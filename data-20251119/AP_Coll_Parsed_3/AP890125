a van dyke selfportrait seems to be looking 
down his nose at his unlikely surroundings in a littleknown museum 
tucked away in an old house in this rural south louisiana town not 
too far from grazing cows 
a lot of people come in here with a puzzled expression 
said delores spears director of the zigler museum they want to 
know how all of this got to the middle of nowhere 
the van dyke is in good company just down the wall from a 
rembrandt a whistler a sir joshua reynolds and dozens of other 
works by noted artists dating from the 17th century 
just off interstate 10 40 miles from the southeast texas border 
jennings was the home of fred and ruth zigler who had a fortune and 
no heirs they decided to leave a legacy to the area they loved 
ziglers father had moved from the landlocked dakotas at the turn 
of the century and made millions in shipbuilding real estate oil 
and gas and other interests 
the zigler legacy included a museum foundation and a separate 
foundation which grants full college scholarships each year to 
deserving students one from each high school in the area that 
foundation also provides grants to charitable organizations 
including the museum foundation which has a smaller endowment 
since 1960 when fred zigler died the education foundation has 
granted 1 million in scholarships grants to other organizations 
total 35 million 
thats really an economic boost when you take into account what 
has happened in this parish said richard boisture a member of 
the museum foundation the parish once fat and sassy from oil gas 
and shipbuilding fell on hard times in 1980 with the decline of the 
oil patch unemployment is over 13 percent 
the money helps the kids the community and all i can say is 
thank god for the ziglers said boisture 
before she died in 1974 mrs zigler left the old family home to 
the museum foundation two wings have been added to the twostory 
columned mansion to handle the growing collection which now totals 
more than 150 pieces of art 
thanks to the education foundation the museum was able to 
purchase the van dyke in 1984 for about 125000 
we took it out of the crate and it was almost an emotional 
thing said boisture his hair looks like you could touch it and 
feel the softness he looks like hes almost glancing back with 
disdain at someone 
one of the best buys said spears was morning by helen 
turner which cost relatively little years ago but its in six 
figures now weve loaned it to a new york museum 
spears says her favorites are a shoreline canvass by george 
inness and the little mother painted by charles sprague pearce 
in the 1880s 
a lot of school kids tour through here and if just one in each 
group leaves with an interest in what hes seen this museum is a 
success said boisture middle of nowhere or not

in anton r valukas four years as us attorney 
he has presided over an office that has indicted more than 270 
public officials government employees and others on corruption 
charges 
valukas 45 is again in the spotlight for his role in the recent 
marketfraud investigation of the leading us commodities exchanges 
observers say no one in chicago is better prepared to tackle it 
us law enforcement officials are investigating allegations that 
as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers 
out of millions of dollars on the chicago mercantile exchange and 
the chicago board of trade no indictments have been announced and 
valukas has declined comment 
valukas has a vast knowledge of commodities trading but it 
wasnt built solely as a prosecutor 
he learned much by defending traders 
as a private attorney at the chicago law firm jenner amp block 
valukas represented brokers in criminal cases and in disciplinary 
proceedings before the commodity futures trading commission the 
agency that oversees futures trading 
eugene wedoff a us bankruptcy judge who worked with valukas at 
jenner amp block recalled at least one instance in which valukas 
successfully defended a board of trade broker accused of breaking 
commodities laws 
by the time he left jenner amp block he probably knew a much 
about commodities law as anyone in the city wedoff said 
chicago attorney john troelstrup agreed tuesday when he came 
to the us attorneys office valukas was probably one of the most 
knowledgeable and experienced in terms of commodities 
experience said troelstrup who is representing at least one of 
those subpoenaed in the commodities probe 
when valukas a chicago native whose father was a judge was 
named us attorney for the northern district of illinois in may 
1985 he pledged to make prosecuting whitecollar corruption a 
priority 
corruption is an epidemicproportion problem in chicago 
valukas said it would be hard for me to imagine a city in which 
there was more corruption 
he joined the us attorneys office as an assistant prosecutor 
in 1970 he joined jenner amp block in 1977 but returned to public 
service in 1981 when gov james r thompson appointed him to head 
the metropolitan fair and exposition authority 
valukas served as an attorney on thompsons reelection campaign 
in 1982 and in 1985 the governor lobbied heavily to make him us 
attorney 
tactics used in the commodities probe wired fbi agents 
posing as traders in the exchanges trading pits secretly taping 
alleged wrongdoing are familiar to valukas 
his office has orchestrated elaborate sting operations with 
undercover agents paying off crooked police officers judges and 
politicians and taping it all on hidden recorders 
when he succeeded us attorney dan webb in 1985 valukas took 
over one of the most publicized investigations operation greylord 
a probe of corruption in the cook county court system 
a key player in the probe was a southern illinois judge brought 
to chicago the judge hid a tape recorder in his cowboy boot and a 
microphone in his judicial robes to document wrongdoing 
so far 90 judges lawyers and other court employees have been 
indicted in the greylord probe and 70 have been convicted several 
cases are pending 
operation incubator developed by valukas and his assistants 
uncovered influencepeddling at chicagos city hall the key figure 
was fbi mole michael raymond whom the fbi taped making payoffs 
to politicians in chicago and new york several former officials 
charged in the probe are scheduled to go on trial in may 
valukas is rumored to be planning to leave the us attorneys 
office in the next few months the chicago tribune reported monday 
that hes eyeing a partners position at a major chicago law firm 
but valukas has not publicly disclosed his plans

in a rundown west texas bar called the sundowner 
recreational club dreams go down as easy as a cold bottle of pearl 
beer and are just as intoxicating 
they are the stuff of life for many of the characters in the 
night hank williams died larry kings pungent yet poignant tale 
of lost loves missed opportunities unfulfilled expectations and 
fatal mistakes 
its not a perfect play but until it collapses into violent 
melodrama in act 2 the night hank williams died has enough 
lowkey charm and homespun humor to soften the hardest of hearts 
maybe thats because king author of the best little whorehouse 
in texas has a jaundiced affection for the folks he has put on 
stage its love but love tempered by the knowledge that most of 
these people will never amount to very much 
despite its title the play has nothing to do with the death of 
countrywestern star hank williams although it is set in 1952 and 
williams music wails from the bars jukebox 
its main concern is thurmond stottle a onetime high school 
football hero in the tiny town of stanley texas thurmonds 
gridiron glories were nearly a decade ago now hes 27 and working 
on a beer gut while he pumps gas at the local service station 
between customers thurmond aspires to be another hank williams 
or at least a songwriter wholl sell his compositions which have 
titles like little bitty bit of love to nashville stars like 
eddy arnold 
nothin wrong with dreams providin you act on em counsels 
gus the benevolent barkeep who extends thurmonds beer tab as he 
tries to rein in the boys fantasies 
thurmond is galvanized by the arrival of nellie bess powers his 
high school sweetheart her marriage to an upandcoming 
chiropractor has soured and she has come home to think about it 
her return rekindles thurmonds adoration as well as his ambition to 
make something of himself 
king takes his time churning up the plot but the wait has its 
diversions his dialogue is peppered with downhome conversation 
salty sly and occasionally very funny giveandtake that is one of 
the evenings main pleasures 
most of these lines are the property of actor barton heyman who 
plays gus the bulky and blustery bartender its the plays most 
fully realized role by the time the curtain falls heyman has 
revealed the frayed and forlorn humanity behind his coarse texas 
humor 
matt mulhern has a harder time playing thurmond who when you get 
down to it isnt a very likable fellow mulhern also has a sweet 
pleasing singing voice something at odds with his doltish 
onetrack personality that smacks of loser from the very beginning 
at first betsy aidem comes on as too much of a dustcaked scarlett 
ohara but the caricature fades when she realizes the consequences 
of her new fling with thurmond 
strains show in the play when events turn melodramatic 
particularly with the appearance of nellie bess fanatically devout 
mother who still is keepin in real close touch with jesus 
also painted in more black than white is the local sheriff but 
actor steve rankin does an expert job shading in the character with 
a portrayal thats part good ol boy and part smarmy eddie haskell 
of televisions leave it to beaver 
the direction by christopher ashley meanders through the plays 
talkier moments and then seems frantic during its actionpacked 
finale still ashley allows time for the audience to savor the 
people who inhabit designer edward t gianfrancescos wonderfully 
ramshackled bar complete with deer head above the door 
the night hank williams died is a bittersweet song to lives 
and loves lost spiced with enough laughs to soften the hurt 
definitely worth a look

here is a transcript of executed killer ted 
bundys interview with religious broadcaster dr james dobson of 
pomona calif the interview taped monday afternoon was released 
to the news media tuesday afternoon after bundy was put to death in 
floridas electric chair 
dobson you are scheduled to be executed tomorrow morning at 7 
oclock if you dont receive another stay what is going through 
your mind what thoughts have you had these last few days 
bundy i wont kid you to say that its something i feel i have 
control of or something i have come to terms with because i 
havent its a momenttomoment thing sometimes i feel very 
tranquil and other times i dont feel tranquil at all 
whats going through my mind right now is to use the minutes and 
hours i have left as fruitfully as possible and see what happens it 
helps to live in the moment in the essence that we use it 
productively right now i am feeling calm and in large part because 
i am here with you 
dobson for the record you are guilty of killing many women and 
girls is that correct 
bundy yes thats correct 
dobson ted how did it happen take me back what are the 
antecedents of the behavior that weve seen so much grief so much 
sorrow so much pain for so many people where did it start how did 
this moment come about 
bundy thats the question of the hour and one that not only 
people much more intelligent than i will be working on for years but 
one that ive been working on for years and trying to understand is 
there enough time to explain it all i dont know i think i 
understand it though what happened to me to the extent that i can 
see how certain feelings and ideas have developed in me to the point 
that i began act to out certain very violent and very destructive 
feelings

dobson lets go back then to those roots first of all as i 
understand it you were raised in what you considered to have been a 
healthy home you were not physically abused you were not sexually 
abused you were not emotionally abused 
bundy no no and thats part of the tragedy of this whole 
situation because i grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated 
and loving parents as one of five brothers and sisters a home 
where we as children were the focus of my parents lives where we 
regularly attended church two christian parents who did not drink 
they did not smoke there was no gambling no physical abuse not 
fighting in the home 
im not saying this was leave it to beaver i dont know that 
such a home exists but it was a fine solid christian home and 
nobody i hope no one will try to take the easy way and try to blame 
or otherwise accuse my family of contributing to this because i 
know and i am trying to tell you as honestly as i know how what 
happened 
this is the message i want to get across that as a young boy 
and i mean a boy of 12 or 13 certainly that i encountered outside 
the home again in the local grocery store in a local drug store 
the softcore pornography that people called soft core as i think 
as i explained to you last night dr dobson in an anecdote as young 
boys do we explored the back roads and sideways and byways of our 
neighborhood and often times people would dump the garbage and 
whatever they were putting out of their house and from time to time 
we would come across pornographic books of a harder nature than of 
a more graphic explicit nature than we would encounter at the local 
grocery store and this also inclouded such things as detective 
magazines 
dobson those that involved violence 
bundy yes yes and this is something i think i want to 
emphasize is that the mostdamaging kinds of pornography and again 
im talking from personal experience are those that involve 
violence and sexual violence because the wedding of those two 
forces is as i know only too well brings out the hatred that is 
just just too terrible to describe 
dobson now walk me through that what was going on in your mind 
at that time 
bundy before we go any further i think its important to me 
that people believe what i am saying i tell you that i am not 
blaming pornography i am not saying that it caused me to go out and 
do certain things and i take full responsibility for whatever i 
have done and all the things i have done thats not the question 
here 
the question and the issue is how this kind of literature 
contributed and helped mold and shape the kinds of violent behavior 
 
dobson it fueled your fantasies didnt it 
bundy in the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process 
then at a certain time it is instrumental i would say 
crystalizing making into something which is almost like a separate 
entity inside at that point i was at the verge of acting out in 
this kind

dobson now i really want to understand that you had gone about 
as far as you could in your own fantasy life with printed material 
or printed and film and then there was the urge to take that 
little step or big step over to a physical event 
bundy and it happened in stages gradually it didnt 
necessarily not to me at least happen overnight my experience 
with pornography generally but with pornography that deals on a 
violent level with sexuality is once you become addicted to it and 
i look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction 
i would keep looking for more potent more explicit more graphic 
kinds of material 
like an addiction you keep craving something that is harder 
harder something which which gives you a greater sense of 
excitement until you reach a point where the pornography only goes 
so far you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder 
if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just 
reading it or looking at it 
dobson how long did you stay at that point before you actually 
assaulted someone 
bundy well yeah that is a very delicate point by the way in 
my own development were talking about something about having 
reached the point or gray area that that surrounded that point over 
a course of years 
i would say a couple of years what i was dealing with there was 
very strong inhibitions against criminal behavior or violent 
behavior that had been conditioned into me bred into me in my 
environment in my neighborhood in my church in my school things 
that said no this is wrong even to think of it is wrong but 
certainly to do it is wrong im on that edge i would say the last 
vestiges of restraint the barriers to actually doing something are 
being tested constantly assailed through the kind of fantasy life 
that was fueled largely by pornography 
dobson do you remember what pushed you over that edge do you 
remember the decision to go for it do you remember you decided to 
throw caution to the wind 
bundy when you say pushed i know what youre saying i dont 
want to infer again that i was some helpless kind of victim in that 
were talking about an influence that is an influence of violent 
types of media violent types of pornography which had an 
indispensible in the chain of events that led to the behavior 
the assaults the murders 
its a very difficult thing to describe the sensation of 
reaching that point where i knew that that something had say 
snapped that i knew that i couldnt control anymore that the 
barriers i had learned as a child had been instilled in me 
were not enough to hold me back in respect to seeking out and 
harming somebody 
dobson would it be accurate to call that a frenzy a sexual 
frenzy 
bundy yes thats one way to describe it a compulsion a 
building up of this destructive energy another factor here i 
havent mentioned is the use of alcohol what alcohol did in 
conjuction with exposure to pornography is alcohol reduced my 
inhibitions at the same time the fantasy life that was fueld by 
pornography eroded them further 
dobson in the early days you were nearly always about half 
drunk when you did these things is that right 
bundy yes 
dobson was that always true 
bundy i would say that that was generally the case 
dobson all right if i can understand it there is this battle 
going on within there are the conventions that you have been 
taught theres the right and wrong that you learned as a child and 
then there is this unbridled passion fueled by your plunge into 
hardcore violent pornography and those things are at war with each 
other and then with the alchol diminishing the inhibitions you let 
go 
bundy yes and its accurate it just occurred to me that some 
people will say that well ive seen that stuff and it doesnt do 
anything to me and i can understand that virtually everyone can 
be exposed to pornography and while they are aroused to one degree 
or another they do not go out and do anything wrong 
dobson addictions are like that they affect some people more 
than they affect others but there is a percentage of people 
affected by hardcore pornography in a very violent way and you are 
obviously one of them

bundy that was a major component and i dont know why i was 
vulnerable to it all i know is that it had an impact on me that was 
just so central to the development of the violent behavior that i 
had reached 
dobson ted after you committed your first murder what was the 
emotional effect on you what happened in the days after that 
bundy long pause please understand that even all these years 
later it is very difficult to talk about and reliving through 
talking about it is difficult to say the least but i want you to 
understand what happened it was like coming out of some kind of 
horrible trance or dream i can only liken it to after i dont want 
to overdramatize it but to having been possessed by something so 
awful and so alien then the next morning wake up from it remember 
what happened and realize that basically i mean in the eyes of the 
law and certainly in the eyes of god you were responsible to wake 
up in the morning and realize what i had done and with a clear mind 
and all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact at that 
moment absolutely horrified that i was capable of doing something 
 
dobson you really hadnt known that before 
bundy there is just absolutely no way to describe first the 
brutal urge to do that kind of thing and then what happens is once 
it has been more or less satisfied and recedes you might say or 
spent that energy level recedes and basically i became myself again 
i want people to understand this too and im not saying this 
gratuitously because its important that you understand this but 
basically i was a normal person i wasnt some guy hanging out at 
bars or a bum i wasnt a pevert in the sense that people look at 
somebody and say i know there is something wrong with him you can 
just tell i was essentially a normal person i had good friends i 
led a normal life except for this one small but very potent and 
very destructive segment of it that i kept vey secret and close to 
myself and didnt let anyone know about and part of the shock and 
horror to my dear friends and family years ago when i was first 
arrested was there was no clue they looked at me and they looked at 
the allamerican boy i wasnt perfect but i was ok i was the 
basic humanity and the basic spirit that god gave me was intact but 
unfortunately became overwhelmed at times 
and people need to recognize its not some kind of those of 
us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the 
media in particular pornographic violence are not some kind of 
inherent monsters we are your sons and we are your husbands and we 
grew up in regular families and pornography can reach out and 
snatch a kid out of any house today it snatched me out of my home 
20 30 years ago and as dedicated as my parents were and they were 
diligent in protecting their children and as good a christian home 
as we had and we had a wonderful christian home there is no 
protection against the kind of influences that are loose in society 
that tolerates

dobson you feel this really deeply dont you ted outside these 
walls right now there are several hundred reporters who wanted to 
talk to you and you asked me to come here from california because 
you had something to say this hour that we have together is not 
just an interview with a man who is scheduled to die tomorrow 
morning i am here and you are here because of this message that you 
are talking about here you really feel that hardcore pornography 
and the doorway to it softcore pornography is doing untold damage 
to other people and causing other women to be abused and killed the 
way you did others 
bundy listen im no social scientist and i havent done a 
survey i mean i dont pretend that i know what john q citizen 
knows about this but i have lived in prison for a long time now 
and ive met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like 
me and without exception every one of them was deeply involved in 
pornography without question without exception deeply influenced 
and consumed by an addiction theres no question about it the 
fbis own study on serial homicide shows that the mostcommon 
interest among serial killers is pornography 
dobson thats true ted what would your life have been like 
without that influence you can only speculate 
bundy tears far better not just for me and excuse me for 
being so selfcentered here but it would have been a lot better for 
me and lots of other people and lots of other innocent people 
victims and families it would have been a lot better theres no 
question there would have been a fuller life certainly a life that 
would not have involved i am absolutely certain a life that would 
not have involved this kind of violence 
dobson im sure ted if i were able to ask the questions that 
are being asked out there one of the most important as you come 
down to your final hours are you thinking about those victims out 
there and their families who are so wounded and years later their 
lives have not returned to normal and will not return to normal 
they will never return to normal are you carrying that load that 
weight is there remorse there 
bundy again people will accuse me of being selfserving but i 
am just telling you how i feel through gods help i have been able 
to come to the point where i much too late but better late than 
never feel the hurt and the pain that i am responsible for yes 
absolutely in the past few days myself and a number of 
investigators have been talking about a number of unsolved cases 
murders that i was involved in 
its hard to talk about all these years later because it revives 
in me all those terrible feelings and thoughts that i have 
steadfastly and diligently dealt with and i think successfully and 
yet its reopened that and i felt the pain and i felt the horror and 
i can only hope that those who i have caused so much grief even if 
they dont believe my expression of sorrow will believe what i am 
saying now that there is loose in the towns and their communities 
people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day 
in day out by violence in the media in various forms particularly 
sexual violence and what scares me and its coming to the present 
now because what i am talking about happened 30 20 30 years ago in 
my formative state and what scares me dr dobson when i see 
whats on cable tv some of the movies and some of the violence in 
the movies that comes into homes today the stuff that they wouldnt 
show in xrated adult theaters 30 years ago 
dobson the slasher movies is what youre talking about 
bundy that stuff is im telling you from personal experience 
is the most graphic violence on screen particularly as it gets into 
the home to children who are unattended or unaware that they may be 
a ted bundy who has that vulnerability that predisposition to be 
influenced by that kind of behavior 
there are kids out there switching the tv dial around and come 
upon these movies late at night or i dont know when they are on 
but theyre on and any kid can watch them its scary when i think 
what would have happened to me if i had seen them and its scary 
enough i just ran into stuff outside the home 
but to know that children are watching that kind of thing today 
or can pick up their phone and dial away for it or send away for it

dobson can you help me understand this desensitization process 
that took place what was going on in your mind 
bundy about the desensitization i would describe it in specific 
terms is that each time id harm someone each time i would kill 
someone there would be an enormous amount especially at first an 
enormous amount of horror guilt remorse afterward but then the 
impulse to do it again would come back even stronger now believe 
me i didnt the unique thing about how this worked dr dobson 
is i still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and 
remorse about other things 
dobson but you had this compartmentalized 
bundy this comparmentalized very well focused very sharply 
focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and 
everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared does 
that make sense 
dobson yeah it does one of the final murders that you 
committed of course was apparently little kimberly leach 12 years 
of age i think the public outcry was greater there because an 
innocent child was taken from a playground what did you feel after 
that was there normal emotions three days later where were you 
ted 
bundy i cant really talk about that 
dobson thats too painful 
bundy i would like to be able to convey what that experience is 
like but i cant be able to talk about it 
dobson ok 
bundy i cant begin to understand i can try but im aware that 
i cant begin to understand the pain the parents of these children 
inaudible feel and i cant restore really much to them if 
anything and i wont pretend to and i dont even expect them to 
forgive me and i am not asking for it that kind of forgiveness is 
of god if they have it they have it if they dont maybe theyll 
find it someday 
dobson do you deserve the punishment the state is inflicted upon 
you 
bundy thats a very good question and ill answer it very 
honestly i dont want to die im not going to kid you i kid you 
not i deserve certainly the most extreme punihsment society has 
and i think society deserves to be protected from me and from others 
like me thats for sure i think what i hope will come of our 
discussion is i think society deserves to be protected from itself 
because as weve been talking there are forces loose in this 
country particularly again this kind of violent pornography where 
on the one hand wellmeaning decent people will condemn the behavior 
of a ted bundy while theyre walking past a magazine rack full of 
the very kinds of things that send kids down the road to be a ted 
bundy 
were talking here not just about more what im talking about is 
going beyond retribution which is what people want with me going 
beyond retribution and punishment because there is no way in the 
world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children 
to their parents and correct and soothe the pain but ill tell you 
there are lots of other kids playing in streets around the country 
today who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the 
next day and the next month because other young people are reading 
the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are 
available when the media took over 
dobson ted as you would imagine there is tremendous cynicism 
about you on the outside and i suppose for good reason im not sure 
there is anything that you could say that people would believe some 
people would believe 
bundy yeah 
dobson and yet you told me last night and i have heard this 
through our mutual friend state attorney john tanner that you 
have accepted the forgiveness of jesus christ and are a follower 
and believer in him do you draw strength from that in these final 
hours 
bundy i do i cant say that being in the valley of shadow 
of death is something that ive become all accustomed to and that i 
am strong and there is nothing bothering me listen it is no fun 
it gets kind of lonely and yet i have to remind myself that every 
one of us will go through this some day in one or another and 
countless millions who have walked this earth before us have so 
this is just an experience which we all share and here i am

greeces new commissioner in the european 
economic community is vasso papandreou a former socialist radical 
who once wanted greece out of the organization 
she and christiane shrivener 63 of france are the first women 
to serve on the 17member eec commission which is made up of senior 
executives and now is charged with preparing for the removal of all 
remaining trade barriers within the 12nation community by the end 
of 1992 
the 44yearold ms papandreou a close friend of but not related 
to greeces socialist premier andreas papandreou was appointed by 
jacques delors the commissions president as with all other 
commissioners she is expected to act independently of her country in 
shaping eec policy she has been assigned the communitys taxation 
and customs union portfolio 
the commission recognizes that social affairs have been left 
behind she said in an interview there is a lot of work to be 
done and success depends both on commission policy and my activity 
a farmerss daughter from southern greece ms papandreou studied 
economics at athens higher school of commercial and economic studies 
and then earned a phd at reading university in england 
she belonged to a generation of young leftists who bitterly 
opposed the 196774 military dictatorship in greece and who were 
inspired by andreas papandreous radical socialist policies 
including pledges to take greece out of the eec and the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
but after leading his panhellenic socialist movement pasok to 
power in 1981 papandreou decided it would be too costly to take 
greece out of the eec 
as one of the trade blocs poorer members greece receives more 
than 15 billion a year in benefits premier papandreou and the 
government are now enthusiastically proeuropean 
asked how she reconciles her radical and marxist past with her 
new job the tall darkhaired ms papandreou said its not me 
thats changed but pasok 
as deputy industry minister while greece held the eec presidency 
during the second half of 1988 ms papandreou chaired meetings on 
streamlining industrial legislation in the community 
in the maledominated world of greek politics ms papandreou and 
culture minister melina mercouri the former actress who starred in 
never on sunday have proved the only female highfliers in the 
socialist government 
in her first government post as director of the organization for 
small and mediumsize businesses for two years from 1981 ms 
papandreou often was assailed by conservative businessmen who 
accused her of trying to impose marxist policies 
but her twoyear stint as deputy commerce minister after winning 
a parliament seat in 1985 impressed even those critics 
ms papandreous portfolio on the eec commission will be a 
sensitive one 
socialist eec membergovernments currently in the majority will 
be seeking to expand labor laws and increase social security 
payments 
but the conservative governments are likely to oppose more social 
welfare legislation that might further complicate the 1992 goal of 
moving services goods and money freely around the community 
ms papandreou says that during her years in government she has 
learned the art of compromise crucial in building community policy 
one always has to compromise she said but im taking a 
positive view and this will be a challenge and a great experience 
she is very intelligent a very good diplomat and knows how to 
maneuver said christos papoutsis a socialist member of the 
european parliament who has known ms papandreou for 15 years

charges that west german companies 
helped libya build what may be a poison gas plant recall horrors 
from two world wars and images of what a politician called the 
evil selfdeceiving german 
germany shocked the world in world war i by wiping out 5000 
allied soldiers april 22 1915 with chlorine gas introducing the 
era of chemical warfare the nazis later use zyklon b gas to kill 
millions of prisoners most of them jews at the auschwitz death 
camp 
in addition to lessons of the past the current debate dwells on 
moral standards in a nation that has developed an arms export 
industry in the last 15 years that ranks fifth in the world 
german profits have grown much more quickly than ethical 
standards said the rev friedhelm hengsbach a social sciences 
professor at st georgen theological university in frankfurt 
the germans are very smart in the sense of economic realities 
but theyre not that shrewd when it comes to ethical responsibility 
and political realities the 51yearold jesuit priest said in an 
interview 
norbert gansel a member of parliament for the opposition social 
democrats put the problem succinctly now our history has caught 
up with us again the evil selfdeceiving german is back 
in its current issue the leftleaning magazine der spiegel said 
the attitude of west german industry is export at all costs to 
guarantee prosperity at home and tens of thousands of people pay 
for the exporters prosperity with their lives 
first comes the food and then morals it said referring to 
a line by the german author bertolt brecht not even that many 
deals are made completely without morals 
government statistics say west german companies legally sell 
about 166 billion worth of guns submarines munitions and other 
arms overseas each year that puts the country in fifth place behind 
the united states soviet union france and britain 
several state and local investigations are under way to determan 
the amount of arms and armsrelated goods sent abroad illegally 
included are inquiries into reports of west german involvement in 
iraqi poison gas production in addition to allegations that west 
german companies helped build the plant at rabta south of tripoli 
that libya says makes medicines and the united states says is for 
producing chemical weapons 
iraq acknowledged using poison gas during its war with iran in 
which a ceasefire was reached in august and has been accused of 
using it on minority kurds 
reports arise frequently of west german companies evading export 
restrictions as gansel reminded a noisy parliamentary debate on the 
libyan matter last week 
the string of armsexport scandals is long he declared 
including sales of sensitive nuclear technology to pakistan india 
and south africa 
gansel 48 said zyklon b gas killed countless defenseless 
jews and reminded fellow legislators the image of the evil 
selfdeceiving german had become a theme for both newspaper 
cartoons and editorials 
many newspaper stories magazine articles and tv programs about 
the chemical plant scandal point out the german history of poison 
gas dating to world war i 
der spiegel called poison gas part of the horrifying tradition 
of the german chemical industry and said after describing the 
1915 attack at flanders 
when the fog lifted 5000 allied soldiers were dead and 10000 
seriously injured the german army had launched chemical warfare 
in munich the suedeutsche zeitung reminded readers in an 
editorial jan 13 not everyone may like the germans no one has 
forgotten their past whoever has as much power as the federal 
republic must also bear responsibility 
joachim perels a political science teacher at hanover 
university said in an interview it is a question of currentday 
morality and the nazi past you just cant lose sight of that second 
point it would be better if west germany didnt supply libya with 
any materials that could be used for war 
friedrich justus perels the professors father was executed by 
the nazis along with thousands of others for alleged involvement in 
the unsuccessful attempt to kill adolf hitler in 1944 
michel friedman spokesman for frankfurts jewish community said 
of the libyan scandal german companies should be more conscious 
of whats taking place in libya an enemy of israel its part 
of the special responsibility of the germans and a special 
responsibility isnt just something to pray about on sundays 
andreas hillgruber a conservative historian on the university of 
cologne faculty said attempts to link the scandal with the nazi era 
are an example of the past that wont go away 
you can view everything that the germans do today against that 
background hillgruber said 
hillgruber and other conservative historians have tried to 
compare the extermination of 6 million jews with other atrocities to 
show the nazi genocide does not stand alone in history

a sovietamerican dog sledding team announced 
plans tuesday to symbolically break the ice between siberian and 
alaskan eskimos during a 1200mile goodwill trek that will include 
the first sanctioned crossing of the bering strait since 1948 
ten men and two women comprising six soviets and six americans 
plan to depart march 1 from anadyr siberia on a twomonth journey 
visiting 30 native settlements along an old arctic trade route 
the expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common 
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the bering region 
expedition coleader paul schurke 33 of minneapolis said at a 
news conference at the russian tea room in manhattan 
some of the team members have relatives on the other side 
schurke said so it could be a very emotional experience 
because visitors are rare in villages so close to the top of the 
world he predicted that the expedition would be met with 
spontaneous celebrations and jamborees and that schools would be 
let out so that the children could ski along with the team for a 
while 
a veteran of arctic travel who made an unassisted trek to the 
north pole in 1986 schurke said the journey was an opportunity to 
combine my interest in travel in the north with playing a part in 
the process of improving sovietamerican relations 
speaking through an interpreter soviet coleader dmitry shparo 
47 of moscow praised du pont co the major american corporate 
sponsor of the bering bridge expedition shparo also put in a plug 
for the main soviet sponsors pravdas youth newspaper the tourist 
bureau known as sputnik and novosti a news agency 
although he is a mathematics professor at moscows institute of 
steel and alloys shparo is best known as a writer and adventurer 
in 1979 he won the soviet unions highest honor the order of 
lenin for successfully leading a ski expedition to the north pole 
last year he was a member of a sovietcanadian trek across the 
polar ice cap from the ussr to canada 
sen frank murkowski ralaska who also attended the news 
conference called the bering bridge expedition another step 
toward melting the ice curtain 
murkowski noted that the us government is working on a new 
treaty with the soviets that would permit american eskimos to visit 
and trade with their counterparts in siberia without visas 
in 1938 the two countries signed an agreement that regularized 
travel in the bering region but that agreement was abrogated in 
1948 during the iciest days of the cold war 
in the spirit of adventure diplomacy the team hopes a new 
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the ussoviet border 
around april 1

the hooded executioner who electrocuted ted 
bundy was a civilian who received 150 a chauffeured escort to and 
from the prison and a guarantee of anonymity 
the executioner was chosen from a list the state has been using 
since it advertised for executioners in 1976 when the death penalty 
was reinstated 
if we didnt take precautions there are enough crackpots 
inside and outside this prison thatd be threatening them said 
thomas burton superintendent of florida state prison they 
threaten me every day 
only burton knows whos on the list he is also the only person 
who handles the arrangements 
jon peck a spokesman for gov bob martinez said he didnt know 
the identity of bundys executioner but added it could have been a 
woman which was speculated by some witnesses to bundys execution 
bundy who confessed to killing more than 20 women was put to 
death in the electric chair tuesday for raping and murdering a 
12yearold girl 
while security is paramount for the executioners job skill is 
incidental 
all the executioner does is start the cycle by turning a switch 
or pressing a button i wont say which and the thing is 
programmed from there burton said 
the executioner stands in a booth behind and to the right of the 
electric chair watching through a 9inchby4foot opening in the 
wall as the condemned prisoner is buckled into the chair a light on 
a panel of dials before the executioner indicates that the current 
is sufficient 
when burton gives the signal the executioner activates the 
machine which pumps up to 3000 volts and 20 amps of electricity 
through the chair and into the body

about 47 pounds of cocaine was discovered tuesday on 
an eastern airlines jet that had stopped at miami international 
airport en route from colombia to new york officials said 
no arrests were made by late tuesday and us customs officials 
are considering whether fines will be levied against the financially 
troubled carrier fined 1 million last fall after cocaine was 
discovered on two flights within a twoweek span said customs 
spokesman cliff stallings 
before the cocaine was found the plane had been cleared by 
customs inspectors following a routine search said stallings 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said a flight attendant found 
a plastic packet containing cocaine inside one of the exit doors 
leading to an extensive search of the l1011 aircraft that arrived 
from cali columbia at about 4 pm est 
the cocaine was between the panels of the door and above the 
lavatories of flight 50 she said 
but stallings said several packets of cocaine were discovered by 
a member of the cleaning crew in the rest rooms he said vibrations 
apparently dislodged the cocaine which was concealed behind ceiling 
panels above the rest rooms 
stallings said the manner the cocaine was hidden suggests it was 
placed by someone with extensive access to and knowledge of the 
plane 
the search was completed about 930 pm est he said 
all passengers were accommodated on other flights ms ceremsak 
said 
since sept 13 customs agents have seized five loads of cocaine 
on eastern flights from colombia including 68 pounds of cocaine 
hidden in a box of ground coffee in november and 56 pounds of 
cocaine found in a mail bag in october 
eastern says it spends more than 3 million a year fighting drug 
trafficking 
avianca colombias national airline banned cargo from its 
flights last june after paying 8 million in federal fines linked to

george bush stops at red lights sometimes 
in a city used to seeing dignitarybearing motorcades screeching 
through traffic lights sirens wailing at all times of day and 
night the sight is more than a little unusual 
there was bushs 15car motorcade waiting for a traffic light to 
change right along with other backedup traffic on a busy downtown 
washington street no sirens no flashing policecar lights 
the president was on his way to a local army base fort mcnair 
for a tuesday afternoon jog and didnt want to disrupt traffic any 
more than was necessary 
its not as though anyone would write him a traffic ticket 
he was simply following a pattern hed established in his eight 
years as vice president said aide bruce zanca mr bushs 
preference as vice president was to stop at lights keep things as 
normal as possible zanca said 
of course as vice president bush didnt require 15 cars to go 
jogging 
he just stepped outside his door and ran the vice presidents 
residence is on the sprawling grounds of the us naval observatory 
and theres lots of space for jogging and other outdoor activities 
there isnt as much room at the white house forcing the new 
president to seek out new jogging trails 
bush once suggested that he might return to the vice presidential 
grounds from time to time to do his jogging joking that he had 
already sought and obtained permission from the man who would be 
living there next vice president dan quayle 
bush 64 jogs at a relatively sedate pace about a mile every 10 
minutes he usually runs for 20 minutes two or three times a week 
the chief executives decision to observe traffic signals 
apparently only applies to personal trips not when hes going 
somewhere on official business 
then its the regular presidential motorcade which gets an 
elaborate police escort and travels on streets where traffic has 
already been cleared such motorcades completely ignore traffic 
signals along the way

passion deepfried pork rinds 
when bush held his first cabinet meeting on monday gone was the 
crystal jar of jellybeans that predecessor ronald reagan used to 
have sitting before him 
by tuesday there was a large jar again only this one was 
filled with pork rinds 
it was a gift of house speaker jim wright dtexas one of a 
group of house and senate leaders that bush had invited to meet with 
him in the cabinet room to discuss the budget 
wright also presented fellow texan bush with a large bottle of 
texas pete hot pepper sauce 
bush is known to love to smother all manner of food with hot 
sauce during his campaign a standard meal for bush aboard air 
force two was tuna fish sandwiches drenched with hot sauce 
we want to give a very warm welcome to the president said 
wright 
bush picked up the bottle of hot sauce and closely examined the 
label 
how come texas hot sauce is made in winstonsalem north 
carolina 
wright retorted same way that some texans were born in 
kennebunkport 
the room erupted in laughter even though wrights citation of 
bushs new england origins was off by a few states 
while his family maintains a vacation home in the seaside resort 
town of kennebunkport maine bush was born in milton mass and 
grew up in connecticut 
im just overwhelmed by both the pork rinds and the texas hot 
sauce bush said you talk about cooperation ecumenical spirit

big government in washington may get the most 
publicity but a new census bureau report shows that government is 
big business in the rest of the country as well with more than a 
halfmillion americans holding elective office 
from school board president to the nations president congress 
to county commissioner public officials total 504404 the bureau 
reported tuesday in a study based on its 1987 census of governments 
thats up from 490807 elected officials counted a decade 
earlier the bureau said 
its quite a statement about the extent of democracy 
particularly the grassroots democracy in the country said diana 
cull a census statistician who compiled the figures 
it means the united states now has more officeholders than bank 
tellers the bureau of labor statistics estimated there were 467000 
tellers in 1987 
but while the report found that holding public office is 
widespread it also shows officeholders dont necessarily represent 
a crosssection of the nation 
only 20 percent were women while 2 percent were blacks and 1 
percent were hispanic nationally women make up just over half the 
population while the nation is about 12 percent black and 7 percent 
hispanic 
most of the growth in elected officeholders since 1977 results 
from the growth of special districts around the nation ms cull 
said these include independent water and sewer districts housing 
authorities transit administrations and similar independent bodies 
with elected boards 
special districts accounted for 80509 elected officials on 
29532 governmental bodies in the 1987 study thats up from 72377 
officeholders running 25962 special districts in 1977 
that increase of more than 8000 officials was well ahead of any 
other group although special districts were only fourth in the 
total number of officeholders municipalities towns and school 
districts continue to have larger totals of officials elected to 
public office 
the leading group is municipalities with 137688 officials 
serving 19200 communities in 1987 thats up from 134017 
officeholders in 18862 municipalities in 1977 
townships came in second in both years totaling 120790 
officials in 1987 and 118966 a decade earlier year during that 
period the total number of township governments declined from 16822 
to 16691 
school districts were the nations third largest job source for 
elected officials providing offices for 86772 people in 1987 that 
was down from 1977 however when 87062 people held elected school 
board positions 
that drop occurred in parallel with a decline in the number of 
school districts in the nation slipping from 15174 to 14721 
the nations 3042 counties the same in both studies provided 
somewhat fewer elected offices in 1987 than in 1977 the total fell 
from 62922 to 59932 
the states meanwhile increased their number of elected offices 
they harbored 18171 elected officials in 1987 up from 15294 in 
1977 
the 1977 report did not include figures for federal 
officeholders the new study put that number at 542 a total which 
ms cull said was unchanged 
elected federal officials include 435 members of the house 100 
senators five congressional delegates from territories and the 
district of columbia and of course the president and vice 
president 
the 1987 report looked at the characteristics of local government 
officials for the first time cull said 
it found that women were most likely to be on school boards 
making up 265 percent of elected school officials women 
constituted 231 percent of township officials and 208 percent of 
county officers they were 185 percent of the municipal officials 
and only 115 percent of those serving on special districts 
blacks on the other hand were most often represented on 
municipal governments holding 33 percent of those posts 
blacks made up 26 percent of the county officials and 24 
percent of school district officeholders they were 06 percent of 
the special district officials and 04 percent in town offices 
school districts were the most common spot for hispanics at 18 
percent they held 13 percent of municipal offices and 12 percent 
in special districts hispanics comprised 1 percent of county 
officials and 02 percent of town officers

personal incomes are increasing the least in 
the nations energy states while the coasts are recording the 
biggest gains the government reports 
the commerce department said tuesday the new england region had 
the highest increase in personal incomes of any region an 89 
percent gain in the 12 months ending with september 1988 following 
close behind were the far west states of california nevada oregon 
and washington with a gain of 87 percent 
at the other extreme were the rocky mountain states a region 
heavily dependent on oil and gas exploration where incomes rose 61 
percent on average from the third quarter of 1987 to the third 
quarter of last year 
we are still seeing the effects of weak energy prices said 
commerce department analyst rudolph depass while some states have 
been able to diversify their economies others have not 
nationally nonfarm incomes rose 78 percent in the period 
ending in september virtually identical to the 77 percent rise in 
overall incomes posted for the 12month period ending with the 
second quarter 
new england has led the country in income growth for much of the 
recovery following the 198182 recession as its hightechnology 
industries have benefited from the big defense buildup of the reagan 
years 
however the rate of income growth has slowed in this area in the 
past year reflecting a slowdown in defense spending depass said 
the most recent quarterly reports have shown that income growth 
in americas rust belt has begun to stage a comeback reflecting a 
rebound in us manufacturing as a weaker dollar has made american 
goods competitive once again on overseas markets 
the rebound in manufacturing has helped narrow but not eliminate 
the bicoastal lead in incomes the department said 
critics of economic policies during the reagan years say the 
record peacetime recovery has essentially been a bicoastal 
expansion with both coasts doing well while americas heartland 
suffered 
over the 12 months ending with september 1988 incomes in coastal 
states have grown by 83 percent 6 percent above the national 
average while income in interior regions of the country grew 7 
percent 10 percent below the national average 
earlier in the expansion the difference was much wider with 
coastal growth 10 percent higher than the national average while 
interior regions were growing 17 percent below the national average 
by state nevada had the biggest percentage increase for the 12 
months ending in september a 129 percent gain fueled by big 
increases in construction payrolls hotel and motel construction 
there reflected a boom in tourism 
nevada was followed by a 99 percent gain in nonfarm incomes in 
new hampshire and a 96 percent rise in hawaii also posting large 
increases were massachusetts and florida both at 93 percent 
with inflation rising at an annual rate of 44 percent last year 
the figures showed that these states stayed well ahead of the 
increase in prices 
at the other end of the scale income growth in some states just 
barely kept up with the rise in prices 
wyoming ranked last with a 42 percent rise in nonfarm incomes 
over the period ending with the third quarter followed by alaska 
with a 48 percent increase other states with low income growth 
were colorado 52 percent north dakota 53 percent new mexico 
53 percent and west virginia 58 percent all states where 
depressed energy prices have hurt incomes 
the commerce department focuses on changes in nonfarm income as 
a better indication of a regions prosperity because of the often 
erratic nature of agriculture

hardnosed highway engineers from across 
america watched as workmen in gray laboratory smocks smoothed out a 
freshlaid bed of concrete on the floor of a hotel ballroom 
they may have been witnesses to the dawning of a new age of 
cement 
the product called pyrament cement that lasts as long as the 
pyramids will divide cement history into eras bp and ap 
before pyrament and after pyrament proclaimed james e stewart 
chairman of lone star industries 
its a material as close to stone as anything can be without 
being stone stewart said 
concrete is a mixture of cement powder sand water and gravel 
concrete made of pyrament hardens in four hours some poured at 930 
am tuesday in the ballroom of the omnishoreham hotel was hard as 
a rock at lunchtime 
that means fix a highway in the night and traffic can roll on it 
during the next mornings rush hour by contrast conventional 
concrete takes a week or two to cure 
pyrament costs six to eight cents a pound twice as much as 
ordinary cement but the cost of the cement is an insignificant 
part of the cost of construction said stewart 
lone star which makes a tenth of the 90 million tons of cement 
consumed each year in the united states has been losing business to 
cheap imported cement 
the companys cement and concrete profits fell in half in 1987 
it thinks pyrament whose formula is secret may be the answer to 
its prayers 
the company invited a thousand transportation research 
executives attending a convention to come kick its tires 
they tried to be skeptical 
ive put down an awful lot of test pavement in my 33 years as a 
professor of civil engineering said james m hoover of iowa state 
university who once worked for the pottawattamie county engineering 
department in iowa this shows excellent potential in terms of 
flexural and compressive strengths 
said herman griffin a transportation engineer specializing in 
highway maintenance for the georgia department of transportation 
id like to get some and mix it and put it down in the real world 
and see if it does as good as they say 
not only can highways be repaired overnight lone star said but 
pyraments extra strength will permit thinner concrete beams 
allowing skyscrapers to have more floors in the same height as those 
built with runofthemill concrete 
pyrament will cure in temperatures as low as 28 degrees 
fahrenheit conventional concrete wont harden when the temperature 
falls below 35 so the construction season can be extended deeper 
into the winter 
pyrament can be used to repair emergency facilities in 
earthquakes or airport runways in combat 
potholes may become things of the past rather than patch them 
with asphalt repair crews will be able to remove a potholed panel 
of roadway and replace it overnight 
the company is roadtesting this slogan repair at night and 
drive at dawn

true nofault auto insurance could mean savings 
of hundreds of dollars for families in some states although the 
overall impact on premiums nationwide would be little more than 6 
percent according to a study commissioned by a group backing 
universal nofault 
the new study did not identify which states would see such large 
savings and its sponsors said they were still massaging the 
data to come up with those estimates 
the analysis by edward j heiden a washington consultant for 
the new group new start said consumers in 47 states could be 
expected to save 37 billion in premiums overall under a true 
nofault system 
there are 135 million cars on the road and the study said the 
average auto insurance premium was 434 per car in 1987 
this would imply a national insurance bill of 59 billion if 
there were no uninsured cars and no trucks used as cars were 
counted if that 59 billion is true the 37 billion saving would 
be a little more than 6 percent 
it is reasonable to conclude that some households could see 
declines in their annual insurance bills of as much as several 
hundred dollars if plans similar to those of michigan florida and 
new york were used nationwide the group said 
new start considers those states to have the only true nofault 
systems twelve states and the district of columbia use elements of 
nofault in their insurance law and 11 states have what the group 
calls phony nofault 
under nofault victims file claims against their own companies 
just as they would for medical insurance the companies are supposed 
to pay no matter who is at fault 
with traditional insurance a victim must sue somebody to 
determine who caused the accident and whose insurance must pay 
the new start group was organized by james l brown director of 
the center for consumer affairs at the university of wisconsin and 
the rev robert j mcewen professor of economics at boston college 
brown said no insurance industry funds had been used in forming the 
new organization which he said has gained 20000 members since it 
was born last october 
virginia knauer consumer affairs adviser to presidents nixon 
ford and reagan will be national chair of the group and will 
undertake a coasttocoast tour next month to drum up support for 
converting all states to nofault 
rising premiums in states with traditional insurance have 
prompted political outcries in several states recently california 
voters last fall passed a referendum requiring companies to reduce 
premiums 20 percent 
nationwide auto insurance premiums increased 60 percent from 
1982 to 1987 while the consumer price index was increasing 17 
percent 
critics say this overpays those who arent hurt much and pays too 
little to the badly injured it jams the courts with lawsuits that 
take years to reach verdicts and according to a 1985 transportation 
department study return to victims only half of premiums paid in 
43 percent in states using no nofault elements at all 
the balance of premium income goes to lawyers and to administer 
the system 
in theory lawsuits are banned under nofault michigan new york 
and florida limit litigation to people who have suffered serious 
and permanent injury this restriction greatly reduces the number 
of suits the group said 
the 11 phony nofault states permit suits only by people 
suffering losses greater than a stated threshold which ranges up to 
6000 in hawaii ms knauer said 
nofault has been defeated or watered down because of trial 
lawyers who stand to profit from the traditional system the group 
said 
bill wagner of tampa fla president of the association of 
american trial lawyers said hed be for any system that would 
support any system to ensure fair treatment to injured people 
but under nofault victims rapidly see the economic power of the 
insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights

a government report says there has been little 
relief for parched winter wheat fields in huge areas of the great 
plains the middle of the nations breadbasket 
winter wheat was planted last fall and will be harvested this 
summer normally it provides about threefourths of the us wheat 
supply farmers will sow the remainder this spring 
the joint agricultural weather facility said tuesday that insects 
along with dry weather also continued to damage wheat during the 
week of jan 1622 the facility is operated by the agriculture and 
commerce departments 
winter wheat is watched closely this time of year for signs of 
damage and potential yield losses it will lead off the 1989 harvest 
season 
historically january is the driest month in the plains states 
and winter wheat usually dormant at midwinter has been known to 
improve dramatically as the result of good moisture in february and 
march 
but drought reduced 1988 production and there has been a heavy 
drain on us and world stockpiles and the possibility of further 
losses in 1989 cannot be ignored 
in kansas winter wheat continued to show moisture stress 
the report said greenbug damage was a continuing problem in the 
southwest and southcentral areas of the state 
the dry conditions were causing winter wheat in oklahoma to turn 
yellow and mild temperatures have allowed greenbugs to multiply 
rain helped conditions in parts of texas but dry soils continued 
to hurt winter grains in many areas the report said greenbug 
damage was apparent in many fields too 
snow cover was needed in most of the northern plains the 
report said snow cover was adequate in north dakota and portions 
of south dakota montanas winter wheat was mostly fair to good 
with only light wind damage 
the oregon winter wheat crop was reported in mostly good 
condition and it was said to be in mostly good to fair shape in 
the corn belt but lacked protective snow cover 
small grains in the mississippi delta and southeast were 
mostly good the report said seeding continued in arizona and 
california wet soil slowed seeding in california 
the abovenormal temperatures reduced livestock stress during the 
week in most areas although there were some respiratory problems in 
illinois the report said rain helped improve pastures in florida 
and in central and southern texas 
looking at some other crops the report said 
rain slowed land preparation and fertilizer application in the 
delta tobacco plant bed preparation and seeding continued in the 
southeast in california cotton seedbeds were preirrigated and 
fertilizer 
needed rain benefited floridas citrus areas and most producers 
were able to discontinue irrigation 
floridas vegetable areas also benefited from rain and spring 
crop planting has been moving along winter harvest of vegetables 
also continued during the week with tomatoes peppers cabbage 
celery lettuce and squash among the volume leaders 
rain slowed the texas vegetable harvest and cold weather 
hampered work in california

the soviet union has bought an additional 
635000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices virtually 
wiping out its current purchase authority under an agriculture 
department program 
christopher e goldthwait acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said tuesday the wheat 
was part of 2 million tons authorized dec 23 under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
the wheat was bought under a longterm supply agreement with the 
united states now in its sixth year 
goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in february and march 
counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements the 
soviets have only 35200 tons still available under the program 
with the latest sales the soviets have bought about 165 million 
tons of us wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact the 
agreement expired last sept 30 but was later extended through dec 
31 1990 
the eep arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 635000 tons of 
wheat would be about 233 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 93 million 
besides the wheat for 198889 delivery under the pact the 
soviets have ordered 102 million tons of corn 450000 tons of 
soybeans and 1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of 
grain sorghum only the wheat is subsidized

commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher 
got a warm welcome at his capitol hill debut and received a stern 
admonition to make the government a more aggressive advocate for 
american businesses in the world marketplace 
at mosbachers confirmation hearing tuesday before the senate 
commerce committee several legislators complained that the united 
states which suffered a record trade deficit of 1701 billion in 
1987 doesnt do enough to protect and promote its industries in 
global trade 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii said the nation suffers from a 
bureaucratic reluctance to be aggressive in support of american 
industry 
were losing everything all the technology committee 
chairman ernest hollings dsc told mosbacher what we really 
need is your enthusiasm your toughness and aggressiveness 
dont just flutter around washington and say free trade free 
trade we dont want to start a trade war 
mosbacher a texas oilman and longtime friend of president bush 
pledged vigorous enforcement of laws designed to protect american 
businesses from unfair foreign competition and said that building 
exports will be his top priority in reducing the trade deficit 
while we certainly do and have opened our nation to the goods 
of the world we expect that to be reciprocated he said if it 
is not i dont see that we have any course but to strongly fairly 
objectively totally enforce the laws governing international 
trade 
asked his strategy for addressing the us trade deficit he 
said we must build our exports first 
he called for greater efforts to educate us businesses about 
export opportunities and for reduced red tape in granting export 
licenses for items whose sales would not harm national security or 
strategic interests 
everything that is not in those two categories should be given 
a license as soon as possible he said 
american exports have strengthened as the weaker dollar has made 
us manufacturers products more competitive overseas but analysts 
believe the dollar would have to decline further to spur more export 
gains 
mosbacher one of four texans named to the bush cabinet comes to 
washington without government experience and after making his 
fortune in the oil business his nomination is expected to win easy 
approval from the committee next week 
democratic sen lloyd bentsen a fellow texan told the committee 
that mosbacher was a tough international businessman who would do 
the job that has to be done in making america more competitive

now plaintiffs come in once again they claim that its 
outrageous that lawyers of their stature should be cuffed to 50 
pages 
we urge the court to rule once more that 50 is the limit for 
otherwise their brief will be too long to even skim it

in their farranging quest for new markets 
michigan cherry growers have come up with some unusual products 
take the cherrypecan sausage for example please 
cook it up slow not too fast and youll think you died and 
went to heaven said ray pleva the dishs inventor 
its a mildtasting sausage with a light cherry flavor its 
not sweet its not sour said pleva who runs plevas meats in 
leelanau county the heart of the nations cherry industry 
plevas inventiveness is exactly the sort of thing the newly 
formed cherry marketing institute in lansing is encouraging the 
sausages are among a dozen cherry products the institute will 
introduce in march at an international food exposition in japan 
institute manager dick johnston sees japan as a market ripe for 
the picking assuming the japanese can be enticed by cherryfilled 
pastries cherry sausages or cherry mustard 
the institute has the same problem at home americans consume 225 
million pounds of cherries a year nearly a pound a person but 
johnston said the market has remained stagnant 
cherry entrepreneurs therefore are spending more time in the 
kitchen inventing new ways to use an old fruit 
pleva concocted his cherrypecan sausages last fall when his 
daughter cindy was the national cherry queen he admits he has met 
some skeptics 
you should see some of the looks said pleva but they

the democratic chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee and a conservative republican member are 
drafting companion bills aimed at punishing countries that use 
chemical weapons and the private western companies that help produce 
them 
the bills were announced at a hearing tuesday in which senators 
cited reports that the west german government did nothing to prevent 
german industries from helping middle eastern nations obtain 
chemical warfare capability 
also at the hearing the head of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said the united states is now satisfied west 
germany is responsibly addressing the situation and will act soon to 
tighten export controls 
the arms control chief william f burns also told senators that 
the soviet union is stockpiling biological weapons in violation of a 
1972 agreement banning them worldwide 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said he is readying a bill to require us 
diplomatic and economic sanctions against any nation using chemical 
or biological weapons he said the legislation will ask other 
nations to do likewise 
sen jesse helms rnc said he will sponsor companion 
legislation to impose sanctions against companies of any nationality 
supplying chemical warfare equipment and technology to third world 
nations 
i have every reason to believe that in the end the congress 
and the administration will see the wisdom of both approaches 
helms said 
burns told the hearing that about 20 nations have the capacity to 
produce chemical weapons he said about five or six are known to 
have used or stockpiled them 
responding to questions burns listed iran iraq libya syria 
and north korea as poison gas stockpilers he said iran iraq and 
libya are reported to have used chemical weapons 
burns also said the united states believes the soviet union is 
maintaining stocks of biological weapons in violation of the 1972 
international agreement outlawing the manufacture and possession of 
germ warfare agents 
we believe the soviet union does have a stock of biological 
weapons and obviously they must have some capacity to produce 
them burns said 
helms asked how in that case the soviets can be trusted to 
comply with a new international agreement soon to be negotiated 
banning the manufacture stockpiling and use of poison gas and other 
chemical weapons 
burns replied that the 1972 agreement had no provisions for 
monitoring and verifying compliance while any new pact will have 
verification provisions 
he acknowledged however that verification will be difficult and 
that perfect monitoring probably cannot be achieved 
helms complained that west german companies were helping third 
world countries especially in the middle east obtain chemical 
weapons capability 
he also said a west german company is helping libya obtain the 
ability to refuel warplanes in flight extending their range and 
giving them the ability to strike israel 
the problem is extremely grim helms said with the 
critical assistance of western industrial firms the four most 
radical regimes in the world are acquiring weapons of mass 
destruction 
burns who said he had discussed the situation with officials of 
the west german embassy said the attitude of the bonn government 
has changed significantly 
i think the west german government is on the right track and i 
applaud the activities they are undertaking now burns said

attorney ronald brown has emerged as the 
frontrunner in the race for democratic party chairman despite 
complaints from party conservatives about his association with jesse 
jackson in the 1988 presidential campaign 
brown picked up endorsements from west virginia democrats on 
tuesday the latest in a series of announcements that cemented his 
position as the man to beat in the race to succeed paul g kirk jr 
as chairman of the party 
at the same time an alabama party leader said election of brown 
as chairman would be a victory for the kennedy cuomo dukakis 
ultraliberal element 
john baker alabama democratic party chairman said brown was 
trying play on the liberal conscience by making an issue of the 
fact that he is black and had ties to jackson 
he stands up and he says im the most qualified candidate 
which is a ridiculously presumptuous statement and if i wasnt 
black id win and if i wasnt connected to jesse jackson id win 
said baker 
thats tremendously presumptive and thats a slap at the other 
candidates its ron brown whos creating that trying to play on 
the liberal conscience 
among those who have endorsed brown who was jacksons convention 
manager last year are sen edward m kennedy and new york gov 
mario cuomo party sources said michael dukakis would add his 
backing to brown by weeks end and that democratic national 
committee members from massachusetts would join their governor in 
that endorsement 
also competing for the party leadership are michigan democratic 
party chairman richard wiener and former reps jim jones of oklahoma 
and james stanton of ohio 
wiener and jones met over the weekend and sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said they discussed the possibility of 
combining forces however the sources said they were unable to 
reach agreement on which should drop out and support the other 
democratic national committee members will vote feb 10 to fill 
the chairmanship for a fouryear term but many committee members 
say they hope the race will be settled before the vote 
a lot of us want it to be over before we get to washington 
said suellen albrecht chairman of the wisconsin democratic party 
when brown first began seeking support for the chairmanship his 
role in the jackson campaign was cited by jews prominent in party 
affairs as a reason for opposing him 
however a group of jewish activists including rep sander levin 
of michigan steve grossman of massachusetts a leading fundraiser 
for dukakis ed sanders and steve moses of los angeles and walter 
shorenstein of san francisco endorsed brown and worked to convince 
jewish democrats that it was unfair to link brown to jackson 
a number of us have talked to opinionmakers within the jewish 
community said levin 
in an article written for washington jewish weekly levin wrote 
that ron brown did not subscribe to every position held by jesse 
jackson he has made clear that he would respond to jesse jackson as 
to other democratic leaders with no hesitation to accept his views 
when he is right nor to reject them when he is wrong 
grossman raised money for brown and also boosted his candidacy 
among other jews 
i dont see ron as being somehow a radical guy who just because 
he was convention manager for jesse somehow bought into all of 
jesses rhetoric he said 
i recognize that for some the perception can be all wrong 
said grossman theyll say ron brown can be the greatest guy in 
the world he can be a fine wonderful guy with lots of judgment 
lots of vision but its just going to play badly in a lot of 
places 
a washington attorney who once was staff director of the senate 
judiciary committee when kennedy was chairman brown agreed last 
spring to serve as convention manager for jackson in that role he 
was widely credited with helping bring about the show of unity on 
the closing night of the convention 
baker said that if brown is elected chairman he would think it 
was wasting the alabama democratic partys money to continue 
attending national party functions 
you cant secede from the national party though frankly i 
would he said 
im not sure thats what we need right now said james 
ruvolo the ohio democratic party chairman who backs wiener for the 
national post 
mr bakers remarks not only surprise me but they make me very 
sad said pat eddington a democratic national committee member 
from alabama

the chairman of the house committee on small 
business says congress should repeal a provision of the 1986 tax 
overhaul that small business owners say has prompted them to 
consider slashing employee benefits 
rep john j lafalce dny filed the legislation tuesday the 
first of two days of hearings on section 89 of the tax overhaul the 
section was designed to encourage expanded benefit programs but 
according to small business interests has resulted in just the 
opposite 
this was a shortcut someone tried to make along the way that 
ended up being a roadblock for small business instead of an aid 
john paul galles executive vice president of national small 
business united told the committee 
any changes to the law however would have to be approved by the 
house ways and means committee which has been reluctant to tinker 
with it because even minor changes bring calls for more significant 
amendments 
section 89 which took effect jan 1 requires all business 
owners to determine if their health and life insurance programs 
discriminate in favor of higherpaid employees discriminatory 
benefits would be subject to higher taxation 
employees are defined as those who work 17 12 hours a week or 
more but witnesses at the hearing said using that definition will 
inevitably lead to findings that most benefit plans are 
discriminatory because employers routinely offer superior benefits 
to fulltime employees and those in highly skilled jobs 
john s satagaj president of the small business legislative 
council said the dramatic and unprecedented change in the 
definition of employee would force costconscious small businesses 
to either eliminate parttime positions to avoid being labeled 
discriminatory or do away with employerpaid health benefits 
altogether 
the law also requires employers to inform employees of any 
planned changes in benefit programs to bring the company in 
compliance with the law 
james lagos president of national small business united said 
most small businessmen are not aware of the law and are in effect 
already violating it either by not beginning the required tests or 
by failing to properly notify workers of planned benefit changes 
instead of paying thousands of dollars or more to have their 
benefit programs tested for compliance many small business owners 
have indicated they would eliminate employerpaid insurance and 
instead give their workers a pay raise lagos said 
that would hurt workers because their taxable income would 
increase and they would have to pay higher health insurance rates 
than would a business purchasing a group plan lagos said

president raul alfonsin declared 
allout war on leftist subversion after touring a suburban army base 
where at least 36 people were killed in a battle between troops and 
besieged civilian commandos 
troops were still scouring the smoldering rubble of the ravaged 
la tablada base tuesday night as alfonsin told the nation the attack 
was a new challenge that i believe is the most serious and 
decisive of my administration 
the 3rd infantry regiment base was seized monday by heavily armed 
civilians and retaken a day later by army and police forces who had 
pummeled commando positions with howitzers mortars grenades and 
machinegun fire 
in his nationally broadcast speech the president recalled his 
impressions of the base and the charred and mangled corpses he 
encountered there it was a nightmare death once again death 
the brutality the barbarity 
he said seven soldiers one policeman and 28 commandos were 
killed and that all but four of the 67 wounded were soldiers and 
policemen 
authorities said troops captured 14 of the commandos who 
apparently intended to steal weapons from the base and quickly flee 
alfonsin described the attackers as irregular elements of 
ultraleftist affiliation citing a written proclamation found at 
the base as evidence of their hallucination 
a copy of the proclamation given to reporters said the base was 
seized to preempt a purportedly imminent coup by rightwing army 
officers 
we are fed up with the arrogance of the military it said 
alfonsin was elected in 1983 to end a nearly eightyear military 
dictatorship during which 8900 suspected leftist subversives were 
arrested and vanished without a trace presumably murdered by 
security forces 
given such incidents as the la tablada raid a dec 4 military 
uprising led by nowcashiered col mohamed seineldin and the 
subsequent bombing of the communist partys headquarters 
argentines fear that political extremism is returning to the 
country 
the englishlanguage newspaper buenos aires herald commented in 
an editorial tuesday 
if the la tablada attack did come from the extreme left this 
means that democracy is now under a twopronged assault from right 
and left for the first time in more than a decade 
now the army has the terrorist threat that has been missing so 
long and the government must worry about the civilian left not just 
the military right 
presidential elections are set for may 14 by law alfonsin 
cannot run for reelection and favored to win is the opposition 
party candidate carlos menem inflation is averaging more than 300 
percent a year real wages are declining and economic and social 
unrest is high 
alfonsin on tuesday set up a national security council he did 
not say who would sit on the body but it was generally believed 
that top military officials would be among its members 
the president praised the soldiers bravery in retaking the base 
and said i want to tell them that this is also my fight and i 
will fight it to the end looking on as he spoke were his military 
chiefs of staff 
the rightwing armed forces in this country that has seen six 
military coups since 1930 have been a constant headache for alfonsin 
in the past 21 months he has had to cope with three uprisings by 
elements in the army angered by the prosecution of officers for 
human rights abuses 
alfonsin has insisted that subversion be combatted within legal 
bounds unlike the militarys dirty war of the 1970s when the 
thousands of suspected leftists disappeared 
this is our chance to show the world and ourselves that we have 
learned from the past he declared tuesday night 
the president said leftist extremism would be fought only 
within the law but with all the force of the law 
if anyone believes that democracy is a weak system they now 
are going to learn how wrong they are he said this is the last 
great test of my government and we are not going to lose

some members of congress as well as the 
lobbying groups that pay them are selfconscious about the practice 
of picking up large fees for speeches or panel discussions before 
one interest group or another 
next week for instance the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors is hosting a twoday conference in 
washington where eight senators and four house members are scheduled 
to speak 
the association issued a notice giving directions to the hotel 
ballroom times and topics making sure reporters knew they were 
welcome 
it gave phone numbers in case anyone has any questions 
ask how much the senators and house members are being paid for 
their speeches and the conversation dies 
im not prepared to get into an interview of that type said 
dirk van dongen president of the association 
that kind of reaction is understandable said howard marlowe 
president of the american league of lobbyists who would like to see 
congress abolish the practice of paying politicians to talk 
the fees known as honoraria are an added source of personal 
income for members of congress who can keep from 26850 to 35800 
annually depending on whether they are house or senate members 
its perfectly legal but the perception is that its bad so 
therefore you have people who dont want to talk about it marlowe 
said 
we all in this town are competing for some forms of access and 
power he said it is easier to buy it than to talk your way 
into it thats buying access and not buying influence 
a proposal on capitol hill to ban the practice is informally 
linked to boosting congressional salaries 50 percent from 89500 to 
135000 
members of congress who late in the spring are required to 
disclose how much they make in speaking fees along with other 
financial information are not eager to give that out before they 
have to 
we are required by law to disclose that information on an 
annual basis but i dont think that its a good idea to give it out 
on a piecemeal basis said david dreyer spokesman for rep tony 
coelho dcalif who made 78500 in speaking fees in 1987 the 
last year for which records are available 
rep dan rostenkowski dill was reluctant to disclose how much 
hes received in honoraria since congress recessed before the 
election last fall but when pressed his office acknowledged he got 
21000 for making five speeches in palm springs calif earlier 
this month while he was at a golf tournament 
lawmakers in both houses can retain up to 2000 per article or 
event with any fee exceeding that figure or any amount over the 
annual cap going to charity 
rostenkowski chairman of the ways and means committee which 
writes the nations tax laws made 245000 in speaking fees last 
year and gave enough of it to charity to drop just below the house 
limit which at the time was less than 26000 
rostenkowski wasnt alone in palm springs in midjanuary 
the tobacco institute hosted 27 members of congress at a posh 
resort near there but institute spokesman walker merryman wouldnt 
say how much they were paid or how much of their expenses were 
picked up he did say that everyone was treated equally 
among those attending the conference was sen thomas a daschle 
dsd whose office said he earned a 2000 honorarium along with 
roundtrip air fare for him and his wife and three nights lodging 
the tab 1392 
marlowe said the league of lobbyists has not taken a position on 
the issue of abolishing honoraria but he favors getting rid of the 
practice because of the bad appearance which he compared to a skin 
blemish 
if it is banned he said some of washingtons finest minds will 
start looking for loopholes 
i honestly am stuck on what will rise up to take its place but 
i have every confidence in the ingenuity of the players involved 
that something will rise up he said just like the zits 
another one can pop up in its place

after enduring more than a decade of ted bundys 
smug silence and denials relatives of his acknowledged victims 
found a chilling relief in his 11thhour admission of a life of rape 
and murder 
the only thing i can say is thank god its finally over 
said vivian rancourt of laconner whose 18yearold daughter susan 
disappeared april 17 1974 in the days before his execution 
tuesday bundy confessed to her slaying 
but an investigator who heard some of bundys confessions said 
there were crimes the serial killer wouldnt talk about and secrets 
he took with him to floridas electric chair 
the 42yearold bundy who was convicted of murdering three 
people in florida admitted killing 23 other women after a decade of 
denial but he left a legacy of frustration for those who suspect he 
killed many more 
no one knows the enormity of bundys crimes fbi officials said 
years ago he might be implicated in 36 slayings throughout the west 
but bundys confessions included deaths to which he had not 
previously been linked such as two in idaho and he did not give 
specifics on at least 10 others in which he was a suspect 
i dont think we have even scratched the surface with bundy 
sheriff pete hayward of salt lake county utah said after the 
execution somewhere there is someone bundy has told the whole 
story to 
bundy confessed to eight utah killings but because he identified 
only two victims there authorities said many cases may never be 
solved 
investigators said bundy would not answer when asked about his 
connection to two utah deaths in which he is a suspect including 
the october 1974 strangulation and beating death of laura anne aime 
17 of salem utah 
but there was no doubt tuesday in the mind of her mother that 
bundy killed her child 
he needed to die very badly shirlene aime said but she 
conceded the last minutes of waiting for his execution were 
horrible 
it made me feel guilty she said despite all the things he 
did to my daughter and all the other girls i started to think how 
low am i waiting for a man to die 
her longsought relief at bundys death was slow to come she 
said 
i still have this empty feeling im sick to my stomach its 
an uptight horrible feeling but it is a relief to know hes gone 
and he wont do it again 
bundy was executed for the 1978 rape and murder of 12yearold 
kimberly leach of lake city fla he also was convicted of killing 
two women in 1978 at a florida state university sorority house his 
gush of confessions in the four days before his electrocution did 
not include those deaths 
robert keppel an investigator for the washington state attorney 
general said the law student dropout from tacoma was unwilling in 
interviews to talk about some cases that gave him painful 
memories and balked at confessing to deaths before 1973 
that seemed to be where he drew the line said keppel who 
spent about two hours during the weekend extracting confessions from 
a shaken tearful bundy 
keppel said bundy denied kidnapping and killing 8yearold ann 
marie burr in 1961 when bundy would have been just 14 but the way 
bundy talked about that crime he left doubt about whether he might 
have been responsible keppel said 
ann marie disappeared from her parents tacoma home near where 
bundys family lived during an early morning rainstorm no clue to 
her fate has ever been found though there have been years of 
speculation including that of ann maries parents that bundy was 
to blame 
he denied that he did it keppel said but he kind of 
offered some qualifiers he told me he was too young at the time he 
told me serial killers start a little older than that and he 
said the neighborhoods were so far apart and he said his 
newspaper route wasnt close to the burr residence 
beverly burr said tuesday she feels strongly that bundy was 
responsible for her daughters disappearance but added if it was 
bundy then theres no way were going to find out we cant do 
much were helpless 
keppel said his opportunity to question bundy was limited to 
friday and sunday when the killer gave considerable detail about 
the string of eight ted murders in 1974 in the seattle area but 
time ran out before he could get details on other killings 
he told me that he would never talk about some cases because 
they were too close and too painful to talk about he said

employment costs rose 5 percent last year 
because of higher social security taxes and rising benefit costs 
while wage and salary gains lagged behind inflation according to 
government data 
the 5 percent rise in the cost of wages salaries and 
employerpaid benefits in 1988 compares with a 36 percent increase 
in 1987 the labor department said tuesday in releasing its 
quarterly employment cost index 
part of the overall increase in employment costs was attributed 
to the increase in the employers social security tax rate in 
january 1988 from 715 percent to 751 percent 
rising health insurance premiums were cited as a major factor in 
the 68 percent increase in benefit costs to private employers in 
1988 another force in driving overall employment costs up the 68 
percent increase in that area was nearly double the 35 percent jump 
in benefit costs reported in 1987 and came after three years of 
virtually identical growth in those costs 
although employment costs rose the rate of wage and salary 
increases lagged behind inflation for the second consecutive year 
the increase was 41 percent in 1988 much closer to inflation than 
the 33 percent hike reported for 1987 inflation averaged 44 
percent both years 
continued low unemployment which increases the competition for 
available workers was cited by analysts as the major reason for the 
accelerated growth in wages in 1988 compared to 1987 
its clearly the decline in the unemployment rate said 
cynthia latta chief financial economist at data resources inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm there is less available labor 
out there in the market and its harder to find what you want 
according to the labor department employment costs rose by 56 
percent among state and local governments in 1988 up from 44 
percent in 1987 
it cost private industry employers 49 percent more last year to 
pay wages salaries and benefits than it did in 1987 the department 
said compared with a 33 percent increase in 1987 over 1986 
federal government employment costs are not included in the report 
sales workers whose pay is heavily influenced by commissions 
experienced a 66 percent wage gain in 1988 up from just a 1 
percent gain in 1987 
workers in the rapidly expanding service sector of the economy 
experienced wage and salary gains of 47 percent while those 
working in goodsproducing industries saw their pay increase on 
average by 31 percent 
for the fifth consecutive year nonunion workers in private 
industry received greater wage and salary increases than did their 
unionized counterparts with the increases averaging 45 percent and 
22 percent respectively 
state and local government workers received on average a 48 
percent pay gain in 1988 up from 42 percent in 1987 with the 
increase in that sector highest among elementary and secondary 
school employees predominantly teachers who averaged 57 percent 
pay raises last year

wake of federal reserve board chairman alan greenspans testimony to 
congress that indicated he may tighten monetary policy to fight 
inflation 
in a testimony tuesday before the us house of representatives 
banking committee greenspan said the risks of inflation were great 
enough that the federal reserve might well be advised to err more 
on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus 
early trading was dominated by dollarbuying but speculative 
investors started selling the currency to adjust their positions 
said takamasa yamasaki of daiwa bank 
we already knew that the united states would tighten its 
monetary policy by keeping the interest rates high but greenspans 
comment still prompted buying because investors have been looking 
for marketaffecting incentives he said

combat veteran jim kessi is hoping that by 
returning to vietnam where most everyone in his battalion was 
either wounded or killed he can exorcise the demons that still 
haunt him after 20 years 
whenever i think of vietnam i get real sad for the 
people who were killed uselessly both vietnamese and american 
said kessi 
if i go back and actually see the territory again that it is 
different that there isnt that big a bogeyman out there that will 
cause the same thing to happen for my sons maybe i can come to 
peace with it 
kessi 43 seven other veterans two group therapists and a 
documentary film crew were to leave tonight for vietnam the 
veterans will spend three weeks traveling through the country and 
undergoing intensive psychiatric therapy 
kessi said guilt was a big problem when his oneyear army tour 
was over 
my first month in the field my best friend from training 
drowned with six other guys while patrolling a river in vietnam 
kessi said when i got back 12 months later i think i was the 
only guy out of 18 guys signed to my battalion with me who wasnt 
injured or dead 
upon his return in january 1969 kessi buried his memories and 
built a succession of businesses dabbling in construction real 
estate and commodities 
i could build up something do real well and then destroy it 
out of guilt he said im not supposed to be good why did i 
survive and nobody else did 
perhaps he will find some answers in hanoi the groups first 
stop from there they will go through several other cities mostly 
by bus ending up in ho chi minh city formerly saigon they also 
will visit the sites of some of the bloodiest battles of the war 
including da nang and the mekong delta area plans also include 
meetings with viet cong and north vietnamese army veterans 
dr ray scurfield director of the posttraumatic stress disorder 
program at the veterans hospital at american lake near tacoma will 
accompany the group and conduct daily sessions 
scurfield who did psychiatric work in vietnam said victims of 
the disorder can develop chronic symptoms that include walking 
nightmares numbing helplessness fear that leads to rage fear 
that leads to grief anger against authority and the system and 
an inability to control emotions and actions 
the disorder often responds to intensive therapy he said 
bill koutrouba 46 who was an army medic with three tours of 
duty in vietnam came up with the idea for the trip following a 
discussion about the oscarwinning movie platoon 
koutrouba won three silver stars and was nominated for the medal 
of honor now he says the disorder has left him disabled 
kessi enrolled in the program two years ago and has been trying 
to strip away his defenses to find out why he feels so isolated and 
angry 
i have no idea what its going to be like when i get there 
he said i had promised some of my men i was a sergeant that i 
would return in 20 years and take a tour of vietnam the feeling is 
to pay homage to the people that werent leaving to our friends to 
our buddies 
if i had one wish about this trip it would be that i could 
come back with less guilt because im guiltdriven and with less 
sadness and maybe with some reason why all those guys died

buoyed by signs of life rescuers braved deadly 
fumes today in an attempt to reach about 100 men believed sealed for 
nearly five days in a gold mine by a deliberately set fire and a 
collapse officials said 
rescue teams have been working intensively through the night 
nazca police spokesman juan torres said early today in a telephone 
interview 
three miners were found dead and three rescued tuesday at the 
mouth of the sol de oro mine near nazca 230 miles south of lima 
energy minister jose carrasco reported tuesday that rescuers 
heard tapping from the tunnels indicating someone was alive he 
said rescuers tapped the walls and heard a faint response 
carrasco said there were conflicting reports of 15 to 200 miners 
trapped in the mine which nazca police lt juan robles said 
collapsed monday after a fire ravaged wooden tunnel supports 
rescuers reduced that number tuesday to about 100 robles said 
the men have been trapped inside the mine since saturday when fire 
prevented their escape 
carrasco told reporters on his return to lima following a visit 
to the mine site that opposing groups of miners set the fires during 
a dispute the state news agency andina said miners were battling 
over a newly discovered vein that was yielding about 45 pounds of 
gold daily 
officials said fallen earth smoke and poison gas had prevented 
rescuers from entering the mine until tuesday when teams of 
specialists from state mines and lima reached the site 
the fire started in the mine friday after gas lamps used for 
lighting set ablaze wooden tunnel supports on the second level 
robles said that fire was controlled he continued but it flared 
again on saturday and miners working inside were blocked from 
leaving by heavy smoke 
robles said the miners were believed to be on the second third 
and fourth levels of the fivelevel mine which extends about 1000 
feet into a halfmilehigh hill on nazcas outskirts 
officials said the mine had not been used commercially for about 
a year but area farmers and others have been mining it on an 
independent basis for extra cash 
robles said about 900 men using mainly picks and shovels have 
each extracted up to a gram of gold a day valued at 10 for sale 
to the state mining company minero peru 
carrasco said two of the rescued men had been hospitalized and a 
third was only slightly injured 
robles said two of the three bodies recovered at the mouth of the 
mine showed signs of having died from poison gases 
mining is perus most important industry and accounts for more 
than half of its foreign exchange gold production averages about 
60 million yearly and is the nations fifth leading mineral behind 
copper silver lead and zinc

hamlet directed his players to speak trippingly 
on the tongue but the latest players to tackle another of 
shakespeares tragic heroes othello dont speak at all 
silent othello the latest production of the 4yearold 
italian american theater tells the tale of the moor of venice 
without the bards poetry and also without sets or secondary 
characters 
the five actors on the bare nightclub stage rely instead on mime 
dance motions and traditional italian gestures most of them 
impolite 
we dont pretend its shakespeare but you could consider it a 
mirror to shakespeare director frank melcori recently said after 
the first of six weekly performances 
we dont have the verbal techniques to do spoken shakespeare 
but we have other techniques we can use to tell a story he said 
othello is the cleanest dramatically of shakespeares tragedies 
its a fairly simple story of jealousy and revenge 
even before shakespeares time it was an italian story the tale 
of how otello moro the venetian governor of cyprus was led by 
misguided jealousy to strangle his wife desdemona 
in silent othello that jealousy is stagemanaged as in 
shakespeare by the villainous iago but this time iago is a woman 
kaja overstreet the only cast member not of italian ancestry ms 
overstreets training is in dance and japanese theater and she 
dispenses with the subtleties of shakespeares iago creating 
instead a demonic elf 
everything ive studied is very gestural ms overstreet 
said im very visual i dont care about the delivery or 
narrative 
using the moves of the buto theater she studied in japan ms 
overstreet establishes iagos villainy at the outset with the mere 
lighting of a cigarette later with snakelike motions she puts the 
horns of the deceived husband on othello in the very act of 
consoling him 
gino degrazia as othello uses restrained movements through most 
of the 40minute performance to suggest a dignified venetian 
general but after strangling desdemona played by laura dame he 
reverts to his african heritage smearing himself with her lipstick 
and doing a voodooinspired dance before committing suicide 
lionel bottari who plays the double role of roderigo and 
brabantio said the production was based largely on the ideas of 
dario fo a contemporary playwright and comedian who draws on the 
traditions of italian folk comedy 
were attempting to create an italianamerican kind of cultural 
entity said bottari who has been performing in guerrilla 
theater since the 1960s italianamericans have arrived 
economically and politically but we havent really arrived at the 
level of culture our families left behind

president bush and his wife barbara 
were among the first to congratulate president corazon aquino on her 
56th birthday today the philippine president said 
president bush also told me that in case i need anything in the 
future i should not hesitate to call him up immediately she said 
mrs aquino told wellwishers that bushs telephone call at 7 
am delayed her arrival at the roman catholic cathedral in this 
provincial capital for a mass to mark the occasion 
the conversation with the bushes was briefly interrupted because 
the line was cut and i had to wait for bush to call again 
mrs aquino said 
she joked that perhaps the fault was with the philippine long 
distance co which is run by a branch of her family and is 
notorious for its poor service 
mrs aquino decided to celebrate her birthday by taking her 
entire cabinet to malolos capital of bulacan province 20 miles 
north of manila to listen to residents complaints and problems and

the air force removed the 10warhead payload 
from five mx missiles late last year several months after an 
accident in which a missile came loose and fell in its underground 
silo a published report says 
the service is still trying to decide how to repair the five 
missiles which account for 10 percent of the nations mx force the 
washington post reported today 
despite taking the warheads off five missiles the service still 
claimed last month that the mx had reached full operational 
capability on dec 30 
the decision to remove the warheads followed an incident last 
june in wyoming according to the newspaper one of the missiles 
became unglued from its underground launch canister 
the missile fell six inches to a foot and had to undergo 
extensive repairs the post said quoting unnamed air force 
officials 
an air force investigating panel concluded that the missile was 
one of a batch of five which had production problems the post said 
air force officials responded to the report by ordering removal 
of the 10warhead package atop each of the five suspect missiles 
according to the newspaper 
the air force has been authorized to build 50 of the missiles and 
deploy them in underground silos in wyoming and nebraska the weapon 
will join the minuteman as the core of the nations landbased 
nuclear missile deterrent force 
the air force has not publicly released details of the two 
incidents and pentagon officials contacted tuesday night said they 
had no information on them 
in the incident last june a key electrical wire was cut the 
wire is normally severed during launch and may have briefly caused 
concern that the weapon was being launched the post said but 
pentagon officials told the newspaper there was no danger of an 
accidental launch

records of american troop movements in vietnam 
prove that thousands of soldiers were in areas heavily sprayed by 
the herbicide agent orange in the 1960s according to two scientists 
whose methods are heavily criticized by the government a published 
report says 
the findings by steven and jeanne stellman that thousands of 
troops were exposed to the cancercausing herbicide challenge 
statements by federal officials that they have been unable to find 
enough soldiers exposed to heavy spraying to reach any meaningful 
conclusions 
the two epidemiologists planned to present their findings today 
to congress the washington post reported today 
twelve million gallons of agent orange were sprayed in vietnam 
from 1965 to 1970 to defoliate jungles and cropland where enemy 
troops were thought to be hiding the herbicide contains dioxin the 
most toxic chemical known a tiny amount of dioxin causes cancer 
immune system depression and birth defects in laboratory animals 
the stellmans found that half the 35 combat battalions they have 
examined so far were in areas near saigon during or soon after the 
time agent orange was sprayed in the 1967 and 1968 
they said the evidence of exposure is so strong that veterans 
should be contacted checked for health effects and informed of 
possible future problems 
when i look at those levels of exposure i get a lump in my 
throat the post quoted jeanne stellman an associate professor of 
public health at columbia university we have several units that 
were right in the midst of very heavy spraying 
her husband steven stellman an assistant health commissioner in 
new york city said those men are at higher risk for a variety of 
health problems 
but vernon c houk director of the center for environmental 
health at the centers for disease control said the stellmans were 
turning logic on its head by ignoring blood tests in favor of 
historical records 
the stellmans said blood analysis such as those used by the cdc 
are not a valid measure of dioxin 20 years after exposure 
the stellmans are helping a federal court in new york determine 
who is eligible for compensation from the manufacturers as part of a 
1984 court settlement with exposed veterans

ten tibetan monks have begun a monthlong project 
that brings an ancient buddhist tradition to the west butter 
sculpture 
no not the statue of a cow they had at the state fair and not 
the carved swan you once saw on a banquet table 
these sculptures begun tuesday in an unheated hall at the 
american museum of natural history are astonishingly intricate 
brightly colored religious offerings created in a ritualistic 
manner that dates back more than six centuries 
we devote ourselves to this way of life which is now under 
great stress said one of the monks thubten jigme after he 
carried a tub of ice water to the demonstration area were 
delighted to let people know about our culture and our art 
organizers with the museum and tibet house new york say its the 
first time largescale traditional butter sculpture has been shown 
in the west 
wearing bright yellow and red robes the monks began their work 
with several minutes of distinctive harmonic chanting individual 
voices somehow produced threetone chords and the chorus of 10 
sounded at once ominous and soothing 
then to work 
the men from the gyuto tantric monastery in bomdila india will 
stay in a private home for the next six weeks rising before dawn to 
chant for hours then settling in to work on the sculptures from 
1030 am to 5 pm 
they create individual piesized pieces of art abstract 
flowers concentric designs called mandalas and other symbols as 
well as miniature sculptures of horses elephants and sixarmed 
figures called mahakalas 
these will be attached to an 8foot wooden frame all to show 
americans how the tibetan monks celebrate the new year in february 
the butter is actually a vegetable product the preferred 
yak butter is virtually unavailable refined from the seeds of a 
certain species of tree that grows in northern india 
konchok wangdu abbot of the monastery said he hoped the 
demonstration will encourage americans to learn extensively about 
tibet her history her culture and her art 
because of the chinese occupation of the past 30 years these 
arts have been extinguished and those people who do them are 
becoming extinct he said more than 100000 tibetans fled their 
homeland and chinese domination in 1959

hours before his execution ted bundy coolly 
traced his origins as a serial killer describing how boyhood 
glimpses of violent pornography became an addiction that grew 
until his destructive energy exploded from fantasy into reality 
the 42yearold law school dropout whose bizarre mixture of 
intelligence charm and homicidal bloodlust were the subject of five 
books and a tv movie also warned before his execution tuesday that 
there were others like himself 
there are loose in the towns and their communities people like 
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in day out 
by violence in the media particularly sexual violence bundy 
said in a videotaped interview monday 
bundy who after a decade of denial told detectives from four 
states that he had murdered 23 young women since the mid1970s said 
he deserved his punishment his execution in the electric chair at 
florida state prison elicited cheers from more than 100 people who 
stood in a field across from the penitentiary 
i dont want to die im not going to kid you but i 
deserve certainly the most extreme punishment society has i think 
society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me 
bundy said in the interview with james dobson a religious 
broadcaster and psychologist 
he said between sobs he hoped the interview would spur society to 
protect itself from the widespread influence of pornography tv 
violence xrated movies 
although he said he felt remorse for the sexrelated murders 
which authorities believes could total 36 nationwide bundy said 
there is no way in the world that killing me is going to restore 
those beautiful children to their parents 
handcuffed and sitting at a table across from dobson bundy 
alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29minute interview he was 
dressed in the peachcolored shortsleeved shirt worn by death row 
inmates 
he appeared to ponder each question carefully sometimes pausing 
at length before answering articulately 
dobson who has a daily radio program heard on 1200 radio 
stations asked about the rape and murder of 12yearold kimberly 
leach for which bundy was executed 
what did you feel after that dobson asked 
bundy held his hands to his face closed his eyes and thought for 
a long time before responding i cant talk about that right now 
its too painful i cant begin to understand the pain that 
the parents of these children felt 
i dont ask them to forgive me im not asking for it that 
kind of forgiveness is of god 
prodded by dobson to explore the sources of his violence bundy 
said that during his murder rampages the unique thing about how 
this worked is i still felt in my regular life the full range of 
guilt and remorse about other things 
but the murders he said were compartmentalized in his 
brain a very well focused very sharply focused area that was a 
black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that 
crack hole just disappeared 
he emphasized he didnt blame pornography for his actions and 
took full responsibility but he said hardcore pornography fueled 
by alcohol guided and shaped what he did 
i have lived in prison for a long time now and ive met a lot 
of men who were motivated to violence just like me and without 
exception every one of them was deeply involved in pornography 
he said 
claiming he was essentially a normal person who grew up in a 
good home bundy said 
people need to recognize those of us who are or who have 
been so much influenced by violence in the media in particular 
pornographic violence are not some kind of inherent monsters we 
are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular 
families and pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any 
house today 
but dr dorothy otnow lewis a psychiatrist who examined bundy as 
part of a lastditch attempt to save him from execution said 
bundys first home was that of his maternal grandparents with a 
grandfather who was an extremely violent and frightening 
individual the grandfather would kick dogs swing cats by their 
tails beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously 
the new haven conn psychiatrist said 
lewis said a cousin told her that when bundy was a preschooler in 
the home in philadelphia he used to sneak into a greenhouse where 
his grandfathers pornography was kept and read it 
in the interview bundy said his desire to murder happened in 
stages gradually once you become addicted to pornography 
and i look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of 
addiction i would keep looking for more potent more explicit more 
graphic kinds of material 
you keep craving something that is harder harder something 
which which gives you a greater sense of excitement until you 
reach a point where the pornography only goes so far you reach that 
jumpingoff point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing 
it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at 
it 
in the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process then at 
a certain time it is instrumental i would say crystallizing 
making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside 
a building up of this destructive energy 
after committing his first murder bundy said he was 
absolutely horrified that i was capable of doing something like 
that 
it was like coming out of some horrible trance bundy said 
it was like being possessed by something so awful so alien 
but then the impulse to do it again would come back even 
stronger

persistent human rights abuses by east germany 
include the punishment of people who seek to emigrate harsh 
treatment of prisoners and the conducting of secret trials amnesty 
international said today 
while the communist government has loosened up some travel 
restrictions some people caught trying to flee have been charged 
with espionage the londonbased human rights organization said 
amnesty said a clear pattern of human rights abuse exists in 
the country of 166 million people but said official secrecy and the 
governments refusal to respond in detail to various allegations 
make it difficult to obtain a complete picture 
western leaders last week sharply criticized east germanys 
record on the issue during a human rights conference in vienna 
east german leader erich honecker has been resisting calls for 
reforms along the lines of those initiated in the soviet union by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
amnesty said east germanys secret trials secret directives to 
lawyers and vaguely defined laws make it possible for the 
authorities to penalize almost any activity of which they 
disapprove 
young east germans with the support of part of the lutheran 
church have been clamoring for greater freedom including the 
ability to travel outside the soviet bloc 
amnesty quoted some east germans as saying their applications to 
emigrate were turned down because the stated reasons were not 
sufficient 
others have reported that the officials said that the 
application was illegal without indicating which laws had been 
broken the organization said in a report 
the east germans have eased travel restrictions after years of 
pressure from western leaders western estimates say 15 million 
people have applied to emigrate from east germany many leave 
illegally more than 9700 in 1988 
amnesty said there have been cases of people being charged with 
espionage if they had access to sensitive information and later 
tried to flee 
in such cases no information has in fact been passed on 
because the person was apprehended before this was possible said 
report says 
it notes that stating ones reasons for wishing to leave east 
germany can be considered the crime of public vilification 
the vilification is considered public if for example a copy 
of the application for an exit visa is sent to a higher authority or 
written on a postcard amnesty said 
many of those persecuted by the government are wouldbe emigrants 
who later turn to foreign organizations in hopes of seeking 
attention for their case the report says 
it says potential witnesses and defense lawyers can be charged 
with crimes if they challenge the prosecutors version of facts in a

federal officials say an accident that 
occurred during testing at the savannah river plant is another sign 
that problems at the nuclear facility are out of control 
the issue is not physical damage the issue is a lack of 
formality a lack of discipline richard starostecki deputy 
assistant energy secretary said tuesday this doesnt give you 
confidence in their ability to handle anomalies 
the engergy department and du pont co the plants operator are 
investigating sundays accident federal officials said there was no 
leakage of radiation or other hazardous material 
du pont officials said damage has tentatively been estimated at 
20000 and will take only a few days to repair 
the savannah river plant reactors which produce plutonium and 
tritium for the nations nuclear weapons arsenal have been shut 
down since april for safety and maintenance reasons 
the impact of the accident on the departments plans to restart 
the reactor before the end of this summer is uncertain 
however doe safety officials say the incident which comes at a 
time when safety of the nations nuclear weapons complex is under 
intense congressional scrutiny casts new doubts on the ability of 
plant operators to run srps three nuclear reactors 
starostecki the does top safety official said the incident was 
further evidence that suggested a lack of control over whats 
going on in the reactors 
he said the mishap at the k reactor closely parallels earlier 
problems at the p reactor in august when operators failed to shut 
down the reactor when they were confronted with erratic power levels 
the latest problem began thursday with a test of a portion of the 
reactor system that uses water from the nearby savannah river to 
help keep the radioactive core cool during normal operations 
during the test operators opened a valve to divert water from 
one segment of the cooling system to the portion being tested 
according to gerald merz du ponts technology superintendent merz 
said problems began when the operators forgot to close the valve 
after the test 
unaware that the valve was still open other operators on sunday 
began a test of another portion of the cooling system when water 
pressure in the portion of the cooling system they were testing 
failed to increase as expected they incorrectly assumed the problem 
was inadequate pumping capacity 
merz said the operators then switched on a second pump which 
created enough force to break the valve he said that caused water 
to surge through the entire system at up to six times the normal 
pressure level 
rather than take a prudent course of action when they werent 
getting the numbers they expected during a test which would have 
been to stop the test somebody elected to turn on another pump 
starostecki said 
du pont officials ordered a halt to further maintenance and 
testing at the k reactor the energy department says that work must 
be conducted before a restart can be attempted 
merz said the companys initial investigation suggests that 
operators failed to explicitly instruct technicians to close the 
valve in question after the test thursday 
but merz starostecki and roger rollins does acting director 
for reactor assessment at srp said tuesday that the faulty decision 
by operators during the sunday test was a bigger mistake 
they should have stopped merz said they were seeing 
something different than what was expected as far as the pressure 
levels and the correct action would have been to halt the test and 
call in the engineers and figure out what was happening 
he said du pont is considering taking disciplinary action against 
the operators involved 
rollins said the doe is investigating the matter including a 
delay in reporting the problem to top plant officials he said word 
of the mishap sunday night did not reach the departments managers 
at savannah river until tuesday

a sovietamerican dog sledding team plans to make 
a 1200mile goodwill trek across the bering strait the first 
officially sanctioned crossing since 1948 
ten men and two women six soviets and six americans will 
depart march 1 from anadyr siberia on the twomonth journey 
visiting 30 native settlements along an old arctic trade route 
some of the team members have relatives on the other side so 
the visits could get emotional said expedition coleader paul 
schurke 33 of minneapolis 
the expedition is an effort to call attention to the common 
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the bering region 
schurke said at a news conference tuesday at the swanky russian tea 
room restaurant 
and since villagers in the remote region rarely get outoftown 
visitors he said they are expecting big welcomes especially from 
children who will probably get the day off from school to ski along 
with the team 
the soviet coleader is dmitry shparo 47 of moscow who in 1979 
won his countrys highest honor the order of lenin for 
successfully leading a ski expedition to the north pole last year 
he was a member of a sovietcanadian trek across the polar ice cap 
from the ussr to canada 
sen frank murkowski ralaska called the bering bridge 
expedition another step toward melting the ice curtain 
murkowski who attended tuesdays news conference noted that the 
us government is working on a treaty with the soviets to permit 
american eskimos to visit and trade with their counterparts in 
siberia without visas 
in 1938 the two countries signed an agreement that enabled 
travel in the bering region but it was abrogated in 1948 during the 
iciest days of the cold war 
in the spirit of adventure diplomacy the team hopes a new 
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the ussoviet border 
around april 1 
when youre only 2 miles from your neighbor it shouldnt take 
40 years to renew your relationship said murkowski referring to 
the narrow strait between the islands of big diomede and little 
diomede the narrowest distance between the superpowers 
the bering strait is the shortest distance between the two 
greatest powers in the world said schurke who made an unassisted 
trek to the north pole in 1986 
yet it remains a cold reminder of untapped potential for 
exchange we are looking forward to setting an example for the world 
and uniting a people too long divided

reputed mob boss john gotti who according to his 
attorney has never run away from a problem walked out of a 
courtroom free on bail after being accused of ordering the shooting 
of a construction union official 
did i ever worry yet a smiling gotti asked reporters waiting 
for him as he arrived back at his home 20 hours after being arrested 
by dozens of law officers on a street in little italy 
i have nothing to worry about 
at a bail hearing tuesday the prosecution asked that gotti be 
held without bail arguing that the reputed head of the gambino 
crime family had access to massive sums of mob money and would flee 
if freed 
gottis income is literally that of the family assistant 
district attorney michael cherkasky told acting judge george roberts 
his financial resources are enormous hes gambled on numerous 
occasions and lost enormous sums of money were counting in the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars cherkasky said 
but gottis lawyer bruce cutler said gotti has strong family 
ties here and had never failed to appear for a court date 
hes not going no place he has never run away from a 
problem cutler said 
roberts set gottis bail at 100000 and about an hour later the 
48yearold gotti dressed in the same tailored brown suit and 
yellow turtleneck he wore when he was arrested monday was back on 
the streets 
at a news conference tuesday district attorney robert morgenthau 
released a grand jury indictment that accused gotti and two 
associates of conspiring to order the shooting of john f oconnor 
who allegedly had a restaurant vandalized for using nonunion 
carpenters 
it was the specific goal and intention of the conspiracy to 
punish john f oconnor and thereby reaffirm the authority of the 
gambino crime family over all others who might challenge it 
according to the indictment which charges gotti and the other two 
men with conspiracy and firstdegree assault 
oconnor vice president and business manager of local 608 of the 
united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners was shot four times in 
the may 1986 attack but survived 
law enforcement officials said oconnor apparently did not know 
the restaurant bankers and brokers in lower manhattan was managed 
by an alleged associate of the gambino organization the nations 
most powerful crime family 
gotti codefendant anthony tony lee guerrieri 60 a reputed 
soldier in gottis organization was freed on 50000 bail both men 
pleaded innocent 
the judge ordered the two to return to court monday 
the third man indicted angelo ruggiero identified as a captain 
in the gambino family was placed in custody at a hospital where he 
is undergoing cancer treatment and will be arraigned later 
morgenthau said 
morgenthau said investigators learned through electronic 
surveillance that a contract to shoot oconnor had been given by the 
gambino group to the leader of the westies a gang that operated on 
manhattans west side 
several members of the westies were named as coconspirators in 
the indictment but were not charged 
a missing member of the gang kevin kelly was indicted in 
absentia in september 1986 on attempted murder charges for the 
oconnor shooting lawenforcement officials believe kelly has been 
killed

studies elsewhere 
mali president moussa traore who heads the oau arrived in 
beijing on tuesday for his third visit since 1973 and was met at the 
airport by a delegation of malian students from universities around 
china 
traore was given a letter asking him to help african students 
leave china the african students said the oau has recently 
criticized china for its treatment of african students 
african students feel menaced by a climate of insecurity which 
is implicitly encouraged by chinese authorities said a copy of 
the letter obtained by the associated press 
we would like to leave china not only with the aim of returning 
to our respective countries but with an aim of continuing our 
studies in countries where living conditions will be favorable 
the letter says 
it asks the oau to provide the students with scholarships to 
enable us continue our studies 
most of the 1500 african students in china are on chinese 
government scholarships it was not clear how many of them the 
letter represented 
telephone calls to the mali embassy for comment were not answered

jan 4 at the beijing languages institute and about half the 140 
african students in nanking remained on strike there

authorities told him he could continue his studies in china he said 
he would rather return home 
ghana protested dosoos arrest and threatened to withdraw its 26 
students from china most of the other african embassies have been 
silent on the issue 
dosoos release appeared aimed at lessening any problems china 
might have with traore during his visit china has long courted 
africa in its attempt to be a leader of the third world 
an official xinhua news agency report on traores visit late 
tonight stressed chinas strong ties to africa 
strengthening cooperation with third world nations including 
those of africa is the cornerstone of chinas foreign policy of

a psychiatrist who examined ted bundy as part of a 
lastditch attempt to save him from execution concluded that the 
confessed serial killer probably started developing psychological 
problems as an infant 
dr dorothy otnow lewis of new haven conn said bundy first 
lived in the home of his maternal grandparents in philadelphia with 
a grandfather who was an extremely violent and frightening 
individual 
the grandfather would kick dogs swing cats by their tails beat 
people who angered him and read pornography voraciously she said 
lewis interviewed bundy on monday as his attorneys tried 
unsuccessfully to prove he was mentally incompetent to be executed 
bundy was electrocuted tuesday morning at the florida state prison 
lewis findings were published in detail in tuesday editions of 
the seattle times offering a possible glimpse into the mind of a 
man linked to as many as three dozen killings in the west and in 
florida in the days before he died bundy confessed to 23 deaths 
lewis said a cousin told her that when bundy was a preschooler 
he used to sneak into a greenhouse where his grandfathers 
pornography was kept and read it hours before his death bundy 42 
said that pornography fueled his violent thoughts toward women 
bundy exhibited bizarre behavior at his grandparents house the 
psychiatrist said at age 3 he appeared several times at the 
bedside of his 15yearold aunt lifting the covers and placing 
butcher knives beside her 
lewis said bundys maternal grandmother had been hospitalized 
more than once for psychotic depression and had undergone 
electroshock therapy later in life the woman had a severe phobia 
against leaving her house 
such things could indicate bundy had a genetic predisposition to 
mental illness lewis said 
the whole family felt that bundys mother louise bundy and 
her son had to be rescued from the home a family member told 
lewis 
in the interviews with lewis ted bundy repeatedly said he had 
only fond memories of his grandfather apparently blocking out 
incidents described by other family members and indicating to lewis 
that bundy had been horribly traumatized as a child 
she said bundy born theodore robert cowell in a burlington vt 
home for unwed mothers finally moved with his mother to tacoma 
where other relatives lived there his mother met and married john 
bundy a hospital cook and john adopted ted 
lewis determined bundy suffered from a bipolar mood disorder 
or a manicdepressive illness that produced violent mood swings in 
the convicted killer at a moments notice bundy could switch from 
euphoria and compulsive talking to anger followed by long periods of 
sullen silence she said 
bundy almost certainly suffered from this disorder at the time of 
his florida trials for killing two florida state university women in 
tallahassee and 12yearold kimberly leach in lake city bundy was 
executed for the latter crime 
as evidence of bundys mood swings lewis showed the court a 
doodle she found in one of bundys college notebooks it showed two 
faces one normal the other enlarged and with draculalike teeth 
lewis said bundy not only didnt recall the doodle he tried to 
explain it away by saying he was probably on drugs when it was drawn 
an example of bundys mood swings occurred when an investigator 
was in bundys cell in florida lewis said the investigator told 
her that during a normal conversation bundy suddenly became weird 
on me did a metamorphosis a bit of a body and facial change 
and almost an odor emitted from him 
the investigator said the incident lasted about 20 minutes 
during which there was a change of personality with extreme 
tension i was afraid of him it was very scary 
on the day the leach girls body was found bundy flew into a 
rage in his cell lewis said he was pacing muttering things 
hyperventilating 
us district judge g kendall sharp who heard lewis findings 
also heard some strong dissent 
dr g jorgenson a university of utah psychiatrist who talked 
with bundy in a utah jail in 1976 described bundys hostility as 
mild he said bundy was intellectually efficient and 
flexible had a good relationship with women and was a normal 
person 
dr charles b mutter a miami physician specializing in 
psychiatry also said bundy was sane 
i think what this man did is brilliant mutter said in 
describing the meticulous research bundy performed in taking 80 or 
90 depositions during one of his trials 
bundy said mutter was very logical very lucid he has beat 
two death warrants is that insanity

a major jewish organization is calling for the 
renewed teaching of values in american schools saying theres more 
cause for concern over moral confusion than over potential 
churchstate conflicts 
a report by the american jewish committee says the organization 
has rejected the argument that values education could be a 
smokescreen for teaching religious precepts 
the ajc a leading jewish civil rights organization is 
encouraging schools to define teach and put into action values 
that are at the foundation of a democracy 
youve got to rely on good faith and the integrity of the 
teaching system said arnold gardner the organizations vice 
president and chairman of the task force that wrote the report 
the easiest thing to do is to say lets not touch it because 
its too risky gardner said i think its a natural evolution 
of our attitude and the ability to distinguish between matters of 
religious faith and shared values 
the report to be released next month is considered significant 
because of the past reluctance of many groups representing minority 
religions to enter into the issue a copy of the report was obtained 
by the associated press 
marilyn braveman the committees director of education said she 
thinks the report could have been written two years ago but it 
wouldnt be received as well there might not be a sense of urgency 
in it 
the role of the public school in teaching values is coming under 
increasing scrutiny as educators and others debate the effect of 
valuefree education in a 1986 speech that focused national 
attention on the issue gov mario cuomo said when you get kids 
for eight years in an elementary school and you never say anything 
to them about values i suspect what youre saying to them is there 
are no values 
a panel of educators brought together by the association of 
supervision and curriculum development recommended in its final 
report last year that schools define and teach a morality of 
justice altruism diligence and respect for human dignity 
the national council of churches representing mainline 
protestant denominations last year launched an experimental program 
to bring together churches schools and teachereducation colleges 
to help communities establish a consensus on values that should be 
taught 
i think what happened over the last 20 years was a certain 
kind of moral relativism did enter in there was confusion about 
right and wrong said irving m levine the jewish committees 
director of national affairs 
what you have now is a reinsertion of the 
ethnoculturalreligious traditions and an attempt to develop a 
consensus around those traditional values 
the committees report said that in many cases religious and 
civic values are identical among these are compassion a regard for 
human worth and dignity integrity and justice the report said a 
nonsectarian consensus can be reached on what values should be 
taught 
you dont have enormous controversy over those values you have 
enormous controversy over opening a foot in the door for sectarian 
religion levine said 
methods the report suggests for introducing values in the 
classroom include a conflict corner where two students could 
work out their differences and a teachermoderated fairness 
committee to propose solutions to classroom problems 
ms braveman gave one example of how values can be taught she 
told of a secondgrade teacher whose class was incubating 20 chicken 
eggs for a science project and suggested opening an egg each week 
to monitor the eggs embryonic development 
when one student told the teacher privately that he thought it 
was cruel to kill the chicks the teacher brought the issue to the 
class after a debate about whether chickens were alive before they 
hatched whether curiosity was a good enough reason to kill a chick 
and whether the scientific value of the experiment warranted opening 
the eggs the pupils agreed to honor their classmates objections 
the old fear that teaching values would lead to teaching 
sectarian religious beliefs still is prevalent in the american 
jewish community ms braveman said but that is no longer the 
exclusive position theres a desperate sense we need to do 
something she said 
the 50000member american jewish committee based in new york 
aims to protect the civil rights of jews worldwide

the state board of pardons and paroles will 
give quicker consideration of parole for a man whose 1976 conviction 
for killing a dallas police officer was questioned in the movie 
the thin blue line 
i would speculate it would be within the next 30 days said 
glenn t heckmann the boards executive director 
the board on tuesday granted randall dale adams an expedited 
parole review meaning his december review would be moved up 
state records show adams 40 who is serving a life sentence has 
been denied parole eight times most recently on jan 10 
adams parole request was expedited based on information provided 
by state district judge larry baraka said karin armstrong an 
information officer with the board 
baraka last month ruled that adams did not receive a fair trial 
in 1977 and recommended he be granted a new one or set free 
the key witness against adams changed his story last month 
testifying that adams didnt commit the murder and wasnt even in 
the car police officer robert wood stopped just before he was gunned 
down 
however the witness david ray harris stopped short of saying 
he pulled the trigger himself in woods slaying 
harris is on death row for another killing and dallas district 
attorney john vance has discounted his testimony 
adams always maintaining his innocence contends prosecutors 
wanted to convict him rather than harris who was only 16 at the 
time if convicted as a juvenile harris would have been released at 
age 18 
the thin blue line a documentary by errol morris questioned 
adams guilt 
adams has served more than 12 years in state prison in 1980 his 
death sentence was commuted to life 
the texas court of criminal appeals also is considering barakas 
recommendation that adams be given a new trial or set free 
attorneys said it could take as long as two years to act on it

the prohanoi government in cambodia has 
signed an agreement with the un refugee agency to allow cambodian 
refugees to return home from camps along the thai border state 
radio reported today 
an official cambodian government broadcast said the agreement 
signed monday in phnom penh deals with principles and procedures 
to welcome back voluntarily repatriated cambodian refugees 
the memorandum has been signed and the unhcr un high 
commissioner for refugees would be ready to facilitate cambodian 
refugees who wish to return said a un refugee agency 
official in bangkok kaiser zaman 
only about 17000 of the quartermillion cambodians along the 
thaicambodian border are being assisted by the un body but 
others could seek transfer to the un refugee camp of khao i dang 
and then apply for repatriation refugee sources said 
large numbers of cambodians fled violence starvation and disease 
as vietnamese troops invaded their country in late 1978 and ousted 
the brutal khmer rouge vast camps were set up along the frontier 
most of them controlled by various antiphnom penh guerrilla groups 
including the khmer rouge 
during a news conference last month cambodian prime minister hun 
sen said his government would be willing to welcome all 250000 
refugees 
refugee officials generally believe most will not seek 
repatriation because of the continued conflict in cambodia 
only about 4000 laotian refugees in thailand have returned home 
under a similar un refugee program that began in 1985 
last june the un refugee agency submitted the names of three 
cambodian refugees who wished to return to phnom penh authorities as 
test cases the government has yet to respond to these 
repatration requests

eleven people were arrested in a 
poaching sting that uncovered the slaughter of more than 400 black 
bears for their gall bladders which are prized as aphrodisiacs in 
the far east 
this is just the tip of this particular iceberg said walter 
bickford commissioner of the massachusetts department of fisheries 
wildlife and environmental law enforcement were aware of 
numerous other operations like this in massachusetts 
the arrests were made in raids that began at 6 am tuesday in 
massachusetts connecticut new hampshire and florida wildlife 
officials said 
the raids were the culmination of a 2year investigation that 
tracked approximately 50000 in transactions involving everything 
from endangered species to black bear gall bladders 
this operation is the most extensive ever conducted in the 
northeast said alan mcgroary director of the massachusetts 
division of environmental law enforcement 
some of the dozens of pelts and gall bladders confiscated in the 
raids were displayed at a news conference among the pelts were 
those of a mountain lion and several bobcats 
also displayed were videotapes and photographs of 27 bear 
carcasses piled in a meadow in the catskills bickford said 
investigators bought at least 360 gall bladders in addition to 
carcasses and skins 
he said the number of black bears apparently slaughtered for 
their gall bladders nearly equaled the black bear population in 
massachusetts most of the bears were taken in maine new hampshire 
and canada he said 
the arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that were 
said to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn which hold the 
same value in the far east as the gall bladders 
this is a primitive superstition said bickford there is 
no proof whatsoever that the bear organs or rhinoceros horns are 
aphrodisiacs he said 
the superstition however has pushed the street value of dried 
powdered black bear gall bladders overseas above that of heroin or 
cocaine in the united states bickford said the powder can sell for 
540 an ounce or more 
the investigation was led by two field officers from 
massachusetts and new york who took part in what bickford described 
as strange rituals in their undercover work 
one ritual involved christening new pickup trucks by building a 
bed of dead deer carcasses when youre dealing with a group 
like this youre talking about some bizarre behavior he said 
three of the arrested people were from massachusetts three more 
were from connecticut four from new hampshire and one was arrested 
in florida wildlife officials said more arrests were expected 
the arrested people jointly face more than 100 counts ranging 
from illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy without a license 
penalties for each count range up to one year in prison and 1000 
in fines 
the sale of black bear gall bladders is forbidden in most states 
although the bears may legally be hunted in many in massachusetts 
only the sale of the head hide and hooves of deer is permitted 
under certain conditions 
mcgroary said the investigation began when massachusetts game 
officials uncovered evidence that a connecticut meat dealer had 
illegally supplied venison to a western massachusetts restaurant he 
refused to identify

a new plan has emerged after years of debate to 
move the bulk of the nations largest collection of indian artifacts 
from new york city to washington dc a newspaper reported today 
the museum of the american indian would relocate from its 
manhattan site to the mall in washington the new york times 
reported the smithsonian institution would build and operate that 
museum as well as a smaller indian museum in new york 
although the collection is considered the finest of its kind it 
has been virtually invisible in its current location in upper 
manhattan far from the usual tourist areas 
the museum is only able to display about 1 percent of the 
collection and the rest is stored in a fourstory warehouse in the 
bronx there has been increasing concern that the collection could 
be deteriorating 
various plans had been raised for several years to move the 
collection which at one point appeared on the verge of being moved 
to dallas but new york city officials intervened pointing out that 
a trust established for the museum 73 years ago requires that it 
remain in new york 
last april smithsonian officials rejected a proposal to break 
the collection into three parts with one moving to the mall one 
remaining at the old manhattan site and another moving into the old 
us custom house in lower manhattan 
the newest plan would move a portion to the custom house 
satisfying the terms of the trust and increasing the museums 
visibility in new york 
mary ellen burns an assistant attorney general in new york city 
said the state had made a major concession in agreeing to give the 
smithsonian full title to the collection 
the attorney generals office is charged with overseeing trusts 
the times said the state has insisted that the customs house be 
used to display the collection in new york 
burns said the city and the heye foundation which runs the 
existing museum agree with the general provisions of the new 
proposal 
the newspaper said approval of the new proposal hinges on 
congress which must approve funds for a new museum

soviet troops shouldering what one of 
their generals has called moscows new task of feeding kabul today 
distributed 275 tons of airlifted flour and heating fuel to more 
than 5000 workers at a stateowned factory 
the distribution at a concrete block factory in the presence of 
invited western correspondents was noticeably orderly compared 
with unruly scenes of afghan soldiers beating back crowds from 
soviet armored personnel carriers during other emergency handouts in 
the capital last week 
the afghan workers most of whom maintained still want the soviet 
army out of the country hauled away 150pound sacks of flour that 
soldiers unloaded from trucks 
soviet col vadim solovye asked about reports the soviets 
suspect emergency supplies handed over to the afghan regime wind up 
with party officials said merely to do this through the afghan 
administration would take a long time 
behind the sovietbuilt factory near kabuls airport ilyushin76 
transport planes were seen landing and taking off in what the 
soviets said was the fifth day of a weeklong airlift of 400500 
tons daily from the soviet cities of tashkent and fergana 
soviet officers said the airlifts will continue as needed when 
the army completes the scheduled withdrawal of its troops by feb 15 
it is unclear however whether moscow will be able to continue 
feeding this capitals 22 million people if moslem insurgents who 
are already causing severe disrupts for road convoys mount an 
economic blockade aimed at strangling president najibs regime after 
his soviet protectors withdraw 
anything can happen but i think that a blockade will remain 
really just a threat maj gen lev serebrov deputy head of the 
soviet military command in afghanistan told reporters 
this weeks emergency airlift followed acute shortages in the 
city last week with fights breaking out in long lines at bread 
stores 
western diplomats say the stateowned silo that holds the 
capitals flour supply is down to less than one days supply the 
soviets say the city needs 120 tons a day but afghan officials say 
it needs 500 tons 
its good theyre going but dont worry theyll continue to 
help us said a 16yearold who identified himself as humanani 
the youth came with his father to help carry away several sacks of 
flour for their family of nine 
sayed wazir a wrinkled 55yearold complained for two weeks 
its been very hard to get anything 
asked what would happen when the soviet troops go he looked 
bewildered perhaps the government will help us he said 
in another development western diplomatic sources said afghan 
military and state security police were making housetohouse 
searches and hauling off young men for army conscription 
despite evidence of substantial troop movements north toward the 
soviet border and by air serebrov said sunday that the final stage 
of the soviet withdrawal has not yet begun 
he remained cautious today just say the withdrawal is 
continuing 
western diplomats who believe the soviets want to cover up he 
withdrawal for security and diplomatic reasons say the final stage 
of the twostage withdrawal started at the beginning of january 
under a unmandated agreement 50000 soviet troops left 
afghanistan by last aug 15 and the rest another 50000 are due 
to be gone by feb 15 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in dec 1979 to prop up 
the promarxist government

dozens of jewish settlers went on a rampage in a 
west bank village and smashed windows of arab houses after their bus 
was stoned and a passenger was struck in the eye by flying glass 
news reports said today 
residents of the village of bidya said the settlers from ariel 
18 miles north of jerusalem left behind handwritten leaflets in 
arabic calling on palestinians to stop the violence before its 
too late 
we will not sit quietly while you commit terror acts against 
us the leaflet said we are calling on you and stretching out 
our hand for peace for the sake of our children and yours 
palestinians have routinely attacked israeli civilian cars with 
rocks and firebombs during their 13month uprising at least 368 
palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed since the revolt 
against israeli occupation began on dec 8 1987 
also today a jerusalem court convicted four israeli journalists 
of membership in the banned democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine headed by palestinian radical nayef hawatmeh 
yakov and ronnie benefrat asaf adiv and michal shwartz of the 
marxist derech hanitzotz newspaper were sentenced to prison terms of 
up to 30 months authorities closed the paper last year 
the four struck a plea bargain confessing to membership in the 
democratic front in exchange for the courts dropping the more 
serious charges of contacts with foreign agents 
in other developments the army said it demolished or sealed the 
rooms of three suspected palestinian activists from the jabaliya 
refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip 
the army demolished the room of mohammed khader allegedly a 
member of a popular committee responsible for organizing 
antiisraeli protests khader was suspected of attacking fellow 
arabs seen as cooperating with israel 
two other rooms belonging to suspects in firebomb attacks were 
sealed military officials said the measure is a frequent 
punishment used by the army 
the army also sentenced a 30yearold reserve soldier to 18 days 
in military jail for refusing to serve in the occupied lands 
sgt arnon ronen was the 54th soldier sentenced to a jail term 
for such refusal since the uprising began although an estimated 500 
troops have requested and received transfers out of the territories 
without facing disciplinary action 
israel radio and the daily yediot ahronot newspaper said about 
100 settlers raided bidya late tuesday after a 16yearold girl from 
ariel was hit in the eye by broken glass when a passenger bus was 
stoned 
yediot said the settlers arrived in 50 cars parked them on the 
main village road leading to bidya and jammed traffic then marched 
into the village carrying israeli flags 
arab villagers hid inside their homes and the settlers smashed 
windows of houses until soldiers came and stopped them yediot said 
a military spokeswoman said she was checking the reports 
an arab reporter who spoke to bidya residents said the settlers 
distributed a leaflet calling on villagers to stop the violence 
we used to live together and we respected each other the 
leaflet said we are sorry to say the relations fell apart in 
recent months when individuals on your side started stoning cars 
and throwing firebombs at our women and children 
about 70000 settlers who live in the occupied lands amid 17 
million arabs have frequently blamed the army for being too soft on 
the palestinians and not putting an end to the rebellion

britains sending of representatives to emperor 
hirohitos funeral does not mean it has forgotten or forgiven 
the atrocities japan committed during world war ii foreign 
secretary sir geoffrey howe said 
the decision to send prince philip and himself to the feb 24 
funeral was made because japan now is an important democratic 
member of the free world howe said 
his comments were contained in a letter to labor party lawmaker 
jack ashley that was released today they are the governments most 
detailed response yet to widespread public criticism over british 
representation at the funeral of a man many veterans still consider 
a war criminal 
i am aware of the very strong feeling which has been expressed 
and i can assure you that britains representation at the funeral 
certainly does not mean that we have forgotten or forgiven the 
atrocities committed during the second world war howe wrote 
nothing can obliterate what happened then nor shall we ever 
forget the great debt we owe to those who fought and died in the far 
east and the terrible sufferings of so many in japanese prison 
camps the same is true of our allies many of whom are being 
represented at the funeral by heads of state or government 
president bush is among world leaders who plan to attend the 
funeral 
about 27000 british prisoners of war died at the hands of the 
japanese during world war ii many of them in the forced 
construction of the notorious burma railway 
a british war veterans group said today it appreciated howes 
remarks but still was dismayed that such a senior member of the 
royal family was attending the funeral 
harold payne president of the federation of far eastern 
prisoners of war associations said he feared that with all these 
high dignitaries going the japanese will assume they are being 
exonerated for all the dreadful things they did in the war 
howe said the allies decided at the end of the war in 1945 that 
hirohito should not be held responsible either for the war itself or 
for atrocities committed during the war they found no evidence 
linking him personally with political decisions taken by the 
japanese empire during that time he said 
indeed the one decision that the emperor clearly had taken 
himself was in august 1945 when the war cabinet was split on 
whether to continue the war howe said 
the government then for the first time turned to the emperor 
who decided that japan should surrender and that he should 
personally broadcast the news to the nation 
howe said the queen decided her husband the duke of edinburgh 
should represent her at the funeral after receiving advice from the 
government 
it her decision was taken in light of the fact that japan 
today is an important democratic member of the free world and an 
important partner of the united kingdom said howe who will 
represent prime minister margaret thatcher 
ashley said today that misguided ministerial advice to the duke 
will insult many exservicemen precisely because they cannot forgive 
or forget

serial killer ted bundy exchanged several 
letters with a religious broadcaster and antipornography crusader 
before they met for a videotaped interview hours before bundys 
execution an associate said 
james c dobson whose halfhour focus on the family program 
is heard daily on 1200 radio stations was the only member of the 
news media to interview bundy in the days leading up to the tuesday 
morning execution bundy canceled a press conference with 30 
journalists on monday 
during the interview bundy coolly traced his origins as a serial 
killer describing how boyhood glimpses of violent pornography 
became an addiction that grew until his destructive energy 
exploded from fantasy into reality 
there are loose in the towns and their communities people like 
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in day out 
by violence in the media particularly sexual violence bundy 
said 
dobson was an outspoken member of former attorney general edwin 
meese iiis federal commission on pornography and was a leader of 
the nationwide protest last summer against universal pictures the 
last temptation of christ 
dobson first received a letter from bundy in 1987 said paul 
hetrick a vice president of the californiabased focus on the 
family ministry the broadcaster then answered three or four more 
letters from bundy said hetrick 
bundy requested the interview with dobson through john tanner a 
newly elected state prosecutor in daytona beach who previously 
counseled bundy through a religious ministry at the florida state 
prison near starke 
hetrick would not reveal the content of the letters exchanged 
between bundy and dobson who met for a twohour private interview

hustler magazines sexually explicit 
caricatures lampooning an antipornography activist are protected by 
the constitution and cannot be considered libelous federal appeals 
court ruled 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on thursday unanimously 
rejected a libel suit filed against the magazine by the activist 
andrea dworkin 
the court said hustler was merely expressing an opinion 
dworkin a feminist writer was the author of an indianapolis 
ordinance which since has been declared unconstitutional that 
defined pornography as a violation of womens civil rights and 
allowed women to bring civil lawsuits 
like other critics of pornography she was lampooned in hustler 
a march 1984 issue included photographs of women engaged in 
lesbian sex or masturbation and included scenes of violence and 
fake blood a caption on one picture referred to the andrea 
dworkin fan club a december 1984 cartoon showed a fat woman 
having oral sex and identified the woman as dworkins mother 
dworkin errs by limiting opinion to highminded discourse 
the court said adding that outrageous and outlandish statements 
are sometimes protected 
ludicrous statements are much less insidious and debilitating 
than falsities that bear the ring of truth the court said 
speech may not be suppressed simply because it is offensive 
dworkins 150 million lawsuit was transferred from wyoming to 
los angeles at the magazines request and dismissed by us district 
judge a wallace tashima it was that ruling the appeals court 
upheld

officer and mutilating a college student was moved from his home for 
fear a list of his crimes sent anonymously to neighbors might spark 
violence officials said 
raymond louis george 36 was moved from his north hollywood 
apartment on tuesday he had lived there less than a week 
george was paroled jan 18 after nearly three years in prison for 
carrying a knife he previously served nine years for killing a 
police officer assaulting two others and attacking a 19yearold 
student with a machete in 1974 
this week copies of a police department internal memo listing 
georges crimes were mailed anonymously to neighbors 
we moved him because i was afraid there might be some sort 
of demonstration said jerry dimaggio regional administrator of 
the parole division of the california department of corrections 
george is a dangerous person and we didnt want him to go off 
if a confrontation occurred 
the location of his new home was not disclosed 
the memo detailed georges criminal history calling him a 
mentally ill man who believes his mission in life is to kill 
police officers and women an anonymous note accompanying the memo 
said he is a time bomb waiting to go off 
george takes medication for a psychiatric condition 
somehow the memo got passed around the community and it 
snowballed from there dimaggio said

investigation to determine who was responsible for its unauthorized 
release 
lawrence singleton convicted of raping a girl and hacking off 
her arms was paroled from a california prison in 1986 officials

ailing ferdinand marcos wants to open 
talks with us and filipino authorities on racketeering charges 
which may be a first step toward a pleabargain to allow him to 
return home officials said 
justice secretary sedfrey ordonez told reporters tuesday that he 
received a telephone call from us assistant attorney charles 
labella who has been gathering evidence against the deposed 
president 
ordonez said labella told him that marcos wanted to open talks on 
the october racketeering indictment in which he and his wife imelda 
are accused of embezzling more than 100 million during his 20year 
rule 
ordonez refused to spell out details of what marcos wanted to 
discuss other than to say it was limited to the us federal 
racketeering charge 
all that was impressed upon me was that marcos is 
determined to discuss with the american authorities and the 
philippine government ordonez said marcos and his wife have 
lived in hawaii since he was ousted in the 1986 militarycivilian 
revolt that propelled corazon aquino to power 
ordonez said the government wanted to make sure that any 
intermediaries were authorized to speak for marcos and his family 
my reply is we must first be sure that these persons are duly 
authorized to speak he said their plan is to have a spokesman 
for marcos spokesman for imelda and spokesman for the children 
he added 
in new york labella said marcos lawyers contacted him to relay 
an undisclosed message to the philippine government labella refused 
to disclose the contents and refused to describe the message as 
pleabargaining 
the philippine consulgeneral in honolulu tomas gomez said he 
was unaware of the messages from labella but gomez added if 
theyre really going through charles labella it sounds more like a 
pleabargain with the us government and if thats the case its 
a very delayed response 
presidential executive secretary catalino macaraig recently said 
the philippine government can no longer decide whether marcos can 
return home because marcos is under criminal indictment in the 
united states 
the philippine government claims marcos and his associates 
embezzled up to 10 billion before his ouster mrs aquino has 
repeatedly refused to allow marcos to return from exile in hawaii 
citing national security 
she has also said marcos must return all the money he allegedly 
stole before there could any discussions on conditions for his 
return 
marcos was hospitalized jan 15 in hawaii suffering from 
pneumonia and bronchial asthma he was hospitalized twice last month 
for treatment of congestive heart failure 
in honolulu a hospital spokeswoman said marcos condition was 
upgraded to satisfactory and he was removed from a respirator

officials said today the death toll from 
an earthquake and mudslide in soviet central asia was only about a 
quarter of the 1000 originally estimated and they called off 
efforts to find more survivors 
we will transform the settlement of sharora into a common grave 
with a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe 
said khusain kasymov communist party chief in the tadzhikistan 
republics stricken gissar region 
he said there was no hope of finding more survivors in sharora 
where 52 homes were buried and 100 bodies were hauled from the mud 
and debris 
the republics prime minister izzatullo khayoyev said 274 
people were known to have died in mondays predawn quake which 
toppled all 88 mudbrick dwellings in okulibolo and sent mudslides 
as high as 50 feet onto the villages of sharora and okulipoyen 
there may be a difference of five or seven people in the 
casualties but no more khayoyev said in an interview on a grassy 
hill overlooking okulibolo 20 miles southwest of the capital 
dushanbe 
the official tass news agency earlier made a preliminary estimate 
that up to 1000 people died in the quake and mudslide officials on 
the scene did not explain the discrepancy in figures 
a day of mourning was declared in tadzhikistan which borders 
china and afghanistan all flags were at halfstaff plays and 
concerts were canceled and restaurants were closed 
the bitter truth is that nobody can be rescued from under a 
landslide provoked by the earthquake tass said 
but there were stories of miraculous survival 
kholmurod barotov 17 of sharora said his 6dayold cousin 
survived the quake held above the torrent of mud by her father who 
perished 
one man 27yearold sergei muratov was found alive buried in 
the mud the prime minister said tass said muratov was in grave 
condition at a dushanbe hospital 
the agency said sharora the largest of the stricken villages 
would be rebuilt near its former site and that construction would 
begin in several days 
the 40second tremor which measured 54 on the richter scale 
hit before dawn monday loosening layers of mud that cascaded onto 
the rural villages 
last month a quake registering 69 on the richter scale killed 
about 25000 people in soviet armenia 
workers using shovels and bulldozers dug for survivors tuesday 
but local officials said today the efforts were in vain 
vitaly zhukov who works at the republics official news agency 
and is chief of a press information center set up in the wake of the 
tragedy said no survivors were found tuesday 
tadzhikistan officials said there would be no attempt to dig out 
the bodies of victims unlike the efforts that lasted for weeks 
after the armenian quake 
moslem law the shariah says that people buried alive must be 
left there khayoyev said most of tadzhikistans 48 million 
people are moslem 
he said relatives of those killed in sharora voted tuesday to 
fence off the settlement and transform it into a common graveyard 
but other officials said two families had objected and when 
foreign journalists visited the site today residents and police 
were digging with shovels in at least two places 
zhukov said the republic would need about 400 prefabricated 
houses for survivors in the stricken villages 
tass said the soviet red cross sent a planeload of relief 
supplies to the region and that the armenian red cross announced it 
would send a rescue team to tadzhikistan 
a special bank account was set up in moscow to accept 
contributions to aid victims 
the communist party daily newspaper pravda on tuesday said much 
of the mud was carried to the villages by an earthen canal saturated 
by melting snow in the babatag hills overlooking the buried towns 
when the quake hit it moved in a huge mass onto the 
villages pravda said there is a danger of new mudslides in 
similar places in the event of a new natural blow

gov george deukmejians administration 
is postponing until the mid1990s the sale of more than 4 billion 
in bonds because the state cant afford the principal and interest 
an aide says 
the bonds would have provided financing for school construction 
earthquake safety the homeless safe drinking water and juvenile 
halls 
the decision to delay the bond sales helped deukmejian balance 
his 478 billion 198990 budget proposal while rebuilding the 
emergency reserve to 11 billion said stan stancell his assistant 
finance director 
the postponement permits a delay in budgeting tens of millions of 
dollars for repayment which must begin almost as soon as bonds are 
sold 
failure to budget repayment could raise big questions on wall 
street that could weaken the states credit rating stancell said 
i dont think it would be prudent to sell bonds without 
showing how we are going to pay for them he said 
stancell said the administration could change its decision if 
revenues improve enough

two shiite moslem militias battled with 
mortars and machine guns in south lebanon today several hours after 
negotiators for both sides reached a ceasefire accord in syria 
police said at least five fighters were injured in the onehour 
battle between the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and 
the prosyrian amal militia in south lebanons apple province 
a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
fighting broke out between hezbollah positions in the villages of 
jbaa and ein bouswar and amal fighters in the hamlets of kfar filla 
and jarjou 
jbaa is the key to a triangularshaped enclave controlled by 
about 500 hezbollah fighters on the western edge of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in south lebanon 
earlier in the day the syrian foreign ministry issued a 
statement in damascus saying the shiite factions had agreed to an 
immediate ceasefire following three days of mediation by syria and 
iran 
it said the militias would continue negotiations aimed at 
reaching a comprehensive reconciliation agreement to regulate the 
relationship between amal and hezbollah and deal with the reasons 
for tension for the sake of lebanons unity and its liberation from 
israeli occupation 
the factions have been fighting on and off for nine months in a 
struggle for control of lebanons 1 million shiites the countrys 
largest sect 
more than 500 people have been killed and 1500 wounded in a 
series of battles that began in april several earlier ceasefires 
collapsed under the deeprooted hostility between the rival militias 
the israelis and their militia allies control a security zone 
israel maintains north of its border with lebanon the zone was 
created in 1985 as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla attacks 
the shiite battles have strained the strategic alliance between 
iran and syria tehrans main arab ally during its eightyear war 
with iraq and both sides have sought to quell the fighting 
hezbollah seeks to create an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
lebanon the more secular and nationalist amal seeks a multisect 
government in which moslems would share power equally with the once 
dominant christians 
hezbollah advocates guerrilla attacks on israel in a moslem 
campaign to liberate jerusalem amal seeks only to drive the 
israelis out of the border strip and wants to curb hezbollahs raids 
because they provoke israeli retaliation

leftist guerrillas are likely to 
be politically strengthened by their startling offer to take part in 
elections whether the proposal prospers or dies on the vine 
even government officials grudgingly admit the insurgents will 
probably be bolstered by the surprise proposal made tuesday 
one highranking cabinet official likened the guerrillas offer 
to a bomb and complimented the rebels on devising such a powerful 
weapon 
it is very ably constructed you have to take it apart very 
carefully and examine all the component parts in trying to 
deactivate it he said of the rebels radical policy shift 
the cabinet official spoke on condition of anonymity because the 
government has not formally responded to the rebel proposal the 
united states also has not responded 
fidel chavez mena the incumbent christian democrats 
presidential candidate in this years election said tuesday that 
the rebels main condition for participating in the vote could not 
be met 
the guerrillas said elections set for march 19 should be 
postponed until september but the constitution prohibits such a 
postponement 
the proposal from the farabundo marti national liberation front 
can be taken at face value or it can be examined for possible 
ulterior motives 
a nineyearold civil war has devastated this massachusettssized 
nation killing 65000 of its people making refugees of a million 
and ruining the economy 
the guerrillas who have called previous elections this decade 
farce and part of a counterinsurgency plan may simply want to 
end the war 
the country is headed for a social explosion we feel a 
responsbility to explore possible alternatives we are being 
responsible and flexible ana guadalupe martinez a member of the 
guerrilla general command told a news conference tuesday in mexico 
city 
flexibility is a sign of strength said salvador samayoa a 
member of the guerrillas politicaldiplomatic committee 
the rebel documents authors said their offer was partially 
motivated by an international situation in which the majority of 
wars are being resolved by means of negotiation 
negotiations have recently produced agreements to seek an end 
conflicts in afghanistan and angola among other countries the 
contra insurgency in nicaragua has also been quieted by a 
preliminary ceasefire agreement 
a rebel source in mexico said there is a wave of negotiations 
in the world we want to look for a solution that is not so drastic 
as war so the countrys fall wont be so drastic 
the guerrillas dont just want to end the war they presumably 
want to win it their proposal especially if rejected could 
improve their standing 
reporters who recently spent time with guerrillas in the hills of 
chalatenango and morazan provinces both rebel strongholds heard 
leaders talk of preparations for a big push in coming weeks 
the insurgents launched two nationwide offensives late last year 
during the past three months they have hit four major military 
installations in the capital bringing a predominantly rural war to 
the city 
the guerrillas appear heady and sources close to them confirmed 
that attacks will increase if the proposal gets nowhere 
if the rebels do step up their attacks they likely will point to 
rejection of their election overture as a spurning that left them no 
alternative but to escalate warfare against an intransigent regime 
most military observers say the 7000 rebels have little chance 
of defeating the 56000man army the rebels say they are organizing 
rural and urban sympathizers and that the moment for mass 
insurrection is not far off 
the rebel proposal appeared to have been directed as much at us 
politicians as the guerrillas countrymen 
copies of the proposal were circulating in washington on sunday 
24 hours before being leaked to the press in san salvador 
the two administrations of ronald reagan gave more than 3 
billion in aid to el salvador with the stated object of fostering 
democracy the country has had a civilian president jose napoleon 
duarte since 1984 but leftists claim his administration is a 
facade for continued military power 
we hear they in the bush administration are more practical 
and less ideological samayoa told the mexico news conference 
we hope for a departure from the policy of the administration of 
ronald reagan which blocked peace efforts in central america 
the rebels enjoy significant support from socalled 
solidarity groups in the united states that have proven 
effective lobbyists in the past 
however their proposal is received the rebels will not lose 
their current supporters if it is rejected they could use alleged 
government inflexibility as a recruitment tool if it is accepted 
with modifications they and their political allies could increase 
their base through campaigning 
the document was drafted with great skill said the 
government official if they shot as well as they write they 
would have routed us by now

a man whose girlfriend had broken up 
with him fatally shot one of her friends at the mushroom farm where 
he worked then killed himself outside a school as police closed in 
authorities said 
the gunman ignacio vasquez segura 25 of watsonville also 
seriously wounded two coworkers tuesday at the farm 80 miles south 
of san francisco 
his former girlfriend francisca partido was not at work when 
segura wearing sunglasses and carrying a semiautomatic rifle 
walked into a packing shed 
the 50 workers inside scattered when segura asked for one woman 
by name shot her then sprayed the inside of the building with 
gunfire said francisca gabriella geisler a lab technician who was 
working in the shed 
everybody was going crazy i saw them screaming and trying to 
hide she said 
a 26yearold woman was killed in the first burst of gunfire 
said sheriffs investigator bob reneau her identity was not 
immediately released 
geisler said the woman had tried to help seguras former 
girlfriend since the couple split up three months ago 
the wounded workers were listed in stable condition today at 
watsonville community hospital 
segura who was carrying three clips of ammunition fired about 
12 shots then fled in a sports car and stopped several miles away 
near north monterey county high school with a california highway 
patrol vehicle behind him authorities said 
he shot himself in the head before backup officers arrived 
moments later authorities said reneau said segura revved his 
engine to full acceleration muffling the shot 
the school had been alerted to the shootings and chase and 
principal dennis carocci ordered students to remain in their 
classrooms he said he closed the gate to the school as segura drove 
up 
seguras arrival at the school prompted fear of an incident 
similar to the slayings last week of five youngsters in a stockton 
schoolyard 
the high school received about 60 calls immediately after the 
incident from concerned parents carocci said

south africans at a conference in october in west germany attended 
by soviet officials and anc leaders including slovo 
slovo and virtually all other anc leaders cannot be quoted

pressure to get an agreement on a federal 
budget is very strong the house democratic leader said today 
because nobody wants to see an acrosstheboard cut in federal 
programs 
we have a target pretty much of a budget resolution by about 
the 15th of april rep tom foley dwash house majority leader 
said on the cbs this morning television program 
nine months from now we run into the grammrudmanhollings 
deficitreduction deadlines that means youre going to have an 
acrosstheboard cut in both defense and domestic accounts unless 
theyre exempt accounts which will take care of the budget deficit 
targets if we dont have a budget plan thats agreed on between the 
house and the senate and the administration he said 
that sort of pressure to get an agreement is very strong 
because no one wants to see an acrosstheboard cut foley 
said 
president bush met tuesday with foley and other congressional 
leaders to set the stage for this years budget work he plans to 
speak about his administrations priorities in an address to 
congress on feb 9 and then detail his budget proposals soon 
thereafter 
rep robert michel rill the house minority leader said he 
hoped the time frame would be telescoped to considerably less than 
nine months 
wed like to do as we did last year get our appropriations 
bills out on time that means that the budget resolution and its 
allocations ought to be done just as quickly and speedily as 
possible he said 
foley said he wants to see the specifics of bushs budget before 
making any decision on a budget summit 
we havent decided on a precise formula or process yet but we 
are listening to the presidents suggestions and we are promising to 
get back to him after we hear the specifics of his budget he said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas made a point tuesday of 
emphasizing there would be consultations not negotiations 
wed like to wait and until we see a budget until we see where 
the areas of agreement and disagreement would be before we 
consult wright said 
wright presented bush a jar of pork rinds and some hot pepper 
sauce one of the presidents favorite snacks 
there is a good atmosphere said george mitchell dmaine 
the senate majority leader 
the presidents choice for budget director richard darman 
suggested weekly meetings between the white house and selected 
leaders from congress in order to expedite the budget process 
but while lawmakers said theyd be glad to meet and would work 
to keep the process running on time none was ready to put a new 
team of negotiators above the committees already charged with 
working out spending plans 
the presidents team will be welcomed as soon as they want to 
come by our budget committees wright said 
it would be to our advantage to have the leadership meet in an 
informal sort of way from time to time moving the process along 
said michel he did not support bypassing the current process he 
said 
although there is precedent for a budget summit one 
occurred in late 1987 after the stock market crisis it is 
unpopular on capitol hill because it cuts most lawmakers out of the 
process in addition cautious congressional leaders do not want to 
be wedded in any way to the bush budget proposals until they are 
made public 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the president needed first to send up his budget and 
then begin discussions without setting up a new framework 
while a summit can serve a function it also carries the risk 
of leaving the rest of congress behind and alienating the votes 
needed to enact the results he said 
you could cut a deal at a high level only to find out that 
members arent going to be with you when it comes to a vote he 
said a worse thing than failing to get an agreement is getting an 
agreement that fails

government leaders today advised 
president roh taewoo to accept opposition demands for a referendum 
on whether voters support him officials said 
at a meeting leaders of the governing democratic justice party 
told roh voters should have the chance to assess his performance 
said party officials 
they said roh called the meeting to deal with opposition 
allegations he was trying to avoid the referendum 
on tuesday kim daejung and other opposition party leaders 
agreed to push for the referendum before he was elected in december 
1987 roh promised he would hold such a referendum after taking 
office but he set no date 
government party leaders lack broad public support but have said 
roh is confident of victory 
some opposition leaders contend roh would have to resign if he 
lost a referendum roh has only said he would accept 
responsibility if defeated

february but the opposition accuses him of being reluctant to take 
firm action to deal with past government abuses 
opposition leaders have demanded the government punish officials 
involved in corruption and other abuses under the authoritarian 
government of former president chun doohwan 
chun went into rural exile in november after making a public 
apology for misdeeds under his administration and roh has asked the 
nation to pardon him 
in a related development today prosecutors questioned three chun 
loyalists including the former government security head chang 
sedong on charges of abusing power under the old government 
chang played a key role in helping chun seize power in a coup in

for clarification of murder laws indicating they might be torn over 
his guilt or innocence in the death of his illegally adopted 
daughter an attorney said

optimistic defense attorney ira london said tuesday 
the jury returned today for a third day of deliberations

the child was removed comatose from steinbergs greenwich village 
apartment in 1987 and died at a hospital three days later of a brain 
injury 
lisas death in an affluent welleducated househould attracted 
wide attention and raised questions about the duty and ability of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse

the prosecutions star witness that steinberg told her in bed after 
they used cocaine and while lisa lay comatose on their bathroom 
floor that he had knocked lisa down and she didnt want to get

child in a jealous rage

a national meat trade association is urging the 
agriculture department to withdraw a proposal for overhauling 
federal inspection at meat and poultry processing plants 
usda made the proposal last november to carry out a 1986 law that 
would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesome processing 
plants but ease up on those with good records 
over time officials estimated the usda inspection force at the 
affected plants would be reduced by half by retirements and 
resignations the program would rely increasingly on good plants 
policing themselves 
department officials said the proposed rule changes would 
strengthen inspection in the 6300 plants that process meat and 
poultry by focusing on those that need it most 
but the american meat institute in comments filed with usda last 
week said the plan has serious problems and should be withdrawn and 
then developed more carefully 
the group said the proposal is overly complex cumbersome and 
burdensome to the regulated industry 
manly molpus institute president said the industry organization 
has supported and continues to support the fundamental thrust of 
the changes envisoned in the law but that there is clearly a 
need to rethink the proposal 
the usda period for public comments on the proposal runs through 
feb 2 molpus said the industry doesnt go along with the notion 
that a rule should be finalized hastily in the face of so many 
unanswered and unresolved questions 
as proposed the new rule would apply to plants that make 
frankfurters beef stew chicken soup luncheon meats and scores of 
other processed items that include meat and poultry the proposed 
rule would not apply to slaughter plants which would remain under 
continuous federal inspection

a former diplomat testified that he was 
told the person behind the 1976 assassination of dissident orlando 
letelier is a former government official sought by the united states 
in the case 
former envoy jose miguel barros in testimony before a local 
judge said the mastermind was identified to him as gen manuel 
contreras sepulveda former head of the nations secret police 
the us justice department for years has been seeking the 
extradition of contreras and his top aid col pedro espinoza on 
charges of ordering the assassination of letelier and an american 
aide ronnie moffitt 
the two were killed sept 21 1976 when a remotecontrol bomb 
blew up their car in washington dc 
barros was one of seven former officials questioned last week at 
the request of the us justice department 
local newspapers carried the testimony in todays editions and 
barros confirmed the accounts in an interview with the associated 
press 
barros told judge julio banados that air force gen enrique 
montero told him during a meeting in the late 1970s that this 
genius of intelligence mounted an operation to assassinate 
letelier 
barros said montero who was then undersecretary of the interior 
ministry told him he was referring to contreras 
at the time of the killing contreras was chief of a feared 
secret police agency the national intelligence directorate 
barros said that according to his information military president 
augusto pinochet was not aware of the assassination plot barros 
testified he was told by another participant in the meeting former 
foreign minister miguel schweitzer that pinochet was not aware of 
the alleged plot 
schweitzer said pinochet asked contreras three times privately 
and two more times in front of witnesses whether he had something to 
do with the letelier case and contreras said no barros testified 
pinochet later ordered administrative sanctions against contreras 
for lying to the president barros said 
letelier was a former cabinet minister and us ambassador for 
the leftist government toppled by pinochet in a bloody 1973 coup he 
was among pinochets most influential critics abroad 
the chilean supreme court rejected the us extradition request 
in 1979 saying there was insufficient evidence that contreras and 
espinoza were involved in the assassination 
an american who worked for contreras agency michael townley 
confessed in a pleabargain in washington to planting the bomb on 
the order of superiors 
army maj armando fernandez larios fled chile in 1987 and 
surrendered to us authorities he confessed to being an accomplice 
to the killing and implicated contreras and espinoza both now 
retired 
the us government has accused chile of not cooperating in the 
case and earlier this month invoked a 1914 bilateral treaty that 
calls for international arbitration of disputes that cannot be 
resolved by other means 
foreign minister hernan errazuriz tuesday criticized the move 
we energetically reject the implicit pressure in an affair that we 
are handling seriously and professionally he said 
the government had not decided how to respond to the move he 
said 
under the terms of the 1914 treaty the dispute would be handed 
over to a commission associated with the international court of the 
hague netherlands

leopold gratz the president of parliament 
and one of the most powerful politicians in the socialist party 
resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of 
ship 12 years ago 
gratz 59 is the second senior socialist official to step down 
because of his alleged involvement in the socalled lucona 
scandal the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a 
parliamentary committee 
interior minister karl blecha like gratz a onetime protege of 
former chancellor bruno kreisky resigned jan19 
blecha and gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding udo proksch 
the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship lucona in the indian 
ocean six sailors died 
the luconas cargo was officially described by proksch as for a 
uranium processing plant and insured for 16 million 
the insurance company has never paid claiming the cargo was only 
scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to 
collect the insurance money 
proksch wanted by austrian justice on suspicion of murder and 
insurance fraud has been variously described to be living in syria 
the philippines and latin america 
in several interviews gratz described himself as a close friend 
of proksch but when proksch fled to escape prosecution gratz 
criticized him 
gratz told parliament today he would give up his seat in 
february hence his post as president one of the most prestigious 
posts in austria 
my decision is a personal one and it is politically 
motivated gratz told the house 
if it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take 
a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of 
parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context 
in a single other topic then he cannot serve the national council 
parliament in such a way as is his duty in past newspaper 
stories gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from 
abroad to help proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment 
was for a uranium processing plant 
gratz who denied the allegations was also accused of helping 
proksch in several other ways like blecha gratz is to appear

cambodian premier hun sen today rejected 
the idea of an international peacekeeping force in his country 
saying cambodia can help itself as vietnamese forces withdraw 
also today chinas official xinhua news agency said cambodian 
guerrillas had demanded vietnam produce a timetable for its pullout 
from cambodia 
xinhua quoted the guerrillas radio democratic kampuchea as 
saying vietnams withdrawal should take place according to a 
publicized timetable with international supervision 
the guerrillas main international sponsor china has made 
similar demands vietnam has promised to withdraw all its troops by 
september 1989 but it has not given a timetable to show how the 
withdrawal will proceed 
vietnams embassy in beijing said vietnamese and chinese 
officials reached some agreements during talks last week but it did 
not say if those included an agreement on a timetable 
hun sen made his comments before meeting with thai leaders 
including prime minister chatichai choonhavan foreign minister 
siddhi savetsila and army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh 
a thai government spokesman suvit yodmani said the talks were a 
frank discussion but stressed they did not constitute thai 
recognition of the prohanoi government in cambodia 
chatichai just wants to get to know hun sen because hun sen 
later on most likely will be involved in a coalition government 
hopefully when there is peace in cambodia suvit told reporters 
he said both sides agreed that warring cambodian factions all 
must attend peace talks on cambodia next month in indonesia 
thailand has shunned the phnom penh government since its creation 
10 years ago following the vietnamese invasion of cambodia it has 
backed a threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting vietnamese and 
phnom penh troops in cambodia 
the international peacekeeping force was part of a peace proposal 
by prince norodom sihanouk leader of the guerrilla coalition 
i think kampuchea cambodia does not need an international 
peacekeeping force because cambodia can help itself but other 
countries must help end all military aid to khmer rouge leader pol 
pot and to the resistance hun sen told reporters 
he said sihanouks proposal would lead to the return to power of 
the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
during its 197578 rule the khmer rouge is one of the parties in 
the guerrilla coalition 
stepped up initiatives on cambodia have come as vietnamese forces 
withdraw from the country raising fears the powerful khmer rouge 
could regain power 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in late 1978 to drive the 
prochinese khmer rouge from power claims it now has about 50000 
troops in cambodia and has set september 1989 as a target date for 
pulling out all its forces 
this month in beijiing chinese and vietnamese leaders began 
talks on the cambodian conflict in the first facetoface meeting of 
highlevel officials from the two countries in more than nine years 
hun sen also said today he was ready to discuss with the united 
states the issue of americans missing in action in the indochina war 
and said the discussions could take place in bangkok 
the united states which lists 83 americans as mia in cambodia 
does not recognize the hun sen government 
washington has enjoyed cooperation from vietnam and laos in the 
effort to resolve the fates of americans missing in the war but 
there have been no known official contacts on the issue with phnom 
penh

hours before his execution ted bundy coolly 
traced his origins as a serial killer describing how boyhood 
glimpses of violent pornography became an addiction that grew 
until fantasy exploded into reality 
the 42yearold law school dropout whose bizarre mixture of 
intelligence charm and homicidal bloodlust was the subject of five 
books and a tv movie also warned before his execution tuesday that 
there were others like himself 
there are loose in the towns and their communities people like 
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in day out 
by violence in the media particularly sexual violence bundy 
said in a videotaped interview monday 
bundy who after a decade of denial confessed to murdering at 
least 23 young women since the mid1970s said he deserved his 
punishment his execution in the electric chair at florida state 
prison elicited cheers from more than 100 people who stood in a 
field across from the penitentiary 
i dont want to die im not going to kid you but i 
deserve certainly the most extreme punishment society has i think 
society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me 
bundy said in the interview with james dobson a religious 
broadcaster and psychologist 
he said between sobs he hoped the interview would spur society to 
protect itself from the widespread influence of pornography tv 
violence xrated movies 
although he said he felt remorse for the sexrelated murders 
which authorities believes could total 50 or more nationwide bundy 
said there is no way in the world that killing me is going to 
restore those beautiful children to their parents 
detectives in washington idaho colorado and utah have said in 
the past week that bundy has confessed to 23 killings there but that 
he did not provide names for all of the victims but an fbi agent 
gave a higher number in a story published today 
the miami herald reported that fbi agent bill hagmeier told 
florida prosecutor jerry blair that bundys confessions closed the 
books on 13 killings in washington utah and colorado provided 
information that may never be confirmed on 14 more cases in 
washington utah idaho california vermont and pennsylvania and 
touched on at least 20 more slayings in various states dating back 
to 1969 
added to the three florida killings of which bundy was convicted 
this would put the number of victims to bundy to at least 50 all 
girls or young women 
hagmeier a specialist on serial killers who interviewed bundy 
last weekend could not immediately be reached for comment today he 
checked out of his starke motel this morning to return to his 
virginia headquarters 
but blair confirmed today that hagmeier had given him those rough 
figures 
including the florida killings blair said there were 30 
based on bundys statements that he appeared to be clearly linked 
and perhaps up to another 20 where he was a suspect or a 
probable i think is the terminology he used 
i dont know that its far off from the figures everybody has 
bandied about anyway blair said today those are the figures 
ive heard for many years i dont think well ever know exactly how 
many 
handcuffed and sitting at a table across from dobson bundy 
alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29minute interview he was 
dressed in the peachcolored shortsleeved shirt worn by death row 
inmates 
he appeared to ponder each question carefully sometimes pausing 
at length before answering articulately 
dobson who has a daily radio program heard on 1200 radio 
stations asked about the rape and murder of 12yearold kimberly 
leach for which bundy was executed 
what did you feel after that dobson asked 
bundy held his hands to his face closed his eyes and thought for 
a long time before responding i cant talk about that right now 
its too painful i cant begin to understand the pain that 
the parents of these children felt 
i dont ask them to forgive me im not asking for it that 
kind of forgiveness is of god 
prodded by dobson to explore the sources of his violence bundy 
said that during his murder rampages the unique thing about how 
this worked is i still felt in my regular life the full range of 
guilt and remorse about other things 
but the murders he said were compartmentalized in his 
brain a very well focused very sharply focused area that was a 
black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that 
crack hole just disappeared 
he emphasized he didnt blame pornography for his actions and 
took full responsibility but he said hardcore pornography fueled 
by alcohol guided and shaped what he did 
i have lived in prison for a long time now and ive met a lot 
of men who were motivated to violence just like me and without 
exception every one of them was deeply involved in pornography 
he said 
claiming he was essentially a normal person who grew up in a 
good home bundy said 
people need to recognize those of us who are or who have 
been so much influenced by violence in the media in particular 
pornographic violence are not some kind of inherent monsters we 
are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular 
families and pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any 
house today 
but dr dorothy otnow lewis a psychiatrist who examined bundy as 
part of a lastditch attempt to save him from execution said 
bundys first home was that of his maternal grandparents with a 
grandfather who was an extremely violent and frightening 
individual the grandfather would kick dogs swing cats by their 
tails beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously 
the new haven conn psychiatrist said 
lewis said a cousin told her that when bundy was a preschooler in 
the home in philadelphia he used to sneak into a greenhouse where 
his grandfathers pornography was kept and read it 
in the interview bundy said his desire to murder happened in 
stages gradually once you become addicted to pornography 
and i look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of 
addiction i would keep looking for more potent more explicit more 
graphic kinds of material 
you keep craving something that is harder harder something 
which which gives you a greater sense of excitement until you 
reach a point where the pornography only goes so far you reach that 
jumpingoff point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing 
it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at 
it 
in the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process then at 
a certain time it is instrumental i would say crystallizing 
making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside 
a building up of this destructive energy 
after committing his first murder bundy said he was 
absolutely horrified that i was capable of doing something like 
that 
it was like coming out of some horrible trance bundy said 
it was like being possessed by something so awful so alien 
but then the impulse to do it again would come back even 
stronger 
gene williams owner of the williamsthomas funeral home said he 
accepted custody of the body but no funeral was planned he would 
not give any details on arrangements including whether there would 
be burial or cremation

secretary of state george p shultz before 
leaving office suggested the bush administration consider easing 
trade controls on the soviet union if it meets the feb 15 deadline 
for withdrawing all troops from afghanistan a us official said 
today 
shultz who stepped down last week to be succeeded by james a 
baker iii made the suggestion in a letter to defense secretary 
frank c carlucci who also resigned with the advent of the bush 
administration 
carlucci in a reply letter to shultz did not commit himself to 
a position to be passed on to his designated successor john g 
tower and suggested the trade issue be handled without a 
recommendation by the new administration the official said 
the allies are interested in easing the sanctions but i do not 
know if its a top agenda item for the bush administration said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the soviet union moved its troops into afghanistan in december 
1979 to support a marxist government in kabul against usarmed 
rebels in 1980 in a punitive gesture the carter administration 
imposed a ban on trade in sensitive equipment with moscow 
even if the restrictions were removed there still would be 
barriers to providing american military technology or equipment to 
the soviet union 
shultz who supported ussoviet reconciliation did not insist 
on lifting the sanctions but simply suggested such a step be 
considered if the feb 15 deadline was met the official said 
at the same time shultz has favored continuing us arms support 
to the afghan rebels if the soviets kept arming the kabul government 
shultzs position on the sanctions was this is something that 
should be discussed the official said but there are always 
people in the government who will tell you that sanctions should not 
be taken off

congressional democrats kicked off a major 
legislative push today for a program of voluntary national service 
that would link federal education job training and housing benefits 
to civilian or military service 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and the prime sponsor of the legislation in the senate 
said the program is very much in line with president bushs call 
in his inaugural address for more civic responsibility and less 
emphaiss on selfish interest 
nunn said he hopes the national service proposal will awaken a 
new spirit of citizenship and civic obligation in america by 
energizing young people to attack the nations social needs while 
earning education or housing benefits 
this is not a guaranteed benefit he said this is a 
guaranteed opportunity to earn a benefit 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said in a 
statement that the introduction of the legislative proposal moves 
the topic of national service to the front for consideration by 
the 101st congress 
under the program which would be phased in over five years 
beginning in 1990 young volunteers in the citizens corps would 
get a 10000 voucher for each year of civilian service or a 
12000 voucher for each year of military service the civilian 
volunteers would be paid subsistence wages of 100 per week plus 
health insurance during their period of service 
the vouchers could be used to finance a college education to pay 
for vocational or job training or as a downpayment on a new home 
after the fiveyear phase in period the vouchers would replace most 
federal student loans and grants although such aid still would be 
available for those not qualified for the national service program 
charles c moskos jr a northwestern university professor who 
developed much of the legislative proposal said the program 
eventually could cost the federal government 5 billion a year 
based on an estimated 500000 to 600000 civilian volunteers and 
400000 military recruits 
but moskos said much of that cost would be offset by the 
elimination of federal student loans and grants and by the reduction 
in federal costs for meeting many of the social needs such as 
providing nursing home care to the elderly that would be handled by 
the young volunteers 
the legislation which was introduced in the house by rep dave 
mccurdy dokla specifies that administration of the program would 
be handled primarily on the local and state level

michael reagan the son of the former 
president has admitted he left a profanitylaced threatening 
message on the answering machine of a photographer suing him over 
the publication of two pictures 
photographer roger sandler has filed a complaint against reagan 
over the jan 15 phone call 
police lt mike farrell said he spoke with reagan on tuesday and 
was preparing a report for the district attorneys office for 
possible prosecution 
sandler said a caller identifying himself as michael reagan said 
you can quote me then launched into a tirade that threatened 
physical harm against sandler and ended with the words i hope 
your family dies in a plane crash with you in it 
the call was made after reagan received a subpoena from sandler 
for a small claims action in which the photographer is seeking 
1500 for copyright infringement over the use of two pictures in 
reagans 1988 book on the outside looking in 
sandler said the pictures were not authorized and uncredited 
reagan said in a statement tuesday i regret that he was 
uncredited but contended that sandler has been continually 
raising his prices for the photos 
i lost my cool which i should not have done and i apologize 
for that reagan said but i actually apologize more to my 
friends and my family for this kind of behavior which is caused by 
the pressures placed on me because of my position 
sandler said he wouldnt drop the police complaint 
he seems to act erratically and it seems that he has a violent 
temper said sandler 
under california law it is a misdemeanor to call another 
individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or threaten 
to inflict injury the maximum punishment is six months in jail and 
a 1000 fine

ways and means committee has just returned to washington from balmy 
palm springs calif where he delivered speeches to a variety of 
lobbyists for the tobacco outdoor advertising and public power 
industries 
rostenkowskis reward up to 2000 per speech plus all expenses 
for himself and his wife laverne mind you this warm weather 
sojourn for rostenkowski was 100 percent legal 
nor was it unique most of his colleagues in congress accept 
similar speaking fees or honoraria as well as firstclass airline 
tickets and free hotel stays at exotic vacation spots from 
lobbyists with an interest in pending legislation 
the lawmakers who accept this kind of hospitality protest of 
course that their votes cant be bought 
perhaps not 
but if americans are to have any faith and trust in those they 
elect to congress then those individuals must be above suspicion 
thats clearly not the case as long as the honoraria gravy train

as part of the congressional pay increase deal the quadrennial 
commission recommended a ban on honoraria 
honoraria critics say are legalized bribing by special 
interest groups or individuals 
in our opinion honoraria do not necessarily need to be banned 
although the salary hike should be banned honoraria should 
however be strictly regulated if honoraria remain legal we 
suggest 
lawmakers should be allowed to accept honoraria only when 
congress is not in session 
reporting guidelines for honoraria must be reviewed to make sure 
there is strict accounting by members of congress and 
charities receiving lawmakers honoraria should be carefully 
governed

charming villain fagin sings im reviewing the situation 
and after considering the possible consequences concludes i 
think id better think it out again 
this would be a good approach for the bush administration to take 
toward the us policy of pressing for vietnamese withdrawal from 
cambodia 
an oversimplified foreign policy would call for all communist 
forces to withdraw from countries where they dont belong 
what we may not have thought through is the new agony which may 
be imposed on the cambodians if the vietnamese withdraw 
our long war in vietnam conditioned us to consider that countrys 
communist regime the worst of all possible alternatives but a good 
case can be made for the proposition that the cambodians were 
considerably worse off under the bloody khmer rouge regime 197579 
than they have since been under vietnamese occupation 
george bush and his adviser would do well to think it out again

corpus christi texas callertimes on gun control 
few crimes more tragically illustrate the lunacy of this nations 
gun fetish than the slayings of those five schoolchildren in 
california by a misfit wagging an ak47 assault rifle 
such weapons are built for one purpose to kill as many as 
quickly as possible 
yet they are readily available for sale and the national rifle 
association irrationally opposes any restrictions on selling such 
killer semiautomatic weapons 
the gun lobby which has such success in convincing congress the 
nation should be awash in weapons might find it beyond its 
persuasive powers to explain to the parents of those five children 
why they had to be put in jeopardy so bubba could blast away at beer 
cans at a 40roundsperminute or greater clip

the flint mich journal on gun control 
our guncrazed society has claimed five more victims five more 
innocent lives five more children 
the violent gutwrenching purposeless plot seems always the 
same a maniac with a gun goes berserk and opens fire on 
unsuspecting and innocent victims 
sometimes its in a restaurant sometimes its on the freeway on 
jan 17 it happened to take place at a california elementary 
school during recess 
we all share the blame some of us more than others but none of 
us more than the national rifle association the nra has 
consistently and effectively thwarted or resisted every attempt to 
enact even the barest restraints on gun ownership 
and the nra skilled in guerrilla intimidation has done so by 
transforming state and federal politicians into spineless jellyfish 
while most of the rest of us just stand by counting victims in 
massacre stories 
we urge each and every one of you to call andor write our 
lawmakers and demand that they put an end to this senseless violence 
insist at the very least on a sevenday waiting period before 
guns are sold demand tough screening procedures require a ban of 
such killing machines as the ak47 and other weapons that serve no 
purpose other than to slaughter people 
like it or not the blood of those five innocent children is on 
our hands too

kennebec journal augusta maine on george bushs presidency 
the phrase kinder gentler endlessly repeated as it has 
already been is now functioning as a key expectation of the bush 
administration 
part of president bushs program could cause him trouble he 
wants a kinder nation without more spending on domestic programs 
and of course no new taxes 
rather like ronald reagan though a bit more plausibly he 
lauds the thousand points of light the volunteer groups 
fighting poverty homelessness and hunger 
the trouble is charity has never fulfilled the role reagan and 
now bush have assigned it relief as it was called during the 
great depression gave people a free meal but did not cure the lack 
of schooling and jobs which produced often hopeless conditions of 
poverty 
only a full scale commitment by government to yes the welfare 
state can ever truly be expected to cure poverty 
social security is the most successful antipoverty program ever 
devised before it began nearly 7 in 10 older americans lived in 
poverty now fewer than 1 in 10 do but such solutions arent cheap 
social security pays out 200 billion in retirement benefits every 
year 
dont expect any such radical move in bushs first year but if 
he takes his own advice seriously eventually he will have to change 
his mind and his policies

asbury park nj press on president bushs views on race 
relations 
it is hardly a secret that former president reagan has never 
been sensitive to the plight of poor blacks and other minorities in 
this country nor has he taken pains to conceal this disinterest 
thats why it was so refreshing to hear president bush speak 
out on what the rev martin luther king jrs message means to 
him 
bush called the slain civil rights leader a great gift from 
god 
then bush pledged to the american people that he will strive 
to ensure that bigotry and indifference to disadvantage will find 
no safe home on our shores in our public life in our 
neighborhoods or in our home and that reverend kings dream for 
his children and ours will be fulfilled 
thats plain talk that anybody can understand after eight years 
of worsening race relations it was a statement the nation needed to 
hear 
one thing is clear festering racial tension will never be 
eased without strong and unambiguous leadership from the white house

los angeles herald examiner on president bushs bipartisan breeze 
like many of his predecessors president george bush extended a 
congenial hand to congress and the country during his inaugural 
address 
a new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship must be made 
new again he said 
and he has assembled a cabinet of dc insiders who know their 
way around at first glance the next four years appear ripe for 
compromise and reconciliation 
but addressing americas challenges will require more than 
congeniality and a sound group of advisors itll take guts 
deficits as bush said must come down but they wont if he and 
his budget director dont get more serious about taxes 
bush wants to be known as the education president that costs 
money 
his kinder gentler nation that addresses the homeless aids 
children affordable housing etc has a hefty price tag too 
a teetering savings and loan industry must be shored up and that 
wont be cheap 
but it will be hard for us to rally around a breeze bushs call 
for bipartisanship however is another matter if he produces 
results from a warmer relationship thats someting americans can 
embrace

picayune miss item on president bushs honeymoon period 
george bush takes office as president amid limited 
expectations from his critics 
thats no surprise they said ronald reagan wouldnt last either 
and that his ideas would never work 
reagan wasnt always right but he was right far more than were 
the predictions of his detractors 
we sometimes wonder why anybody would want to be president it 
doesnt seem to be much fun anymore maybe thats what america liked 
about ronald reagan he enjoyed the job 
now its bushs turn he needs americas support and prayers 
this nations troubles and directions are far more than one man can 
handle 
hes asked for a kinder gentler nation maybe the nation could 
start by being a little kinder and gentler to its leader 
liberals chant give peace a chance why dont we try give 
the president a chance

the journal new ulm minn on ronald reagans years as 
president 
ronald reagan turned over the reigns of government friday to 
george bush a fitting finale would be for reagan to stand up in the 
saddle on a white stallion wave his stetson and gallop off into the 
sunset a movielike ending for our first actorturnedpresident 
its hard not to think about the reagan years in terms of a movie 
reagan leaves office an immensely popular figure a leader who 
kept smiling and waving while others fell around him from james 
watt to ed meese his administration was plagued by friends and 
followers miscast in their appointed roles 
but no one ever seemed to blame reagan for the troubles his 
appointed administrators caused he was the star the likeable guy 
no matter how bad his supporting cast was 
reagan was fond of using anecdotes and stories to illustrate and 
build support for his views listening to him speak was almost like 
watching movie clips in fact some of his anecdotes actually were 
movie clips but nobody seemed to mind his ability to confuse 
fiction and fact 
all in all the reagan years have been like an uneven movie 
script there have been holes in the plot and bad casting in some 
roles but the leading man managed to carry it off

a federal appeals court has reinstated a 
lawsuit seeking to block logging near spotted owl nests on 
government land in oregon 
the 30 ruling tuesday by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
was a partial victory for environmentalists whose suit had been 
dismissed by a federal judge in portland 
but the appeals court also lifted its ban on logging of socalled 
oldgrowth timber timber from virgin or longestablished 
stands near spotted owl sites at least until the lawsuit is 
decided 
that section of the ruling prompted timber industry lawyer mark 
rutzick also to claim victory 
there are 289 spotted owl sites within the timber sale area on 
the western slope of the cascades said attorney victor sher of the 
sierra club legal defense fund 
the suit contends logging of oldgrowth timber would eliminate 
the birds by destroying their habitat 
the spotted owl which lives in northern california oregon and 
washington is not an endangered species under federal law although 
sher said the fish and wildlife service is under court order to 
reassess the birds status by may 1 
environmental groups regard the spotted owl as an indicator 
species whose reduction in a given region is a signal that other 
forms of life are threatened 
while removing the ban it imposed last june on new logging of 
oldgrowth fir within 21 miles of a spotted owl site the court 
said environmental groups could ask a federal judge to forbid sales 
from specific sites as they are proposed 
the timber industry blamed the courts previous order for the 
loss of 1000 lumber and plywood mill jobs but sher disputed that 
us district judge helen frye in portland had ruled previously 
that a 1987 law prohibited the environmentalists from suing that 
finding was largely reversed by the appeals court

machinists union members fanned out across 
capitol hill on wednesday to lobby for repeal of a federal aviation 
administration rule change that would allow us airlines to handle 
more aircraft maintenance at foreign repair stations 
about 250 union members sought congressional support for 
legislation introduced by rep norman y mineta dcalif that 
would repeal the faa rules change 
on nov 22 1988 the faa revised federal air regulation 145 to 
eliminate a rule that limited foreign repair to work on aircraft 
which are used in operations conducted completely or in part outside 
the united states under the change aircraft flown on us domestic 
routes can also be repaired at foreign work stations 
john peterpaul transportation vice president of the machinists 
union said the two main issues were jobs and safety 
youre talking about a potential here for thousands tens of 
thousands of jobs to be lost peterpaul said about 90000 of the 
unions 600000 members work in the aviation industry 
peterpaul said the safety issue has become very very 
distressing in view of recent incidents involving aging us 
airliners including sudden inflight disintegration of aircraft 
fuselages and loss of engines 
an airplane doesnt make any money on the ground its always 
got to be up in the sky he said this competitiveness thats 
been created as a result of deregulation i think is one of the main 
culprits involved why some of these carriers have gotten so lax in 
some of their maintenance 
mineta said that prior to the rule change the ability of 
airlines to get their domestic aircraft serviced abroad was quite 
limited 
with the change however united states domestic aircraft will 
now be able to be maintained overseas on a free and open basis 
without prior approval he said 
lets not mince words mineta told a union gathering you 
know that this is bad policy i know that this is bad policy and 
those new rules should be repealed

art collectors dignitaries and those who 
surrounded salvador dali during his last reclusive years today 
attended funeral services for the artist who was buried under the 
museum where his first exhibition was held 
several thousand onlookers applauded as four pallbearers in red 
blue and gold outfits designed by the artist carried his coffin from 
a church to the theatermuseum it was placed in a marble tomb in 
the floor 
the museum is a former municipal theater where the surrealist 
artist first showed his paintings to the public in 1918 
the tomb dug sunday the day before dali died is below dalis 
floortoceiling work lincoln in dali vision a giant nude 
painting of his late wife gala that turns into a portrait of 
abraham lincoln when seen from across a courtyard 
earlier a catalanlanguage funeral service was held for dali in 
the nearby 14th century roman catholic church where he was baptized 
84 years ago 
salvador now that you have found the beauty with which you 
have tried to surround yourself we wish you a perfect rest and 
peace said parish priest narciso costabella 
spanish culture minister jorge semprun catalan regional 
government president jordi pujol dalis cousin montserrat domenech 
and close friends of the painter joined townspeople in the small 
church 
dali died in figueras hospital of heart failure brought on by 
respiratory problems and pneumonia 
he left an estate estimated at 877 million the estates exact 
value is difficult to calculate because of the erratic prices of 
20th century art and the widespread existence of forgeries 
dalis will reportedly divides his estate among the governments 
of figueras catalonia and spain under spanish law it cannot be 
read until at least 15 days after his death 
a major question is whether private collectors own the lucrative 
reproduction rights for their dali works 
im here because of a 45yearold friendship to pay my 
respects to a dear friend and thats all said a reynolds morse 
owner of the largest private dali collection outside spain in his 
st petersburg fla museum 
the american collector told the associated press he did not want 
to discuss possible legal battles until after the mourning period 
was over 
also in town for the funeral was robert descharnes a french 
photographer who had been close to dali since the early 1980s and 
was the principal merchant for his works 
the spanish press has implied that descharnes the author of what 
is considered the most complete catalogue of dalis works kept the 
painter in seclusion and controlled everything around him 
decharnes has called the accusations absolutely wrong he 
administers the dutchbased company demart which owns reproduction 
rights to dalis works until 2004 
italian collector giuseppe alboretto who owns more than 500 dali 
works said today he had prepared legal action against decharnes 
who he said had prevented him from visiting the painter 
figueras mayor mariano lorca said he did not know whether dalis 
only living close relative his sister ana maria dali figured in 
the will 
the barcelona daily la vanguardia reported that the sister 
planned a private funeral service in her home in nearby cadaques 
a founder of the surrealist movement in the early 1930s dali was 
the last of an outstanding generation of spanish painters that 
included pablo picasso and joan miro a fervent catalan he returned 
to his native region in 1948 after living in madrid paris and 
several us cities 
in later years he was known as much for his outrageous 
personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings 
dali went into seclusion and sank into depression when his wife 
manager and muse gala died in 1982 
he had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a 
wheelchair and fed through tubes since he was badly burned in a 1984 
fire

a sheriff brought 69 inmates to the capitol today 
in a protest against jail overcrowding but the prisoners were sent 
back on orders from gov joe frank harris without even getting out 
of their buses 
it was totally irresponsible on the part of the sheriff and was 
reckless endangerment of the public said harris spokeswoman 
barbara morgan 
the two busloads of dekalb county inmates arrived as part of a 
protest by georgia sheriffs who blame jail overcrowding on the 
states practice of forcing local jails to accept state inmates 
until prison space opens up 
the buses pulled up to a curb outside the capitol but left about 
15 minutes later 
dekalb county sheriff pat jarvis said that he never intended to 
take the prisoners into the capitol that the inmates were 
nonviolent and that he had informed police and capitol security 
guards in advance 
this is not a sideshow this is business he said 
jarvis said the demonstration was in support of a senate bill 
that would let counties decide whether to accept overflow state 
prisoners currently counties are paid 15 a day per prisoner 
which jarvis said is about half the actual cost 
we are a holding facility not a prison said jarvis 
asked where the state should put the 4000plus prisoners it has 
in county jails jarvis said thats not my problem where am i 
going to put them 
corrections commissioner david evans has asked for 7100 new 
prison beds in the fiscal year beginning july 1 to ease 
overcrowding but harris included no money in his 7 billion budget 
proposal for new prison space 
bud cody executive director of the georgia sheriffs association 
said half of georgias jails are overcrowded with state prisoners at 
a cost of 27 million a year to local taxpayers 
weve got a very desperate situation he said 
earlier this week overcrowded jails in colquitt and turner 
counties were the scenes of minor uprisings and overcrowding was a 
factor in recent disturbances at prisons in milledgeville and at the 
hall county jail 
these things are going to continue to pop up as long as weve 
got too many prisoners jarvis said

the irish republican army is engulfed in a serious 
internal dispute because its most ruthless unit apparently has 
refused to obey the ira leaderships order to disband a newspaper 
reported today 
the times of london quoted unidentified ira supporters as saying 
the order stemmed from a dispute over the units killing of 
protestant civilians the unit will likely continue operating as a 
renegade group the newspaper said 
also today a 26yearold construction worker was slain in the 
northern ireland city of belfast by two gunmen and police said they 
were investigating whether it was another incident of sectarian 
violence 
on tuesday another london newspaper the independent quoted 
unidentified ira sources as saying the guerrilla organization had 
ordered the unit in question disbanded and disarmed because of the 
protestant slayings 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite the province 
with the irish republic under socialist rule 
the controversial unit reportedly is based just across the border 
from northern ireland around the towns of ballyshannon and bundoran 
the times said the unit had coordinated the bombing of an annual 
memorial service for world war dead at enniskillen in county 
fermanagh on nov 8 1987 the attack which killed 11 civilians 
provoked worldwide condemnation of the guerrillas the ira admitted 
it made a grave error and apologized 
the independent reported that one of the killings that angered 
ira leaders was that of harold keyes a 23yearold protestant from 
county fermanagh in northern ireland two gunmen killed keyes jan 
15 as he visited his roman catholic girlfriend at ballintra in the 
republic 10 miles across the border 
keyes was a former reservist with the royal ulster constabulary 
northern irelands predominantly protestant police force but left 
the force three years ago prime minister charles haughey of ireland 
condemned the slaying as brutal and senseless 
the independent said another protestant civilian victim of the 
unit was a 21yearold fermanagh woman gillian johnston who was 
slain in march 
the unit said at the time that its target had been her brother 
who the group claimed was a member of the ulster defense regiment a 
locally recruited british army unit in northern ireland 
the family and police denied the brother was a member of the 
force and a later ira statement said the killing had been a mistake 
the times said the unit is believed to have seven members 
including a prosperous irish businesswoman who acted as its 
intelligence officer 
it said the unit has strong links to the irish national 
liberation army a breakaway marxist rival of the ira the newspaper 
quoted ira supporters as saying the unit might switch allegiance to 
the rival 
in todays slaying press association britains domestic news 
service identified the victim as david dornan from ballynahinch 15 
miles south of belfast the news service said dornan was a 
protestant and that police thought the shooting may have been a case 
of mistaken identity 
he was operating excavating equipment in a protestant 
neighborhood in lisburn near belfast when the gunmen stepped from 
behind bushes and opened fire police said

people living near a volcano in northern japan that 
came to life last month for the first time in 26 years are bracing 
themselves for another powerful eruption 
scientists studying the volcano said wednesday there were signs 
another major eruption was developing 
based on the volume of magma that exists there may be a major 
powerful eruption to match those that occurred in 1926 and 1962 
said yoshio fujii professor on volcanology and petrology at 
hokkaido university 
fujii based his prediction on analysis of rock samples taken from 
nearby peaks following the dec 19 eruption of the 6814foot mount 
tokachi in central hokkaido japans northernmost main island 
koichi ueda an official of kamifuranocho a town of 14000 
people just 15 miles from mount tokachi said 13 town officials were 
maintaining an aroundtheclock watch 
no damage or injuries were reported in the dec 19 eruption 
heat from mount tokachis eruption in 1926 melted almost all the 
snow on the mountain causing mudslides that killed 144 people and 
injured another 200 in two nearby villages a smaller eruption in 
1962 killed four people 
activity inside mount tokachi has intensified since jan 9 
because magma is rising from deep within the earth to about 1650 
feet below the crater of the volcano according to hiroshi okada 
head of hokkaido universitys usu volcano observatory 
the form of volcanic activity has started changing 
indicating the possibility of an explosion of magma from the 
mountain kyodo news service quoted okada as saying

the new session of congress signals the 
beginning of a lobbying war over whether the united states should 
extend soontoexpire steel import curbs that have helped the 
american steel industry become profitable 
the current import ceilings which were negotiated in the fall of 
1984 expire sept 30 
already there has been a lot of rhetoric on whether they 
should be renewed william reinsch steel trade expert for sen john 
heinz rpa said this week 
in terms of parties coming and sitting down its just now 
beginning to heat up reinsch said 
pressured by the steel industry and by congress the reagan 
administration negotiated fiveyear steel trade agreements with 
japan south korea the european community and other leading 
steelexporting nations 
the idea was to give american companies breathing space from 
subsidized foreign competitors by pressuring the competitors to 
restrict imports on a productbyproduct basis 
usx corp bethlehem steel corp ltv steel co and other large 
steel companies have begun pushing for an extension of the curbs 
beyond 1989 
but with the steel industry turning a second consecutive profit 
last year and with some importers complaining of steel product 
shortages it is no sure bet that the large firms will win renewal 
of as strong a package of quotas as in 1984 
three days before winning the november election president bush 
pledged to continue the socalled voluntary restraint agreements in 
some form but opponents of the plan believe they can make a case 
for ending or at least scaling down the import curbs 
there is little argument that the curbs have aided the steel 
industrys revival imports have been reduced from 264 percent of 
the american market in 1984 to about 205 percent last year 
meanwhile employment and profits were up last year over 1987 
the issue is whether the quota agreements are still necessary 
and to what degree if at all they have harmed other sectors of the 
american economy besides steel companies 
the precision metalforming association an industry group says 
the availability of steel has been reduced because of the import 
curbs the association represents hundreds of metal product 
manufacturers that convert such products as brake pedals and 
computer frames from raw steel 
our position is because of the restrictions on steel supplies 
which cause increases in prices and limited availability we would 
rather see the most open and competitive steel market possibile 
spokesman greg estell said monday 
the steel trade issue has already spawned some angry language 
after caterpillar inc of peoria ill issued a september 1988 
paper arguing against continued import ceilings the american iron 
and steel institute soon compiled a 20page pointbypoint rebuttal 
in the jan 1 rebuttal the trade association accused caterpillar 
of numerous distortions and inaccuracies the paper claimed that 
the import curbs do not cause steel price increases or otherwise 
impede the competitiveness of us manufacturers

scaling back pentagon spending and about his personal ties to 
defense contractors as the senate armed services committee prepared

department

mass a spokeswoman for sen john warner of virginia ranking 
republican on the committee 
details of the meeting were not available 
the former texas senator could expect to be treated with special 
courtesy by his former colleagues this afternoon in the historic 
senate caucus room site of the watergate and irancontra hearings 
but the 63yearold tower who emerged as president bushs 
nominee after an exhaustive background check was certain to be 
quizzed on his consulting work for defense contractors and his 
private life as well as on defense policy and overall pentagon 
funding 
sen alan dixon dill a member of the senate armed services 
committee said tuesday he expects the hearings to be marked by some 
controversy based on the reports that have already been raised in 
the media 
theres enough out there dixon said

commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher was warmly 
received tuesday before the senate commerce committee lawmakers 
told the texas oilman he should make the government a more

appointment as transportation secretary in written responses to 
questions from the senate commerce committee the 50yearold 
illinois transportation administrator said foreign airlines serving 
the united states should be forced to meet the same security 
requirements as us carriers 
the tower hearings are likely to focus in part on the issue of 
overall military spending former president reagan asked in his 
final budget for 3152 billion for the pentagon in fiscal 1990 
which begins oct 1 the request represents a 2 percent increase 
after inflation 
but bush according to testimony last week from office of 
management and budget nominee richard darman is expected to reduce 
reagans request by an unspecified amount 
if bush fails to trim the request congress is likely to do so 
in the past four years congress has cut military spending increases 
to levels below the rate of inflation 
i think theyre whistling dixie if they think theyll get a 2 
to 3 percent increase in spending said rep sonny montgomery 
dmiss a member of the house armed services committee theyll 
be fortunate if they get the inflation factor

into the forefront including his bitter divorce and reports of 
drinking and womanizing

of rumors that proved to be groundless and said i am totally 
satisfied in that regard 
sens sam nunn dga and warner ranking members of the senate 
armed services committee said they would read the fbi reports on 
all nominees before the hearings 
expected to raise the question of towers private life is paul 
weyrich chairman of coalitions for america a conservative think 
tank weyrich is scheduled to testify before the committee next 
tuesday

nomination because the former senator fails to meet the ethical 
standards bush envisioned for his administration

a veteran cuban diplomat secretly defected to 
the united states three months ago after becoming disillusioned with 
widespread official corruption and with cuban support for marxist 
rebels in at least three latin american countries 
hector aguililla saladrigas 35 broke with the revolution last 
october when he was granted political asylum by us officials but 
his defection was not publicly disclosed until the state department 
made him available for an interview tuesday with the associated 
press 
aguililla criticized the corruption that he said cuban officials 
engaged in while he was posted in syria and iran and added he was 
troubled by the lack of freedom and the total militarization of 
cuban society 
the cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of aguilillas 
allegations on wednesday but spokesman angel pino refused comment 
president fidel castro has acknowledged that corruption in cuba 
is a problem but he nonetheless contends that the revolution has 
produced hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer 
for social welfare projects at home and in numerous third world 
countries 
aguililla whose diplomatic career spanned 14 years offered a 
rare glimpse into the role cuba has played in cooperation with 
palestinian radicals in the shadowy international arms trafficking 
business 
aguililla said that with palestinian help cuba has arranged for 
the transport of large quantities of westernmade weaponry to 
guerrilla groups in el salvador guatemala and chile and also 
provides training in cuba for leftist african groups 
he said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as the second 
ranking official at the cuban embassy in damascus he routinely made 
trips to lebanons bekka valley where the trunk of his car was 
loaded with rifles pistols revolvers and smoke bombs 
he said palestinian groups particularly two promarxist 
factions were the principal source of weaponry which he was able 
to transport back to syria without a customs check because of the 
diplomatic plates on his car 
on occasion he said a top cuban intelligence officer flew to 
damascus for largerscale arms transfers 
weapons of us israeli or italian manufacture were favored 
because socialist involvement in the arms trafficking scheme 
could thus be concealed he said 
the palestinians were a good source of western arms because 
they had a lot of contacts to get them he added 
the policy of cuba has always been to export the revolution 
aguililla said as he recounted his experiences in the 75minute 
interview 
speaking in spanish while chainsmoking cigarettes aguililla 
said he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way of 
syria continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early 
1984 
he said cuba assists the palestinian movement in a number of 
ways including the provision of training of a terrorist nature 
palestinians he said are trained by cubans as frogmen and in 
the use of all types of weaponry as well nonlethal skills also 
are taught such as how to falsify passports and to engage in 
clandestine correspondence through an invisible writing technique 
aguililla was assigned last september to be the second ranking 
official at the cuban embassy in madagascar he departed cuba on 
october 10 but at a transit point en route which he refused to 
disclose he asked for political asylum for his wife and two 
children aged 13 and 10 
he described castro as paranoid and capricious and said 
he was disturbed by widespread evidence of corruption in cuban 
society sometimes at high levels of government 
wilma espin a member of the politburo and head of the federation 
of cuban women once helped herself during a visit to damascus to a 
fund that embassy women had contributed to for parties and toys for 
children he said adding that she used the money for shopping 
orlando fundora formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution 
stopped once in damascus aguililla said and asked him to exchange 
money on the black market 
he was supposed to be the model of socialist morality but 
nonethless he violated the law of that country aguililla added 
the wife of a former cuban ambassador to syria arturo barber 
orosco used to finance shopping expeditions by drawing thousands of 
dollars from an embassy fund and saying the money was being used for 
cleaning materials for the ambassadors residence aguililla 
said

attorneys for fired national security council 
aide oliver l north disclosed today they have issued subpoenas in 
the irancontra case to three house committees and two members of 
the house 
north attorney barry simon said the subpoenas were sent to the 
house intelligence foreign affairs and armed services committees 
the two members of congress werent identified defense subpoenas 
also were issued for two unidentified house staff members 
the house through the general counsel to the clerk subsequently 
moved to quash portions of the subpoenas to the committees a 
22page court brief said the panels could not allow the wholesale 
rummaging through the records of the house sought by norths 
lawyers 
norths subpoenas require surrender of the broadest imaginable 
range of privileged documents including the whole set of 
records of the house intelligence panels investigation of the 
resupply operation for the nicaraguan contra rebels the brief said 
the committee began the investigation after the october 1986 
shootdown of a contra resupply plane in nicaragua carrying american 
eugene hasenfus as one of its crew members 
us district judge gerhard gesell said with regard to the two 
house members subpoenaed were not going to pull them off the 
floor were going to have to approach this part of the case with 
some degree of accommodation 
norths trial is scheduled to get under way next tuesday 
although an interagency intelligence group is still reviewing 
classified documents that both the prosecution and defense want to 
use at trial 
the brief references to subpoenas by norths defense team came at 
a court hearing where prosecutors argued in favor of subpoenaing 
norths spiral notebooks which he compiled on a daily basis while 
he was at the nsc 
gesell said he would decide by friday whether north should be 
compelled to produce the notebooks portions of which were turned 
over to congress for the irancontra hearings in 1987 
at the court hearing simon said the notebooks might be applied 
to the portion of the case alleging destruction of documents by 
north in november 1986 as the irancontra affair was unfolding 
simon said prosecutors might try to link references in the 
notebooks to documents that north allegedly destroyed before leaving 
the nsc 
simon declined to acknowledge that the notebooks existed or were 
in norths possession but he said north is entitled to fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination 
the notebooks also delve into norths assistance to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels and his involvement in the reagan 
administrations secret arms shipments to iran 
north took the last of the notebooks with him when he was 
dismissed on nov 25 1986 after the diversion of iran arms sale 
proceeds to the contras was uncovered 
independent counsel lawrence walsh has been trying to get the 
notebooks since well before norths indictment last year 
a subpoena for the material was issued through the federal grand 
jury investigating the irancontra affair but was withdrawn after 
north was charged walsh said in a court filing monday 
walsh said the notes are presidential records over which the 
united states has complete ownership and control 
the notebooks could be used by prosecutors in an attempt to 
bolster the portion of the governments case alleging that north 
made false statements to congress by saying that the nsc offered no 
tactical advice to the contras and by denying that he used his 
influence to help move supplies to them 
norths notebooks describe successful efforts to obtain false 
enduser certificates from guatemala stating that arms actually 
destined for the contras were instead for the exclusive use of the 
central american country to which they were being sent the false 
certificates enabled one of norths codefendants richard secord 
to ship more than 90000 pounds of east european munitions by 
chartered aircraft from a european arms dealer to the contras 
norths notebooks also touch on his participation in efforts to 
secure space at a salvadoran air base to launch contra resupply 
missions and the construction of an emergency airstrip in santa 
elena costa rica to help open a southern front of contra military 
operations 
the notebooks also detail norths participation in arranging the 
november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles from israel to iran 
one charge against north is that he obstructed congress by 
helping to prepare a false chronology that said no us official 
learned before january 1986 that hawk missiles had been shipped to 
iran in november 1985 
in notebook entries for nov 20 1985 several days before the 
hawk missile shipment north detailed a plan for shipping hawks to 
iran in exchange for a fourphase release of hostages

yugoslav report said there are no plans at this time for such a 
trip 
white house chief of staff john sununu declined to confirm or 
deny whether bush would be making such a trip 
i would suggest that you wait for the tall thin guy bush to 
sing or the short bald guy press secretary marlin fitzwater to 
tell you that the tall thin guy has sung he told reporters 
there is no official announcement of that yet

a survey of scientific studies suggests most 
women suffer no lasting emotional trauma from abortion but the 
american psychological association says much of the research is 
flawed and more studies are needed 
by and large what you find is that most of the women who have 
abortions experience a sense of relief brian wilcox director of 
public interest legislation at the apa said tuesday in an interview 
he said the apa survey showed that postabortion syndrome a 
notion that women are harmed emotionally by abortion is not a 
scientifically or medically recognized disorder 
however olivia gans director of the american victims of 
abortion said negative findings on the effects of abortion are 
absent from the scientific literature because the apa and the 
american medical association have a proabortion bias 
thousands of women she claimed suffer emotional problems after 
undergoing abortion 
earlier this month surgeon general c everett koop said in a 
letter to the white house that there was no scientifically sound 
evidence showing negative health effects to the 15 million women 
who get legal abortions annually 
both wilcox and miss gans agreed with the position taken by koop 
and both said there is a need for scientifically valid research 
wilcox said apa experts surveyed more than 100 research studies 
on the psychological effects of abortion and found that most of the 
research was flawed because there were few valid comparisons for 
example wilcox said there are no studies that directly compare the 
relative effects on women who chose abortion with those who decide 
to bear an unwanted child for adoption or raise the child out of 
wedlock 
in general he said however the studies do not show any lasting 
psychological trauma that can be attributed solely to abortion 
its clear that the vast majority of women are not going to 
experience any significant problems said wilcox millions of 
women are having abortions and it appears to be a relatively benign 
procedure both medically and psychologically it just depends on the 
circumstances surrounding the abortion 
miss gans said many women suffer from postabortion syndrome 
and experience great difficulty from having an abortion 
postabortion syndrome is a theory that has been discussed by 
clinicians around the country among those who have seen patterns 
emerge she said 
professionals are beginning to compile research on it but they 
are having difficulty getting published said miss gans 
she said the apa and the ama have a bias toward abortion and a 
hostility toward studies that show negative findings about abortion

in motown where cars are synonymous with life 
itself for many psychologists say a recent skein of reported 
roadway shootings has shaken motorists confidence in their cars as 
rolling security 
since november there have been at least 10 random highway 
shootings in and around detroit some were roadside snipers others 
stemmed from traffic disputes 
youve got a lot of idiots out there with guns in their cars 
and you put that together with publicity and people start taking 
shots at each other assistant oakland county prosecutor james 
halushka said 
it certainly makes people anxious and it affects peoples 
behavior on the road said emanuel tanay a professor of 
psychiatry at wayne state university in detroit the car has been 
known as a sort of sanctuary but now thats not the case 
the most serious incident occurred nov 22 when michael warner 
31 of trenton was shot and killed while sleeping in a car driven 
by his wife on interstate 75 in southgate police have made no 
arrests 
since then there have been reports of shots shattering car 
windshields state police investigators subsequently discovered the 
damage was caused by rocks no serious injuries have been reported 
it has happened before in the summer of 1987 at least five 
people were killed and 20 injured in an unrelated string of 
shootings on southern california freeways some of the incidents 
stemmed from traffic disputes while others appeared to be random 
sniper attacks 
los angeles area authorities set up a highway violence hot line 
to handle calls from worried drivers and special aerial freeway 
patrols were established the shootings later tapered off 
michigan authorities have no similar plans state police are 
trying to be more alert but lack the manpower to increase road 
patrols said lt david werner commander of the state police 
freeway post in detroit 
tanay said the media have given the michigan incidents real and 
imagined unwarranted attention which has contributed to drivers 
anxiety 
we live in a society where theres violence why is it so 
shocking that it happens in a car people die in car crashes 
everyday he said 
werner also criticized the heavy news coverage of the shootings 
its my feeling that copy catting always occurs in things of 
this type he said ive tried to downplay things of this 
nature though 
authorities say most people now are driving more cautiously to 
avoid traffic disputes but the extent to which driving behavior is 
altered depends on the psychological makeup of the particular 
individual said dr william birkhill of southfieldbased couseling 
associates 
it depends greatly on how much people use denial to protect 
themselves birkhill said many deal with traumatic events by 
denying them most people if it hasnt happened to them they are 
able to dismiss the possibility of danger 
catching a highway shooter is difficult werner said in most 
instances there are no witnesses and we have few leads to go on 
authorities hope the sentencing of john rayes 17 to eight to 20 
years in prison for a highway shooting will be a deterrent rayes 
pleaded guilty jan 3 to the shooting of 19yearold dawn lamsa on 
i696 in madison heights lamsa was wounded in the neck and was 
hospitalized for several days 
rayes told police he mistook lamsa for someone he had argued with 
at a carnival earlier in the evening

president bush today credited the soviet union 
with definite improvement in human rights but said the united 
states will watch what develops in the months ahead while weighing 
whether to carry through with a promise to attend a moscow summit on 
human rights in 1991 
i think we need to look for performance and there will be time 
in which to see performance in that regard he said he added 
there has been definite improvement in some ways there but lets 
see what develops as we move towards that conference date 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was not backing 
away from its commitment to attend the moscow conference but said 
theres plenty of room for independent analysis between now and 
1991 
bush made his comments in an interview with two reporters as part 
of a white houses experiment to make the president available to the 
news media in different forums a transcript of the session was made 
public 
the president hinted he may visit china next month after stopping 
in japan for the feb 24 funeral of emperor hirohito stay 
tuned he said we may have something on that yea or nea 
before the close of business today but i just dont know yet 
there also is speculation bush will visit south korea while in 
the far east 
on other subjects bush said 
he does not want the federal reserve board to act too strongly 
to bring down inflation rates fed chairman alan greenspan said 
tuesday that inflation was too high and he would press to reduce it

applauded the upward movement in the stock market and said theres 
no signals out there in the markets that this economy is in real

insure the troubled sampl industry thats one option he said

prime minister noboru takeshita said wednesday he 
wont be driven from office by a stocktrading scandal that has 
forced three cabinet ministers to resign and will try to restore 
public trust in government 
opposition leaders have demanded takeshitas removal since ken 
harada the economic planning agency director resigned tuesday 
because of links to the recruit co conglomerate the company 
involved 
harada was appointed a month ago in a cabinet realignment 
intended to quiet complaints about the scandal and had been chosen 
to lead an investigation of financial connections between recruit 
and politicians 
earlier this month takeshita declared his new cabinet free of 
taint from the scandal in which politicians and others were offered 
advance shares in a recruit subsidiary and made huge profits when 
the stock went public 
takeshita said in a television interview wednesday the harada 
resignation reinforces my feeling that we need to do something we 
must make efforts to dispel public distrust in government and in the 
party 
at a meeting with japanese reporters he said demands for his 
resignation were a matter for me to judge 
news reports said harada received monthly political donations of 
about 80 from recruit for 14 years until the end of 1987 well 
after the stocktrading scandal was revealed 
recruitcosmos the subsidiary sold unlisted shares to more than 
150 influential politicians journalists and businessmen 
although the transactions were not illegal the deal aroused 
suspicions of bribery and influencepeddling the result was a 
public outcry over fundraising practices and the traditional 
coziness between japanese businessmen and politicians 
harada 69 was chosen for the new cabinet the prime minister 
appointed dec 27 in an attempt to restore the image of his 
government and his party the conservative liberal democrats 
he said tuesday in resigning that recruit had not sought favors 
from him and he had done nothing wrong koichiro aino also 69 was 
appointed to replace him 
justice minister takashi hasegawa resigned after only three days 
in office when it was disclosed that he continued receiving 
donations from recruit after the stock deal was exposed 
kiichi miyazawa the finance minister quit in december after 
repeatedly changing his story about an aides purchase of shares in 
his name 
takeshita told japanese reporters wednesday that opposition calls 
for him to resign were a matter for me to judge 
the japan socialist party the largest opposition group adopted 
a resolution at its annual convention wednesday demanding 
parliamentary elections 
were pretty sick of all this takako doi the party 
chairwoman said in a television interview 
several ranking current and former bureaucrats also have been 
linked to recruit 
kunio takaishi former deputy education minister and takashi 
kato former deputy labor minister bought shares in recruitcosmos 
takaishi was forced to abandon his quest for a seat in parliament 
and prosecutors have questioned kato several times 
yoshiro okai the current deputy and masayuki nomiyama director 
of the labor standards bureau acknowledged accepting dinners and 
golf trips from recruit labor ministry officials both would quit at 
the end of the month but described the resignations as routine and 
unrelated to the scandal 
the ministry monitors and sets guidelines for the personnel and 
employmentinformation fields recruits main business and 
prosecutors are investigating the possibility of bribery 
since the scandal began last june takeshita has pledged to clean 
up government most recently saying in his new years speech he 
would seek to revise election laws and rules for political donations 
asked wednesday how he would erase public distrust he said i 
will solve problems one by one 
the prime minister is scheduled to visit washington next week to 
meet with president bush

reagans 1988 book on the outside looking in

uncredited but contended that sandler has been continually 
raising his prices for the photos 
i lost my cool which i should not have done and i apologize 
for that reagan said but i actually apologize more to my 
friends and my family for this kind of behavior which is caused by 
the pressures placed on me because of my position 
sandler said the apology wont make him drop the police complaint 
he seems to act erratically and it seems that he has a violent 
temper said sandler im sorry he didnt handle the publication 
of the pictures properly to begin with and didnt deal with me 
honestly 
under california law it is a misdemeanor for a person to call 
another individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or 
threaten to inflict injury the maximum punishment is a sixmonth 
sentence and 1000 fine

north dakotas reputation for blizzards 
howling winds and subzero cold may partly be blamed on its name 
according to a legislative resolution that seeks to change it to 
simply dakota 
i have come to see the word dakota as having a much more 
poetic romantic connotation than the term north dakota said 
state sen tim mathern who introduced two resolutions in the 
legislature wednesday calling for the change 
state tourism director jim fuglie called the idea wonderful 
but south dakota gov george mickelson said it would forsake a 
centurys worth of history 
if either of us wants to change our name now we might as well 
call ourselves michigan or tallahassee because any name change now 
would deny 100 years or more of our heritage mickelson said 
north dakota gov george sinner said he hadnt thought about the 
issue but i certainly dont have any builtin opposition 
one of matherns two resolutions calls on congress to amend 
federal enabling legislation to permit the name change the 1889 act 
admitted north and south dakota montana and washington to the 
united states 
the second resolution calls for a statewide election to make the 
necessary amendment to the north dakota constitution 
north dakota conveys an image of severe climactic conditions 
according to the first resolution while dakota conveys an image 
reflective of the pioneering spirit of the inhabitants of the 
state 
dakota which means friend in the sioux language was the 
name for the territory that later became north and south dakota as 
well as much of wyoming and montana 
this is a serious look at the name of our state during our 
centennial year said mathern a democrat it gives us a chance 
to look at what we feel good about and want to take with us into 
our second century 
the idea is not new bob saueressig a bismarck advertising 
executive said in 1983 he and others paid for a billboard that 
proclaimed lets drop north and call it dakota 
the proposal generated national publicity but the idea didnt 
fly some wags suggested dropping dakota instead and the 
proposal basically got laughed down saueressig said 
mathern however said his suggestion was serious 
for those people who at some point need to have some levity 
with this i can understand that he said for me it is not a 
joke

a legislative committee has approved a bill 
requiring childrens homes to report certain information to the 
state a move sparked by widespread publicity on alleged abuse at a 
fundamentalist christian boarding home 
the senate public health and welfare committee approved the 
measure tuesday without substantive debate panel chairman robert 
huggins said he would likely call the bill up for debate before the 
full senate next week 
its the first time the legislature has taken this bold a step 
as far as regulation of these homes are concerned he said its 
been something that in the past has been so politically hot that no 
one would touch it 
sen jim bean chairman of the subcommittee that handled the 
bill said the proposal would not infringe on religious rights of 
churchoperated schools 
the bill would require the homes to provide the state department 
of health with 
names guardians and nearest relatives of all residents 
proof of inspections by a local fire department or the state 
fire marshals office and the local health department 
a statement that medical records are maintained on each child 
the bill also would require the homes to file monthly reports 
with the department of health and have on hand policies addressing 
discipline and parentchild communication 
huggins said he would have preferred seeing the state department 
of public welfare as the agency receiving the reports rather than 
the department of health 
he said he believed political fallout from the welfare 
departments raid on the bethel home for children in lucedale last 
summer might have led to the department of health being the 
designated agency 
on june 10 the welfare department took temporary custody of 72 
bethel children based on allegations of abuse and neglect most of 
the children taken from the home were released to parents or 
guardians but the state took custody of 17 
the rev herman fountain a fundamentalist baptist minister and 
founder of the controversial bethel home has vowed to ignore any 
legislation that becomes state law he claims the home is part of 
his church and is exempt from any kind of state regulation under the 
us constitution

police on wednesday ended the search 
for victims of the pan am flight 103 disaster with 17 bodies still 
missing out of the 270 people killed 
police also said a symbolic coffin would be lowered into a grave 
next week at a service for those victims still missing and presumed

dumfries and galloway chief constable john boyd said the search 
which was carried out over 845 square miles of scottish countryside 
would only be resumed in specific areas if it was thought necessary 
the scale of the disaster has inevitably led to the conclusion 
that some of the victims may never be recovered he said 
inspector mike dean said police representatives last week visited 
relatives of the 17 missing to tell them of the plans to call off 
the search and hold the graveside service 
he said seven were from the united states three were from 
hungary and seven were lockerbie residents of the others killed 
253 bodies have been identified and returned to their families 
he said most of the relatives of the missing victims planned to 
come to the service jan 31 where a tombstone to remember all the 
victims would be erected over the grave of the single coffin 
the tombstone donated by pan am will read in remembrance of 
all victims of the lockerbie disaster who died on dec 21 1988

vice president dan quayle vowed wednesday the 
bush administration wont go duck hunting for ways to hike 
taxes even as other administration officials talked of ways to 
raise new revenues 
quayle made a play on president bushs no new taxes pledge 
and budget directordesignate richard darmans explanation of taxes 
to congress in which he said if it looks like a duck walks like 
a duck and quacks like a duck its a duck 
quayle in his first policy speech since becoming vice president 
on friday said some people try to use the budget deficit as an 
excuse to go duck hunting for new taxes for their pet spending 
ideas 
remember the code word as we go into this budget battle this 
year no duck hunting period quayle told a conference of the 
citizens for a sound economy foundation no hunting ducks no 
hunting for taxes 
quayle made the comments as bush told reporters at the white 
house that he would entertain an idea raised by treasury department 
officials to tax depositors who put money in federally insured 
institutions 
bush said he sees the idea as an option but he deflected a 
question on whether that would not be considered a tax by asking 
whether an entrance fee to national parks is a tax 
the proposed depositor fee would be 25 cents on every 100 
deposited in federally insured institutions and the money would be 
used to help the ailing savings and loan industry accounts in 
commerical banks and credit unions also would be subject to such 
fees 
quayle reiterated bushs support for a presidential lineitem 
veto of the annual budget instead of the current system of 
accepting or rejecting the entire budget package 
he said also that congress should be held accountable through a 
vote when a president asks it to rescind appropriations for 
unnecessary spending that has already been approved currently the 
money must be spent unless congress acts on a presidents recission 
request within 45 days quayle said congress should be forced to 
act within 15 days after a rescission request is sent to capitol 
hill 
such reforms would give the president a greater voice in how 
congress spends the taxpayers money 
congress itself has a duty to its consitutents to work with the 
administration to spend our money more prudently and responsibly 
than it has in the past he added 
quayle noted a roper poll released wednesday by the citizens for 
a sound economy had said most americans believe the government 
should hold down spending not raise taxes to cut the federal 
budget deficit 
the inperson interviews with 1947 adults nationwide found that 
62 percent believed increased spending caused the deficit while 9 
percent said inadequate revenues were the cause and 21 percent put 
the blame on a combination of spending and revenues 
quayle said the poll shows a broadly based distrust of the way 
our government operates in taxing and spending 
the poll conducted dec 310 also found 73 percent of those 
polled said the government should hold down spending to cut the 
deficit while 5 percent favored raising taxes and 12 percent wanted 
both options used 
the poll also asked people their opinions on whether social 
security payments should have cost of living increases even if 
government spending were held to present levels for two years 
sixtyfour percent favored social security increases in a 
spendingfreeze situation while 26 percent were opposed 
on new government programs 43 percent of the respondents said 
they oppose creation of new government programs until the deficit is 
eliminated while 40 percent favor new programs even with the 
deficit

focusing on research and educational activities in economic issues

a cabinet minister said wednesday any 
spark on the 730mile border with iran could rekindle the war that 
was suspended in august after eight years and an estimated one 
million deaths 
latif nussayif jasim iraqs information minister said in an 
interview the factionalized iranian leadership does not seem capable 
of negotiating peace and talks will remain deadlocked until that 
changes 
special un envoy jan eliason met with iranian leaders wednesday 
in tehran in an attempt to revive the negotiations which began in 
geneva on aug 25 five days after a unsupervised ceasefire took 
effect 
eliasson is expected in baghdad on friday perhaps with proposals 
from iran 
each side accuses the other of frustrating the negotiations 
iranian television said foreign minister ali akbar velayati told 
eliasson it is not acceptable that our territories are still 
occupied due to iraqi subterfuges and delaying tactics 
iran claims iraqi soldiers still occupy 260 square miles of its 
territory iraq says iran is stalling for time to rebuild its 
military forces which suffered several defeats last year and forced 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime to accept a truce the iraqis 
accuse iran of massing troops on the border 
un military observers say the ceasefire is holding despite 
claims by both sides of violations 
neither side has withdrawn from the truce line as stipulated by 
the terms and iranian officials have said they see no point in 
resuming the geneva talks unless the united nations can guarantee 
progress 
jasim said we believe iran does not have the ability to make a 
decision regarding peace thats why they want to maintain the 
nowar nopeace situation 
his apparent reference was to divisions in the iranian hierarchy 
after khomeinis decision last july 18 to accept a un security 
council ceasefire resolution 
without a stable ceasefire any spark could lead once again to 
an unsolvable problem the information minister said 
he denied western news reports that iraq was willing to make 
concessions on the shattalarab which is iraqs only sea outlet 
and was the prewar southern boundary between the persian gulf 
neighbors 
the shattalarab is an iraqi waterway jasim declared 
the dispute over who controls the shatt formed by the confluence 
of the tigris and euphrates rivers helped start the war in 
september 1980 
iraq invaded iran after weeks of border skirmishes a few days 
before the invasion president saddam hussein abrogated a 1975 
treaty drawing the boundary down the middle of the waterway 
before that treaty the border had run along the eastern iranian 
bank putting the waterway in iraq control of the shatt is at the 
center of the impasse in geneva 
jasim said iran must allow iraq free navigation through the 
persian gulf and its southern outlet the strait of hormuz iraq 
also wants the shatt cleared of sunken ships and other debris under 
un supervision and negotiations on its status postponed until the 
job is done 
iran would have full rights to use the waterway after a 
settlement jasim said he added that iraq has no ambition for 
iranian territory and is eager to conclude a peace treaty

an unusually large jury was selected 
wednesday to hear evidence against a man accused of terrorizing 
blackstone valley residents with a series of sniper attacks two 
winters ago 
selection of the 16member jury was completed after a lastminute 
appeal for more potential jurors the original group of 25 jury 
canidates was exhausted because many wouldbe jurors were familiar 
with the sniper attacks which received wide publicity 
juries normally contain 14 members including two alternates but 
two additional alternates were selected because the trial of peter 
t trepanier is expected to take four to six weeks said prosecutor 
evamarie mancuso 
trepanier 25 of burrillville is accused along with a high 
school classmate of 35 counts including multiple charges of assault 
with intent to commit murder arson burglary and conspiracy the 
arson charges carry a potential sentence of life in prison 
the classmate russell j ducharme ii is scheduled to go on 
trial after trepaniers case is finished 
the charges stem in part from eight of 11 nighttime sniper 
attacks in december 1986 and january 1987 that forced cumberland and 
north smithfield residents to huddle behind drawn curtains the 
attacks prompted gov edward d diprete to call out the national 
guard which patrolled for about six weeks 
superior judge dominic f cresto said after the jurors were sworn 
in thursday they would tour the rural area where the sniper attacks 
occurred opening arguments were tentatively scheduled for friday 
two of the attacks occurred in bellingham mass where trepanier 
and ducharme also face charges of assault with intent to commit 
murder massachusetts authorities were waiting for the rhode island 
trials to conclude before pressing those charges said catherine 
ferrone a bellingham police secretary 
the men were arrested when trepanier walked into the woonsocket 
police station on oct 8 1987 and allegedly confessed to the 
snipings and implicated ducharme

the woman has fallen ill so were going to take other 
witnesses out of order until she returns judge gilberto hinojosa 
told the jury 
the woman had testified tuesday until midafternoon when she 
reported fainting during a break in her crossexamination earlier 
in the day a defense attorney had suggested in opening arguments 
that she was sexcrazed 
felipe chew 29 is on trial on an aggravated kidnapping charge 
and also faces a sexual assault trial in the case he was indicted 
with nine other men after the woman reported being abducted and 
raped by as many as 20 men in march 
her testimony in the cases first trial in september led to the 
sexual assault conviction of a 24yearold man who was sentenced to 
20 years in prison 
the woman asked to be excused from testifying in the chew trial 
and the prosecutor agreed to the request but the judge on tuesday 
compelled her to testify or go to jail for contempt of court 
she said that publicity from the case disrupted her personal life 
and that the news media had harassed her 
to a certain extent i sympathize with what youve been going 
through or what you say youve been going through said the 
judge but too much has happened for me to allow you to determine 
whether or not this case should proceed 
prosecution testimony continued this morning with investigator 
jerry galvan describing the woman as withdrawn almost in shock 
the morning after the incident 
defense attorney jaime garza in his opening statement tuesday 
said the trial would include testimony about women who have an 
insatiable desire for sex women that just cant get enough even 
with multiple men 
he said a witness would testify the woman got willingly into a 
car with the men she said abducted her 
garza also noted the womans request to be excused from 
testifying saying you have to ask yourselves why why didnt 
she want to testify 
during her testimony tuesday the woman said she was pulled into 
a car with chew and three other men taken to a ranch where an 
illegal cockfight was being held and forced to perform sex acts with 
a number of men including chew

city officials hoping to stem the spread 
of aids are considering a proposal that would require innkeepers to 
put safe sex kits beside the good book in each hotel room 
certainly if hotels can have a gideon bible in every room they 
can include a safe sex kit said nurse practitioner leland 
traiman a clinical aids researcher who proposed the idea 
there could be a sign with each kit saying the bible may save 
your soul but this will save your life said traiman who served 
on the citys aids health commission last year 
the proposal was on wednesdays agenda for the city councils 
committee on public safety and health and is also scheduled for a 
hearing before the citys community health advisory committee next 
month 
city councilwoman ann chandler who chairs the council committee 
said she is not sure safesex kits should be required by law but 
she added given the crisis caused by aids we must do all we can 
to educate the community its an issue that needs to be discussed 
each kit would contain condoms and information about how aids is 
transmitted 
david morris chairman of the community health advisory 
committee said he knows very little about the proposal but that it 
didnt seem like a halfbad idea 
not surprisingly some hoteliers disagree 
my boss is hitting the ceiling said doris flood manager of 
travelers lodge a few blocks from the university of california 
hes called the home office and the home office has called 
england and im not even going to tell you what england said 
said flood whose hotel is owned by the britishbased trustforte inc 
we are three blocks from the university a lot of our clientele 
is associated with the university they are mostly older people or 
professors or people from europe its not conducive to our 
clientele here flood said 
she also worried that a faulty condom could leave the hotel 
vulnerable to a lawsuit 
steve rodri general manager of the berkeley marina marriott 
hotel said his mormonrun franchise places the book of mormon in 
each room and doesnt even allow playboy magazine in the gift shop 
he said the hotel is not about to place condoms in the rooms 
the marriott organization has always stood for high morals and 
professional ethics rodri said i think it could be difficult 
to ask a housekeeper of deep religious convictions to handle these 
types of items 
traiman said the idea was born last year when the citys health 
commission tried to persuade hot tub and sauna owners to post aids 
warnings and to provide safe sex information the managers of one 
sauna refused 
they told us they wouldnt cooperate until there are safe sex 
kits in all hotel and motel rooms in berkeley he said 
voila we said we all thought it was such a good idea that we 
decided to pursue it

president bush voiced firm support today for 
health and human services secretarydesignate louis sullivan saying 
sullivan fully supports bushs opposition to abortion 
in an interview with a small group of reporters in the oval 
office bush replied none when asked whether he foresaw any 
circumstances in which he would withdraw sullivans nomination 
bush took issue with reports that sullivan disagrees with the 
presidents position advocating a reversal by the supreme court of 
its landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
he has supported my position 100 percent the president said 
ive not heard anyone suggesting that he will not be confirmed i 
havent heard one single person suggest that 
meanwhile sullivan met with a group of republican senators in 
the office of minority leader bob dole rkan and said i found 
them to be very supportive 
sullivan was asked by reporters if he favored overturning roe vs 
wade he responded only by saying once the hearings go forward 
everything will be cleared 
he sort of gave us a preview of it and if he says what he said 
his preview was satisfactory said sen jesse helms rnc 
sen alan simpson rwyo said of sullivan he was never in 
favor of retaining roe vs wade 
sen gordon humphrey rnm an opponent of abortion said that 
on the basis of his questioning of sullivan at the meeting he is 
convinced sullivan believes in his heart that the roe vs wade 
decision should be overturned 
earlier humphrey had said he was concerned that some senators 
who met with sullivan in advance of his confirmation hearing next 
week reported the nominee personally supported the supreme court 
decision legalizing abortion 
asked after the meeting with sullivan if he had any reservations 
about the secretarydesignate humphrey said not in my mind on 
the basis of this meeting 
on tuesday humphrey said he saw little likelihood the sullivan 
nomination would be blocked 
lets put it plainly dr sullivan is the only black nominee to 
the cabinet it would be an embarrassment to the president an 
embarrassment to the republican party if the nomination encountered 
any trouble and we dont want that humphrey said then 
we want to make the best of the situation and thats what weve 
been striving to do by encouraging the white house to surround 
sullivan with people experienced in government and who would 
actively support the president on abortion he said 
bush in a bid to placate antiabortion groups will name 
constance horner as undersecretary of hhs an administration source 
declining to be named publicly said today horner director of the 
office of personnel management under president reagan is considered 
acceptable by antiabortion lawmakers 
the horner appointment was initally reported by the washington 
post the new york times and the washington times 
sen strom thurmond rsc said that in his meeting with 
sullivan he said that personally he would favor abortions in 
three instances the life of the mother rape or incest but he says 
that hes going to go with president bushs policies and i think 
thats responsible 
bush also has said he favors abortion in those same circumstances 
in addition sullivan has said he opposes federal spending on 
abortions except for those three exceptions a position bush also 
has supported 
according to sen bob packwood rore and ranking republican on 
the senate finance committee which has scheduled a feb 1 
confirmation hearing for sullivan the doctor was mystified by all 
the interest in the abortion issue 
i think he was stunned and not prepared for the fervor over 
something that he regarded as a relatively slight part of what would 
be his responsibilities and he has the proportion right it is a 
slight part said packwood who supports womens right to make 
their own decisions on abortion 
hhs with a nearly 400 billion budget this year encompasses the 
medicaid medicare and social security programs as well as the 
public health service and the food and drug administration 
packwood said he was impressed with sullivan the founder of the 
morehouse school of medicine in atlanta and hoped he would not be 
hamstrung by antiabortion concerns in his personnel appointments 
i would hope that in picking someone whos going to head the 
health care financing administration that hed pick somebody that 
has some knowledge about how we can contain health costs not are 
they prochoice or antichoice on abortion packwood said

president bush said wednesday he hopes the 
federal reserve boards concern about inflation wont lead the 
central bank to stifle economic growth by driving up interest rates 
bush said he believes the economy is reasonably stable and 
he added theres no signals out there in the markets that this 
economy is in real trouble 
the presidents comments in an oval office interview with two 
newspaper reporters came one day after federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan told a house committee that the central bank is 
likely to keep a tight grip on the money supply to control inflation 
bush said he had not read greenspans comments and preferred not 
to get into commenting on such testimony 
he did say i havent talked to alan lately but i dont want 
to see us move so strongly against the fear of inflation that we 
impede growth we have to keep expanding opportunities for the 
working men and women of this country 
also wednesday the federal reserves district banks reported 
stronger economic activity in december and early january fueled by 
strength in retail sales and manfacturing 
the report based on surveys conducted by the 12 district banks 
found little change in other sectors of the economy demand for bank 
loans was generally flat construction work was subdued in most 
parts of the country and continuing dry weather threatened the 
winter wheat crop in some areas 
it would appear on the basis of these reports that the 
national economy gained momentum in recent weeks as consumer 
spending strengthened manufacturing activity continued to rise and 
producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment said 
the report 
the survey was prepared for the feb 78 meeting of the federal 
reserves open market commitee the panel that sets monetary policy 
for the central bank the federal reserve has appeared to be pushing 
up interest rates since march to dampen inflation pressures and 
contain economic growth 
greenspan in his comments tuesday said that strains on 
factories production capacity and a tight labor market could be 
expected to keep inflation pressures high and that the nation would 
risk a serious intensification of inflationary pressures at some 
nottoodistant point 
given the longrun costs of inflation he said the federal 
reserve might well be advised to err more on the side of 
restrictiveness than of stimulus 
the federal reserves survey of economic conditions found 
unexpectedly high retail sales throughout the country including 
strong sales of new cars and trucks 
in manufacturing production was at or above november levels 
several industries were using most of their production capacity but 
only a few such as chemicals reported that limits on capacity had 
constrained production 
as use of capacity rises economists fear factories will have 
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand leading to shortages 
and price increases 
in an indication of future activity manufacturers reported plans 
to increase capital spending in the coming year mostly for new 
equipment rather than to expand plants 
while the survey found economic activity overall to be strong 
the philadelphia district reported indications that the pace of 
the advance may be slackening 
the district reported that manufacturers expect to ease activity 
during the first half of the year and that retailers were generally 
cautious about sales and are keeping inventories under tight control

the pilot of a plane that crashed last 
april killing the montana secretary of state may not have been 
medically qualified to fly and may have suffered a heart attack just 
before the crash federal authorities say 
crashes like the one that killed jim waltermire have resulted in 
a recommendation that the federal aviation administration tighten 
regulation of the medical condition of pilots an investigator said 
waltermire 39 and the 64yearold pilot james andrew morris 
died april 8 when the twinengine plane they were flying crashed in 
a snowstorm 
at the time waltermire was the leading candidate for the 
republican gubernatorial nomination he was returning to helena 
after a campaign appearance 
the national transportation safety board report did not decide 
the cause of the crash saying the airplane was destroyed and there 
was little evidence on what happened before the crash 
however ntsb investigator verlin tranter said morris medical 
history suggests that he may have suffered an acute incapacitating 
event such as a heart attack or stroke under the stress of the 
difficult landing 
hc burton the faa flight surgeon in salt lake city who 
reviewed morris file after the crash said tuesday that morris had 
heart problems and high blood pressure that required drugs to 
control 
authorities at the faas aeromedical certification branch in 
oklahoma city concerned about morris heart problems had written 
to the pilot only three days before the crash asking for more 
medical information burton said 
had that review been begun earier officials said the veteran 
pilot may have been found medically unfit to continue flying but 
they stressed that at the time of the crash morris permission to 
fly had not been revoked and he had done nothing illegal 
i dont think mr morris was trying to violate anything 
tranter said wednesday but he was getting up there in years 
tranter said morris had a valid certificate for a commercial 
pilot 
but in a telephone interview wednesday tranter said morris may 
have held the certificate only because lax supervision of medical 
records at the faa branch 
he said that when a medical certificate is issued after a quick 
examination the examination report is sent to the faa center for 
more detailed evaluation the faa center can ask for more 
information if it doubts a pilots fitness to fly as it did in 
morris case during that evaluation the certificate remains valid 
tranter and burton said morris had a history of ischemic 
events similar to minor heart attacks and an electrocardiogram 
suggested possible heart muscle damage but morris showed no 
symptoms of heart disease and denied experiencing chest pain 
nevertheless burton said the conditions were in place to 
explain an acute cardiovascular event the severe stress he was 
encountering in landing that plane could have been the precipitating 
factor 
tranter said that as a result of the waltermire crash and similar 
incidents the ntsb has recommended the faa change its procedures 
possibly by revoking a medical certificate immediately if the 
evaluation center has doubts about a pilots medical fitness

the air force removed the warheads from five of 
its 50 mx nuclear missiles late last year after a summertime 
accident in which one missile came loose and fell to the bottom of 
its underground silo according to a published report 
the five missiles were part of the same production lot and air 
force investigators discovered a common problem that forced the 
safety action the washington post said 
the service is still trying to decide how to repair the five 
missiles each of which is designed to carry 10 warheads the paper 
added quoting unidentified sources 
the air force refused to confirm the account on wednesday 
acknowledging only that a single mx missile had been taken off alert 
last june following an accident 
that accident previously had been reported by newspapers in 
wyoming where fe warren air force base is located the nations 
mx or peacekeeper missiles are all deployed at fe warren 
the air force also insisted wednesday without elaborating that 
the nations entire mx force of 50 missiles was on alert at this 
time 
we have 50 missiles that are deployed and operational at this 
time said lt col don christianson a spokesman at fe warren 
christianson refused to say whether any problem missiles had been 
replaced with new missiles in order to maintain the alert force 
the spokesman agreed however that one mx missile had been taken 
off alert its warheads removed and its components broken down as 
part of a safety investigation after an incident last june 
last summer we received indications of an electrical 
disconnection with a peacekeeper mx missile inside its silo 
christianson said 
an investigation was conducted and a structural failure in a 
support skirt was found to be the cause there was no safety threat 
the reports of the investigation are classified however so i cant 
go further 
the post said wednesday the missile had fallen between six inches 
and a foot when it came unglued from its underground launch 
canister the canister envelops the missile and is used to propel 
the fourstage mx from its silo before the main rocket motor is 
ignited 
the newspaper said the fall of the 195000pound missile was 
sufficient to cause grave damage and to require extensive 
repairs and when the air force further investigated the matter 
it concluded the missile was one of a batch of five that had been 
subject to a particular production problem the paper said 
air force officials responded by ordering removal of the 
10warhead packages atop each of the other four suspect missiles to 
relieve the weight and pressure on their canister bonds pending 
corrective action the paper concluded 
the air force so far has been authorized to build 50 of the 
missiles and to deploy them at fe warren 
former president ronald reagan pushed congress for permission to 
build 50 more mx missiles and to base them on mobile railcar 
launchers the administration of president bush has yet to make a 
final decision on whether to push that same program or endorse 
another program to develop a truckmounted singlewarhead midgetman 
nuclear missile

demands for the creation of such an office in the protest the 
workers performed their jobs but pledged to donate their first three 
hours pay to the pope to help feed the poor 
archbishop jan schootte a belgian who handles vatican labor 
relations said at the time that the protest was unjustified and 
that negotiations were in progress toward creating the office

president bush today named an eightmember 
panel to recommend ethical standards for government officials 
saying he wants an unambigious code of conduct to avoid even the 
appearance of conflict of interest 
bush this week is making ethics a continuing theme to ensure 
that he does not face the allegations of an administration sleaze 
factor that dogged his predecessor 
we need an unambiguous code a code of conduct to ensure that 
those who serve the public trust avoid any actual or apparent 
conflict between their personal and public interest he said in 
setting up the commission on federal ethics law reform by executive 
order 
bush said current ethics rules do not adequately serve to 
eliminate use of public funds for private gains he said the laws 
are fragmented and confusing 
bush ordered his new commission to give him recommendations for 
new legislation by march 9 
the panels chairmen are griffin bell the former attorney 
general in the carter administration and malcolm wilkey a senior 
judge on the us court of appeals in washington 
other panel members are former white house counsels fred fielding 
and lloyd cutler washington attorney jan baran former rep 
harrison schmitt of new mexico former counsel to the senate armed 
services committee r james woolsey and judith bello former 
counsel to the us trade representatives office 
on tuesday bush asked the director of the office of government 
ethics frank nebeker to brief all senior administration officials 
on ethical and conflictofinterest standards required of them said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
bush had proposed during his campaign that such briefings be held 
on an annual basis and nebeker wrote to him on the day after the 
nov 8 election offering to conduct the sessions said fitzwater 
fitzwater said the 10minute meeting with nebeker on tuesday was 
for symbolic value to emphasize the importance bush attaches to 
ethical conduct 
more than 100 members of the reagan administration in which bush 
served as vice president were at various times accused of unethical 
or improper behavior two of president reagans closest advisers 
lynn nofziger and michael deaver were convicted of offenses 
associated with their lobbying after they left the administration 
while a string of allegations against reagans longtime friend and 
attorney general edwin meese iii battered the justice department 
an independent prosecutor declined to seek indictment of meese 
but the justice departments own ethics office concluded this month 
that he had engaged in conduct that should not be tolerated of any 
government employee 
democrats assailed the sleaze factor and used it as 
ammunition in the fall campaigns bush responded by saying 
repeatedly that he intended to have an administration that hews to 
high ethical standards 
bush supported president reagans veto of ethics legislation 
passed by congress last year but said he wants to introduce his own 
package it is expected to contain the same standards where 
applicable for congress as it sets for the executive branch 
employees last years package set differing standards 
the new commission will take testimony on simplification or 
expansion of current ethics rules and will make recommendations to 
bush for legislation on the issue 
bush has put his white house legal counsel boyden gray in charge 
of coordinating ethics policy 
on thursday the president will continue to spotlight the issue by 
meeting with senior executive employees to emphasize the ethics 
provisions of the law and their responsibilities and what he expects 
of them said fitzwater 
on friday he will talk to the inspectors general of the 
government departments to emphasize their role in ethics enforcement

of schoolchildren toured 
it was a part of a protest by sheriffs and their representatives 
from across georgia who are forced to house more than 4100 state 
prisoners because state prisons have no room 
state prisons currently house about 18700 prisoners 43 percent 
more than they were designed to hold 
gov joe frank harris ordered the buses away calling the display 
totally irresponsible jarvis denied the charge saying he had 
informed capitol security guards and atlanta police they were coming 
this is not a sideshow this is business jarvis said of the 
protest he described the prisoners as nonviolent 
jarvis said the demonstration was to support senate bill 149 
which would let counties decide whether they want to accept overflow 
state prisoners for long periods 
jarvis who said his jail leads the state with 250 overflow state 
prisoners was asked where the state should put them if it cant 
require counties to house them 
thats not my problem where am i going to put them he said 
under current law counties can be forced to accept the inmates 
they are paid 15 a day per prisoner which jarvis said is about 
half the actual cost 
hall county sheriff dick mecum whose jail had a costly uprising 
blamed on overcrowding during the christmas holidays said 
legislative priorities are skewed 
if atlanta wants to build a stadium let them build a domed 
stadium but let them pay for it leave us out of it he said at a 
news conference inside the capitol he was referring to legislation 
that would pay for a domed stadium with hotelmotel tax revenues 
the 7 billionplus budget proposed by harris for fiscal 1990 
includes no money for more prisons even though corrections 
commissioner david evans has asked for 7100 new prison beds said 
john jeffries of clarke county vice president of the association 
county commissioners of georgia 
many county jails have more state overflow inmates alone than 
they have beds said sheriff greg coursey of burke county president 
of the georgia sheriffs association he said his jail with 22 beds 
has 44 inmates he was forced to accept from the state 
he said sheriffs are being hit with lawsuits spurred by 
overcrowding poor hygiene and riots 
just this week overcrowded jails in colquitt and turner counties 
reported minor uprisings and overcrowding was a factor in recent 
disturbances at prisons in milledgeville and hall county 
these things are going to continue to pop up as long as weve 
got too many prisoners jarvis said

passengers miffed that a train skipped 
their stop delayed the train for 19 minutes in protest sparking a 
counterrebellion by riders who wanted the train to proceed 
authorities said wednesday 
human oversight and human error were the reasons why the 7 
pm metronorth commuter railroad train from grand central breezed 
by the fleetwood station tuesday night said metronorth spokesman 
daniel brucker 
the train due to stop in fleetwood at 726 pm skipped the 
stop to the consternation of the 50 to 60 passengers who wanted to 
get off there and pulled in three minutes later at bronxville said 
brucker angry commuters delayed the train for 19 minutes by holding 
the doors open as they demanded explanations from the engineer and 
train crew 
some passengers insisted the train back up the threequarters of 
a mile to the bypassed station but brucker said to do so would have 
violated federal regulations 
witnesses said a counterrebellion broke out when commuters 
headed for stations up the line tried to remove the fleetwood 
passengers from the doorways about 1500 passengers were on the 
train brucker said 
brucker said dispatchers ordered a southbound express train to 
stop at the bronxville station and pick up the fleetwood passengers 
at 810 pm 
the railroad may consider disciplinary charges against the 
engineer who was not identified the spokesman said

john cleese won libel damages wednesday from a 
newspaper that claimed he had increasingly come to resemble basil 
fawlty the manic hotel owner he played in the hit television series 
fawlty towers 
his lawyer roderick dadak said cleese did not tweak peoples 
ears or routinely fly into manic or irrational rages and the claim 
that in real life he resembles basil fawlty is absurd 
in an outofcourt settlement approved wednesday by the high 
court cleese 49 accepted undisclosed substantial damages to 
be donated to a charity of his choice from publisher robert 
maxwells mirror group newspapers the newspaper group also agreed 
to pay cleeses legal costs and publish an apology 
the newspaper groups lawyer simon gallant said the article 
should not have been published and apologized for embarrassing and 
distressing cleese 
the daily mirror reported in august 1987 that cleese a founding 
member of the monty python comedy troupe had got into the habit of 
painfully tweaking the ears of fellow cast members and flew into a 
rage when they objected during the filming of a fish called 
wanda 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified friend who said 
colleagues were complaining that cleese had become increasingly like 
the sour abusive hotel keeper he created in the 1970s series 
fawlty towers 
dadak said cleese had actually gotten along very well with fellow 
cast members the film which also starred jamie lee curtis and 
kevin kline was released last year and became one of the years 
biggest hits

authorities wednesday raided the 
offices of three companies and the homes of 12 people in an 
investigation of allegations that west german firms helped libya 
build a suspected chemical weapons plant 
some politicians meanwhile accused chancellor helmut kohls 
government of bungling west germanys initial response to the 
allegations and a magazine reported that companies had helped iraq 
build a rocket factory 
customs authorities searched the offices and homes on suspicion 
that export laws had been violated with deliveries to the libyan 
plant said hubertus voegele spokesman for the prosecutors office 
in offenburg 
he declined to identify the businesses searched but confirmed 
that the imhausenchemie firm of lahr was among them 
imhausenchemie is suspected of playing a major role in building 
the factory in rabta about 60 miles south of the libyan capital of 
tripoli 
us officials say libya intends to produce poison gas at the 
plant libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory 
west german officials who conducted the searches in cities 
throughout the country seized a huge quantity of material 
especially from imhausenchemie that will take time to examine 
voegele said 
up to now there are no grounds for any arrests but we have a 
lot of material to go through he told the associated press 
allegations of west german involvement in the libyan plant came 
to light late last year 
kohls government at first denied any wrongdoing by west german 
firms and exonerated imhausenchemie after an investigation earlier 
this month 
but officials have acknowledged over the past two weeks that 
several companies appear to have provided materials or knowhow to 
the libyans including a company owned by the government salzgitter 
industriebau ag 
a day after us senators accused kohls government of looking 
the other way during such operations the foreign affairs committee 
of the west german parliament met in special session wednesday to 
discuss official handling of the affair 
members of the opposition social democratic party singled out 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and finance minister gerhard 
stoltenberg for criticism 
lawmaker norbert gansel said stoltenberg did nothing after 
learning from the us embassy in bonn last may that washington 
suspected west german firms of involvement with the libyan plant 
another prominent social democrat karsten voigt said it was 
unbelievable genscher could have been uninformed for months 
about intelligence reports that west german firms helped with the 
plant 
voigt said the scandal had reduced west germanys international 
prestige to a low point 
genscher met with world jewish congress leader edgar bronfman on 
wednesday for talks that centered on the scandal 
bronfman said genscher assured him west germany would do its best 
to see that the libyan plant would not be used to produce chemical 
weapons 
we want to make sure that the teeth of the tiger get pulled 
bronfman said 
also wednesday the weekly magazine stern said west german 
companies were heavily involved in an iraqi rocket development 
project 
west german companies had shipped technology and equipment to 
iraq for a research and development center that by all indications 
is a rocket factory the magazine said 
it described the factory as a heavily guarded plant near the city 
of mosul about 210 miles north of baghdad 
stern identified the projects general contractor as gildemeister 
projekta of bielefeld 
a gildemeister official said the company had made deliveries for 
the facility but called sterns contention that it was for rocket 
production was utterly ridiculous 
we are building a laboratory and workshop complex that 
resembles facilities at universities and technical colleges said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there is no way to produce rockets there at best you can run a 
few little experiments he said 
the official said gildemeister obtained federal export licenses 
for all shipments economics minister helmut haussmann confirmed his 
ministry had one authorization on file from june 
haussmann who two weeks ago announced tougher measures to 
protect against export violations said better international 
coordination is needed to limit the spread of arms and chemical 
weapons technology 
west germany is the worlds fifthlargest supplier of arms and 
exports at least half of its chemical production each year because 
of its dependence on raw material imports and income from 
manufacturedgoods exports bonn has taken a lessconfrontational 
approach toward nations such as libya and has avoided trade 
sanctions as a lever in political disputes

the senate opened for business wednesday and 
senators like merchants at a bazaar quickly lined up to offer a 
dizzying array of legislative proposals 
and like a bazaar some of the offerings were shiny new some 
were somewhat shopworn and others were tired and battered and dulled 
after years of legislative mauling 
among wednesdays actions 
a bipartisan group of senators opposed to a 50 percent 
congressional pay raise proposed legislation that would roll back 
the increase if the house lets it become law by ducking a vote 
the dozen sponsors split evenly between democrats and 
republicans made clear they wanted to turn up the pressure on the 
house which appears headed toward allowing the large increase to 
become law automatically 
chief senate sponsors larry pressler rsd and charles e 
grassley riowa said the rollback provision of their bill would 
keep the pressure on the house even if the pay raise becomes law 
through house inaction 
a proposal for a uniform closing time for polls across the 
country during presidential election years the proposal by sens 
brock adams dwash and donald riegle dmich was designed to 
eliminate television network projections of presidential races 
before the polls are closed in western states 
a bill from sen alan cranston dcalif that would provide 
cost of living increases in compensation rehabilitation education 
and training benefits paid to veterans who have serviceconnected 
disabilities 
legislation by sens william v roth rdel and wendell ford 
dky that would put the federal budget on a twoyear cycle instead 
of the current yearly process 
a renewed effort from sen edward m kennedy dmass to raise 
the nations minimum wage from 335 to 455 the increase which 
would be the first in eight years died in the closing days of the 
100th congress 
an ethics in government act proposed by sen strom thurmond 
rsc that was approved by the 100th congress but vetoed by 
president reagan last november the bill restricts former members of 
congress from lobbying the legislative branch and top executive 
branch officials for 12 months after leaving government service 
a republican campaign finance reform proposal that would among 
other things restrict political action committees from giving more 
than 1000 to any one candidate compared to 5000 under present 
law 
another republican bill by senate minority leader bob dole of 
kansas that would require a report from the president on what 
foreign nations are aiding in the production of chemical weapons 
that bill would trigger sanctions against such companies 
prohibiting them from exporting goods into the united states 
another dole bill would gradually repeal the earnings test 
which restricts the amount retirees under the age of 70 may earn 
without losing a portion of their social security pension the law 
permits retirees under 65 to earn up to 6480 a year without 
penalty those 65 to 69 may earn 8880 for each additional dollar 
earned the beneficiary loses 50 cents of social security 
a proposal by sen al gore dtenn calling for an 
international alliance for environmental progress the package 
would include legislation designed to confront the socalled 
greenhouse effect and promote global cooperation on environmental 
issues 
an aids bill proposed by cranston that would establish a grant 
program to help communities develop coordinated systems of care to 
people infected with the disease 
also landing in the hopper was a bill to provide more than 17 
billion to carry out programs contained in last falls omnibus 
narcotics law congress approved the drug bill last year but left 
town without furnishing federal agencies with the funds to carry out 
most of the programs 
congress is ready to work with the administration to stop the 
scourge of drugs said rep charles rangel dny in unveiling 
the measure he is sponsoring with sen daniel p moynihan dny 
and rep benjamin gilman rny but he left uncertain exactly how 
lawmakers would find the money and still remain within tight budget 
constraints 
gilman also vowed to reintroduce his 1988 bill to impose a 
modest excise tax increase on beer cigarettes and wine to raise 
funding for our war on drugs

a recently discovered herpes virus may activate 
the aids virus and join with it to kill critical diseasefighting 
blood cells in aids a testtube study says 
blood cells infected with both viruses died faster than those 
infected with just the aids virus researchers reported in 
thursdays issue of the british journal nature 
the herpes virus had previously been identified in many people 
with acquired immune deficiency sydrome the researchers said 
the possible role of the virus in aids was discussed publicly 
last year by one of the studys coauthors robert gallo of the 
national cancer institute 
at that time gallo said the virus called herpesvirus6 appears 
to be harmless or produce only mild disease in people not also 
infected by the aids virus called hiv1 
herpesvirus6 discovered in 1986 differs from its betterknown 
cousins that that cause cold sores or genital infections 
the new work is reported by scientists at the cancer institute 
and bionetics research inc of rockville md 
they found that blood cells infected with herpesvirus6 plus the 
aids virus died faster than those infected with either virus alone 
the combination killed faster than would be expected if each virus 
were acting independently researchers said 
researchers also found evidence that herpesvirus6 could make the 
aids more active within cells and that it could activate a segment 
of genetic material in the aids virus that regulates reproduction

officials on wednesday abandoned hope of 
finding any more survivors of the earthquake and mudslide that 
inundated three mountain villages and said this settlement would be 
dedicated as a common grave 
along with the bad news that no more survivors could expect to be 
found there also was good news officials said the death toll from 
mondays disaster was only about a quarter of the 1000 they 
originally had estimated 
in addition a young man described how his 6dayold cousin 
miraculously survived the quake held aloft in her fathers hands as 
he and his household died in a torrent of mud 
kholmurod barotov 17 a worker in a sharora bakery said his 
mother had gone to stay with her sister who had just given birth to 
a daughter 
his aunts house was completely buried by the mudslide but the 
little girl survived because her father 30yearold herdsman 
saifulo khodzhayev held her above his head as he and the rest of 
the family died he said 
we will transform the settlement of sharora into a common grave 
with a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe 
said khusain kasymov communist party chief in the tadzhikistan 
republics gissar region 
the religious leader of predominantly moslem tadzhikistan akbar 
kakharov participated in discussions leading to that decision

the farming settlement and make it into a common grave

early monday the official news media estimated that as many as 
1000 people might have died 
but khayoyev told reporters in an impromptu interview wednesday 
that 274 people were confirmed dead there may be a differnce of 
five or seven people in casualties but no more he said 
he said a nationwide census completed only four days before the 
quake struck helped provide a quick and accurate count of the 
villages residents 
officials said the earthquake which was recorded as 54 on the 
richter scale toppled all 80 brickandstraw dwellings in the 
settlement of okulibolo located on the north side of the babatag 
hills about 20 miles southwest of the tadzhikistan capital dushanbe 
the quake loosened saturated soil on both sides of the hill on 
the north side it came crashing down in seconds onto sharora which 
was located next to okulibolo 
but on the south side about 1 miles away the mud slipped 
slowly down the hill toward okulipoyen the town was destroyed but 
residents managed to escape in time 
all flags were at halfstaff plays and concerts were canceled 
and restaurants were shut down in dushanbe and across the small 
republic as a day of mourning was declared 
khayoyev said losses were estimated at 24 million according to 
tass 
he said 75 people had been hospitalized in dushanbe and gissar 
and that 17 had been discharged 
the homeless were being put up in mobile wagons shepherds 
dwellings and tent tass said the number of people involved was not 
given 
tass said the destroyed villages would be rebuilt elsewhere a 
was taken to rebuild at a new place the village of sharora which 
had been turned into a common grave by underground shocks designers

construction will start in several days time

a routine inspection of an eastern airlines jet 
arriving from colombia failed to reveal a cache of hidden cocaine 
but string holding the drug packets in place broke and the cocaine 
dropped into view authorities said wednesday 
eastern employees spotted the hiding place on the l1011 
passenger jet tuesday as it was moving from the international 
terminal to the domestic departure area to continue its flight to 
new york the us customs service said 
flight 50 from cali landed at miami international airport just 
before 4 pm and was routinely searched by customs inspectors who 
found nothing said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
but the string holding the drug above a lavatory broke and 
packets fell through a ceiling panel customs agents said a second 
search revealed 47 pounds of cocaine above the lavatories and in two 
exit doors 
the placement seemed to indicate someone with extensive access 
to the aircraft and extensive knowledge of its structure had 
stored the drug customs said in a news release no arrests were 
made 
the jet was released to eastern but the customs service is 
investigating to determine if punitive measures will be taken

in a rare public admission white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday a news leak about a 
bailout plan for the savings and loan industry was a trial 
balloon floated by the administration to gauge reaction 
but minutes later fitzwater made a speedy retreat saying he had 
been wrong 
fitzwater as well as president bush and white house chief of 
staff john sununu were bombarded during the day with questions 
after the washington post reported the administration was 
considering imposing a fee on customers of savings and loan 
institutions to help the federal government bail out the troubled 
sampl industry 
after fielding numerous questions fitzwater finally told a 
packed news briefing what youre looking at today is a trial 
balloon 
as laughter arose from the press fitzwater continued and 
were willing to talk about it willing to discuss it and well see 
how it flies but there will be other trial balloons and i trust 
youll all be here for those explanations too 
when a reporter complimented him on his candor fitzwater 
laughingly said i wasnt sure it was a trial balloon till i had a 
call at 6 am this morning that said the story leaked last night 
and the secretary of the treasury nicholas brady is on three 
television talk shows this morning 
thats a dead giveaway the press secretary said 
shortly after his briefing fitzwater circulated through the 
press room to change his story saying he was backpedaling on the 
trial balloon 
he said he was wrong in suggesting brady went on television to 
sell the savings and loan plan instead he said brady had 
consented to the interviews to talk about leveraged buyouts and was 
hit with questions about sampl plan in the wake of the post story 
it was not an intentional trialballoon fitzwater said

a man whose flagburning conviction in texas is 
the focus of a supreme court case on the limits of permissible 
public protest said wednesday that setting fire to the american flag 
is his idea of a thousand points of light 
gregory joey johnson a member of the revolutionary communist 
youth brigade told a news conference the court case is an 
opportunity to examine the real meaning of the flag 
around the world wherever people rise up quite often one of 
the first things they do is torch the red white and blue johnson 
said now thats what i call a thousand points of light 
johnsons sarcastic echo of one of president bushs campaign 
themes underscored the timely nature of the court dispute 
bush stressing patriotic values during his campaign attacked 
democratic opponent gov michael dukakis of massachusetts for 
vetoing legislation to require that massachusetts public school 
teachers lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance 
the high court announced last october it will consider 
reinstating johnsons flagburning conviction that was overturned by 
a texas appeals court the state court said burning the flag was a 
form of symbolic expression protected by the constitution 
the high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in march 
or april and announce a decision by july 
johnson 32 and living in new york city now was sentenced to a 
year in jail and fined 2000 for his part in a demonstration during 
the 1984 republican national convention in dallas 
the protest culminated with a rally in front of dallas city hall 
in which demonstrators poured lighter fluid on an american flag and 
ignited it 
johnson said wednesday he had no part directly in igniting the 
flag although he approved the action and gave speeches during the 
rally 
he said he believed he was singled out for prosecution because 
the dallas police knew he was a member in the revolutionary 
communist youth brigade 
the center for constitutional rights which is representing 
johnson filed a legal brief with the supreme court on wednesday 
urging it not to revive johnsons conviction 
david cole said the case seems to be a return to the 1960s 
when protests against the war in vietnam were reaching their peak 
he said the state of texas is saying that it and it alone can 
define the meaning of the flag and that it can prohibit private 
citizens acting in a political context from using even their own 
flag for any purpose contrary to that defined by the state 
the texas law used to prosecute johnson forbids the desecration 
of a venerated object if that is likely to cause serious 
offense 
police officers who arrested johnson said they were seriously 
offended by the flag burning 
cole said many states as well as the federal government have 
laws against burning the flag although it does not appear there are 
many cases where the statutes have been enforced 
the supreme court in 1974 threw out the conviction of a college 
student who taped a peace symbol onto a flag the court in 1943 
ruled that the government may not compel citizens to salute the 
flag but the justices never have decided whether laws against 
destruction of the flag are constitutional

the government wants substantial 
cuts in the number of us nuclear warheads in europe as part of its 
goal of reducing to an absolute minimum the role of the weapons 
there it was reported wednesday 
the zdf network quoted from a position paper prepared by various 
government ministries in bonn and approved by the federal security 
council it did not say when the document was approved 
the government position still calls for effective nuclear 
forces in europe despite the envisioned reductions and views the 
us military presence as irreplaceable according to zdf 
west germany has been reassessing its stance on nuclear missiles 
in hopes of improving ties with the soviet bloc the missile issue 
remains particularly sensitive in this country on the front lines of 
the eastwest conflict 
for example defense minister rupert scholzs statement earlier 
this month that west germany would agree to the replacement of 600 
lance shortrange missiles sparked such a furor he later retracted 
it 
zdf said that according to the document the federal government 
wants to cut the role of nuclear weapons to the absolute minimum 
necessary 
the number of us nuclear warheads stored in europe should be 
reduced unilaterally probably to less than 2900 from the current 
number of approximately 4600 it quoted the document as saying 
however a necessary minimum needed for the credible deterrence 
in europe should be kept zdf said in reporting the governments 
stance 
defense ministry spokesman lt col werner widder said most of 
the report already was public knowledge 
however widder refused to confirm the federal government was 
aiming to cut the number of us nuclear warheads to less than 2900 
west germans have applauded the removal of intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles provided for in the treaty signed in december 1987 
by the soviet union and united states 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has been leading the 
calls for further steps toward disarmament and for greater trust in 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
west german public opinion polls have shown a growing trust in 
the soviet bloc 
a new survey presented by zdf as part of its report wednesday 
said 88 percent of those polled do not feel militarily threatened by 
soviet bloc countries it said only 10 percent were in favor of 
replacing the aging lance missiles pointed at east germany and 
czechoslovakia 
zdf said the poll was conducted by an outside research institute 
and surveyed 1017 west german citizens it did not provide a margin 
of error

prosecutors today searched the 
offices of three west german companies and the homes of 12 people 
suspected of helping libya build a chemical weapons factory 
authorities said 
a spokesman for the prosecutors office in offenburg hubertus 
voegele said one of the firms was imhausenchemie in lahr which is 
suspected of playing a major role in building and equipping the 
libyan plant 
voegele said the searches were conducted on suspicion that 
export laws had been violated he declined to name the other firms 
whose offices were searched but added they were located throughout 
the country 
the us government says the plant at rabta 60 miles south of 
the libyan capital of tripoli was built to make poison gas libya 
says it will manufacture medicine 
bonn officials initially dismissed the us allegations but have 
now launched a criminal investigation to determine if 
imhausenchemie and other companies illegally shipped arms 
hazardous substances or components that can be used to produce them 
the affair has deeply embarassed the west german government 
on tuesday news reports said an imhausenchemie employee had 
confirmed allegations the company played a key role in building the 
libyan plant 
the weekly stern magazine said imhausenchemie and a 
governmentowned company were aware that blueprints that were 
supposed to be shipped to hong kong to build a pharmaceuticals plant 
had ended up in libya 
the ard television network late tuesday reported that klaus hess 
a technical draftsman with imhausenchemie is said to have given 
evidence that imhausen shipped parts and chemicals to libya and 
further that imhausen employees helped build the facility in rabta 
ard did not disclose the source of its information but said the 
details were confirmed by the prosecutors office in karlsruhe the 
television also did not say if the employees traveled to libya to 
work on the plant 
imhausenchemie has denied accusations it was involved in the 
rabta plant 
this weeks stern said an official at imhausenchemie told 
investigators that officials at imhausen and the governmentowned 
salzgitter industriebau knew shipments of salzgitter blueprints 
ended up in libya instead of hong kong 
the magazine did not name the official and it was not known 
whether it was the same person identified in the ard report 
salzgitter officials acknowledged last week that the firm had 
done business with imhausenchemie but said it involved 
construction of a pharmaceuticals plant in hong kong salzgitter 
officials late tuesday denied any involvement in the rabta project 
in its report stern also said it had been clear to experts 
working for salzgitter that the libyan plant was not designed as a 
small factory for pharmaceuticals but as a large chemical plant 
for the production of highly poisonous substances 
the magazine reported last week that salzgitter which 
manufactures steel products and industrial equipment delivered 
blueprints for the libyan plant 
voegele has confirmed that an imhausenchemie employee had been 
questioned but declined to reveal what that person told 
investigators 
last week stern said the hong kong project called pharma 
150 was devised to disguise involvement by imhausenchemie in 
helping build the plant in libya which has the same name 
the magazine said this week that siemens the giant west german 
electrical firm sold switching and measuring equipment for pharma 
150 
siemens spokesman horst siebert said the company had delivered 
equipment to hong kong and said it had not done anything wrong 
stern telexed its report tuesday to other news organizations in 
advance of thursdays publication

a government science panel has dismissed as 
seriously flawed a study that concluded vietnam veterans 
suffered postwar physical problems due to exposure to the herbicide 
agent orange 
a report sent congress on wednesday concluded that data in the 
study conducted for the american legion do not support the 
conclusions drawn by the authors 
the american legion study was reviewed for congress by the agent 
orange working group of the department of health and human services 
domestic policy council 
the study is seriously flawed due to major problems in study 
design and execution the panel said in a memo written by its 
chairman dr vernon n houk director of the center for 
environmental health and injury control 
the study released last november contradicted other studies by 
the veterans administration and the federal centers for disease 
control their studies have found no significant health differences 
among veterans of the vietnam era regardless of whether they 
actually served in southeast asia 
the legions study said there were significant doserelated 
relationships between skin exposure to herbicides and subsequent 
development of skin conditions such as rash with blisters and change 
in skin color it also connected agent orange exposure to benign 
fatty tumors and risk for miscarriage among wives of von to vietnam veterans 
based on exposure to 
agent orange

confining the 250 men on death row to 
their cells creates dangerous suspicions among them a convicted 
murderer testified wednesday as a hearing on a federal lawsuit 
convened in san quentin prison 
leadoff witness rodney alcala convicted of kidnapping and 
murdering a 12yearold girl called for allowing the prisoners to 
mingle on tiers outside the cells so you know what everybodys 
attitude is whats going on in everybodys head 
its like if you live in a neighborhood and theres one guy who 
never comes out of his house you dont know what the guys going to 
do thats pretty important in our situation 
the men awaiting possible execution in the san quentin gas 
chamber were called to testify in a lawsuit that claims state prison 
officials are violating a 1980 court order on their housing and 
treatment in an isolated wing of the institution 
among other things the lawsuit contends the inmates are not 
given adequate access to the prison law library are improperly 
prohibited from leaving their cells in the daytime and are denied 
some of the exercise equipment and personal items guaranteed by the 
court order 
the state agreed to abide by the order in 1980 but officials say 
it has become obsolete and should be relaxed or repealed 
state officials say the growth in death row population from 40 in 
1980 to the current 250 has increased the cost and security risk of 
complying with some provisions they also say us supreme court 
rulings since 1980 broadening prison officials leeway to determine 
prison conditions have made it clear that conditions at san quentin 
comply with the constitution 
the 1980 order is at best irrelevant to the dictates of the 
law and at worst a dangerous and extravagant interference with 
professional prison management deputy attorney general john 
donhoff said in court papers 
lawyers for the prisoners say the state has no legal reason for 
violating the order only a political motive to avoid appearing soft 
on convicted killers 
us district judge stanley weigel who signed the 1980 order 
assigned the hearing to his former law clerk attorney robert riggs 
who acts as a monitor of the states compliance with weigels orders 
in several lawsuits over conditions at state prisons 
riggs in a report filed before the hearing started last week 
found apparent violations of various provisions including 
requirements to furnish an adequate law library allow condemned 
prisoners out of their cells for meals and other activities during 
the daytime and provide a covered exercise yard 
he ordered the state to show why it should not be held in 
contempt of court for violating weigels order 
the hearing began in san francisco federal court last week and 
was shifted across the bay to san quentin for the inmates testimony

the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission on wednesday urged congress to move cautiously in trying 
to use tax law changes to stem the current wave of leveraged buyouts 
you should be aware that your committees activities may 
influence a stock market that is skittish and nervous sec 
chairman david ruder told the senate finance committee 
ruder said sec studies after the october 1987 stock market crash 
showed that one factor contributing to its severity was legislation 
then being considered by the house ways and means committee to 
curtail some of the deductions on interest paid by companies to 
holders of highyield junk bonds 
ruder admitted that the double taxation of dividends first as 
part of the 34 percent income tax on corporations and again when 
they are distributed to shareholders as personal income is helping 
drive the leveraged buyout or lbo phenomenon 
but he said he opposed taxing the interest that leveraged 
companies pay on junk bonds as a way of equalizing the tax treatment 
between the two primary means for raising captital debt or bonds 
and stock or equity 
ruder like treasury secretary nicholas f brady who testified 
before him on tuesday said the better alternative would be to allow 
companies to treat as a deductible expense the dividends they pay or 
to give shareholders a tax credit for the corporate income taxes 
paid by a company 
but also like brady he added i do not believe we can do that 
given our enormous deficit problem 
in an lbo an investment group borrows heavily in order to buy 
out stockholders and take over the company often lbos are proposed 
by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover 
the companys new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of 
the company to pay back loans critics of the practice fear the high 
debt levels in a recession would endanger both the boughtout 
company and the banks and brokerage firms financing the buyout 
both the taxwriting finance and ways and means committees are 
reexamining leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending 25 
billion purchase of rjr nabisco co by lbo specialist kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co and the 13 billion buyout of kraft inc by 
phillip morris co last year 
those were the two biggest of more than 300 leveraged buyouts 
totaling nearly 100 billion in 1988 
sen lloyd bentsen dtex the finance committees chairman 
said the primary concern is the possibility the recent surge of 
leveraged buyouts has created a mountain of corporate debt that 
will make our next recession deeper and longer than it needs to be 
while bentsen said the goal is to balance the attractiveness of 
equity and debt financing that is clearly tilted to the debt side 
under current tax laws but he acknowledged it is going to be 
difficult to find the right combination of carrots and sticks

officials from opec and independent oilproducing 
nations huddled separately wednesday to plot strategy for thursdays 
joint meeting over cooperation in supporting crude oil prices 
afterward the independent group indicated support for opecs 
attempt to limit production and stated both producer and consumer 
nations would be served by stabilizing prices 
a senior opec source said separately that he was hopeful the 
cartel could reach agreement for output cuts by the independent 
producers but said that wasnt likely to happen immediately 
our unity is stronger now prices have strengthened and we are 
ready for a cooperative agreement said the senior opec source 
who requested anonymity 
this is the first step in a stepbystep move to push up oil 
prices he said 
a similar joint meeting was held last april when six nonopec 
producers met with representatives of the 13member organization of 
petroleum exporting countries and suggested they jointly cut their 
exports by 5 percent opec rejected that proposal 
this time some of the seven attending nonopec producers might 
offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent without 
asking for reciprocal cuts from opec nonopec sources have said 
this week 
the independents likely will want opec reassurance that the 
cartel would not increase its own production if they went ahead with 
their cuts 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widelytraded 
international crude oil was 1655 a barrel late wednesday in 
london up 54 cents from late tuesday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate jumped 58 cents wednesday to settle at 1812 a 
barrel after closing 21 cents higher on tuesday 
opec experts from algeria saudi arabia kuwait indonesia 
venezuela and nigeria met for several hours wednesday at the 
indonesian embassy 
at a brief news conference after the meeting opec director 
general subroto described the gathering as a preparatory meeting of 
cartel technicians 
he said technicians for opec and the nonopec nations would meet 
thursday morning to exchange information and we will see the 
market together and then what we can do together 
the groups planned to issue a joint statement afterward subroto 
said 
the nonopec group issued a communique afterward saying that 
representatives of angola china colombia egypt malaysia mexico 
and oman met with observers from the soviet union norway the yemen 
arab republic and the canadian province of alberta and the us 
states of alaska and texas 
the delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oil 
market stabilize an issue they consider of importance to both 
consumers and producers of oil the communique read this shared 
responsibility was perceived in spite of the variety of outlooks 
represented at the meeting 
the delegates were satisfied that the opec conference held in 
vienna last november had produced very positive results and they 
expressed the hope that those efforts would be sustained throughout 
the first half of 1989 the communique read

powerful tranquilizers with potentially dangerous 
side effects are being widely given to elderly people in rest homes 
often by untrained aides without medical supervision a study 
concludes 
such drugs are available only through a doctors prescription 
but many patients continue to be given the drugs months or years 
after examination by a doctor the studys principal author said 
wednesday 
it may well be that when they first started getting the stuff 
they needed it said dr jerry avorn of the beth israel hospital 
and harvard medical school in boston it may be that some people 
still need it but without followup examinations there is no 
assurance that the drugs are being used properly he said 
drugs like thorazine and haldol which are meant to treat 
psychotic patients can cause a disfiguring and sometimes 
irreversible problem called tardive dyskinesia in which patients 
develop uncontrollable facial twitches 
avorn found that use of the drugs is not limited to treatment of 
psychotics 
sometimes they are used as sedatives and thats not a good 
idea because they will have side effects that outweigh their 
advantages avorn said 
too high a dose of the drugs can increase confusion and lethargy 
thereby raising the chances that patients will fall and injure 
themselves avorn said 
if you oversedate a person you are quite likely to put them 
at risk of a fall that can lead to considerable disability or 
death he said 
twenty percent of elderly people who fracture their hips for 
example will die within one year avorn said 
avorn with stephen b soumerai of harvard and paul dreyer and 
kathleen connelly of the massachusetts department of public health 
surveyed 55 rest homes in massachusetts these are institutions for 
the care of elderly people not sick enough to be in nursing homes 
but too frail to live on their own avorn said 
the researchers found that 55 percent of the 1201 residents were 
taking at least one psychiatric drug and 39 percent were taking 
socalled major tranquilizers such as thorazine and haldol 
in a further study of 837 residents at 44 nursing homes the 
researchers found that about half had apparently not seen a doctor 
for evaluation of their mental health for at least a year 
onethird of the residents did poorly on standard tests of mental 
function it certainly raises the question of whether the 
medication might contribute in part to this lack of ability avorn 
said 
six percent of the residents had moderate to severe cases of 
tardive dyskinesia 
the findings will appear thursday in the new england journal of 
medicine 
dr stanley slater director of the geriatric research and 
training program at the national institute on aging in bethesda 
md said avorns study is not surprising but of course its a 
concern 
places for the care of the institutionalized elderly are 
constrained by a lack of resources so that most of the care comes 
from nonprofessionals slater said the people who provide the 
care are often minimumwage employees 
avorn said that although the survey was limited to rest homes in 
massachusetts the findings are probably typical of whats happening 
elsewhere we are pretty representative of this level of care 
around the country he said 
in december avorn and his colleagues reported on a similar 
misuse of mood altering drugs in nursing homes

the bush administration asked congress on 
wednesday to change us trade rules that international panels say 
violate an agreement with other trading countries 
if we want other nations to eliminate illegal trade barriers 
when we win before a panel we must be equally prepared to change 
our actions and policies when we lose said judith h bello 
general counsel to the us trade representative 
she was testifying before the house ways and means committees 
subcommittee on international trade 
we must show were not a scofflaw rep sam gibbons dfla 
agreed he is chairman of the subcommittee and a major force in 
trade policy 
the accord is the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
which has nearly 100 governments as members the gatt organization 
sponsors the uruguay round negotiations in which the us 
government has been trying unsuccessfully for a longterm agreement 
on ending subsidies to farmers these subsidies cost consumers and 
taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year 
ms bello said the rules she wants changed are more important 
than they seem because there are widespread doubts among other 
negotiators about us intentions 
at issue in tuesdays hearing was a tax on imports of petroleum 
and some petroleum products passed by congress in 1986 to help 
finance a superfund for cleaning up toxic waste the tax on 
imported products was 117 cents a barrel 35 cents more than the 
tax on us production of the same items 
in june 1987 an international panel ruled that the difference 
was a discrimination against other countries and a violation of 
gatt other governments threatened to retaliate against the united 
states to avoid that the reagan administration offered to 
negotiate compensation with the countries affected there have been 
talks with canada mexico and the 12 countries represented by the 
european economic community but no conclusion has been reached 
the community estimates that the tax costs its member countries 
266 million a year ms bello said it would be preferable to get 
rid of the differential 
also at issue is a user fee for work done by the us customs 
service based on the value of products imported another 
international panel ruled that also was a violation of the accord 
which says such fees should be based on actual cost to the customs 
service 
according to ella krucoff press officer for the european 
community in washington its members paid 222 million in such fees 
in 1987 
the us fee must be revised to tie it more closely to the 
actual cost of processing particular entries ms bello said 
the program brought in 787 million last year according to harry 
w carnes director of the us customs service user fee task force

the soviet union has been given the goahead to 
buy more us grain than had been previous specified including more 
quantities of wheat at subsidized prices the agriculture department 
announced wednesday 
in one action the soviets were told they can now buy up to 20 
million metric tons of grain in the 198889 year up from 16 million 
tons specified earlier purchases already total more than 12 million 
tons 
the department also said the soviets have bought another 150000 
tons of soybean meal which has a potential current market value of 
about 36 million 
under a longterm grain agreement the soviet union was 
originally limited to 12 million tons of us grain a year but that 
was increased to 16 million tons on dec 23 the agreement had 
expired last sept 30 but was later extended through dec 31 1990 
officials said the increase for 198889 takes into account 
recent public confirmation by soviet authorities that the soviet 
unions grain harvest last year was below expectations 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg also announced that 
moscow has been authorized an additional 2 million tons of wheat 
that it can buy under the departments export enhancement program 
or eep 
earlier this week for example the department announced an eep 
wheat sale to the soviet union of 635000 tons or about 233 
million bushels the subsidies shaved 2305 per ton off the regular 
market price or about 63 cents per bushel 
a metric tons is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sales of wheat and corn now total more than 116 million tons for 
delivery in the sixth year of the agreement which began last oct 1 
that includes about 102 million tons of corn and 14 million tons 
of wheat in addition the soviets have bought 450000 tons of 
soybeans 128 million tons of soybean meal and 500000 tons of 
grain sorghums 
under the agreement each ton of soybeans or meal counts for two 
tons of grain 
only wheat is approved for sale to the soviet union under the eep 
subsidy arrangement

fired national security council aide oliver 
north subpoenaed former house intelligence committee chairman lee 
hamilton and rep david mccurdy for norths upcoming trial in the 
irancontra case one of the congressmen confirmed wednesday 
also north has subpoenaed records from three house panels that 
tried unsuccessfully during 19851986 to determine what action he 
was taking on the contras behalf a house reply that sought to 
quash portions of the subpoenas complained that he sought the 
broadest imaginable range of documents 
at a court hearing us district judge gerhard gesell said the 
matter of subpoenaing two congressmen must be approached with some 
degree of accommodation and that were not going to pull them 
off the floor of congress to testify at norths trial 
north attorney barry simon didnt identify the two congressmen 
however mccurdy an okahoma democrat and a member of the house 
intelligence committee confirmed in an interview that he and 
hamilton had been subpoenaed by north hamilton dind chaired the 
committee during 198586 and is no longer a member of the committee 
a hearing is scheduled for friday to hear all objections to 
norths subpoenas including those seeking testimony from former 
president reagan and president bush 
two house staff members also have been subpoenaed by north simon 
said and congressional sources identified them as house 
intelligence committee employees 
the house filed a 22page motion seeking to quash large portions 
of norths request for documents from the house committees on 
intelligence foreign affairs and armed services the filing said 
the house stands ready to provide all documents which are 
material and relevant for the trial which is scheduled to begin 
next tuesday 
nort according to the house filing hopes to show that the 
committees in 1985 and 1986 already knew about his efforts on behalf 
of the contras from other sources making it irrelevant whether he 
misled or told the truth in responding to questions about his 
activities from capitol hill 
the former nsc aide asserts that what north was allegedly 
concealing in 198586 chiefly by false statements and document 
alteration and destruction house committees knew from other 
sources said the house filing 
north reasons that hence no crimes occurred for what the house 
knew north could not conceal from it 
norths dragnet subpoena is based on an amazing theory that 
failure to obstruct congress is a defense to an obstruction 
charge the house filing concluded 
norths house document subpoenas require surrender of the 
broadest imaginable range of privileged documents said the filing 
by steven ross counsel to the house clerk 
north is seeking everything the house committees have regarding 
providing support to the contras by private benefactors third 
countries john singlaub norths courier to the contras robert owen 
and codefendant richard secord who north enlisted to run the 
resupply operation 
north subpoenaed the whole set of records of the intelligence 
panels probe of the contra resupply operation which began after a 
contra resupply plane with american crewman eugene hasenfus aboard 
was shot down in nicaragua in october 1986 
ross also disclosed that norths attorneys at one point delivered 
to house counsel a subpoena for the house as a whole asking for 
records from the files of every member norths attorneys were 
told that house counsel wasnt authorized to accept service of such 
a subpoena 
north issued two subpoenas dec 28 for the intelligence and 
foreign affairs committees and issued two more subpoenas on 
inauguration day to the armed services and foreign affairs panels 
the house disclosed in its court filing 
four of the 12 criminal charges remaining against north are that 
in 1985 he concealed from congress his alleged efforts on behalf of 
the contras to raise funds arrange arms shipments or offer tactical 
advice another count says he concealed similar information at an 
august 1986 meeting in the white house situation room with members 
and staff of the house intelligence committee north is charged 
additionally with obstructing congress in november 1986 by altering 
destroying and concealing documents on the iran arms shipments and 
aid to the contras 
meanwhile independent counsel lawrence walsh in a court filing 
supported the governments motion to quash norths subpoena issued 
while ronald reagan was still president for any presidential 
documents concerning the arms sales to iran and support for the 
contras walsh also supported quashing a separate north subpoena to 
the executive offices custodian of records seeking videotapes and 
audio tapes of speeches by reagan or thenvice president george bush 
supporting the contras and documents on posttrip briefings for 
reagan or bush on the contras 
walsh said norths subpoenas for presidential documents are an 
attempt to delay the start of trial by requiring the government to 
provide massive unnecessary pretrial discovery

the army said wednesday it is replacing 
reserve soldiers with infantry and paramilitary police to reduce the 
time israelis must serve in the reserve and to cut the cost of 
controlling the palestinian uprising 
since the uprising began more than 13 months ago reserve duty 
has increased by about a third and the armys recent gettough 
policy in the occupied territories has come under increasing 
criticism by jews and arabs alike 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip on wednesday six 
palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with israeli soldiers 
arab reports and hospital officials said 
israeli and arab reports said jewish settlers in the west bank 
invaded the arab village of bidya on tuesday night to protest an 
injury to a 16yearold settler from a stone and emulated leaders of 
the palestinian uprising by issuing a warning leaflet 
you must know that such things if they continue will hurt 
you your property and your security said leaflet no 1 from the 
settlers in nearby ariel we are calling on you before it is too 
late and patience is lost 
gen ehud barak deputy chief of staff spoke of the personnel 
changes at a news conference in which he was repeatedly asked about 
growing palestinian casualties in the occupied territories with the 
introduction of a gettough policy against stonethrowing protesters 
barak said mobilized infantry units already have been deployed 
throughout the occupied west bank and gaza strip and now make up 
about 10 percent of the troops handling the revolt against israeli 
occupation 
we are trying to make these extra units more effective more 
mobile barak said 
regular soldiers also have been reinforced with paramilitary 
border police patrols whose strength has been increased by about 50 
percent in recent months he said 
he refused to discuss specific troop strength for security 
reasons but some reports have said an average of 10000 israeli 
troops have been deployed in the territories on any given day 
barak said one aim of using the police units was to try to reduce 
the amount of reserve duty that israelis have been asked to perform 
over the past 13 months 
reservists last year served an average of about 60 days he said 
greatly increasing defense spending and interfering with the 
reservists lives 
he said the goal was to cut this to between 42 and 44 days in the 
fiscal year starting april 1 or about the level it was before the 
uprising 
the deployment goals for reservists reflect reports that the 
defense ministry hopes to cut its spending for controlling the 
uprising from 222 million in the 16months ending march 31 to about 
124 million in the following 12 months 
the army is facing growing criticism over its policies in 
territories occupied by israel since the 1967 middle east war 
settlers have complained soldiers were not tough enough and 
leftwing israelis have questioned whether troops were not firing 
too freely some reserve soldiers also complained last week they 
were forced to beat palestinians to keep order 
recent complaints have centered on new policies allowing soldiers 
to fire plastic bullets at palestinians fleeing stonethrowing 
protests or blocking roads with stone barricades 
barak defended the use of plastic bullets introduced by the army 
as less lethal than standard lead ammunition but confirmed reports 
plastic bullets killed 47 palestinians since they came into use in 
july 
he said about a third of those deaths and most of the palestinian 
casualties came as soldiers fired in a lifethreatening 
situation but he said some deaths were due to mistakes 
according to hospital figures 368 palestinians have been killed 
since the uprising began dec 8 1987 fifteen israelis also have 
died 
barak gave slightly lower figures saying 352 palestinians were 
killed including 289 who died from in army gunfire 
he said at least 30 were killed by fellow palestinians he did 
not give other reasons but there are some cases where jewish 
settlers are being investigated for killing palestinians 
barak said more than 40 israeli civilians and about 300 soldiers 
have been wounded in the uprising he said that 4300 palestinians 
have been wounded but did not explain the difference from a 
monthsold figure listing at least 7000 palestinians injured

legislation to set a uniform nationwide poll 
closing time during presidential elections was introduced wednesday 
by sen brock adams dwash 
the bill is intended to prevent early projections of election 
results while polls on the west coast are still open 
election officials in the west have complained that early network 
television projections of the winner in the presidential race 
discourages voters in their states from going to the polls the 
lower turnout has affected the outcome of close local races 
officials have said 
after every presidential election the need for this bill is 
increasingly apparent said adams adding that last year the 
networks began their quadrennial scramble to project a winner in 
the presidential race almost two hours before polls closed in the 
west 
as the networks struggled to beat each other to the punch they 
delivered a severe blow to our electoral process said adams 
the bill calls for the polls to close simultaneously across the 
country at 7 pm pacific time 8 pm mountain 9 pm central and 
10 pm eastern poll closing times in hawaii and alaska would not 
be affected 
similar legislation was approved by the senate rules committee 
last year but was not acted on by the full senate during the rush 
to adjourn before the election

west german investigators are exploring leads 
that the giant siemens technology firm assisted in the construction 
of a chemical plant in libya by providing electronic control 
equipment and telephone gear a us government source said 
wednesday 
the offices of three west german companies and the homes of 12 
people suspected of assisting libya in violation of export laws were 
searched wednesday authorities in offenburg said only one of the 
firms imhausenchemie was identified by a spokesman for the 
prosecutors office 
siemens has denied any wrongdoing 
the us government source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the control equipment apparently was shipped to libya under an 
expired license while 10 tons of telephone equipment was mislabeled 
as being bound for the hong kong telephone exchange 
he said some investigators believe siemens role in advancing the 
plant project could grow larger as the probe proceeds 
siemens spokesman horst siebert said the munichbased company had 
delivered switching and measuring equipment for a project in hong 
kong but denied any wrongdoing or involvement with a libyan 
enterprise 
the state department spokesman charles e redman said he had no 
comment 
the investigation now is centered mostly on imhausenchemie and 
its alleged role in constructing the plant at rabta some 60 miles 
south of tripoli and also on intec another west german firm that 
reportedly helped libya convert transport planes into tankers to 
refuel frenchbuilt jets in midair so they could reach israel 
the idea was to bring the western wall in jerusalem other jewish 
holy places in the capital and tel aviv the most populous city in 
israel within range the source said 
siemens and also saltzgitter a wholly stateowned company that 
reportedly supplied plans for the plant are getting increased 
attention saltzgitter has denied its employees worked on the rabta 
factory 
the west german government initially disputed findings by 
separate us british and dutch investigations that linked west 
german firms to the project but subsequently acknowledged there was 
compelling evidence to support the allegations 
officials in west germany are conducting a criminal investigation 
to determine if imhausenchemie and other companies illegally 
shipped arms hazardous substances or components that can be used to 
produce them the affair has deeply embarrassed the west german 
government 
a former imhausenchemie manager who had buried damaging 
documents is cooperating with the investigators said the source he 
described the exemployee as a canary 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi has denied the plant was designed 
to produce chemical weapons and has offered to open it to 
international inspection former secretary of state george p 
shultz who led the us campaign to deny libya useful technology 
said before leaving office last week that the plant had not reached 
the point of production and might not get there if western firms 
heeded us warnings 
gadhafi contends the plant is designed to eventually produce 
pharmaceuticals

the air force launched 
an unarmed minuteman iii missile wednesday that successfully reached 
its target in the pacific ocean 4200 miles away officials said 
the missile blasted off at 557 am and splashed down as planned 
30 minutes later in the kwajalein missile range in the marshall 
islands said capt teresa v waddell 
the launch was the 473rd strategic air command test launch of a 
minuteman missile from this base 140 miles northwest of los angeles 
the window for the launch or the time during which the western 
test range is secured and cleared of sea vessels and aircraft began 
at 5 am the flight was delayed 27 minutes by minor unexpected 
events said lt gary morey of the vandenbergbased 1st strategic 
aerospace command division he would not elaborate 
morey said the lift off was monitored on the ground by a crew 
from malmstrom air force base in montana where the missile was 
stationed before being transferred to vandenberg 
the launch was the first from vandenberg since reports surfaced 
two weeks ago that the flight recorder from a similar july 1987 test 
involving a minuteman ii missile may have been recovered by the 
soviet union 
that missile was carrying a flight recorder for the us 
department of energy which manufactures and tests this nations 
nuclear weapons although that recorder contained no classified 
information it could provide valuable information to an adversary 
said chris sankey energy department spokesman 
however the minuteman iii carries no flight recorder and instead 
radios down information to us tracking stations while it flies

irans foreign minister is expected here 
thursday to try again with syrian officials to stop a ninemonth war 
between the shiite moslem militias they sponsor in lebanon 
the syrianbacked amal and the fundamentalist hezbollah 
supported by iran are fighting for supremacy among lebanons 1 
million shiites the largest sect in the warravaged nation 
more than 500 people have been killed and 1500 wounded since 
april the latest round of battles has taken 172 lives since dec 
31 and 337 people have been reported wounded 
a truce was announced wednesday morning under a preliminary 
peace agreement but an hourlong battle broke the truce later in 
the day 
iran said foreign minister ali akbar velayati would visit 
damascus on thursday to make the deal final he also was in the 
syrian capital tuesday 
syria supported iran in its eightyear war with iraq in which a 
ceasefire was reached aug 20 but their interests compete in 
lebanon where syria stations about 40000 troops and has been the 
main power broker 
amal and hezbollah which means party of god reached the peace 
agreement during three days of negotiations in damascus mediated by 
syria and iran 
a syrian foreign ministry statement issued wednesday after 
nightlong negotiations said the rival militias agreed to end their 
war in south lebanon and the south beirut slums but a battle with 
mortars and machine guns began later in south lebanon 
police said five militiamen were wounded in the hourlong battle 
in the shattered orchards of iklim eltuffah or apple province 
which was a land of abundance before lebanons sectarian civil war 
began in 1975 
several earlier amalhezbollah truces also have failed 
elsewhere in south lebanon the israeli army and allied 
militiamen expelled 40 lebanese men women and children from its 
selfproclaimed security zone just north of the border police 
reported 
they said the expulsion from the sunni moslem village of shibaa 
inside the zone occurred after inhabitants refused to cooperate with 
an israelisponsored local administration a police spokesman said 
130 soldiers and militiamen with 20 armored personnel carriers 
surrounded shibaa during the night 
un spokesman timur goksel said two 155mm howitzer shells landed 
at the un peacekeeping force headquarters in the border town of 
naqoura but did not explode 
he told reporters they were fired from around marjayoun 
headquarters of the south lebanon army the israelibacked militia 
that operates in the security zone 
according to the syrian statement the peace agreement between 
amal and hezbollah provided for an immediate ceasefire and an end 
to hostile propaganda campaigns by both sides 
it said the militias would continue negotiations for a 
comprehensive reconciliation agreement 
syrianofficials would not comment on the ceasefire violation 
velayati the iranian foreign minister met in damascus on 
tuesday with president hafez assad foreign minster farouk 
alsharaa amal leader nabih berri and hussein musavi leader of 
hezbollah 
hezbollah seeks to create an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
lebanon but the more secular and nationalist amal wants government 
in which moslems would share power equally with the oncedominant 
christians 
hezbollah advocates guerrilla attacks on israel but amal seeks 
only to get the israelis out of the border zone it opposes 
crossborder raids because they provoke retaliation against the 
predominantly shiite population of south lebanon

an accident that caused several valves to 
rupture at a nuclear reactor in south carolina resulted in part from 
poor supervision and a neglect of safety procedures energy 
department officials said wednesday 
troy wade acting assistant secretary for defense programs told 
a senate hearing the accident was disturbingly similar to an 
incident last august in which operators of another reactor at the 
savannah river plant bypassed standard procedures in attempting to 
restart the reactor causing a dangerous power surge 
it does have some unfortunate parallels to the august incident 
when you talk about operator attitude wade told the senate 
governmental affairs committee 
department officials at savannah river said wednesday it was too 
early to say whether the accident sunday would delay a planned 
restart of the threereactor complex savannah river is the nations 
only source of tritium a perishable gas vital to the production of 
nuclear warheads 
the complex has produced no tritium since last spring due to 
technical and safety problems department officials have said they 
hope to have the reactors running again by the end of 1989 although 
no firm target date has been set 
gary pitchford a department spokesman at savannah river said 
all testing maintenance and other operations at the k reactor were 
halted after the accident and would remain on hold at least for a 
few more days he said investigators would make a detailed 
assessment of the damage 
pitchford said preliminary indications were that this shutdown of 
reactor operations will not have any significant impact on the 
timetable for restarting the k reactor 
the pentagon has said production of tritium must be resumed 
before the end of the year to avoid a weakening of the nations 
nuclear weapons program it has not said exactly when the tritium 
supply would reach a critical level 
pitchford said it appeared it would take a few weeks to 
complete the investigation of sundays accident 
department officials said the reactor operators were performing a 
test involving running water through the reactors backup cooling 
system and monitoring the pressure in pipes operators were unaware 
that a valve had been left open after a similar test last week and 
pressure did not rise to expected levels 
in what pitchford called a violation of standard procedures the 
operators started another pump causing pressure inside the pipes to 
rise suddenly the valve that had been left open then slammed shut 
causing a surge of pressure that damaged other valves 
wade recalled that after the august incident an extra reactor 
crew was added at savannah river so that one full complement could 
always be in training that hasnt helped improve safety 
procedures as we thought it would he said 
he added that if the damage from sundays accident turns out to 
be the worst case it will have some effect on plans for 
restarting the reactor 
we will not restart until we are satisfied with worker training 
and worker attitude he said 
sen john glenn dohio who has led congressional inquiries into 
problems at the nuclear weapons complex told wade the latest 
incident seemed to indicate that procedures to assure safety at 
savannah river had not improved since last summer 
meanwhile governors from states with nuclear weapons plants 
urged president bush on wednesday to commit more money to cleaning 
up radioactive and chemical pollution at governmentowned bomb 
factories 
as the governors of the states most affected we implore you to 
take the initiative in working with congress to establish cleanup as 
a national imperative said a letter from govs richard celeste of 
ohio booth gardner of washington roy romer of colorado cecil 
andrus of idaho ned ray mcwherter of tennessee and bob miller of 
nevada 
as an urgent critical first step in this process we urge you to 
include substantially increased funding for waste cleanup and 
disposal work at energy department facilities in your fiscal year 
1990 budget proposal said the letter delivered to the white 
house

the department of energy has concluded that 
linear accelerator technology is not mature enough that 
accelerators rather than nuclear reactors can be used to produce a 
key ingredient for atomic weapons a top department official said 
wednesday 
it is a giant step from where we are today to the kind of 
accelerator and size of accelerator we would need troy wade the 
departments acting assistant secretary for defense programs told 
the senate governmental affairs committee 
scientists at the los alamos and brookhaven national laboratories 
and the westinghousehanford co in washington state have written 
that an accelerator could produce tritium more cheaply quickly and 
safely than a nuclear reactor 
some of the scientists also believe that an accelerator could be 
used to change highly radioactive waste into less hazardous 
substances 
last july the department recommended construction of two new 
nuclear reactors to produce tritium one at the savannah river 
complex in south carolina and the other at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory in idaho falls 
the reactors which would cost an estimated 68 billion and take 
at least 10 years to finish would replace the aging 
tritiumproducing reactors at savannah river the existing savannah 
river reactors have been plagued by safety problems and are 
currently shut down 
we have looked at accelerator technology wade told the 
committee it is not mature technology we would continue to 
pursue the accelerator technology but at the moment it is not as 
mature as fission reactors 
the department provided 300000 in funding for the initial 
accelerator research but no money was provided to continue the 
research in the current fiscal year 
also on wednesday an aide to sen brock adams dwash said the 
senator may ask the general accounting office to review the 
accelerator proposal 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminum the resulting collision 
produces tritium a radioactive gas used in nuclear weapons 
the accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity to 
operate roughly the output of an entire nuclear power plant the 
scientists who have studied the accelerator have suggested the 
hanford nuclear reservation in washington state as one possible site 
the pacific northwest has the cheapest electric rates in the 
nation and the bonneville power administration has indicated it 
would have enough electricity available in the 1990s to power an 
accelerator

nearly a quarter of the senate sponsored 
legislation wednesday that would reject a proposed 50 percent 
congressional pay raise and would roll back the increase if the 
house lets it become law by ducking a vote 
the senators 10 democrats and 13 republicans made clear they 
wanted to turn up pressure on the house which appears headed toward 
allowing the increase to become law automatically 
sens larry pressler rsd and charles e grassley riowa 
chief sponsors of the legislation said the rollback feature would 
keep pressure on the house even if the raise becomes law through 
house inaction 
if the increase takes effect grassley said house opponents of 
the raise could try again and again to attach a rollback to crucial 
legislation 
former president reagan proposed increasing rankandfile 
congressional salaries from 89500 a year to 135000 a raise that 
becomes law feb 8 unless both the house and senate vote to stop it 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has promised a 
vote on rejecting the raise before the deadline but house leaders 
have expressed no interest in allowing such a vote 
until now critics of the raise have centered on stopping the 
increase by the deadline 
the presslergrassley bill and comments by lawmakers in both 
houses wednesday have raise the possibility of action after the 
deadline to reduce the raise 
senators joining pressler and grassley in sponsoring the bill are 
harry reid dnev jesse helms rnc john mccain rariz 
dennis deconcini dariz paul simon dill gordon humphrey 
rnh david boren dokla quentin burdick dnd strom 
thurmond rsc and howell heflin dala 
also sens robert w kasten jr rwis nancy kassebaum 
rkan tom harkin diowa christopher s bond rmo richard h 
bryan dnev pete v domenici rnm dan coats rind rudy 
boschwitz rminn carl levin dmich richard c shelby dala 
and don nickles rokla 
mitchell told reporters i favor a comprehensive approach that 
includes enactment the ethics bill the president vetoed campaign 
finance reform a ban on honoraria and enactment of compensation to 
offset the loss in honoraria 
he said the package could not be pulled together before the 
automatic trigger for the raise 
the ethics bill vetoed by reagan and introduced again wednesday 
by thurmond would restrict lobbying by former members of congress 
their staffs and top executive branch officials campaign finance 
reform would impose limits on campaign spending 
rep barney frank dmass sponsor of the house version of the 
ethics bill said he believed the house also would address the pay 
raise as part of a reform package after the increase went into 
effect 
there should be a vote scheduled and i think will be this 
spring frank said 
frank said he favors a package that includes the postemployment 
ethics bill elimination of honoraria and a 27000 pay raise that 
would be a tradeoff for the honoraria loss in the house 
franks plan however likely would be unpopular with senators 
who can keep 35800 in honoraria compared with the house cap of 
26850 senators would therefore lose more in honoraria than they 
would gain in a raise 
the proposal emphasized the strains between the two houses in the 
pay raise controversy 
house members dont like the senates higher honoraria figure 
senators are angry that the house has refused to vote on pay raises 
before they automatically become law 
frank said many senators would like to leave the honoraria on 
and asked why the presslergrassley bill did not include an 
honoraria ban along with the pay raise rollback 
grassley said house members resent the higher senate honoraria 
without a doubt because most senators get some honoraria most 
house members dont get any 
the presslergrassley bill is in three parts 
the first feature would would disapprove the raise not only for 
lawmakers but also a proposed 50 percent increase for top executive 
branch officials and federal judges this action would only be 
meaningful if the house followed suit 
the second part effective if the raise becomes law would roll 
back congressional and executive branch salaries to levels of last 
jan 1 judges would still get their raise because the constitution 
prohibits reducing their salaries 
the third element would require that all future pay raises have a 
recorded vote

plo chairman yasser arafat urged the bush 
administration wednesday to move quickly in its middle east peace 
efforts and persuade israel to take part in peace talks 
we hope the new us administration will contribute in 
pressuring israel to bow to the voice of peace arafat said 
appealing for worldwide backing for his peace initiative 
arafat wants the palestine liberation organization to have equal 
footing with israel in peace negotiations a demand israel has 
refused 
the present year is important for such an american decision 
after george bush has taken over the presidency and before 
washington is taken up with other international issues he said 
arafat was addressing a news conference in muscat before leaving 
after a threeday visit his first ever to oman he has been 
enlisting the efforts of sultan qaboos in his quest for widescale 
diplomatic backing for the peace initiative 
peace is not up to israel but up to the united states the 
israel decision lies in washington and not in tel aviv arafat 
said in other interviews while in oman 
the question now is whether the international community will 
force israel to respond to peace or not arafat said will the 
world leave the powder keg in the middle east aflame because of 
israeli intransigeance 
more than 360 palestinians have died in the 13monthold 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip which israel 
seized from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war fifteen 
israelis have also been killed 
arafat renewed a proposal to place the occupied territories under 
un trusteeship for a transitional period of a few months 
during which the palestinian inhabitants would exercise their right 
to selfdetermination 
in palestinian language this means a referendum in which these 
inhabitants would decide whether to be an independent state or to 
confederate with jordan 
bush in a preinauguration interview recommended confederation 
as the basis for a palestinian settlement 
the bush administration is about to resume formal sessions of the 
dialogue with the plo that the reagan administration initiated in 
december after arafat explicitly recognized israel and renounced 
terrorism 
abu dhabis staterun newspaper alittihad referred to an 
informal meeting in tunis on monday between plo executive committee 
member farouk kaddoumi and us ambassador robert pelletreau jr 
it said kaddoumi pressed for washington to reopen the plo 
information office in the american capital closed after 
congressional charges of terrorism by the guerrilla organization 
mahmoud abbas a plo executive committee member said the 
movement will insist that washington clearly define what it 
considers palestinian rights when plous talks resume 
so far we have had only one meeting with the americans with 
only one topic in the agenda terrorism we have not discussed 
anything related to palestinian leaders or institutions he said 
in a lecture tuesday night in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates 
abbas also scotched reports the united states demanded the plo 
disband guerrilla groups and expel plo figures washington considers 
terrorists

federal investigators said they cannot 
determine whether politics was behind private detectives who 
shadowed rep byron dorgan dnd in 1986 and have closed the 
books on the case according to documents released wednesday 
the federal election commissions general counsel said it cant 
sort out whether the detectives were hired to influence the 1986 
election or were only looking into the lobbying activities of 
dorgans wife kimberly who represented canadian timber interests 
dorgan alleged that the detectives were trying to dig up 
information for a washington lawyer bert rand who is a friend of 
former sen mark andrews rnd at the time andrews viewed dorgan 
as a potential rival in his race for reelection to the senate 
dorgan said he was disappointed but not surprised at the 
commissions decision to drop the case 
even a blind hog can find an acorn now and then but the fec 
has been consistently unwilling to investigate these things 
dorgan said the federal election commission is a political body 
which seems to have a political antenna in these cases which is 
always out 
andrews who denied any involvement in the matter said the 
commissions decision was a vindication although he acknowledged 
that political fallout from the incident probably contributed to his 
losing the election 
the original complaint against our campaign committee was 
politically motivated and totally without substance andrews said 
that complaint was filed one week before the 1986 election by 
dorgan and sen kent conrad dnd who went on to win a narrow 
victory over andrews 
the complaint originally was against andrews reelection 
committee the state republican party the private detective agency 
and a handful of lawyers 
the commission decided to drop the investigation last fall but 
that decision and the case record remained sealed until wednesday 
however the central issue remained unresolved 
there is conflicting evidence as to whether the activity in 
question was undertaken for the purpose of influencing a federal 
election the commissions general counsel wrote 
rand who told the commission he was working on behalf of wendell 
wyatt a former republican congressman from oregon hired two other 
lawyers one of whom hired a bismarck nd private detective 
agency to gather information on dorgan

the air force said wednesday it had begun legal 
proceedings to suspend a top contracting official who has been 
implicated in the pentagon fraud investigation 
the service said dr victor d cohen the deputy for tactical 
systems in the office of the assistant secretary for acquisition 
had been served on tuesday with a notice of proposed indefinite 
suspension 
cohen has seven days to contest the air force personnel action 
this action is based primarily on an fbi affidavit which became 
available to the air force on dec 28 the service said in a 
prepared statement 
the action is based on a reasonable cause to believe that he 
has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be 
imposed 
if an indefinite suspension is imposed cohen would be forced 
into a nonpay status for an indefinite period of time penking 
resolution of the criminal process 
cohen is currently suspended from his job but is drawing pay 
cohen unlike one navy employee who was suspended earlier this 
month has not been indicted by the federal grand jury that is 
conducting the investigation 
cohen was named in a government affadavit filed by prosecutors 
investigating bribery and corruption in the pentagons 
150billionayear procurement business 
the affadavit based on telephone taps showed by cohen used his 
official position to help consultant william galvin or his clients 
in exchange for payments and other gratuities galvin has been 
indicted by a federal grand jury in the pentagon case 
the affadavit that names cohen cites an example of cubic corp 
of san diego a client of galvins and a maker of shells that house 
electronic gear called pods 
sometime before april 1 galvin asked cohen to award an 
unidentified pod contract to cubic on a sole source basis so that 
cubic would be the only supplied the ducment said 
in a tapped phone conversation on may 15 1987 cohen told galvin 
that he wouldnt award the contract to cubic as a sole source but 
he said he planned to have the air force issue the request for 
proposal with a required delivery scheduled that cubics competitor 
couldnt meet the affidavit says 
cohen assured galvin that by doing it this way the procurement 
would appear to have been completed when in actuality cubic would 
be guaranteed the award of the contract the document said

a 9inch statuette of the virgin mary that a 
police official put on his desk sparked a dispute with his deskmate 
that has spiraled into a debate on the division between church and 
state authorities said wednesday 
the smallscale religious war erupted last year between lt 
eugene v begley and his supervisor capt bruce hogan when hogan 
placed the pale yellow plastic madonna on their desk 
the officers who were commander and secondincommand on the 
evening shift began trading insults and jibes as the argument 
escalated last fall 
hogan alleged that begley shrouded the religious icon in 
newspaper whenever hogan stepped out for a meal and ordered him 
never to touch the statue 
i never touched it responded begley i just put the cup 
over it 
the spat came to an abrupt conclusion in november when chief john 
f hollow transferred begley to dayside detective duties hollow has 
said the transfer had nothing to do with the religious dispute 
on tuesday a state arbitrator heard begleys claim that the 
transfer which he says will cost him thousands of dollars a year 
was indeed religiously motivated and was improper three more 
hearings are scheduled through march 
lynn a factory city of about 78000 has seven roman catholic 
churches and a police force of 180 officers 
im as good a roman catholic as anybody but that statue has no 
place on a police captains desk begley said we have 
catholics protestants jews and im sure a few moslems in this 
department hogan has no right to push his religion on other people 
he should not be flaunting it 
calls to hogans office wednesday evening were an answered by an 
officer who said that department employees had been ordered not to 
discuss the case with the news media 
david hoffman an attorney for the civil liberties union of 
massachusetts said the group had not been asked to become involved 
in begleys case but said it raised important issues 
we are often concerned when government officials in a 
position of authority use displays of religious objects in a way 
that might suggest to the public or to employees that there is a 
particular religion that is favored by the agency hoffman said 
such a symbolic link between church and state raises issues 
under the establishment clause of the first amendment 
begley claims the transfer cost him 45000 in annual pay because 
by working days he can no longer accept extra assignments for 
traffic control on road construction projects 
department officials had little comment on the case wednesday 
it should never have left the inhouse stage said lt joseph 
rowe hollows spokesman the department certainly didnt plan to 
go public with it

premier hun sen of cambodia on wednesday 
rejected proposals for an international peacekeeping force in his 
country and asked other nations to stop supporting guerrillas 
seeking to topple his government 
cambodian guerrillas meanwhile demanded that vietnam come up 
with a timetable for withdrawing its occupation forces from the 
country 
hun sen had a frank discussion with thai prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan and other thai leaders on wednesday said thai 
government spokesman suvit yodmani 
yodmani stressed the twohour talk did not constitute thai 
recognition of the vietnambacked government in cambodia 
chatichai just wants to get to know hun sen because hun sen 
later on most likely will be involved in a coalition government 
hopefully when there is peace in cambodia suvit told reporters 
he said both sides agreed that all warring cambodian factions 
must attend the second session of cambodian peace talks scheduled 
feb 1921 in indonesia 
participants in the first session in july included vietnam laos 
the warring parties in cambodia and the members of the noncommunist 
association of southeast asian nations 
the conclusion is that up to now anyway cambodia would like 
thailand to try to get the four sides together and to face one 
another and talk frankly said suvit referring to hun sens 
government and the three parties in the cambodian resistance 
coalition 
vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 and toppled the brutal regime of 
the khmer rouge who killed hundreds of thousands of people during 
their threeyear rule 
thailand has shunned the phnom penh government since then and has 
backed the threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting vietnamese and 
cambodian government troops 
before meeting with chatichai hun sen told reporters that he 
rjected an international peacekeeping force for cambodia and also 
opposed other parts of the peace proposal by guerrilla coalition 
leader prince norodom sihanouk 
hun sen also reiterated calls for a cessation of all military aid 
to cambodian resistance groups opposed to his government 
he said sihanouks proposals would lead to the return to power of 
the khmer rouge one of the parties in the guerrilla coalition 
hun sen also said he was ready to discuss with the united states 
the question of americans missing in action in cambodia from the 
vietnam war saying the discussions could take place in bangkok 
the united states which lists 83 americans as missing in action 
in cambodia also does not recognize the hun sen government 
vietnam has said it will withdraw by 1990 but said it may pull 
its forces from cambodia by september if a political solution can be 
achieved 
in beijing chinas official xinhua news agency quoted cambodian 
guerrillas as demanding a specific timetable for a vietnamese 
withdrawal 
xinhua quoted the guerrillas radio democratic kampuchea as 
saying vietnams withdrawal should take place under international 
supervision 
the guerrillas main international sponsor china has made a 
similar demand east european sources said a timetable was discussed 
during meetings last week in beijing between vietnamese vice foreign 
minister dinh nho liem and chinese officials 
vietnams embassy in beijing later said the two sides reached 
some agreements but did not say if those included an agreement on a 
timetable china earlier called vietnams statement that it could 
pull out by september a step forward

to bystanders it looked as if the 
contestants were trying to fish from the thirdfloor balcony of the 
massachusetts institute of technology on wednesday 
in fact the students and teachers were competing in an 
experiment that could alter how spacecraft dock in outer space 
the competitions longrange goal was to devise a cheaper more 
effective method of linking the space shuttle with the space 
station present space shuttle docking plans are expensive and 
timeconsuming said mit professor andreas h von flotow 
the simulated design contest was sponsored by von flotow and 
energy sciences laboratory inc of san diego the 500 first prize 
and a possible job with the company was offered to the competitor 
who completed the docking maneuver in the shortest time 
the experiment involved dropping a tether line from a thirdfloor 
balcony in the mit lobby or the space station and trying to 
connect it with the space shuttle on the floor below fashioned 
from a garbage can and contestantmade nose cones 
the trick was linking the tether to the space shuttle as rapidly 
as possible without risking hard impact but the link had to be 
strong enough to lift the simulated space station off the floor 
this idea has been drifting around for years said von 
flotow an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at 
mit but the aerospace business is the most conservative around 
they dont always want to try new things even if there are 
considerable benefits 
von flotow said several aerospace companies had expressed 
interest in seeing the winning design 
currently the plans for a shuttlespace station docking call for 
what is termed metaltometal mating which requires hours of 
precision flying to dock a relatively small payload 
since the cost of docking is estimated to be about 100000 per 
second substantial savings can result from finding a faster 
procedure von flotow said 
von flotow said docking would require less fuel if a soft device 
on a mileslong tether were dropped from the orbiting space station 
to dock remotely with the space shuttles payload at a suborbital 
altitude 
he said several of the designs attempted wednesday could work in 
space where tether lines would be required to lift 6600 pounds of 
weight 
four teams of contestants competed in the twohour experiment 
the winner mit graduate student siegfried zerweckh used a fishnet 
attached to the tether line to grasp a nose cone made of foam 
rubber his best time was 99 seconds 
mit professor norman ham the only faculty member to compete 
lowered two balloons and hooked them to cylindrical wires attached 
to the nose cone in a 19second docking maneuver 
to ensure that the simulated docking mechanisms would not damage 
a space shuttle von flotow tested each of the entries by dropping 
them on an egg and making sure they did not break it 
its something you can create and develop and at the same time 
it may prove really useful some day said gary carr a us 
department of transportation mechanical engineer who was on the only 
nonmit participant in the contest

the senate unanimously confirmed james a baker 
iii as secretary of state wednesday as majority leader george 
mitchell pledged to cooperate with the bush administration while 
pursuing a democratic agenda of improvements in the minimum wage 
housing health care and the environment 
the democraticcontrolled senate also confirmed elizabeth dole as 
labor secretary and richard darman as budget director without a 
dissenting vote 
mitchell in a speech that seemed crafted as a response to 
president bushs inaugural address said he looked forward to true 
bipartisanship on foreign policy he said that meant the white 
house must commit itself to full timely and meaningful 
consultation with congress 
the first votes were anything but contentious 
the roll call was 990 to confirm baker who served as treasury 
secretary and white house chief of staff under president reagan and 
was president bushs campaign manager last year he was sworn into 
office minutes later the state department said 
mrs dole the wife of senate gop leader bob dole also won 
approval on a 990 vote she is a former secretary of transportation 
who resigned her post to help her husbands unsuccessful 1988 
presidential campaign 
darmans confirmation roll call was 990 as well he is a former 
top aide to baker at the treasury and will be bushs point man in 
the drive to reduce the federal deficit 
in all three instances sen don nickles rokla was the only 
senator who didnt vote 
in the busiest day so far of the new 101st congress committees 
also held confirmation hearings for several cabinet appointees 
among them was defense secretarydesignate john tower who said 
there is a need for reform at the pentagon and pledged to work 
with congress to achieve it 
nearly a quarter of the senate sponsored legislation to block the 
45000 proposed congressional pay raise scheduled to take effect on 
feb 8 the proposal would roll back the increase if as expected 
the house lets it become law without a vote 
the bush administration worked behind the scenes to defuse 
controversy over one cabinet appointment 
louis sullivan named to head the department of health and human 
services met privately with antiabortion senators and apparently 
persuaded them he is committed enough to their cause to win their 
support for confirmation 
dr sullivan believes in his heart that the roe vs wade 
decision should be overturned said sen gordon humphrey rnh 
referring to the 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion 
sullivan had upset many conservative senators when he was quoted by 
another senator as saying he did not favor overturning the ruling 
baker dole and darman were the first bush appointees to face 
confirmation votes in the senate attorney general dick thornburgh 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and education secretary laurio 
cavazos are holdover appointments from the reagan administration and 
did not require confirmation 
the house was not in session but inside the senate chamber 
speeches by mitchell and republican leader bob dole were followed by 
the introduction of legislation for the first time this year 
the bills ranged from a measure to block the proposed 45000 pay 
raise for lawmakers or repeal it if it takes effect on feb 7 to 
doles proposal for a balanced budget amendment to the constitition 
sen edward m kennedy dmass filed legislation to raise the 
minimum wage gradually from 335 to 455 an hour and sen strom 
thurmond rsc filed ethics legislation that was approved last 
year but vetoed by president reagan 
dole who spoke a few moments after mitchell pledged 
bipartisanship and added it was the intention of the republicans to 
support and further the cause of our new republican president 
mitchell in a speech that seemed drafted to reply to bushs 
inaugural address of last week said the president had put his 
hand out to me and the speaker of the house i now extend mine to 
him 
mitchell said we enter a new era the new deal and the reagan 
reaction to it are over we face new circumstances 
he said his objectives were to reestablish a bipartisan foreign 
policy while also establishing a new social contract at home that 
defines not only what our country will do for our citizens but what 
our citizens will do for our country 
the maine democrat cautioned bush that bipartisanship on foreign 
policy required full timely and meaningful consultation with 
congress on the part of the new administration 
mitchell added that serious consultation will not prevent 
differences between the congress and the president there have 
always been such differences there always will be 
his speech carried slightly more of a challenge to bush on 
domestic issues 
we look forward to receiving the presidents budget 
proposals he said adding that democrats would work with bush 
to achieve a bipartisan budget reduction that is fair 
credible and based on realistic economic projections 
mitchell said his speech was not designed as a detailed agenda 
for the year but he did go into some detail he said democrats 
would seek legislation to deal with the homeless health care and 
increased research and development he called for full funding for a 
drug bill approved a year ago improvements in the clean air act and 
said we will raise the minimum wage to a rate that will help 
those who depend on it 
he also said he favors legislation to establish a program of 
voluntary national service 
mitchell pledged to seek enactment of a comprehensive package of 
ethics legislation including laws restricting lobbying activities 
of former members of congress a campaign finance bill and a ban on 
speaking and appearance fees received by senators and 
representatives 
he did not say so in his speech but he told reporters beforehand 
he favors a pay raise for members of congress as part of the ethics 
package 
the proposed 45000 pay raise has become the most controversial 
issue of the new congress and opponents introduced legislation 
during the day to block it or in the event it takes effect to 
repeal it their measure is designed to thwart apparent plans by 
house speaker jim wright to prevent a vote on the pay raise until it 
takes effect automatically in two weeks 
lawmakers salaries are to rise from just over 89000 to 
135000 an increase of 50 percent federal judges and some 
political appointees would also receive increases

president bush voiced reservations wednesday 
about american participation in a human rights conference in moscow 
in 1991 saying we need to look for peformance by the soviet 
union in his first interview as president bush also hinted he will 
stop in china after visiting japan next month 
stay tuned bush said discussing the possibility of going to 
beijing we may have something on that soon he added later as 
he left the oval office for the night bush was asked again if he 
was going to china no just going home he quippped 
in the interview the president also said he hoped the federal 
reserve would not move so strongly against fear of inflation that 
we impede growth pointing to rising prices on wall street bush 
said theres no signals out there in the markets that this 
economy is in real trouble 
bush refused to say how long his pledge against raising taxes 
would apply im not thinking beyond anything other than to say i 
will not raise taxes and ive got to stay with that approach i 
really feel strong on that particular point and i havent thought 
beyond one year or anything of that nature 
bush discussed domestic and foreign policy subjects in a 
12minute interview with the new york times and the houston post 
and a text of his comments was released to the press it was the 
first episode in what white house officials say will be a series of 
experiments to make bush available to the media in various forums 
bushs remarks about the human rights conference in moscow echoed 
reservations voiced by james a baker iii during his confirmation 
hearings to be secretary of state in the final days of the reagan 
administration the united states agreed to the staging of a human 
rights conference in moscow 
asked about going ahead with the conference bush said i think 
that we need to look for performance on human rights and there 
will be time in which to see performance in that regard there 
has been definite improvement in some ways there 
but lets see what develops as we move towards that conference 
date he said 
later white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
united states was not backing away from its commitment 
he said the bush administration is only two days old and they 
want time to make our own analysis 
but president bush certainly agrees with president reagan he 
was a part of that administration that considerable progress on 
human rights has been made in the soviet union after president 
gorbachev came to power fitzwater said but thats not to say 
there isnt room for new analysis 
on other subjects bush said 
the administration is considering imposing a fee on customers of 
savings and loan institutions to help the federal government rescue 
the troubled sampl industry im not going to say what im going to 
do but that is one option he said 
he is not considering dropping dr louis w sullivan as his 
candidate to head the department of health and human services 
despite questions about sullivans position on abortion bush said 
that in his conversations with sullivan he has supported my 
position 100 percent 
he favors prudent development by oil companies in a vast 
arctic national wildlife refuge that environmentalists are trying to 
protect 
he is not trying to do things differently than reagan but its 
important to me to do it my way 
it is uncertain how much money will be available for the war 
against illegal drugs but that the elimination of drugs is going 
to stem from vigorous changes in our societys approach to 
narcotics its going to be successful only if our education is 
successful 
in what will be his first foreign trip bush is is scheduled to 
go to ottawa on feb 10 to meet with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney 
bush also has said he will attend the feb 24 funeral of emperor 
hirohito in japan and there had been speculation he would go on to 
china and perhaps south korea afterward

howard dnj died after a heart attack last march he has 
remained relatively obscure in congress despite a 20year house 
career in contrast to the more colorful and outgoing howard

anderson wanted to continue as chairman of the full committee and 
the surface subcommittee but other panel members citing a 
longstanding committee tradition argued that the committee 
chairman should not also chair a subcommittee

the panels younger members that subcommittee chairmanships are not 
opening up for new people the sources said

controls billions of dollars in highway and mass transit projects

it moved as fast as a running man and 
with enormous force looming black against the predawn sky the 
mudslide sounded like thunder or rocks being crushed into dust 
survivors recall 
unleashed by an earthquake the moving wall of mud 50 feet high 
in places crashed down on this hillside peasant settlement in 
soviet tadzhikistan on monday it buried onestory mudbrick and 
prefabricated concrete homes and killed 207 villagers most of them 
in their sleep 
it left a silent moonlike landscape of rolling moist earth and 
no signs of life except for white roofs that peeked through the 
grime or scraps of brightly colored cloth carried across it by a 
morning breeze from the hills 
in house no 1 at sharoras dairy farm herdsman saifulo 
khodzharayev 30 and seven members of his family were buried alive 
and suffocated after the earthquake measuring 54 on the richter 
scale dislodged the earth softened by thawing snow they were among 
about 270 confirmed dead 
the familys lone survivor was khodzharayevs 6dayold baby 
girl who had not yet been given a name she was held by her father 
aloft at arms length and escaped the deadly torrent of wet sticky 
clay said kholmurod barotov 17 a bakery worker 
barotov said his mother the infants aunt had gone to spend the 
night at her house farther up the hill to help her sister take care 
of the newborn 
that gesture probably cost safarmo barotov her life her teenage 
son survived because he had been hospitalized outside of sharora for 
a stomach ailment he told moscowbased reporters brought in by bus 
and helicopter wednesday to view the disaster scene 
for this more than 300yearold settlement the end came in 
seconds the mudslide covered much of sharora with a 300yardwide 
chocolatecolored earthen slather 
it was like a bomb had exploded on top of our heads or a 
thunderstorm had broke said kibo rakhikov 27 a policeman roused 
by the quake he made it into the street in time to see an inky 
black mass tumbling down onto the village from the hills above 
two days after the disaster in this remote rural area about 1800 
miles southeast of moscow bulldozers cranes and dumptrucks worked 
to free sharoras streets of crumbled brick broken pieces of 
undulated roofing twisted trees and mud 
a group of five women dressed in the flowing robes and shawls 
common to this area north of afghanistan and china shuffled weeping 
past wrecked and ruined homes holding tightly to each other 
since custom in this mostly moslem republic is not to attempt to 
recover the bodies of people buried alive this village whose name 
means spark in the tadzhik language will be fenced off and 
turned into a common grave complete with a memorial for those who 
died 
two families however have insisted on searching for the bodies 
of loved ones regional communist party chief khusayin kasymov said 
and a dozen policeman and villagers wielding shovels and hoes and 
assisted by an excavator cut into the dense earth wednesday morning 
in search of more dead 
on the lip of the crater overlooking the site khusnia khiromov 
shawled in black and weeping watched the men slowly work down 
through the mud to the shambles of the house where 11 people six of 
them her relatives had been buried 
another relation a middleage man who covered his face with a 
handkerchief wailed loudly as he stood behind the digging men 
in the mass of drying mud the diggers sighted a sofa cushion 
covered with a striped blanket and some hair which they took for 
the sign of a body they unfurled a bright pink bath towel making 
ready to cover yet another victim in tadzhikistan it is not 
considered proper to reveal the dead to strangers 
south of sharora on the other side of the rolling urtabuz hills 
mud ran like coffeecolored lava and fouled 370 acres of land tilled 
by the karl marx collective farm 
in the farms settlement of okulipoyen two miles down the other 
side of the hill villagers were awakened monday by an approaching 
roar that esnali matkamilov 66 a retired mechanic said sounded 
like a rockcrushing machine 
the surging advancing mud moved more slowly taking at least 1 
hours to reach the village it felled trees and 32 homes in its path 
but gave time enough to evaculate okulipoyen and not a single 
resident died 
at the sound i jumped into my shorts ran out of the house and 
then to the next village matkamilov said other villagers said 
they fled with their families in trucks and cars 
in okulibolo a village to the west of sharora and near the 
quakes epicenter 67 people died when all 88 whitewashed dwellings 
in the settlement were flattened by the quake many were built only 
of dried clay and straw and they crumbled into bits

a former chairman of the house ethics committee 
has blasted as jury tampering the attempts by two conservative 
groups to lobby a gop member of the ethics panel in the case of 
house speaker jim wright 
the brazen effort is closely akin to jury tampering in a court 
of law said rep louis stokes dohio in a letter to house 
colleagues this clearly amounts to a flagrant politicization of a 
process that was specifically created to be above partisan 
politics 
the letter was evidence of growing partisan tensions as the 
ethics committee nears the end of its sevenmonth probe of wright 
and the time when its 12 members six democrats and six republicans 
must vote on the speakers guilt or innocence 
wright is accused in a sixcount resolution of abusing his office 
for financial gain and improperly intervening with federal 
regulators on behalf of constituents 
the controversy began last month when a conservative newsletter 
published a brief bit of speculation that the ethics panel would 
ultimately avoid a 66 tie vote on the wright case because committee 
member rep chip pashayan rcalif would side with the democrats 
to exonerate the speaker 
in response two groups the conservative campaign fund and the 
national right to work committee launched an effort to lobby 
pashayan to be tough on wright 
peter flaherty director of the conservative campaign fund said 
he already had doubts about the independence of the investigation of 
wright by outside counsel richard j phelan after the newsletter 
item appeared his group sent 300 pieces of mail to contributors in 
pashayans district urging them to contact their congressman and 
urge him not to side with the democrats 
there is enough information on the public record to require 
strong action against wright the groups letter argues all of 
the members of the committee are under pressure both subtle and 
overt from the speaker it states 
at about the same time the righttowork group mailed letters to 
1500 of its supporters in pashayans district asking that the 
lawmaker stand up to the awesome power of speaker wright 
pashayan has received about 100 calls and letters from 
constituents on the issue but the flow of contacts has dwindled 
this week and the ethics panel member professed to be 
impervious to the lobbying effort but he acknowledged that 
tension over the wright case has grown as it nears its conclusion 
phelan is in the process of drafting his final report consulting 
occasionally with committee members and is expected to be ready to 
present it to the panel for discussion and a vote sometime in 
february 
as the former chairman of that committee i feel certain that 
nothing of this kind has ever previously intruded in such a way upon 
the committees deliberations stokes wrote in his letter to all 
house members 
republican members of the committee the speaker himself and 
the house as an institution deserve far better than this shabby 
attempt to undermine the integrity of our processes stokes wrote 
efforts to contract spokesmen for the groups for a response to 
stokes letter were unsuccessful

a city councilmans offer to buy semiautomatic 
weapons back from people in the wake of the stockton schoolyard 
massacre led citizens to turn over an uzi and an ak47 to police 
officials said wednesday 
councilman nate holden a mayoral candidate displayed the black 
uzi rifle at a news conference where police cmdr william booth 
outlined procedures for safely bringing weapons to police stations 
holden offered on tuesday to pay up to 300 for semiautomatic 
rifles and that night received a response he said a woman who kept 
the uzi under her bed for several years turned it in to get it out 
of her life he said 
a 16yearold boy brought the unloaded ak47 to a police station 
wednesday saying he received it as a gift and just wanted to be 
rid of it said spokesman lt fred nixon 
an ak47 was used last week by 24yearold drifter patrick purdy 
to fire more than 100 bullets into a schoolyard in the san joaquin 
valley city of stockton killing five students wounding 29 students 
and one adult 
the attack by purdy who killed himself produced calls from 
state and local officials for bans or restrictions on militarystyle 
assault rifles which can be bought in california more easily than 
handguns 
booth said others who want to take holden up on his offer to buy 
the guns should take them to a police station notifying the station 
in advance and carefully storing the gun in the trunk of the car 
empty of bullets and disassembled 
these weapons were manufactured to kill people that kind 
of weapon has no place in a civil society booth said 
police will issue a receipt the person can take to holdens 
office holden who is running for reelection in april said he 
would pay up to 300 for each gun depending on its value and had 
50000 in a campaign committee fund for the effort 
police said that any weapons turned in would be investigated and 
noted that possession of a gun that had been converted into a fully 
automatic weapon is illegal but holden said parents friends and 
relatives of gun owners particularly gang members should welcome 
the chance to get rid of the powerful and deadly weapons 
the weapon displayed by holden and booth came in a canvas gun bag 
with a document that identified it as an uzi model b and produced 
by israel military industries 
a resolution calling for legislation to ban the sale of military 
assault rifles in california was approved by the county board of 
supervisors on tuesday the action was spurred by the jan 17 
shooting deaths of five children in a schoolyard in stockton in 
northern california twentynine other students and one teacher were 
wounded the gunman then killed himself 
its important that we send a message to sacramento that people 
here are concerned about this ed edelman chairman of the 
fivemember board said tuesday 
sheriff sherman block told the supervisors that he was meeting 
with other law enforcement officials friday to draft legislation 
banning future sales of the ak47 assault rifle and other 
militarystyle weapons 
the proposed bill also would include a provision allowing judges 
to increase a sentence by five years for felons convicted of using 
such weapons in a crime 
in addition to blocks suggestions los angeles city police chief 
daryl gates wants to require a 15day waiting period to buy any gun 
to allow law enforcement officials to check the buyers record a 
police spokesman said

the former armed forces chief who 
founded the nicaraguan rebel movement in honduras was assassinated 
on wednesday by six men who riddled his car with gunfire officials 
said 
former gen gustavo alvarez martinez died of gunshot wounds near 
his home in the capitals florencia district said salvador lobo 
director of emergencies at the state hospital school 
radio america a local station said anonymous callers claimed 
responsibility on behalf of the popular liberation forces a leftist 
group but police said they had no evidence to confirm the claim 
it was the third assassination in honduras in the last three 
weeks the previous killings involved a nicaraguan rebel commander 
and a reputed druglords lawyer 
as head of the national police in 1981 alvarez became the 
godfather of the contras by telling cia director william casey that 
antisandinista forces could operate from honduran territory 
in subsequent years until his ouster by fellow officers annoyed 
at his highhandedness the passionate anticommunist continued to 
develop and promote the usbacked nicaraguan guerrillas which 
became known as contras 
witnesses said six gunmen waited for alvarez outside his home and 
poured machinegun fire into his car the driver also was killed and 
alvarezs soninlaw was wounded police said 
police and army troops were deployed to look for the gunmen said 
col julio cesar chavez the police chief military personnel 
searched cars at barricades set up on roads out of tegucigalpa 
one witness alba luz guzman told the associated press the men 
intercepted me forced me to get out of my car then fled in my 
automobile 
alvarez 56 was chief of the armed forces from 1982 to 1984 
under the government of president roberto suazo cordova trained in 
the united states and argentina he was once considered the most 
powerful figure in honduras 
alvarez frequently denounced the leftist sandinista government of 
neighboring nicaragua he also presided over the beginning of joint 
ushonduran military exercises in honduras designed to intimidate 
the sandinistas 
the contras alvarez once pledged would wage a war without 
quarter against international communism which has now taken over 
nicaragua 
under his original proposal to casey described in the book 
banana diplomacy by newsday correspondent roy gutman alvarez 
proposed to use the rebels to provoke a border incident with the 
leftist sandinistas in neighboring nicaragua honduras then would 
ask the united states for assistance permitting intervention by 
us forces 
alvarez also supervised a counterinsurgency campaign against 
suspected honduran guerrillas that us officials privately viewed 
as a success 
human rights activists charged the campaign relied on death 
squads linked to the military and that at least 100 people 
disappeared or were jailed illegally honduran forces deny the 
charges 
honduran officials wanted to keep a low profile on the contras 
and officially denied their presence even when thousands of them 
operated from border camps 
alvarezs denunciations of the sandinistas brought embarrassing 
attention to the us role in honduras and honduran support for the 
contras 
military officers led by thengen walter lopez reyes ousted 
alvarez from his post in 1984 and he went to exile in miami after 
being given a dishonorable discharge 
us officials said in 1984 that suazo cordova ousted alvarez 
because he was meddling in politics most honduran political and 
military sources said the honduran military command orchestrated the 
ouster because he would not consult them on vital decisions 
about 12000 contra fighters now are believed to be in camps 
along the honduran border us military aid to the contras ended in 
february 1988 and they now receive only humanitarian aid 
in the two previous assassinations this month veteran contra 
military commander manuel adan rugama acevedo was fatally shot just 
outside the capital on jan 7 nicaraguan rebel radio on monday 
blamed the popular liberation forces for the killing 
also monday two gunmen killed carlos diaz lorenzana a lawyer 
for reputed drug baron juan ramon matta whose extradition to the 
united states last year caused riots and a state of emergency 
alvarez maintained he was deposed illegally but returned to 
honduras in april 1988 after the army command guaranteed his 
security 
he then became an activist with an evangelical church he was 
frequently seen walking the streets of tegucigalpa alone in 
civilian garb and without bodyguards 
he told a meeting of christian businessmen in december ive 
embraced christ in order to forget the rifle

despite his tears executed killer ted bundy 
remained coldblooded and manipulative to the last as he dribbled 
out information on his victims in hopes of delaying his execution 
an investigator said wednesday 
robert keppel a state attorney generals investigator who 
tracked bundy for nearly 15 years said he believes bundy may have 
killed more than 100 girls and women 
as keppel spoke at a news conference the florida prosecutor who 
sent bundy to the electric chair tuesday estimated he may have slain 
as many as 50 young women the fbi said it was still analyzing the 
confessions given to a parade of law enforcement officers bundy 
invited to the florida state prison beginning late last week 
the whole thing was orchestrated from the very beginning 
keppel said of the confessions in which he participated he 
dismissed as phony bundys final interview putting some of the blame 
for his activities on pornography 
pornography is maybe oneonethousandths of the whole problem 
he had keppel said adding that the interview with james dobson 
a religious broadcaster and psychologist was totally 
selfserving 
he said the only remorse bundy felt in his final hours was for 
himself 
bundy 42 admitted during his final days to killing 23 women 
including 11 in washington state officials said he was convicted 
of killing three others 
keppel said he believes the toll is much higher and that the 
exact numbers and details will never be known 
my feeling is he has killed way over 100 said keppel who as 
a king county detective investigated the eight ted killings in 
the seattle area that occurred in 1974 
bundy confessed to those crimes and to killings in utah 
colorado and idaho 
keppel has interviewed bundy several times in the past few years 
and said he would take the information gathered in his latest 
sessions and present it to other law agencies in hopes it will help 
solve stillunexplained murders 
during the final interviews keppel also questioned bundy about 
the green river killings of western washington and oregon primarily 
to gain insight into how a serial killer thinks and acts bundy was 
imprisoned in florida when the green river killings began in the 
early 1980s 
keppel played a tape he had recorded during a session with bundy 
on friday when the former tacoma resident and law school dropout 
admitted to killing the eight ted victims 
in the tape bundy describes how he lured a university of 
washington student georgann hawkins to his car beat her with a 
crowbar and then drove her to a secluded grassy spot in the hills 
near issaquah east of seattle 
keppel would not play the part of the tape where bundy detailed 
how he killed and apparently mutilated her and other victims out of 
respect for the families of the victims 
i was shocked he said of the way the victims were treated 
he said investigators hadnt known bundys methods because the 
victims were found weeks and months after their deaths and many 
bones had been strewn by animals 
keppel said bundy used stalling tactics during the last days 
even as he invited law enforcement officers from various states to 
the prison to talk about murder cases 
bundy would let em squirm let em dangle for a little more 
information said keppel hopeful that such tactics would win him 
a lastminute respite from the death penalty if only temporarily 
however it was only because death was imminent that bundy did 
confess at all added keppel had the florida governor indicated in 
the slightest way he would spare bundy to allow law officers more 
time to question him bundy would have clammed up keppel said 
he also said law enforcement officers would have been well 
advised to use a different method in questioning bundy with those 
who were successful given more of the task

the fourth game of the world chess championship 
candidates quarterfinal between kevin spraggett of canada and artur 
yusupov of the soviet union ended in a 17move draw wednesday 
leaving the match score tied 22 
playing with the advantage of the white pieces spraggett 
exchanged the queens on the ninth move of a reti opening but failed 
to gain any advantage in the resulting endgame 
some experts attributed spraggetts lackluster performance to the 
psychological fallout from his loss tuesday in the third game which 
enabled yusupov to tie the score 
spraggett a 34yearold from montreal seized the lead in the 
sixgame contest with a victory in the second game 
the winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world champion 
garri kasparov for his title in 1990 
the fifth game will be played friday with yusupov 28 playing 
white jean hebert a canadian international master who is 
commentating on the games said spraggett will use the free day 
thursday to improve his black defenses 
french chess expert catherine jaeg said the contest resembled 
roulette with just two games remaining she said one blunder 
or brilliancy would decide the outcome 
in case of a 33 tie two more games will be played followed by 
a series of tiebreakers played at an increasingly fast pace a win 
scores one point and a draw a half 
british grandmaster jonathan speelman is already through to the

attorney ronald brown who directed jesse 
jacksons operations at the 1988 democratic national convention 
claimed victory wednesday in the race for the party chairmanship 
after he received the endorsement of his chief rival in the 
fourcandidate race 
i am ending my campaign today and i am endorsing ron said 
rick wiener the michigan democratic party chairman widely regarded 
as browns principal competitor 
brown immediately issued a statement thanking wiener and saying 
i now have more than enough votes to win the chairmanship of the 
dnc 
i am very very pleased and look forward to leading a united 
party for the next four years my first priority is to reach out to 
all democrats our strength as a party depends on our ability to 
appeal to americans in every region with a message of strength and 
hope 
two other candidates former reps jim jones of oklahoma and 
james stanton of ohio remained in the race but brown and wiener 
were considered the two contenders with the largest blocs of support 
jones said his aides were calling wiener supporters to see how 
many would support the oklahoman 
i believe in making a decision based on reality and real 
numbers he said until we get them im not going to decide 
whether to continue his campaign 
stanton had no immediate comment 
the democratic national committee will meet in washington on feb 
10 to elect a successor to paul g kirk jr who is completed a 
fouryear term as head of the party 
many party leaders urged kirk to seek a second term to avoid a 
potentially divisive fight for the chairmanship but he opted to 
step aside 
some of the strongest opposition to brown came from southerners 
concerned about his ties to jackson and the liberal wing of the 
party 
in his campaign for the chairmanship brown received the support 
of sen edward m kennedy and new york gov mario cuomo as well as 
the endorsement of the aflcio 
ron is probably the most qualified guy in the race said 
florida democratic party chairman charles whitehead but the 
perception in this state is that ron is jesses and teds and 
labors guy it poses me a political problem a little bit in 
florida 
brown served as jacksons convention manager and was widely 
credited with helping to end the convention on a note of unity the 
night that michael dukakis accepted the presidential nomination and 
then was joined on the podium by jackson and his family 
a former vice chairman of the party brown had worked for kennedy 
as general counsel and staff director of the senate judiciary 
committee he was deputy campaign manager for kennedys unsuccessful 
bid for the 1980 presidential nomination 
after the 1988 democratic convention brown served as a senior 
adviser to the dukakis presidential campaign 
wiener ended his campaign shortly after the four contenders 
appeared at a closed meeting of the house democratic caucus 
it wasnt that exciting said rep barney frank of 
massachusetts a supporter of brown since we dont have a vote 
it wasnt exactly clear what was supposed to be happening 
a former party vice chairman brown was working hard to create a 
bandwagon mood that would swing more votes his way 
ron brown continues to move closer to winning the chair of the 
dnc said his campaign manager carl wagner as he announced that 45 
committee members from western states were endorsing the washington 
attorney 
were at the threshold of victory he said 
one house democratic source who asked not to be identified said 
that during the meeting with the caucus brown assured house members 
he would remain neutral in the race for the 1992 democratic 
presidential nomination a year when jackson is considered likely 
to make his third bid for the nomination 
brown also emphasized that his role in party affairs began years 
before may 1988 when he agreed to join the jackson campaign as 
convention manager 
one vocal opponent of the black attorney alabama party chairman 
john baker said his opposition had nothing to do with browns race 
or his role in the jackson campaign 
baker said he objected to turning the party leadership over to 
someone he described as part of the ultra liberal wing of the 
party 
i cant help the fact that hes black said baker i cant 
help the fact that he was jesse jacksons campaign manager

president mikhail s gorbachev but he also said they did not 
alter the fact that in terms of political philosophy and offensive 
capability the soviet union remains our greatest adversary 
at the pentagon there is a need for reform declared tower 
vowing to implement changes legislated by congress 
he told lawmakers he had severed his ties with defense 
contractors for whom he worked as a consultant over the past two 
years and said he would appoint tough aggressive deputies and 
adopt a policy of zero tolerance toward misbehavior in the 
pentagon 
tower said he would review all us weapons systems with the 
knowledge that difficult choices be made 
nothing is sacred he said there is no room in the future 
of the defense budget for costly mistakes 
we cant afford any more pet rocks whether they are my pet 
rocks the services pet rocks or congress pet rocks said tower 
tower declined to answer some of the toughest questions from his 
former colleagues on whether he favored purchasing major weapons 
systems as the mobile midgetman missile the railbased mx missile 
or the b2 stealth bomber he said those decisions awaited review by 
the new administration 
towers former colleagues treated him with respect although many 
said in their introductory remarks they would quiz him fairly but 
fully on a range of other topics including health personal and 
professional matters 
panel chairman sam nunn dga said the committee would be 
reviewing a lengthy federal bureau of investigation report that he 
said was completed on jan 6 the time required to complete that 
review reportedly delayed bushs nomination of tower 
at the close of the session wednesday nunn said the hearings 
would resume thursday with questions on possible conflict of 
interest involving contractors with whom tower had acted as a 
consultant but there seeemed little doubt that tower would be 
confirmed 
on wednesday nunn questioned tower on how he planned to trim 
pentagon spending and what changes he would support in us defense 
and diplomatic policies 
us national security strategy is currently overreaching and 
ambiguous said nunn 
sen lloyd bentsen the texan who was the democratic vice 
presidential nominee last fall introduced him and said he hoped 
the committee after giving him his baptism of fire will approve 
his nomination 
john tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank check 
from the us treasury to the pentagon said bentsen 
two republican senators minority leader bob dole of kansas and 
phil gramm of texas also testified on towers behalf 
a committee liberal sen edward m kennedy dmass said that 
when tower was chairman i didnt always agree with senator tower 
but i respected him and look forward to working with him as 
secretary of defense 
towers confirmation hearing took place in the senate caucus 
room the big hall used during the watergate and irancontra 
hearings aides said that some sensitive issues might be raised in 
sessions closed to the public 
last month tower who is 63 was hospitalized for surgery to 
remove a cancerous rectal polyp and later a benign polyp and a 
12inch piece of his colon 
questions linger from his personal life as well he was divorced 
in 1987 from his second wife lilla who charged that he had 
committed marital misconduct 
as the hearing got under way tower introduced his three 
daughters penny marian and jeanne and his first wife lou with 
whom he remains on friendly terms he declined nunns invitation to 
introduce other friends including dorothy heyser his companion for 
the past year who sat behind tower family members 
tower spent 24 years in the senate retiring in january 1985 
shortly thereafter he was appointed chief negotiator to arms 
control talks with the soviets in geneva he quit that after 14 
months and served as chairman of the presidential panel that 
investigated the irancontra affair 
one committee member sen albert gore dtenn commended tower 
on the hardheaded approach he said tower took as a negotiator 
for the past two years tower has worked as a defense consultant 
in washington advising industry giants such as rockwell 
international martin marietta and ltv in 1988 tower earned more 
than 665277 in consulting and director fees and more than 74000 
for speaking engagements according to his financial disclosure 
report additionally he received 48743 in federal pensions the 
records show

the aggravated kidnapping trial of felipe chew who also faces a 
separate sexual assault trial in the case

the woman claimed she was assaulted by up to 20 men all have

september led to the sexual assault conviction of a 24yearold man 
who was sentenced to 20 years in prison

room personnel and nursing supervisors said the womans physician 
refused to release further information

briones testified that he fondled the woman and tried to have sex 
with her that night but that he had consumed two cases of beer that 
rendered him impotent

a draft agreement has been reached to transfer 
title to the nations largest collection of indian artifacts from 
new yorks museum of the american indian to the smithsonian 
institution a spokeswoman said wednesday 
the plan is still being negotiated and theres nothing thats 
signed said madeleine jacobs spokeswoman for the smithsonian 
essentially the agreement would transfer title of the heye 
collection to the smithsonian but the smithsonian would be 
obligated to maintain a satellite museum of significant size in 
new york jacobs said 
this would legally fulfill terms of the trust which established 
new yorks museum of the american indian 73 years ago and which 
requires the collection to be in new york 
under the draft agreement most of the collection would be housed 
in a new national museum of the american indian to be built by the 
smithsonian on the mall in washington 
the new york museum could be located in the old us custom house 
in lower manhattan as has been previously suggested but thats 
one of the things thats open to negotiation at this point jacobs 
said 
the draft is to be presented to the smithsonians regents next 
week the museum of the american indian had not signed the 
memorandum either jacobs said 
the latest proposal emerged after years of debating how best to 
preserve and exhibit the more than 1 million artifacts comprising 
the collection of the late george gustav heye the current museum of 
the american indian in upper manhattan is only big enough to 
display about 1 percent of the collection 
in addition it is located in a decaying neighborhood which 
attracts few casual visitors the rest of the collection has been 
moldering in a fourstory warehouse in the bronx 
various plans had been raised for several years to move the 
collection which at one point appeared on the verge of going to 
dallas but new york city officials intervened pointing out that 
the heye trust requires that it remain in new york 
last april smithsonian officials rejected a proposal to break 
the collection into three parts with one moving to the mall one 
remaining at the old manhattan site and another moving into the old 
us custom house in lower manhattan the smithsonians key 
objection to the earlier plan was that it did not want only to have 
borrowing privileges

an american lawyer argued in an unusual hearing 
before the full supreme court on wednesday that japan should end 
restrictions on taking notes in courts 
lawrence repeta of seattle charged that the ban on notetaking by 
spectators in most criminal trials restricts freedom of reporting 
since only members of exclusive judiciary press clubs generally are 
allowed to take notes 
in japans controversial press club system most government 
agencies give preferential access to information to members of 
semiofficial press clubs the clubs generally exclude foreign 
journalists and japanese reporters who work for smaller newspapers 
and magazines 
while attending a tax trial in 198384 as part of his research on 
japanese tax law repeta was repeatedly denied permission by the 
judge to take notes with support from the japanese civil liberties 
union he lodged a complaint which was rejected by both the tokyo 
district court and the tokyo high court 
its a very important international issue repeta said in an 
interview you cant take notes unless you are in a press club 
and no foreign reporters are members of the press clubs if we win 
that will change 
repetas supreme court appeal hearing wednesday was unusual 
because foreigners seldom address the court and it is rare that all 
15 supreme court justices hear a case 
speaking in japanese repeta urged the judges to set a 
democratic standard of openness that will ultimately be followed by 
other branches of the japanese government 
in an interview he said the big question is this what is the 
standing of japan in the world and what kind of model will japan 
give the rest of the world 
japans national government has been very slow in adopting any 
changes that would increase the openness of information if the 
supreme court doesnt show an example of openness we cant expect 
much from the diet parliament or other government agencies he 
said 
the tokyo high court said in rejecting repetas appeal in 
december 1987 that if there is even a slight possibility that 
influence may be exerted upon the fair and smooth conduct of a 
trial restrictions on taking of notes are unavoidable 
although members of court press clubs are allowed to take notes 
they do not have access to court documents and can take photographs 
only before the actual start of a trial said takeshi maezawa 
ombudsman of the yomiuri shimbun japans largest newspaper 
we japanese journalists should place importance on matters 
affecting freedom of the press freedom of information and the 
exchange of information between japan and the rest of the world and 
understand the greater implications of this case with regard to 
those matters he wrote in a column

soviet defense minister gen dimitry 
yazov has given a breakdown of troops to be withdrawn from hungary 
over the next two years as part of a unilateral soviet troop 
reduction plan media reported wednesday 
in geneva the soviet senior arms expert said moscow will seek 
early progress at vienna talks on reducing conventional forces in 
europe that are due to start in march 
yazov detailed the withdrawal figures in a letter to hungarian 
defense minister ferenc karpati saying the first stage to be 
completed by july will include one armoured division and an armoured 
training regiment the official news agency mti reported 
however karpati gave no exact date for the start of the 
withdrawal and mti said the hungarian defense minister refused to 
say how many troops are to leave in the threestage pullout 
he said the kremlin would publish a detailed timetable on what 
forces would be removed and when by the end of this month 
there are an estimated 62000 soviet troops stationed in hungary 
and karpati and other officials have said about one fourth of them 
are to be withdrawn under the kremlin plan 
the withdrawals are part of a unilateral move announced in 
december by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to remove some 
50000 troops from hungary east germany and czechoslovakia as well 
as 5000 tanks by 1990 
the gesture was intended to give impetus to the march talks in 
vienna 
karpati said yazovs schedule foresaw the withdrawal of an 
airborne assault battalion and a fighter plane regiment from 
hungarian territory in the second half of this year 
in 1990 a chemical defense battalion and the staff of a training 
school for noncommissioned officers in eastern hungary would be 
withdrawn mti quoted karpati as saying 
in geneva victor karpov soviet deputy foreign minister and 
senior arms control expert suggested the scheduled vienna talks 
stand a better chance of success than their failed predecessor the 
mutual balanced force reduction talks launched in the early 1970s 
we are going to participate in those talks openmindedly 
karpov said of the conference due to start march 9 with 23 nations 
from east and west 
he said moscow intends to help from the very start to negotiate 
solutions that can bring in a very short period of time real 
reductions with elimination of imbalances between the two camps 
military power in europe as first priority 
he added the soviets are not rigid on the issue of 
verification and will be ready to discuss various possibilities 
karpov was in geneva to lead a soviet delegation to a un 
disarmament workshop 
the official czechoslovak news agency ctk reported wednesday that 
the warsaw pact is to hold annual military exercises in 
czechoslovakia in the first half of february 
the hungarian news agency mti reported that the exercises 
codenamed friendship 89 will involve the hungarian and 
czechoslovak armies as well as soviet forces stationed in 
czechoslovakia 
neither news agency gave an exact date for the exercise

a former diplomat said on wednesday he was 
told the chief of the military governments secret police ordered 
the assassination in washington of dissident chilean politician 
orlando letelier 
jose miguel barros said in sworn testimony the mastermind was 
identified to him as gen manuel contreras sepulveda the united 
states has tried for years to extradite the former secret police 
chief and his assistant col pedro espinoza both now retired 
contreras denied the accusations wednesday night neither i nor 
any official of the intelligence agency were involved in the 
killing he said on santiagos channel 13 
letelier and american aide ronnie moffitt were killed sept 21 
1976 when a remotecontrolled bomb blew up their car he had been a 
cabinet minister and ambassador to the united states for the 
government overthrown by gen augusto pinochet in 1973 and was 
among pinochets most influential critics abroad 
barros was one of seven former officials questioned last week at 
the request of the us justice department newspapers carried his 
testimony in wednesdays editions and barros confirmed the accounts 
to the associated press 
he told testified to judge julio banados that air force gen 
enrique montero told him during a meeting in the late 1970s this 
genius of intelligence mounted an operation to assassinate 
letelier 
barros said montero then undersecretary of the interior ministry 
in the pinochet government identified the genius as contreras 
head of the national intelligence directorate secret police at the 
time of the assassination 
in his testimony barros said another participant in the meeting 
former foreign minister miguel schweitzer told him pinochet did not 
know of the plot 
schweitzer said pinochet asked contreras three times privately 
and two more times in front of witnesses whether he had something to 
do with the letelier case and contreras said no barros testified 
pinochet later ordered administrative sanctions against contreras 
for lying to the president the former ambassador said 
the supreme court rejected the us extradition request in 1979 
on grounds of insufficient evidence that contreras and espinoza were 
involved 
an american employee of the generals secret police michael 
townley confessed in washington to planting the bomb on the order 
of superiors 
army maj armando fernandez larios who fled chile in 1987 and 
surrendered to us authorities confessed to being an accomplice 
and implicated contreras and espinoza 
us officials say chile has not cooperated and they invoked a 
1914 bilateral treaty this month calling for international 
arbitration of disputes that cannot be resolved by other means 
under it the dispute would go to a commission associated with the 
world court in the hague netherlands 
we energetically reject the implicit pressure in an affair that 
we are handling seriously and professionally foreign minister 
hernan errazuriz declared tuesday he said the government had not 
decided on a response

the prosecutor who sent ted bundy to the 
electric chair said wednesday that the serial sex killer may have 
slain as many 50 young women a toll frustrated investigators have 
sought to prove for years 
state attorney jerry blair said that just before tuesdays 
execution at florida state prison near starke he and an fbi expert 
on serial killers informally discussed a weekend of bundy 
confessions 
blair said fbi agent bill hagmeier told him that bundys 
confessions closed the books on 13 killings in washington utah and 
colorado provided information that may never be confirmed on 14 
more cases in washington utah idaho california vermont and 
pennsylvania and touched on at least 20 more slayings in various 
states dating back to 1969 three florida killings charged to bundy 
would be added to the 13 closed cases putting the total to at least 
50 
i dont know that its far off from the figures everybody has 
bandied about anyway blair said those are the figures ive 
heard for many years i dont think well ever know exactly how 
many 
robert keppel a washington state investigator who tracked bundy 
nearly 15 years said he believes bundy may have killed more than 
100 girls and women but that exact details and numbers may never 
be known 
keppel played a tape he had recorded friday with bundy when 
bundy admitted to the eight ted killings of young women in the 
seattle area in 1974 
in the tape bundy describes how he lured a university of 
washington student georgann hawkins to his car beat her with a 
crowbar and then drove her to a secluded grassy spot in the hills 
near issaquah east of seattle 
keppel said bundy used stalling tactics in his last days hoping 
to delay his execution by feeding crumbs of information on his 
murders to investigators but would have fallen silent if a reprieve 
had come through 
fbi spokeswoman kathy bradford said no formal statement would be 
made about bundys crimes until officials have been briefed at the 
fbis quantico va center for the analysis of violent crime 
hagmeier checked out of his starke motel wednesday 
until last week bundy had denied killing anyone he was convicted 
in three slayings in florida and charged in only one death in 
colorado several bodies have never been found 
bundy a 42yearold law school dropout and onetime republican 
activist in washington state was executed shortly after 7 am 
tuesday for the 1978 kidnap rape and murder of 12yearold kimberly 
leach whose body was found in an abandoned pigsty 
in an interview monday with psyhologist james dobson bundy 
refused to discuss details of the leach murder i cant talk about 
that right now its too painful 
he was also sentenced to death for killing two florida state 
students in their chi omega sorority house on the university campus 
just three weeks before miss leach was abducted in lake city 
he died under his fourth death warrant 
there is no way in the world that killing me is going to 
restore those beautiful children to their parents said bundy who 
told dobson he didnt want to die 
but bundy said he deserved his punishment and expressed remorse 
about his long bloody trail of kidnappings sadistic sexual 
mutilations and slayings 
i dont want to die im not going to kid you but i 
deserve certainly the most extreme punishment society has i think 
society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me 
he said 
in the 29minute interview bundy said his home life had been 
normal but early experiences with pornography had crystallized 
violent tendencies within him 
i am essentially a normal person except for this 
destructive segment he said emphasizing that he didnt blame 
pornography for his actions and took full responsibility 
people need to recognize those of us who are or who have 
been so much influenced by violence in the media in particular 
pornographic violence are not some kind of inherent monsters we 
are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular 
families and pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any 
house today 
bundy warned that there were others like himself 
there are loose in the towns and their communities people like 
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in day out 
by violence in the media particularly sexual violence he said 
about 100 people gathered wednesday in the rotunda at the state 
capitol for a vigil opposing capital punishment and to mourn the 
victims of ted bundy and to grieve with their friends and 
families said roberta christie of amnesty international 
also wednesday us sens bob graham dfla and sen sam nunn 
dga refiled a bill offered in previous years to cure what graham 
called a federal judiciary mired in an encumbering backlog of 
frivolous appeals 
if enacted the bill would give convicted killers a oneyear 
limit on filing federal habeas corpus appeals after statecourt 
appeals were exhausted and a twoyear limit on challenging denials 
of such federal appeals 
a double execution is scheduled in florida next week if both ian 
lightbourn under his second warrant and robert raymond clark 
under his fourth death warrant go to the electric chair it will be 
the first double execution on the same day in nearly 25 years 
lightbourn 29 was condemned for the 1981 shooting of nancy a 
ofarrell in marion county clark 47 was sentenced to die for the 
shooting murder of david drake who was abducted in 1977 in pinellas 
county 
florida last executed two inmates on one day may 12 1964 when 
sie dawson and emmett blake died 28 minutes apart several multiple 
executions have been scheduled in recent years but appeals have 
blocked them

a huge fireball was spotted over 
northwestern oregon and southern washington wednesday afternoon and 
one expert said it probably was an unusually large and fiery meteor 
the sighting was reported to the us coast guard by a 
motorcyclist traveling on a coastal highway about 130 pm later 
dozens of witnesses reported it to broadcast stations from the coast 
to southcentral washington 
bruce spainhower of the oregon museum of science and industry 
said that judging from the various reports the fireball was probably 
a bolide a brilliant meteor that appears to explode in the earths 
atmosphere some bolides are large enough that they fail to burn up 
completely before hitting the earths surface as meteorites 
witnesses described the fireball as plainly visible on a bright 
sunny winter afternoon traveling from west to east many also 
reported they heard a sonic boom after the sighting 
spainhower said that if those descriptions of the size and the 
trajectory are accurate it was quite possible the meteor landed 
somewhere in eastern washington 
he said most meteors often called shooting stars range in 
size from a pea to a walnut and burn up in the air 
spainhower said a bolide of such magnitude is very rare and he 
encouraged the public to call in reports to help scientists 
determine if it landed and where

the jury in the joel steinberg murder trial ended 
three days of deliberations without a verdict wednesday and a 
defense lawyer said he was guardedly optimistic about an 
acquittal on the main charge of murder 
the jurors who recessed at 855 pm indicated the day before 
they were sharply divided when they asked the judge whether they 
could move to the lesser homicide counts against steinberg if they 
were not unanimous on the top count seconddegree murder 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax repeated what he told 
the six men and six women before they got the case monday that they 
must unanimously acquit steinberg of murdering 6yearold lisa 
steinberg before moving down to firstdegree manslaughter 
seconddegree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide 
deliberations were scheduled to resume at 10 am thursday 
defense lawyer ira london said the questions the jurors asked 
tuesday and the length of their deliberations had made him 
guardedly optimistic about steinberg being acquitted on the 
murder charge 
this is an extremely intelligent jury london said if they 
cant resolve the murder charge theyre going to say were not 
going to sit here and look at each other but theyre not going to 
permit a mistrial either 
london said he expected the panel to exercise what is known in 
legal circles as jury nullification this means they would 
disregard the judges legal instructions and do what they feel is 
right 
the jurors sent out no notes during the morning session 
wednesday and shortly before 6 pm asked for a rereading of 
testimony by pathologists who testified for the prosecution and the 
defense 
the first was dr douglas miller a neuropathologist at new york 
university medical center and a prosecution witness he said the 
force that caused lisas head injuries was equivalent to a 
threestory fall and could have been inflicted by a man the size of 
steinberg who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 to 190 pounds 
the jury also asked to rehear the testimony of dr john plunkett 
a coroner from st paul minn and the defense pathologist he 
agreed with miller that lisa was the victim of a homicide but 
testified her injuries could have been caused by a woman the size of 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs former companion 
in addition the jurors asked to rehear plunketts testimony on 
the cat scan of lisas brain the cat scan he said showed that 
less force had caused lisas injuries than miller had testified 
the jurors said that after rehearing the testimony they would go 
to dinner and retire for the night 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer is charged in the fatal 
beating of lisa the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed long 
island teenager and raised as his own but never legally adopted 
the child was comatose when taken from steinbergs greenwich 
village apartment on nov 2 1987 to a hospital where she died of a 
brain injury three days later 
london said he believes ms nussbaum the prosecutions star 
witness is the center of the jurys deliberation difficulties 
ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens book editor testified that 
steinberg told her in bed after they smoked cocaine and while lisa 
lay comatose on their bathroom floor that he had knocked lisa 
down and she didnt want to get up 
steinbergs lawyers charge that ms nussbaum fatally beat the 
child in a jealous rage 
the prosecution maintains that ms nussbaum against whom murder 
charges were dropped after she agreed to be a prosecution witness 
was too physically and emotionally disabled by 12 years of living 
with steinberg to have harmed lisa

us navy secrets are easier to steal than 
toothpaste from a department store former navy radioman and 
convicted spy john a walker said in an interview broadcast 
wednesday night 
i have to say that kmart security is better than anything the 
navy would have i mean kmart protects their toothpaste better than 
the navy protects their top secrets said walker who was a chief 
warrant officer with top secret clearance 
walker spoke in an interview filmed in the federal prison in 
marion ill where he is serving life for running a soviet spy 
ring the commercial channel 4 television program dispatches 
calling him americas most notorious spy said it was the first 
time he had been interviewed 
walker said the lax security enabled him to photograph decoding 
material and technical manuals at us navy bases and on warships 
from which the soviets were able to build copies of the latest 
cryptographic machines 
he said when offered some of the material the soviets told him 
not to bother indicating they had other spies at work they were 
probably paying for the stuff five times walker said 
walker said he was interviewed by the national security agency 
and the boys went pale when he told them the soviets wanted 
nothing on machines that went into service in the early 1980s with 
the us navy and nato indicating they already had what they needed 
the program said walkers spying activities would have 
compromised secret material of all the navies in the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization it said the soviets read millions of 
secret messages exchanged between the various navies 
the balding bespectacled and bearded spy looked relaxed and 
confident and was smoking a pipe the program said he insisted on 
being interviewed in civilian and not prison garb 
walker said his espionage even included updating his own security 
clearance and inserting it in his navy records 
the fact of the matter is i did perfect work for both 
governments at the same time my work for the us navy was 
extraordinary exemplary my work for the soviets was also 
exemplary he said 
the program said the soviets paid walker 1 million for supplying 
them with codebreaking information over 18 years 
walker showed no remorse in the interview and often smiled and 
laughed but he said at the end im very sorry sorry for the 
navy for the country 
the walker spy ring is behind bars but there are still more 
than 4 million americans cleared for access to more than a trillion 
classified documents in the past eight years alone 40 traitors 
have been caught trying to sell secrets the program said 
walker said in conclusion you have to assume they are not 
arresting everybody what percentage do you think they are arresting 
half a third 1 percent i dont know

a federal appeals court on wednesday revived 
a lesbians lawsuit against the cia for denying her a security 
clearance 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said a claim that the cia 
has a policy of rejecting clearances for any homosexual an 
allegation the agency denies should not have been dismissed 
without a trial 
the cias explanation for its actions in this case suggests the 
agency considers all persons who engage in homosexual activity to 
be unacceptable security risks the court said in a 30 decision 
the ruling allows julie dubbs an openly lesbian employee of a 
military contractor on the san francisco peninsula to go to trial 
on her claim that the cia unconstitutionally denied her a highlevel 
security clearance in 1981 
attorney richard gayer noting that his client received a similar 
clearance from the army said the decision gives us a chance to 
embarrass the cia by forcing it to justify its practices he said 
he was disappointed the court required her to prove discrimination 
before the federal judge who had previously thrown out her case 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown would not comment on 
behalf of the government 
dubbs of santa clara maintains she needed the clearance to 
advance in her job as a senior technical illustrator for sri 
international of menlo park 
the cia turned her down in a letter that gave two reasons she 
had not volunteered information about her homosexuality during an 
initial security investigation an action that an agency official 
described as showing a willingness to engage in deceptive 
behavior and although her current lover was also an open 
lesbian dubbs might have a future partner who is not an open 
homosexual and who fears public exposure

a federal grand jury returned indictments tuesday naming david 
morehead and shannon brennan of lovelock eugene john thacker of 
winnemucca and david thacker and ronald emory hage of cosgrave 
mattly said

to surrender the four in custody were held under 50000 bail 
morehead is charged with seven counts of killing a wild horse or

where more than 500 mustangs have been found dead since last august 
most of the animals had been shot 
mattly gave no motives for the killings and would not say how the 
five men were tracked down except to credit an extensive 
investigation on the part of the bureau of land management law 
enforcement staff

investigated since it was first brought to our attention last 
august we have interviewed over 200 people and done extensive

a church group on wednesday denounced the 
slaying of 36 indians during 1988 and blamed the government of 
president jose sarney for increasing violence against native 
populations in brazil 
at least 28 of the deaths were linked to battles over land and 
in the majority of cases authorities took no measures to find or 
punish the guilty parties antonio brand executive secretary of 
the indian missionary council said in a press conference 
brand said the worst indian massacre last year was the march 28 
slaying of 14 tikuna indians in the far northern state of amazonas 
after a dispute over land with a wealthy wood dealer 
in a press release the council also mentioned the death of 25 
yanomami indians through diseases transmitted by white men such as 
malaria or poisoning by mercury which is used by gold prospectors 
to refine the precious metal 
brand said the governments refusal to remove the thousands of 
gold prospectors from yanomami territory in the amazon jungle region 
will allow the continued massacre of this people 
the yanomami indians are brazils most primitive tribe and live 
almost without contact with the modern world close to brazils 
northern border with venezuela 
brand said the government was responsible for the state of 
chronic violence that exists in the rain forest which is rich in 
gold diamonds iron ore and uranium 
currently about 220000 native indians and 430 tribes remain out 
of a population estimated at 5 million when brazil was discovered by 
the portuguese 
about 15 percent of the amazon has been destroyed by farming 
gold prospecting and mining according to the usbased institute 
for policy studies an estimated 400000 gold prospectors are 
located throughout the amazon and along with farmers and 
woodcutters often involve themselves in territory disputes with 
indians

a 4milelong ditch that a justice department 
official compared wednesday to a buried berlin wall is planned 
for a stretch of the usmexican border to stem drug smuggling into 
southern california 
but the plan is being criticized as too little too late by a 
group that advocates building fences along the border and blasted as 
repressive by immigrant rights organizations 
associate attorney general francis a keating ii said he proposed 
the idea last fall as a way to discourage drug smugglers from 
driving loads of cocaine marijuana and heroin across the border 
near san diego 
the plan being undertaken by the immigration and naturalization 
service was approved last month by attorney general dick thornburgh 
keating said 
the ditch which keating likened to our buried berlin wall 
will be deep and wide enough to discourage smugglers from driving 
trucks and cars across the border along a fourmile stretch of flat 
desert east of san ysidro calif 
the associate attorney general who is leaving office with the 
start of the bush administration said the desert stretch in the 
otay mesa area east of san ysidro is a major drug smuggling route 
the cocaine marijuana and heroin from mexico is being carried 
across the border between the points of entry that are operated by 
the customs service keating said 
this is not intended in any way to interfere with legitimate 
traffic or trade it is not intended to stop legal entry he said 
the border patrol has tried to stop vehicle traffic across the 
desert by digging shallow trenches but smugglers have been able to 
fill in the ditches to drive through keating said 
no country is a country that cant protect its border said 
keating who oversaw law enforcement agencies in the justice 
department including the border patrol this is one of many 
systems to do it 
i am sure it will be applauded by people who are sick and tired 
of the deluge of cocaine and heroin that is flowing across the 
mexican border keating said in an interview 
in california dale cozart chief us border patrol agent in the 
san diego sector said this is no panacea to all of the 
drivethrough situations we have in the otay mesa area its just 
another tool that theyll be using 
but the plan has its critics 
the drainage ditch is too little too late if it is to be taken 
seriously as a method of deterring illegal entry said patrick 
burns assistant director of federation for american immigration 
reform 
there is a serious problem at san diego of which a very very 
small component is highspeed drivethroughs by drug smugglers 
said burns whose organization is preparing to release a study 
proposing ways to harden the usmexican border 
burns said a barrier of earth reinforced with concrete would be a 
more effective means of preventing drug trafficking across the 
desert 
eugene hernandez an official of the mexicanamerican political 
association in los angeles called it a very repressive and a very 
illfounded idea 
rather than constructing the ditch i think they should hire 
more people more agents at the border hernandez said 
once again we appear to be obsessed with dealing with symptoms 
instead of trying to find solutions to illegal immigration said 
arnoldo torres national political director for the washingtonbased 
league of united latin american citizens 
he said the plan will have negative consequences symbolically 
as well as substantively 
keating confirmed a report in wednesday editions of the los 
angeles times which said the 5feet deep and 14foot wide ditch was 
planned for completion by next fall 
the isolated otay mesa area a gateway into southern california 
for illegal immigrants is believed to be the most popular crossing 
spot along the entire 1900mile usmexico border 
about one third of the 12 million illegal immigrants captured 
along the border last year were apprehended at otay mesa 
up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally 
into san diego each month officials said

a 6yearold girl died wednesday after being 
shot in the head by her 8yearold brother with a gun their 
grandmother had purchased for protection against burglars officials 
said 
the incident occurred during an afterschool argument while the 
two were home alone police said 
the girl had been declared braindead following the monday 
afternoon incident but she was on lifesupport machines at fairfax 
hospital she died after those machines were turned off hospital 
officials said 
the shooting occurred after the two children returned home from 
school according to police in this washington dc suburb 
police did not release the names of the children the shooting 
occurred at the home of the childrens grandmother dorothy bea 
where they had moved last year after their parents separated 
the incident began when the boy a secondgrader began playing 
with a 32 pistol mrs bea kept in a dresser drawer in her bedroom 
his sister who was in the first grade scolded him for playing with 
the gun and he responded by shooting her police said 
the shooting occurred after the children had returned home from 
school which ended at 110 pm they were normally alone in the 
home until 3 pm when an uncle came home officials said 
fairfax county commonwealths attorney robert f horan jr said 
he probably will not file charges against the girls brother unless 
it can be proven the attack was deliberate 
horan said police must have evidence that the boy was capable 
of forming criminal intent when he pulled the trigger does he 
know right from wrong that would be determined by a lot of 
things he said 
although the shooting was termed deliberate by police they 
werent sure about the boys state of mind 
when we say deliberate we mean it was not an accidental 
thing said police spokesman warren carmichael he did point 
the gun and he did pull the trigger whether he realized what 
would happen were just not in a position to say 
mrs bea said she doesnt believe her grandson intended to harm 
his sister 
as far as im concerned it was an accident she said hes 
just eight he couldnt have known 
mrs bea said she bought the gun 18 months ago for protection 
against burglars 
neither of the children knew she owned a gun until the boy began 
rummaging through the dresser drawers after christmas bea said the 
boy told police

police staged more than 20 raids 
around the capital wednesday seeking evidence connected to an 
attack on a base that left 36 people dead and at least 68 wounded 
attorney general andres dalessio said 
also wednesday president raul alfonsin signed a decree creating 
a national security council to investigate the attack and prevent 
subversion 
alessio said three of the civilian commandos identified belonged 
to radical leftist groups supporting the governments contention 
that the attack was leftistinspired he also said the attackers 
identified so far are argentine 
in all 17 men and two women between the ages of 19 and 35 were 
being held at police headquarters in downtown buenos aires 
dalessio said a 20th person was hospitalized with wounds and may 
or may not be involved with the commandos he said 
previously the government acknowleged only 14 people were under 
arrest 
he also said the commandos included five women two of which were 
killed and three arrested 
shortly after dawn monday about 50 heavily armed civilians burst 
through the main gate at the 3rd infantry regiment at la tablada on 
the outskirts of buenos aires by tuesday afternoon at least 28 
were dead and perhaps 10 others escaped 
seven soldiers and a policeman also were killed officials said 
the attorney general said police raided between 20 and 25 places 
in the capital and its suburbs as part of an investigation of the 
base attack one woman was arrested dalessio declined to give any 
further details 
dalessio offered little information about the commandos motives 
and ideology but the identities of three lent support to the 
position of president raul alfonsin that the group was comprised of 
radical leftists 
among the dead were jose luis caldu a former member of the 
castroinspired peoples revolutionary army and jorge manuel banos 
a leader of a spinoff group known as movement everyone for the 
country banos recently denounced alleged plans by rightists in the 
military to overthrow the government and install peronist 
presidential candidate carlos menem 
at least 18 bodies remain to be identified dalessio said 
erp as the peoples revolutionary army is called by its spanish 
acronym formally disbanded in 1980 after years of battling with 
soldiers in open clashes and being decimated in the process the 
movement is a small littleknown organization that includes exerp 
militants 
under arrest is another movement leader juan manuel burgos 
pamphlets and statements found among the commandos indicated they 
called themselves the popular resistance front which government 
sources say was composed of former members of the erp the movement 
and other groups 
the propaganda indicated the commandos saw themselves as acting 
to prevent an imminent rightwing coup 
there was little indication what the group intended to do at the 
base or achieve by the attack or whether it had links to similar 
groups 
a congressional source with close ties to the left said the 
attackers hoped to carry out a lightning raid to demonstrate their 
militant opposition to rightwing elements in the army and to 
attract popular support and that they did not intend a shootout 
alvaro alsogaray presidential candidate of the center alliance 
said the government must make sure the attack is an isolated 
incident and not the leading edge of a wave of attacks like those 
that plagued the country 15 years ago 
alfonsin in a nationwide speech tuesday night said resolving 
the symptoms if not the causes of subversion is the last test of 
my government and pledged to establish a national security council 
the council over which alfonsin personally is to preside will 
include the ministers of defense interior and foreign relations 
the heads of argentinas army navy and air force and others the 
president might choose later 
the immediate goals are to figure out what happened in mondays 
base attack determine whether other potential threats exist 
develop strategies of prevention and coordinate information 
alfonsins election in 1983 replaced a military dictatorship he 
will step down in december after national elections in may

the american psychological association says a 
survey of the scientific research on abortion suggests that most 
women suffer no lasting emotional problems from the procedure 
by and large what you find is that most of the women who have 
abortions experience a sense of relief brian wilcox director of 
public interest legislation at the apa said in an interview on 
tuesday 
the apa survey found that much research on the subject has been 
flawed but it also found the notion of a postabortion syndrome is 
not a scientifically or medically recognized disorder 
earlier this month us surgeon general c everett koop said in 
a letter to the white house that there was no scientifically sound 
evidence showing negative health effects to the 15 million women 
who get abortions annually

the united states three months ago after becoming disillusioned with 
widespread official corruption and with cuban support for marxist 
rebels in at least three latin american countries 
hector aguililla saladrigas 35 broke with the revolution last 
october when he was granted political asylum by us officials but 
his defection was not publicly disclosed until the state department 
made him available for an interview tuesday with the associated 
press 
aguililla criticized the corruption that he said cuban officials 
engaged in while he was posted in syria and iran and added he was 
troubled by the lack of freedom and the total militarization of 
cuban society 
president fidel castro has acknowledged that corruption in cuba 
is a problem but he nonetheless contends that the revolution has 
produced hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer 
for social welfare projects at home and in numerous third world 
countries

a 5000yearold irish tomb has yielded new 
evidence that it provided a dramatic light show at sunrise of the 
winter solstice making it the oldest known structure with an 
astronomical function a researcher says 
the new work gives the strongest argument yet that astronomy 
influenced its design an idea suggested by previous research said 
astronomer tom ray of the dublin institute for advanced studies 
the tomb built centuries before stonehenge or the great 
pyramids was probably designed to use sunlight for ritual rather 
than scientific purposes ray said in a recent interview 
his research used surveying instruments to determine the path of 
ancient sunlight in the newgrange tomb which is north of dublin 
the findings appear in thursdays issue of the british journal

its seminar season time for experts and 
unemployed candidates to talk about overhauling the way americans 
nominate and elect their presidents theyll get scant encouragement 
from president bush 
bush who won once and lost once under the current system said 
he will play by the rules until some better ones come along 
im not going to spend any time trying to redo it he said in 
an interview prior to his inauguration 
campaigns grow longer and more costly every time presidential 
primary elections multiply and for a while after each election 
there is talk of change in the name of reform its been that way 
since the democrats began changing the system nearly 20 years ago 
that changed the process for republicans too because the primary 
election laws enacted by state legislatures usually cover both sides 
so far efforts at change have only made campaigns more complex 
more expensive and more timeconsuming 
long before bush has been in the white house a year prospective 
challengers will be making their first moves toward the 1992 
campaign most of which will have to do with raising money step one 
these days is to set up a political action committee to bankroll 
preliminary operations 
all told there were 38 presidential primary elections in 1988 
on a single night super tuesday 20 states a dozen of them in the 
south chose nominating delegates by primary or caucus 
democratic rereformers tried to put more political savvy in 
their nominating process by guaranteeing party elders and 
officeholders seats at the democratic national convention but that 
was scaled back at last summers convention under pressure from 
jesse jackson who got almost no support from those exofficio 
delegates 
that was part of a peacemaking package with gov michael dukakis 
the democratic nominee against bush and it illustrates the reality 
the reformers cant alter the nominating system in both parties 
bends to accommodate the candidates who master it to gain power 
southern democrats devised the super tuesday notion which was 
supposed to give their more conservative constituencies an early and 
influential voice in the contest for the 1988 democratic nomination 
it sent the party no clear signal the path was left open for 
dukakis but it was a turning point for the republicans as bush came 
close to a sweep 
bush said early this month that the regional concept was 
something new this time and it proved to be a tremendous boon 
for me 
he said other regions will start looking at alliances that would 
cluster their primaries to increase their influence the western 
states some day are going to get together and say why should we be 
left out all the time why shouldnt we get in there and be up 
front 
thats occurred to some other regions too new england made a 
stab at it but wound up as an adjunct to super tuesday in part 
because new hampshire was not about to give up its premier primary 
to enter into a group 
there are other proposals for restricting primaries to certain 
dates so there would be a limited number of election days during the 
primary season and by a combination of date and region so that 
candidates wouldnt spend so much time traipsing between distant 
campaign states 
bush doubts the revisionists will get far his skepticism is 
founded on experience it happens every fourth year bush said hed 
seen it coming everybodys going to go up to harvard and try 
to figure out whats wrong with the system 
i dont think youre going to redesign it he said 
and he certainly isnt going to try why should i go out and 
say iowas a lousy idea he asked im here because of iowa 
not iowa in 88 iowa in 80 
in 1980 bush upset an absentee ronald reagan in the iowa 
precinct caucuses first event on the presidential campaign 
calendar that vaulted him out of the field and ultimately led to 
his nomination for vice president in 1988 iowa was his most severe 
setback bush ran third but as vice president he was able to come 
back quickly 
you want to get that broad perspective he said looking 
back that perspective comes most readily to winners

it isnt hard to understand why many americans 
have stopped contributing to their individual retirement accounts in 
the past couple of years 
since 1987 they havent been allowed to deduct the contributions 
on their tax returns if they are covered by a pension plan and have 
incomes that exceed specified limits 35000 for single filers and 
50000 for married couples 
for those who remain eligible furthermore the deduction doesnt 
save as much in taxes under the system of lower tax brackets created 
by tax reform 
people in the 15 percent bracket who make 2000 contributions 
for example get only a 300 tax break 
nondeductible ira contributions still are allowed for anyone 
with income from a job but nondeductible iras have proved to be 
less than a big hit 
that is evidenced by the dropoff that has occurred in ira 
promotions by banks and other financial institutions especially at 
this time of year 
a lot of bankers arent as hot on the account as before tax 
reform reports the newsletter 100 highest yields which tracks 
trends in consumer banking the editors say they have heard reports 
that some outfits wont promote their iras at all in 1989 
analysts who have studied the situation say the iras fall from 
favor is partly the result of confusion and misunderstanding 
they say some people who could still make deductible 
contributions have the mistaken impression that they no longer can 
do so 
in addition they observe savers at all levels often fail to 
appreciate the power of taxfree compounding which still applies 
for all iras and there is an understandable reluctance to tie the 
money up until age 59 when withdrawals are permitted with no 
penalty 
even if you decide to make a nondeductible contribution your 
resolve may weaken when you confront the paperwork and 
recordkeeping it will require over the years 
once you make a nondeductible contribution you know that you 
will someday have nontaxable distributions assuming that you dont 
want to pay taxes on the same money twice 
that ushers you into the wonderful word of such documents as 
internal revenue service form 8606 nondeductible ira 
contributions ira basis and nontaxable ira distributions 
form 8606 entitles you to spend an extra 28 minutes irs 
estimate each year wrestling with such demons as 
12 enter total ira distributions received during 1988 do not 
include amounts rolled over before 1189 see instructions 
with all this though some advisers on matters of personal 
finance contend that people who shy away from iras may be missing a 
bet especially if they arent taking other compensating steps to 
plan for retirement 
the arguments about keeping savings liquid and avoiding irs 
reporting requirements are cogent but not cogent enough 
declares jonathon pond president of financial planning information 
inc in watertown mass 
the taxdeferral feature of iras will result in a superior 
return versus investing outside the ira quite frankly we also like 
the notion of removing retirementoriented money from temptations 
reach 
the onerous ira reporting requirements can be reduced 
considerably if only one or a couple of ira accounts are utilized

quoting scripture the preacher put it to the new us president 
this way when one rules justly over men ruling in the fear of 
god he dawns on them like the morning light 
the robed whitehaired clergyman head of the denomination to 
which bush belongs advised him and others that people today 
hunger for moral leadership and as they are satisfied they are 
reconciled to one another 
the advice came from the most rev edmond lee browning presiding 
bishop of the episcopal church at a special worship service last 
sunday attended by bush and officials of his new administration 
moral leadership is grounded in the inner disposition of love 
and compassion browning said 
this inner disposition nurtured by the holy writings and 
prayer enables a leader to reach out to tap and release the deep 
well of justice and compassion in a nations people 
in the congregation at the national cathedral the episcopal 
center in washington were bushs family his designated cabinet and 
staff members of congress and an ecumenical turnout of religious 
leaders 
browning as the episcopal churchs primate is the presiding 
officer and chief spiritual guide to its 28 million members 
including bush 
moral leadership makes conscious that which lies unconscious in 
the soul of a nation browning said his gaze roving over that 
gathering of the powerful from this leadership flows healing and 
unity of purpose 
from this leadership emerges national greatness of will and 
purpose in the exercise of justice and mercy from this leadership 
can come the reconciliation of the peoples of the earth 
when the moral leader shows his inner disposition of love and 
compassion through his words and actions the people recognize 
acclaim and accept its authority 
browning cited jesus sermon on the mount about caring for the 
poor the peacemakers even ememies as setting the fundamental 
standards of charity and compassion toward each other 
he helps all people to accept the attributes of a nation that 
is blessed by god browning said he said those principles were 
exemplified in the presidency of abraham lincoln in the civil war 
leaders living by those principles pray as jesus did that gods 
will be done browning said these moral leaders are blessed 
because they can discern what is good and bad true and false 
corrupt and incorruptible 
they are blessed because they have internalized the will of 
god 
browning quoted from the book of samuel in which god told ancient 
israels king david that a just ruler dawns on people like the 
morning light like the sun shining forth upon a cloudless morning 
like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth 
the homily was one of three delivered at the special service 
culminating a weekend of inaugural events 
the other two sermons were by missouris gov john ashcroft a 
layman of the assemblies of god and by the rev peter gomes an 
american baptist and minister of harvard universitys memorial 
church 
ashcroft preaching on care for gods creation pointed out that 
humanity was created from dust 
that makes dust pretty important he said the elements are 
not only gods creation but were chosen by god to represent his own 
character we are dust ultimately contamination of the 
environment is selfcontamination 
noting that gods first order to adam was to tend and care for 
the garden ashcroft said wrongful use of the garden brought to 
both adam and the environment a curse 
we still have the charge to dress the garden and to work it 
ashcorft said we are stewards of creation of the very 
elements from which god chose to create us in his own image 
others might think it insignificant but to those who believe 
dust and deity are closely linked 
by giving us dominion over the earthgod has shared with us 
his role of creatorin large measure we shape the nature of the 
world in which we live we can create communities of pollution or 
purity we make the choice 
fortunately many of our environmental missteps of the past can 
be redeemed we have an incredibly wonderful opportunity to correct 
some of our past errors to clean them up and start over again 
gomes said hope must be restored to the destitute of our 
american calcuttas to the prisoners of the inner city to 
youths the aged aids sufferers and the prisoners of affluence 
and indifference 
god has ordained governments to be instruments of hope he 
said in god we trust but in governments we hope

rhett butler is gone and taras a mess but 
scarlett ohara still knows one thing tomorrow is another day 
gone with the wind was a mess too but david o selznicks 
blockbuster the worlds most popular film has been restored and 
will rise yet again this month for a 50th anniversary tour thats 
already selling out theaters 
since its dec 15 1939 premiere the popularity of the movie 
based on margaret mitchells novel about the civil war and 
reconstruction has never faltered 
it broke boxoffice records by grossing 14 million its first 
year and new generations flocked to carefully spaced reissues in 
1947 1954 1961 and 1967 the 1976 television debut was the largest 
audience ever to tune in for a theatrical feature with 339 million 
homes watching the film has so far grossed 767 million at the box 
office and had been the no 1 topgrossing movie until the sound 
of music edged ahead in 1965 
a widescreen version made in the 1960s turned gone with the 
wind into a celluloid mess the conversion ruined the color and 
composition of the movie which had been made in technicolor 
promoters say the newly restored version brings back the color and 
majesty of the original 
television entrepreneur ted turner who owns the film is 
planning a 42city tour in american movie houses for the restored 
print the 3hour film which won eight academy awards including 
best picture is already sold out with tickets at 10 and 1250 
for the first showing jan 3031 in new york city 
the day of its premiere in 1939 the governor declared a holiday 
and more than a million people crowded into downtown atlanta as 
clark gable and vivien leigh led a parade of stars down peachtree 
street to loews grand theater which was decked out with a white 
marble facade reminiscent of tara scarletts plantation they were 
celebrating the film version of a hometown writers pulitzer 
prizewinning epic 
turner acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought 
mgmua entertainment corp with its massive film library for 15 
billion he daily began showing the david o selznick blockbuster in 
1987 at one of the six theaters at cnn center the headquarters of 
his cabletv empire a shop in the atrium offers gwtw 
memorabilia he also launched his 24hour tv channel turner network 
television with you guessed it gone with the wind 
its his favorite movie said turner broadcasting system 
spokesman frank miller so turner was only too happy to foot the 
250000 bill for the complex restoration process using the original 
negatives 
the situation before was that they were making prints from 
masters that were several stages removed from the original 
negatives miller said there were prints floating around that 
were four or five generations removed 
for the restored version turner obtained every bit of negative 
he could in the best possible condition from eastman house in 
rochester ny and then printed under optimal conditions he 
said 
what really comes out is a better print than has ever been seen 
before even since 39 they selznicks crew had wonderful 
equipment for recording and sound but not as good equipment for 
printing it 
also restored is the original sweep title which moved across 
the screen from right to left in the 1939 version it had been 
replaced by a block title showing all four words at once in 
remakes during the 1960s 
the anniversary celebration comes just one year before the 
anticipated publication of the longawaited sequel to mitchells 
novel after fighting for decades to keep others from continuing the 
story of scarlett and rhett the mitchell estate authorized a sequel 
in 1987 and last year chose alexandra ripley a virginia author to 
write it 
warner books paid 494 million for the rights to publish the 
sequel 
turners staff is putting together events to celebrate the films 
50th anniversary in december 
there will be a ball of some kind in atlanta miller said 
but its not for sure right now what exactly is going to be done 
until turner bought the rights atlanta had few permanent 
reminders that it was the home of mitchell who won a pulitzer prize 
for the 1936 novel that has sold 25 million copies efforts to save 
the apartment where she wrote much of the book are tied up in court 
the loews which opened as an opera house in 1892 was gutted by 
fire in 1978 
the restored version of gwtw will be available on 
videocassette for home use as will a tbs documentary the making 
of a legend gone with the wind which was produced by selznicks 
sons l jeffrey and daniel selznick 
the original was released on videocassette in 1985 and has sold 
more than 500000 copies at 8995 each in the united states with 
similar sales overseas initially 29000 copies had to be destroyed 
because they opened with 45 seconds of the wrong music a strident 
marching song the videos were later rereleased with the correct 
tune dixie

in 1939 as britain and france challenged the 
german war machine and admiral richard byrd made his third 
expedition to the icy vastness of antarctica america went to the 
movies 
and oh what movies they were 
never had hollywood seen such a single year a year bursting with 
delicious and memorable screen treats including gone with the 
wind the wizard of oz wuthering heights and mr smith

middle of an ice cream jungle with 26 flavors dangling from vines 
there was john wayne riding tall in stagecoach his first 
major feature laurence olivier and merle oberon left audiences 
breathless as heathcliff and cathy in wuthering heights they 
were torn with desire and twisted with hate robert donat 
played the shy schoolmaster in the sloshy and sentimental goodbye 
mr chips with greer garson in her screen debut 
meanwhile james stewart tried to inject intelligence decency 
and some good old common sense into congress in frank capras mr 
smith goes to washington smith i wouldnt give you two cents 
for all your fancy rules if behind them they didnt have a little 
bit of plain ordinary kindness and a little looking out for the 
other fella 
and there was the timeless fantasy the wizard of oz which 
has touched practically every child in america it was directed by 
victor fleming who also was a director on 1939s most spectacular 
movie and indeed one of the most popular films of all time gone 
with the wind which won eight academy awards 
it was a time when more than 50 percent of the population 
regularly went to the cinema and more than 500 pictures came out 
each year it was a time when americans talked about going to the 
movies today one goes to see with any luck a movie and 
that one movie might be only 90 minutes long and not very good 
in 1939 when the studio system was at its height churning out 
motion pictures to satisfy a moviegoing public magic came to 
hollywood how such grand movies all came out at the same time and 
managed to survive the years and become among the best ever made is

rhett butler with a wide paintedon mustache 
meandering eyebrows eye glasses and a cigar 
well if author margaret mitchell had her way and had been really 
serious about it it would have been groucho marx who swept miss 
scarlett up all those stairs for a taste of southern lust instead of 
clark gable 
with all the hollywood hype to recruit stars for gone with the 
wind mitchell who wrote the pulitzer prizewinning best seller 
kept her distance because she feared fellow southerners would blame 
her if the movie didnt turn out well she didnt want to help write 
the script wouldnt participate in the casting search for stars and 
finally coughed up her own candidate the ribald comic 
as one of the most popular movies of all time gone with the 
wind is awash with such nuggets 
did you know for example that the winner of eight academy 
awards was panned by some critics 
a major event in the history of the industry but only a minor 
event in motion picture art there are moments when the two 
categories meet on good terms but the long stretches between are 
filled with mere spectacular efficiency wrote franz hoellering in 
the nation 
shakespeares the taming of the shrew seems to have gotten 
mixed up with one of the novels of ethel m dell wrote james 
agate 
here are some other gone with the wind factoids 
two soundtracks were released with the 1939 film one for 
domestic distribution and one for overseas in the international 
version there was strident marching music and the visual was an 
elaborate description of the northsouth conflict the domestic 
version had a sweet version of dixie and talked about the 
halcyon days in the south that are gone with the wind 
with all the oscars the movie copped there was one significant 
omission clark gable he lost out to robert donat for his 
performance in goodbye mr chips 
hattie mcdaniel who won an academy award for supporting 
actress for her role as the maid mammy kept her long manicured 
fingernails in the movie as her own way of protesting the treatment 
of blacks in hollywood she was not she wanted the world to know a 
maid she was the first black actor ever nominated for an oscar and 
the first to ever win 
vivien leigh refused to have any embraces with gable when they 
first began shooting the movie because of a foul mouth odor caused 
by his dentures he eventually remedied the problem 
cammie king conlon who portrayed bonnie blue rhett and 
scarletts little girl couldnt stop blinking while playing dead so 
a mask of her face was made and used over her real face also it 
wasnt the actress who fell from the pony but a midget and a 
blueeyed boy played bonnie blue as an infant 
scenes of the tara plantation and the burning of atlanta were 
filmed at the backlot of laird studios in downtown culver city 
calif 
walter plunkett the movies costume designer was given a box 
of thorns by a woman in charleston sc because during the civil 
war there were no metal pins and clothing was held together by the 
thorns 
the structure which collapses in flames during the burning of 
atlanta had also been the temple of jerusalem in king of kings 
and the native village in king kong 
george cukor began as director of the movie but clark gable 
complained that he favored the female actresses sam wood and 
william cameron menzies also had directorial stints on the epic but 
it was victor fleming who ultimately got the main credit and the 
oscar for best director 
the film rights for the blockbuster were purchased for a mere 
50000 in 1936 
paulette goddard was selznicks first choice for scarlett but 
he feared her attachment to charlie chaplin would be bad publicity 
she and chaplin later married 
leslie howard only agreed to appear in the movie as the wimpy 
ashley wilkes after selznick agreed to make him associate producer 
on intermezzo ingrid bergmans first hollywood film 
the ocala fla chapter of the united daughters of the 
confederacy protested the casting of vivien leigh who was british 
as the southern heroine 
irving thalberg who directed mgm production under studio head 
louis b mayer didnt think gone with the wind stood a chance 
at the box office said he to louis b forget it louis no civil 
war picture ever made a nickel 
the movie went on to break box office records its first year by 
grossing 14 million

the people of this swampside settlement have 
shunned formal government since the days when it was a logging camp 
taking their problems and projects instead to town meetings at the 
schoolhouse 
the school has held the town together but now it appears headed 
for closure and residents fear its demise will mean the end of fargo 
just when the community is on the rebound 
the 250 or so residents are taking on the georgia department of 
education to try to keep the states smallest elementary school 
open the odds arent great but the odds have been bad before and 
fargo is still on most maps 
fargo is a cando town its the way towns used to be said 
bill oettmeier a native son 
it might take an act of congress to keep our school and 
theres not but 58 students and we know that but if we lose the 
school it wont be our fault said rosemary leviton a school 
board member 
fargo lies on the edge of the okefenokee swamp just where the 
suwanee river the suwanee river crawls out of the bog and heads 
south in no great hurry past stephen foster state park the 
songwriter who made the river famous people in fargo say 
apparently never laid eyes on it 
not that theres much to see 
georgia highway 89 barely slows down through the cluster of 
modest homes and small stores unincorporated since it was a logging 
camp at the turn of the century fargo has had little to do with 
governments residents often pass the hat when the town needs 
something and governments have returned the favor 
nothing but pine trees will grow in the sandy acid soil around 
the okefenokee where a hill is any land with no standing water 
on it in a disastrous fire 33 years ago tens of thousands of acres 
of pines burned but the trees were replanted and are becoming 
marketable now there is serious talk of a new mill of more jobs so 
more people can stay in fargo 
weve spent 33 years trying to come back and the qbe is hitting 
this little place in the head just when its trying to recover 
said oettmeier president of superior pine which leases more than 
200000 acres of pine around fargo to champion lumber co 
under georgias quality basic education law a reform package 
passed by the legislature in 1985 smaller school districts are 
being encouraged to consolidate isolated schools 
the fargo school was built in 1952 for several times the current 
enrollment but as loggers cut the trees the fire missed people 
began to dribble out of fargo clinch county operates the school 
with its six teachers and one principal on the 200000 a year it 
gets in state sparsity grants 
as things stand that will be cut in half next year and then end 
fargo the state has decided doesnt qualify for the grants though 
for some children who live in its outer reaches the round trip to 
school in homerville will mean nearly 100 miles a day on a school 
bus 
don thornhill director of facilities and transportation for the 
georgia board of education said that to qualify there must be no 
way the schools can be consolidated only a few meet that standard 
he said and consolidation is becoming common across rural georgia 
if the grant stops it will be up to clinch county to decide 
whether to consolidate or use local funds to keep the school open 
that is not really within the realm of possibilities said 
county school superintendent tommy lee this is a rural county 
that is losing jobs and losing people and for us to take over the 
cost is out of the question 
clinch county raises less than a quarter of its annual 47 
million school budget locally it would have to raise local school 
taxes by some 25 percent to handle the 200000 annual fargo costs 
lee said the concern over fargos fate is very real but the 
board of educations primary function is to educate children not 
preserve towns 
if there is no school the lumber company is going to want to 
know about it now oettmeier said theyre not going to build a 
40 million mill where nobody wants to work and live 
town leaders are lobbying state officials to try to keep the 
funding that will let the school remain open and say they have some 
support it may not be enough many in fargo realize to save a way 
of life they cherish 
at the school kids dont lock their bikes if a kid rode down 
the street on somebody elses bike the whole town would know on a 
recent afternoon dogs waited outside a classroom for their young 
owners and if one poked a nose in an open doorway that was ok in 
fargo people know whose dog is whose 
fargo residents say it is this closeness and tranquility that 
makes them want to stay raise families and pursue values that are 
endangered elsewhere even if they have to travel 28 miles to the 
nearest pharmacy and most go to valdosta 50 miles west to see a 
doctor or dentist 
for a time the nearest fire engine was in homerville so fargo 
residents raised the money themselves to refurbish an old donated 
engine they passed the hat to aircondition the school and to build 
a ballpark complete with lights homerville teams played night 
games in fargo while waiting for a government grant to get a lighted 
park of their own oettmeier notes 
danny ellis 25 who returned to his hometown to teach 
kindergarten and first grade said all the towns activities are 
centered at the school the senior citizens have their programs 
here the first aid and first response groups meet here so do the 
boy scouts and the pta 
the school hosts the community christmas program gift baskets 
are distributed from the school to the less fortunate 
it all happens from the school ellis said if the school 
closes the town will close

a month after drexel burnham lambert inc agreed 
to plead guilty to felony charges federal prosecutors have revealed 
the allegations include crooked dealings with disgraced stock 
speculator ivan f boesky and a defunct securities firm 
but the disclosure of the six specific mail and securities fraud 
counts tuesday still leaves unanswered questions 
what will be required of the investment giant to keep its plea 
bargain which includes an agreement to pay a records 650 million 
in fines and restitution 
when will drexel actually plead guilty and 
what effect will the agreement have on the fate of drexels 
embattled junk bond chief michael milken 
the charges against drexel were revealed in a court document 
known as an information which is presented to a judge or magistrate 
when a defendant agrees to waive indictment and settle a case 
without going to trial 
a lawyer for drexel entered a not guilty plea before us 
magistrate nina gershon because only a judge can take a guilty plea 
to a felony 
us attorney rudolph giuliani said drexels guilty plea would 
not come until after the settlement is approved by the justice 
department and the securities and exchange commission 
key details of the settlement spelling out drexels 
responsibilities concerning cooperation with investigators and other 
issues was kept under seal at drexels request however 
giuliani said he believed the public had a right to know details 
of the agreement and he would ask a federal judge to unseal details 
of the settlement at a closed hearing today 
i cannot answer for drexel why they want to keep it under 
seal said giuliani who added the public in general but in 
particular the investing public is entitled to the facts about the 
case 
in a statement drexel said it will not comment further 
regarding other criminal allegations that have been a part of the 
us attorneys investigation 
the government accused drexel of criminal acts ranging from 
insider trading to stock manipulation involving some recent major 
takeover targets as well as boesky and princetonnewport partners 
which liquidated after five of its top officials were indicted last 
year on racketeering charges 
in all there were four counts of securities fraud and two of 
mail fraud in the information 
there are no specific insider trading charges among the six 
counts enumerated said assistant us attorney john k carroll 
but the information does describe the course of conduct between 
drexel and the boesky organization and drexel and the 
princetonnewport organization and in connection with them the 
information does allege insider trading 
some of the charges also implicated a senior employee at drexels 
high yield and convertible bond department in beverly hills calif 
identified only as john doe 
giuliani said he was not permitted by federal rules to 
identify the individual 
people familiar with the case concluded the employee was milken 
drexels senior junk bond financier who is expected to be indicted 
shortly on fraud and racketeering charges 
giuliani declined to comment on any possible charges facing 
milken who has maintained he has done nothing wrong 
five of the charges in the criminal case mirrored accusations in 
a civil case leveled against the firm and milken in september by the 
sec which said they schemed with boesky the nowimprisoned stock 
speculator who has snitched on many prominent securities figures in 
exchange for lenient treatment 
the sixth charge involved a transaction that allegedly defrauded 
a drexel client 
drexel manipulated securities prices engaged in insider 
trading and unlawfully facilitated merger and acquisition 
activities said a statement from giulianis office 
todays filing of an information charging drexel burnham 
lambert is in accordance with the preliminary agreement reached with 
the united states attorney on dec 21 1988 said drexels 
statement we believe that this settlement is in the best 
interests of our firm its employees and clients 
the statement also said the settlement when final will 
protect drexel from further prosecution relating to the matters 
which are part of the us attorneys offices continuing 
investigation 
the charges accused drexel of mail fraud and securities fraud in 
connection with takeoverrelated transactions that included targets 
fischbach corp mca inc harris graphics corp phillips petroleum 
co and stone container corp 
the firm also was accused of fraud in connection with a 
transaction in which the government said it conspired with 
princetonnewport to cheat a drexel client comb co 
drexel is the fifthlargest wall street firm and one of the most 
profitable investment concerns in the country it is a leader in the 
175 billion market for junk bond securities often used to 
finance takeovers and the growth of small to medium sized companies 
the firm and milken were implicated in extensive wrongdoing by 
boesky after he turned states evidence in late 1986 in december 
drexel began negotiating a plea deal with giulianis office in order 
to avoid crippling charges of racketeering milken continues to 
maintain his innocence

the fallout from the oct 19 1987 stock market crash to bolster 
sales they put incentives on their vehicles a move that may have 
proven unnecessary 
the automakers didnt really realize that the underlying demand 
was there heaney said so consumers were going to buy anyway 
and then the incentives pushed them up more

the booming cellular phone industry has settled 
on a transmission standard for the future that should keep the 
airwaves from getting clogged with busy signals 
the agreement announced on tuesday sets a standard for the 
digital cellular phones that are expected to begin appearing in 
1991 a digital system can handle many more calls in the limited 
frequency band that is available because calls can be compressed 
by computers 
at a meeting in san antonio the cellular telecommunications 
industry association said its board of directors had on monday 
unanimously endorsed a decision reached last week by the 
standardsetting telecommunications industry association 
cellular phones typically used in cars are actually radio 
receivers and transmitters calls are sent to central offices where 
they plug into the regular phone network los angeles and new york 
are already running up against capacity with the current system 
in addition to providing more capacity a digital system will be 
more secure because calls will be harder to intercept initially it 
will be more expensive but costs will come down because of the 
greater efficiency of digital technology 
the standards setters agreed that digital calls would be funneled 
onto channels using a technique known as timedivision multiplexing 
the alternative standard which had been supported by motorola 
inc and american telephone amp telegraph co is known as frequency 
division multiplexing the standards setters decided that 
timedivision multiplexing had more potential for future growth 
although the decision went against them motorola and atampt said 
they were pleased with the agreement because it would allow the 
industry to move forward 
we feel that this is a very positive step said jerry wilson 
a motorola spokesman 
several other decisions on standards remain to be made but this 
was a major one 
this decision needed to be made before any other decisions 
could be made in the digital standards process lynne rose a 
spokeswoman for the cellular telecommunications industry association 
the voting members of her association are operators of cellular 
phone systems the standardsetting telecommunications industry 
association in contrast comprises both system operators and 
equipment manufacturers

the stage is set for shamrock holdings to 
wage a proxy fight for control of polaroid corp after the camera 
maker rejected shamrocks 32 billion buyout bid calling it 
indadequate 
the uninvited bid turned down tuesday was made last week when 
shamrock a television and radio concern owned by the roy e disney 
family raised its offer to 45 per share for all polaroid stock 
including 97 million shares issued under polaroids employee stock 
ownership plan 
the previous offer of 26 billion or 42 per share did not 
include the employee shares 
in a statement polaroid called the latest sweetened offer 
inadequate from a financial point of view and not in the best 
interest of polaroid and its stockholders except shamrock and its 
affiliate 
polaroids board strongly recommends that stockholders reject 
the shamrock offer and not tender any of their shares of common 
stock polaroid stated 
on tuesday polaroid stock rose 12 cents a share to 40 on the 
new york stock exchange 
tom reed a shamrock spokesman said the burbank califbased 
company would proceed with its plan to nominate a slate of 
candidates for election to polaroids board at the companys annual 
meeting may 9 
if elected shamrocks candidates would be committed to selling 
the company either under shamrocks offer or to any third party who 
made a higher bid 
shamrock president stanley p gold said he was disappointed by 
polaroids rejection of shamrocks 45 per share offer 
in a prepared statement issued from burbank gold said we 
intend to vigorously pursue our tender offer and our previously 
announced plans to wage a proxy contest for control of polaroid if 
our tender offer is not consummated prior to polaroids may annual 
meeting 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips declined comment on 
shamrocks proposed proxy challenge 
shamrock said when it extended its offer jan 19 that about 131 
million polaroid shares or 183 percent of the outstanding stock 
had been tendered and not withdrawn 
shamrocks tender offer expires march 15 and is contingent on 
obtaining at least 90 percent of polaroids 716 million outstanding 
shares 
alex henderson an analyst with prudential bache securities inc 
said polaroids management could be forced into a leveraged buyout 
to thwart shamrocks takeover attempt in a leveraged buyout a 
group usually finances its bid by borrowing heavily against the 
assets of the company being acquired 
my guess is that the next time shamrock is forced to extend its 
offer that the number of tendered shares will probably move up to 
close to 25 million he said 
henderson said 25 million tendered shares nearly 35 percent of 
the outstanding shares combined with the 69 million shamrock 
already holds could frighten polaroid executives into financing a 
leveraged buyout to avoid having sell the company to shamrock 
polaroid has been resisting shamrock since july when shamrock 
offered 40 per share in a friendly but unsolicited bid 
polaroid is incorporated in delaware and shamrock is appealing a 
delaware chancery court ruling upholding the employee stock 
ownership plan the delaware supreme court has scheduled a march 16 
hearing on the appeal 
shamrock contends the employee stock was issued to block a 
takeover if it is invalidated shamrock has promised to raise its 
offer to 336 billion or 47 per share 
the stock plan owns about 14 percent of polaroids stock it 
makes a takeover extremely difficult because under delaware law a 
hostile suitor must gain at least 85 percent of its target to 
proceed with a takeover

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan says the risk of 
inflation is great enough to keep boosting interest rates to 
restrict growth and his comments were credited with helping fuel 
rallies in stocks and bonds 
the dow jones industrial average rose 3804 points on tuesday to 
finish at 225643 closing above its preblack monday level for the 
first time since the october 1987 crash 
after closing at 224674 on oct 16 1987 the dow jones 
industrials lost an unprecedented 508 points in the black monday 
market collapse on oct 19 
testifying before the house banking committee on tuesday 
greenspan warned that strains on factory capacity and a tight labor 
market particularly in the northeast likely would keep inflation 
pressures high so the central banks monetary policy should 
continue on the tight side 
the longrun costs of a return to higher inflation and the 
risks of this occurring under current circumstances are 
sufficiently great that federal reserve policy at this juncture 
might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness 
than of stimulus he said 
greenspan told congress he wants to keep a lid on economic growth 
and continue to slowly boost interest rates to avoid higher 
inflation which was 44 percent in 1988 
the labor department meanwhile reported that wage gains of 41 
percent last year lagged behind inflation rate while employment 
costs at 5 percent rose faster than inflation 
wage and salary gains are closely watched as signals of a 
possible inflationary spiral the increase for 1988 was much closer 
to inflation than the 33 percent wage hike reported for 1987 
the labor department figures indicated that continued low 
unemployment has forced employers to compete for available workers 
often by increasing pay 
greenspan said the unemployment rate at 53 percent in december 
has hit a 14year low well within the range of what most economists 
consider to be the natural rate of unemployment leaving little room 
for further improvement without inflation 
in other economic news tuesday automakers reported that sales of 
usmade cars in midjanuary plummeted 163 percent led by 
general motors corps 219 percent decline from a relatively 
strong yearearlier period 
a year ago automakers were offering some buyer incentives amid 
continued uneasiness about the strength of the automobile market 
following the stock market crash eventually the concern about the 
market proved to be unwarranted as automakers posted the thirdbest 
model year in history in 1988

the us dollar closed higher today against the 
japanese yen and the tokyo stock exchanges leading index inched up 
to another record high 
the dollar ended at 12765 yen up 070 yen from tuesdays 12695 
yen close it opened at 12786 yen and ranged between 12737 and 
12788 yen 
the dollars higher opening followed a remark tuesday by us 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan that he would tighten 
monetary policy to fight inflation 
after buying the dollar in early trading speculative investors 
then started selling the currency for position adjustments said 
takamasa yamasaki of daiwa bank 
we already knew that the united states would tighten its 
monetary policy and keep interest rates high but greenspans 
comment still prompted the buying because japanese investors have 
been looking for marketaffecting incentives he added 
higher us interest rates tend to make the dollar more 
attractive to foreign investors 
other dealers said investors were reluctant to push the dollar 
higher for fear of another round of dollarselling intervention by 
central banks 
meanwhile the 225issue nikkei stock average closed at 
3156779 a new high just 1011 points or 003 percent higher 
than the previous record of 3155768 set on tuesday 
the indexs rally in early trading followed rising prices on 
overseas markets overnight it began falling as investors grew 
concerned about the indexs rapid increase but managed to keep the 
marginal gain said a dealer with nikko securities in tokyo 
trading became directionless as investors floated from one issue 
to another while trying to keep the index from rising too high said 
the dealer speaking on condition of anonymity 
investors are expecting the nikkei to rise continuously but 
they get cautious if prices rise too quickly the dealer said 
he predicted that the nikkei would continue upward in view of 
recent stability in foreign exchange rates and oil prices

the chicago board of trade one of two exchanges 
targeted in a federal probe of corruption in the pits issued a 
warning against rules violations to members and traders as many were 
summoned before a grand jury 
top officials at the exchange distributed a letter tuesday 
saying we will never tolerate violations of our rules and 
regulations and have always aggressively prosecuted those who have 
broken our rules 
the bot and the chicago mercantile exchange the nations 
largest commodities exchanges are at the center of an 
investigation into allegations that up to 100 brokers and traders 
cheated customers out of millions of dollars 
fbi agents posing as traders wore hidden tape recorders to 
document alleged wrongdoing in the crowded frantic trading pits 
illinois farm bureau president john white jr warned tuesday of 
serious consequences from the twoyear investigation 
these are not just chicago markets these are world markets 
and these are my markets white a kane county grain farmer said 
in a telephone news conference 
the public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchanges 
are working honestly and in an open environment 
the fbi on tuesday subpoenaed clearing firms that serve the 
exchanges while a federal grand jury was assembled to begin hearing 
testimony from traders subpoenaed last week according to defense 
attorneys 
the chicago tribune said at least 200 subpoenas were issued as 
part of operation sourmash and some of the recipients were 
david h horberg a former cohead of the mercs powerful yen 
futures committee james nowak a major soybean broker and martin 
dempsey a soybean trader who sold his bot seat last week for 
415000 
subpoenas were also delivered to continental illinois corp of 
chicago which owns capital first options inc and jp morgan amp 
co of new york the tribune said 
i hope its only a fishing expedition said john sandner 
chief executive officer of rbamph inc which also was served i 
would not want to believe theres such widespread corruption that 
would require such a widespread investigation 
us attorney anton r valukas and fbi officials declined to 
comment on the latest developments 
clearing firms which must own seats to do business are among 
the exchanges largest members they have authority to handle retail 
orders and contract out the physical trading of those orders in the 
pit to independent traders also known as locals 
a merc spokeswoman julie jacobs said exchange officials had no 
idea how many of the exchanges 81 clearing firms were subpoenaed 
chicago mercantile exchange officials were informed that many 
of the cme clearing member firms have been served with subpoenas to 
provide various records relating to trading activity on the chicago 
board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange the merc said 
the statement said the subpoenas do not imply that the firms 
or their officers are targets of the investigation or are 
suspected of any wrongful actions 
the bot and merc are marketplaces in which buyers and sellers 
essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of 
financial instruments and commodities such as treasury bills or 
soybeans 
the board of trades letter signed by karsten mahlmann chairman 
of the board at the exchange and thomas r donovan president and 
chief executive officer said 
if any members have taken part in trading practices which are 
illegal or violate our rules and regulations they are not 
representative of the 3500 members of the cbot

the national economic commission will be 
remembered as a missed opportunity in deficitreduction efforts 
because it lacks the white house commitment necessary to negotiate a 
settlement a panel member says 
i think it had the potential of being a worthwhile exercise 
but i think up to now at least a couple of the essential 
ingredients of an important role for the commission are lacking 
aflcio president lane kirkland said tuesday 
the panel has been meeting since last may and is scheduled to 
submit a report to president bush by march 1 bush decided against 
extending the deadline six months 
the prospects of a unified report i think are doubtful but i 
dont want to make any premature judgments said kirkland one of 
14 members of the panel 
missing he said was a commitment from the white house and to a 
lesser extent congressional leaders that the commissions work 
would be seriously considered and that the panel would be used as a 
forum to find a compromise among various deficitreduction proposals 
kirkland said such a commitment and a sense of urgency were 
essential to the work of a 198283 commission that studied the 
social security system kirkland also served on that panel 
those were the circumstances that i think were necessary for 
this committee to serve its purpose he said they may yet 
evolve i dont write off that possibility but as yet its not 
visible 
asked who was to blame kirkland said 
i would suppose if you want to lay it at the door of any one 
factor it is the constraints that have been expressed by the 
president both before his election and since as to the options 
that were available to deal with the problem he seems 
preferenced to advance his own programs his commitment to the 
socalled flexible freeze 
kirkland during a meeting with reporters at his office said 
congressional leaders also have not given the commission the stature 
it needs to convince the various interest groups involved in 
deficitreduction efforts to make concessions 
absent that you see members of the commission certainly like 
myself find no real reason to yield on any of our positions he 
said if there were serious negotiations with the major players 
and the ultimate package or the ultimate shape of the resolution 
were otherwise acceptable as a citizen and as a patriot and as one 
concerned with resolving it id be disposed to go along with some 
things that might otherwise prove distasteful

trader vics that citadel of ersatz polynesian 
cuisine whose defenders include former president richard nixon has 
gotten tacky and has no place in the plaza hotel plaza owner 
donald trump says 
trump who recently bought the plaza wants to revamp the hotel 
into a fivestar institution and says the restaurant with its 
thatched roofs and dugout canoes does not fit in with the image 
of the hotel i want to achieve 
so instead of a polynesianstyle bar where customers could order 
a samoan fog cutter or a dr funk of tahiti therell be a health 
club and a restaurant serving japanese and chinese food 
but perhaps to console patrons who feel theyve been forsaken 
therell be a bar run by trump that will serve tropical drinks 
thats small consolation to such loyal patrons as nixon who 
dined there while president in 1972 
my entire family will be very sorry to see it close nixon 
said tuesday through a spokesman it was always our daughters 
favorite restaurant and it quickly became mine too 
trump who bought the plaza last year for 390 million said 
construction on the oriental restaurant and the health club will 
start in about three or four months 
the restaurant section of trader vics which has been in the 
plaza basement for 25 years has been closed for more than year but 
the bar has remained open 
clint wade a trader vics spokesman said the company wants to 
run the new oriental restaurant at the hotel but noted that trump 
has no intention of keeping trader vics at the plaza 
the trumps want to get a new looking restaurant and that is 
also what we want wade said sure trader vics has gotten 
tacky but thats because nothing has been done to it in 12 years 
trader vics which began in san francisco still has more than 
20 restaurants across the united states and in west germany japan 
and canada wade said

mccaw cellular communications inc of 
kirkland and american telephone amp telegraph co have signed an 
agreement that gives mccaw the federal governments 
cellulartelephone business 
the immediate impact of the atamptmccaw subcontracting agreement 
is likely to be small in financial terms at first but could mean 
big business if the federal government expands its use of cellular 
phones 
mccaw already is the nations largest provider of cellular 
service 
the agreement comes under a contract awarded by the general 
services administration last month to atampt for 60 percent of the 
contract for the governments multibilliondollar fts2000 network 
the new network will replace a 24yearold federal 
telecommunications system 
including cellular services in atampts package would give the 
government an excellent new wirefree communications technology 
said loren kragh a mccaw vice president for the first time 
government personnel away from the office on field assignments or 
responding to emergencies will have continuous access to the 
government phone system 
if the government decides to make extensive use of cellular 
telephones it could be a great deal for mccaw said tom 
friedberg an analyst for piper jaffray amp hopwood inc in seattle 
mccaw which has been aggressively buying cellular franchises in 
major cities already serves areas with populations totaling about 
48 million people in 25 states 
last week mccaw announced it will sell 22 percent of its stock 
to british telecom britains largest telecommunications company 
for 15 billion

the president of the illinois farm 
bureau citing wavering confidence in the chicago commodity markets 
is urging a speedy conclusion to an fbi probe of alleged fraud at 
the citys two futures exchanges 
john white jr warned of serious consequences from a prolonged 
probe of allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the 
chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange defrauded 
customers of millions of dollars 
these are not just chicago markets these are world markets 
and these are my markets white a kane county grain farmer said 
tuesday in a telephone news conference 
the public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchanges 
are working honestly and in an open environment he said 
some grain and livestock farmers use the futures markets to 
guarantee prices for the crops and herds they are raising by 
entering into contracts for future delivery of their products at a 
specified price futures prices also influence cash prices for the 
commodities 
white said confidence in the integrity of the futures industry 
was crucial to farmers participation in the markets farmers also 
must have trust in the independent traders who create liquidity in 
the market by accepting producers risks in hope of making a profit 
that confidence has been diminished by the current probe 
white said our analysts feel that liquidity has already been 
diminished 
he said it was too early to know whether the growing scandal had 
set back the efforts of some farm leaders to encourage farmers to 
use the futures markets 
if the investigation uncovers a major violation its a major 
setback he said if it turns out to be nitpicking i think 
it would be a shortterm thing that can be overcome

prime minister noboru takeshita today rejected 
opposition calls for him to quit after a third member of his cabinet 
resigned over links to a company at the center of a stocktrading 
scandal 
also today the labor ministry announced the resignations of its 
two top bureaucrats who also have been linked to the company 
takeshita scheduled to travel to washington in a week for a 
meeting with president bush was hit tuesday with the resignation of 
ken harada from the cabinet post of director general of the economic 
planning agency 
harada 69 had been appointed dec 27 when takeshita brought 15 
new faces into his scandalplagued administration in an effort to 
erase the taint of money links to the recruit co an 
informationbased conglomerate 
but takeshitas justice minister takashi hasegawa resigned 
after only three days and now harada has quit in the case of both 
men news reports had revealed that they continued to take political 
donations from recruit months after the scandal became frontpage 
news last summer 
in december kiichi miyazawa resigned as finance minister after 
having repeatedly changed his story on how an aide used his name to 
buy shares in the recruit subsidiary 
the largest opposition party the japan socialist party ended 
its threeday convention today with a resolution to try to force 
takeshitas liberal democratic party to hold new elections 
asked about opposition calls for him to resign and call early 
elections takeshita told japanese reporters thats a matter for 
me to judge 
he said he was resolved to cope with an expected difficult 
legislature when the diet or parliament convenes next month to 
debate the governments proposed budget of 47195 billion 
scandal has dogged the governing liberal democratic party since 
an everwidening web of dubious money links began to emerge between 
recruit co and prominent people in politics business and the news 
media 
the company had offered prelisted shares in a realestate 
subsidiary to the prominent people at bargain prices and they 
profited handsomely by selling after the shares went on the market 
in october 1986 
at least 16 top politicians including some in opposition 
parties acknowledged that they or their aides benefited in such 
deals 
the transactions were not illegal under japanese securities law 
but they raised suspicions of bribery and influencepeddling and 
focused public attention on the close links between business and 
politics

loss of 144 million compared with a profit of 213 million or 44 
cents a share a year earlier revenue jumped 61 percent to 431 
million from 267 million a year earlier because of the feb 5

japanese automakers built a record 127 million 
cars trucks and buses in 1988 up 37 percent from the previous 
year the japan automobile manufacturers association announced 
wednesday 
the previous record 123 million vehicles was set in 1985 
annual output declined since then due to the yens sharp rise 
against the us dollar making japanese cars more expensive in the 
united states a soft american market also contributed to the 
decline 
export figures for 1988 due for release next week will show a 
total of about 6 million vehicles meaning a decline of 32 percent 
from 1987 said the report 
the association attributed the recordhigh 1988 production to 
brisk domestic sales which shot up 11 percent to a record 67 
million vehicles the strong domestic demand was a result of japans 
steady economic growth and vigorous personal spending it said 
toyota motor corp last year again produced the largest number of 
vehicles among 11 japanese makers nearly 4 million up 91 percent 
from 1987 nissan motor co was second at nearly 22 million down 
28 percent 
total passenger car production last year increased 39 percent to 
a record 82 million while 44 million trucks up 32 percent and 
57000 buses up 149 percent were built it said

edits throughout to delete outdated material further background on 
pepsi ad campaigns tighten 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aging and expanding baby boomers are turning 
more often to lowcalorie drinks and cocacola co is bidding for 
their taste buds by pitting its chief diet soda against rival 
pepsicolas flagship sugared brand 
the marketing move is the first time a major cola company has 
aimed a diet drink directly at a leading nondiet competitor and 
has sparked an escalation of the war for dominance of the giant soft 
drink market 
pepsicola co today announced that it had signed a worldwide 
sponsorship and advertising deal with pop star madonna that will 
include a major global ad campaign beginning next month and pepsi 
sponsorship of the singers upcoming world tour 
the diet segment is a big growing segment and as people get 
older they tend more towards diet said emanuel goldman a 
beverage industry analyst with the investment firm painewebber in 
san francisco 
jesse meyers publisher of industry newsletter beverage digest 
said the diet cola market grew 84 percent and sugared cola volume 
rose 32 percent last year he said diet drinks account for 252 
percent of the 26 billion wholesale market 
i believe that in the early 2010s the diet market will be the 
tail wagging the softdrink dog meyers said 
goldman estimated it will take a generation before diet colas 
outsell sugar colas 
coke and pepsi recognized the trend last year producing 
commercials featuring prize fighters and football players that moved 
away from past diet drink strategies targeting women 
cokes battle plan for diet coke was the first major marketing 
excursion since ira herbert was named president of the companys 
domestic operations last year 
diet coke moving ahead of pepsi is the next logical step in the 
longterm trend herbert said in a statement announcing the 
campaign 
cocacola whose cocacola classic is the nations topselling 
brand announced its latest goal in the aftermath of a highly 
visible advertising blitz during sundays super bowl telecast 
the package included a ballyhooed threedimensional spot for diet 
coke and another new commercial featuring celebrities that included 
actor and former pepsi pitchman don johnson a star of the 
television show miami vice 
pepsi contends cokes claims ignore consumer propensity to buy by 
price and not brand and the no 2 colamaker had been expected to 
mount its own counteroffensive 
in addition to the madonna signing pepsi won sponsorship of the 
nfl player talent show that aired before the super bowl 
the company in recent years has boosted its brands through 
celebrity ads featuring michael jackson david bowie tina turner 
and lionel richie 
atlantabased coke gave no timetable for its goal of boosting 
diet coke past pepsi 
were not saying this is going to happen overnight or within 
the next year or two granted its going to take some time said 
coke usa spokesman ron coleman 
coke also claims that almost 2 million families stopped buying 
regular pepsi last year and coleman said more than a quarter of 
them turned to diet coke 
but pepsis mckenzie countered that half of all soft drink 
consumers identify themselves as brandswitchers meaning just 
as many people switched from coke as from pepsi 
goldman backed up mckenzie saying people dont just drink one 
soft drink people do mess around 
besides the new television commercials coke said its campaign 
will include 200 million national magazine and newspaper coupons and 
local sweepstakes offering airline tickets and other prizes 
whether cokes plan succeeds is almost irrelevant meyers said 
i believe that coke believes that statistical reality is not as 
important as the perception of pitting the number three brand 
against the number two brand because it finesses the number one 
position for coke classic he said 
according to meyers cocacola classic topped all brands last 
year with 201 percent of domestic sales pepsi was second with 187 
percent followed by diet coke at 82 percent and diet pepsi at 52 
percent 
diet coke was the fastest growing brand gaining 05 percent of a 
share compared with a year ago caffeinefree diet coke added 03 
percent to reach 2 percent overall good for ninth place 
together diet coke and caffeinefree diet coke accounted for 
102 percent of the market meyers said pepsi and caffeinefree 
pepsi had 195 percent while diet pepsi and caffeinefree diet 
pepsi were at 66 percent he said

president bushs nominee for transportation 
secretary told congress today that the united states can and will 
take a leading role in combating terrorism in the skies 
samuel k skinner testifying at his confirmation hearing before 
the senate commerce committee said stopping terrorism means 
meeting headon the gruesome threat with all the resources we 
can muster 
in written responses to questions posed by the panel skinner 
said that foreign airlines serving the united states should be 
forced to meet the same security requirements as us carriers 
he said that if the government issues new security requirements 
for american carriers a means must be employed to assure that 
foreign air carriers that offer service to the united states should 
be required to make the same improvements 
the 50yearold illinois transportation administrator was also 
likely to face questions about air safety the aging us aircraft 
fleet and its recent rash of mechanical problems other likely 
topics were proposals to remove the faa from the transportation 
department in an effort to improve its efficiency drug testing for 
transportation workers and truck and bus safety 
skinner was also expected to be asked to contrast bushs views on 
federal transportation spending with those of former president 
reagan who often sought to phase out us assistance in such areas 
as mass transit and amtrak the passenger railroad 
as the hearing began sen howard metzenbaum dohio withdrew 
objections to skinners appointment that he had expressed over 
skinners conduct when as us attorney in chicago he declined to 
prosecute gd searle co there had been allegations that it 
fraudulently tested nutrasweet the artificial sweetener skinner 
later joined the law firm that represented searle in the case 
last month metzenbaum called for a delay in skinners 
confirmation vote until questions about the situation were answered 
skinner said he conducted himself in accordance with department of 
justice guidelines in the case 
skinner told the senators that before leaving the us attorneys 
office he had ended his involvement in the searle case and that the 
decision to not prosecute the firm was made by others metzenbaum 
said that based on skinners explanation he believes the appointee 
to be a man of integrity and said he now expected to vote to 
confirm skinner 
in his written responses skinner said that making the security 
requirements uniform would prevent us airlines from losing 
business because of cumbersome security procedures which might 
inconvenience passengers 
last year before the dec 21 explosion that destroyed pan 
american flight 103 over scotland the federal aviation 
administration proposed rules that would require foreign airlines 
serving the united states to have security procedures approved by 
the faa the rule has not yet taken effect however 
domestic carriers are already required to have faaapproved 
security programs 
eight days after the pan am disaster which killed all 259 people 
on board and 11 others on the ground the faa toughened the security 
steps it requires us airlines to follow at airports in europe and 
the middle east 
despite metzenbaums objections the sentiment on capitol hill 
was that skinner would have little trouble gaining senate approval 
for his new job 
skinner was bushs campaign chairman in illinois in 1980 and 
1988 when bush carried the state he has been chairman of the 
regional transportation authority of northeastern illinois the 
countrys second largest transportation system since 1984 
he is also an instrumentrated pilot and a member of the aircraft 
owners and pilots association which lobbies congress on behalf of 
private plane owners and pilots

futures prices of grains and soybeans were lower

wheat futures were weighed down by the rainy weather forecast for 
the great plains growing areas and a slackening of us wheat 
exports said dale gustafson a grains analyst with drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
soybean prices pulled back because european markets didnt follow

a government investigator in 1983 concluded that 
drexel burnham lambert incs michael milken and others were 
involved in securities fraud but the case was dropped about four 
years before similar charges were brought against the investment 
firm according to a report published wednesday 
a securities and exchange commission lawyer spent two years 
investigating drexel and told superiors he had evidence of a 
fraudulent scheme to disguise ownership of stocks and manipulate 
stock prices the wall street journal reported 
in a 33page confidential memo sec attorney john hewitt charged 
that milken drexels highyield junk bond financier had 
manipulated the price of shares of reliance group inc an insurance 
holding company run by takeover strategist saul steinberg the 
newspaper said 
the journal did not disclose where the october 1983 memo was 
obtained but the secs chief enforcement officer gary lynch said 
the newspaper received the material from an unidentified 
congressional committee 
the newspaper also reported that between 1980 and 1985 four sec 
investigations implicated drexel and milken but all were closed 
without action 
the sec investigation was said to focus on trading in the stock 
of reliance and leasco corp another steinberg company before and 
after a july 1981 announcement that the companies would be merged 
and taken private in 1982 
the journal said hewitt wrote that securities were warehoused 
and manipulated in a complex scheme to facilitate the transaction 
warehousing involves placing stocks in accounts that disguise 
ownership 
but the probe was dropped in march 1984 because of lack of 
evidence the journal said 
the sec last september filed civil charges against drexel and 
milken accusing them of scheming with nowimprisoned inside trader 
ivan boesky to commit securities fraud 
on tuesday the government made public the six specific fraud 
counts that drexel has agreed to plead guilty to as part of a record 
650 million settlement that concluded a twoyear inquiry by the 
us attorneys office 
the government accused drexel with participating in a litany of 
criminal acts ranging from insider trading to stock manipulation 
involving some of the biggest us takeover targets of the 1980s 
in the 1983 hewitt memo the journal account said the sec 
investigator said that from 1979 through at least 1983 milken ran 
a trading scheme to warehouse and manipulate securities for 
the benefit of certain highyield department clients 
hewitt also said two investment partnerships including milken and 
his brother lowell also appeared to have violated federal 
disclosure laws the journal account said 
a spokesman for milken denied any wrongdoing in the 1983 
allegations drexel said in a statement that these were thorough 
investigations and to assume otherwise isnt wellfounded 
but the point is that having already reached an agreement with 
the us attorney we now are in goodfaith negotiations with the 
sec to establish enhanced procedures that will prevent even the 
appearance of these kinds of issues in the future it said 
the journal said the investigation of milken and drexel began 
when reliance was cited as one of eight stocks the sec examined 
after spotting unusual price increases on new years eve 1981 
lynch told the newspaper i think you ought to put high up in 
your story that you were provided with nonpublic documents by a 
committee of congress because thats how washington works i 
think it stinks 
he did not identify the committee but rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee which 
monitors the sec was quoted by the newspaper as saying of the 1983 
probe the sec didnt use the tools congress gave it to protect 
investors in this instance

a federal inspection of safety at a nuclear 
weapons plant near denver found serious lapses caused in part by 
inadequate worker training but significant improvements are under 
way energy department officials said 
the outlines of a report on the inspection conducted by a team 
of 20 safety experts last november and december were presented 
tuesday to members of a committee advising the government on how to 
correct technical and managerial problems at its nuclear weapons 
complex which has been crippled in recent months 
the full report was not disclosed 
a key finding by the inspectors was insufficient training of 
workers at the rocky flats plutonium processing facility this was 
in part due to a practice by the plant operator rockwell 
international corp of letting workers switch to job assignments 
outside their area of expertise officials said 
oliver lynch a department safety official cited an instance of 
workers in a lowlevel waste evaporator building reading the 
newspaper instead of monitoring safety indicators 
this struck home the need for a greater department of energy 
presence in the facility said richard w starostecki deputy 
assistant secretary of energy for safety health and quality 
assurance 
he and other department officials stressed however that 
rockwell managers had shown a much greater willingness to improve 
safety procedures at the plant which reprocesses plutonium from old 
nuclear weapons for use in new ones he said this change in 
rockwells attitude had emerged over the past year 
rockwell has made a noteworthy first step toward meeting 
energy department concerns he said by developing a comprehensive 
longterm strategy for safety improvements 
the plant situated about 16 miles from denver was shut down by 
federal authorities last october after an incident in which three 
employees were accidentally exposed to plutonium particles 
starostecki also reaffirmed to the advisory panel that a phased 
and closely monitored restarting of the rocky flats plant had begun 
last week he said the plant could be in full operation as early as 
late march 
at the same briefing to the advisory panel starostecki said more 
study will be needed to determine the severity of numerous cracks in 
the cooling systems of a south carolina reactor complex that 
produces key ingredients for nuclear weapons 
the savannah river plant near aiken sc is the nations only 
source of tritium a perishable and increasingly scarce gas vital to 
making nuclear warheads 
the threereactor complex has not been producing tritium since 
last april when the energy department shut down the last active 
reactor for safety reasons 
starostecki said an accident sunday during testing at the 
savannah river plant indicates a lack of control over whats going 
on in the reactors 
federal officials said there was no leakage of radiation or other 
hazardous material from the incident the operator ei du pont de 
nemours amp co estimated damage at 20000 
du pont disclosed earlier this month that it had discovered and 
was monitoring 27 cooling system cracks including 15 in the k 
reactor which it hopes to restart by the end of this year 
john ahearne chairman of the energy departments advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety said starostecki told his 
panel the cracking problem was probably not as serious as has been 
suggested but its still an open question 
if the cracked pipes need to be replaced the work could cause 
further delays in restarting the reactors

a bipartisan group of 12 senators unveiled 
legislation today that would reject a proposed 50 percent 
congressional pay raise and roll back the increase if the house 
lets it become law 
the rollback proposal is designed to give senate payraise 
opponents a better weapon than a simple resolution to turn down the 
increase it could keep the issue alive even if the raise goes into 
effect 
senators are expected to overwhelmingly reject the pay raise 
while at the same time knowing that a house vote appears unlikely 
unless both chambers reject the pay plan recommended by former 
president reagan the raise would become law automatically on feb 8 
reagan following the advice of a commission recommended that 
congressional salaries rise from 89500 to 135000 for 
rankandfile lawmakers 
the recommendation would allow the house speaker to receive 
175000 instead of 115000 and would pay 155000 to the 
president pro tempore of the senate and the majority and minority 
leaders of each house all of whom now earn 99500 
reagan also recommended 50 percent increases for top political 
appointees in the executive branch and for judges 
sen larry pressler rsd a main sponsor of the new 
legislation said the rollback was the key provision if the senate 
approves the legislation and sends it to the house house opponents 
of the raise could keep trying to tack it on to other bills after 
feb 8 
the legislation also would require a vote on all future pay 
raises 
senate sponsors accused the house leadership of trying to duck a 
vote speaker jim wright dtexas has been noncommittal while 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has promised a 
senate vote 
its ridiculous not to have a vote on the pay raise sen 
charles e grassley riowa told reporters not only is the 
amount outlandish but it sets a pretty bad example the public 
hates the pay increase and the way its approved 
any rollback also would affect 50 percent raises for top 
executive branch officials which also were part of reagans 
recommendation raises for judges were in reagans package also but 
cannot constitutionally be cut back once they take effect 
the senate sponsors of the legislation are sens pressler 
grassley harry reid dnev jesse helms rnc john mccain 
rariz dennis deconcini dariz paul simon dill gordon 
humphrey rnh david boren dokla quentin burdick dnd 
strom thurmond rsc and howell heflin rala 
on tuesday 35 house members wrote wright to demand a vote out 
of respect for the american taxpayer 
the letter written by rep robert c smith rnh was signed 
by 30 republicans and five democrats wright had no comment 
the prospect of an increase in congressional salaries has 
prompted a broad range of comments but there is one theme that is 
constant the letter said the american people are firm in their 
conviction that regardless of the legislative form there must be a 
vote on this enormous pay raise 
the letter said that avoiding this issue is not the answer

president bush said today his administration is 
considering imposing a fee on customers of savings and loan 
institutions to help the federal government pay to insure the 
troubled sampl industry 
a treasury department spokesman said accounts in commercial banks 
and credit unions also would be subject to the fees 
treasury secretary nicholas brady appearing on television 
interview programs said plans under review include such fees as 25 
cents for every 100 in deposits at a thrift and that the premiums 
would be used by the federal government to insure the deposits 
at the white house bush said thats one option adding that 
the idea had not been presented as a formal recommendation and so 
im not going to say what im going to do but that is one option 
he said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
what youre looking at today is a trial balloon that was leaked 
to see what the reaction would be there will be other trial 
balloons 
we think it has merit fitzwater said lets see how people 
react he said the idea was first proposed as part of former 
president reagans budget but didnt draw much attention 
white house chief of staff john sununu spoke warmly about the 
proposal but insisted that it was one of many alternatives still 
being studied he insisted it would be a premium and not a tax 
that would violated bushs nonewtaxes pledge 
thats just like any other insurance premium revenue 
generation for services rendered brady said on abcs good 
morning america the important thing here is that the federal 
insurance on deposits is going to be continued 
brady said administration officials have taken the plan to the 
chairmen of the congressional banking committees sen donald 
riegle dmich and rep henry gonzalez dtexas 
they know how big this program is he said theyre giving 
us plenty of of time to look at the options theyve been 
receptive 
arthur siddon a spokesman for brady said the treasury 
department has not clearly defined the option he said the fee 
mentioned by brady could be imposed on depositors or it could be 
paid by the institutions as an increase in the insurance premium 
they already pay 
the fee or premium would apply to all federally insured 
financial institutions banks sampls and credit unions he said 
previously siddon said the fee might apply only to sampls 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures deposits in commercial banks told the 
washington post that the proposal was the reverse toaster theory 
instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit 
you give them one 
brady emphasized the plan has not been adopted by the 
administration he said it hasnt even been presented to president 
bush and rejected suggestions that it would represent a tax 
increase for sampl customers 
what were doing is to examine all manner of options to pay for 
this savings and loan problem we have its a big problem so were 
discussing all kinds of things insurance based premiums various 
different kind of options like that he said on nbcs today 
program 
the post quoting unnamed sources said the fee could raise 9 
billion a year which would cover interest payments on the 20 
billion to 30 billion the government will have to raise for several 
years to close sampls and pay off depositors 
another proposal under which taxpayers would foot the bill for 
closing insolvent institutions is being offered by the savings and 
loan industrys largest trade group the proposal released tuesday 
by the us league of savings institutions would also cut the fee 
that thrifts pay for deposit insurance 
the proposal would give the treasury responsibility for paying to 
resolve the cases of more than 350 insolvent but still open sampls 
bush in a meeting tuesday with congressional leaders said he 
would propose substantial revisions next month to ronald reagans 
budget including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis 
the league proposal called for tougher regulation but said sampls 
should be preserved as an industry separate from commercial banking 
the recommendation which the group plans to present at a 
congressional hearing thursday drew immediate criticism from 
members of the house banking committee 
its called how to transfer the problems of the sampl industry 
to the taxpayers said rep stan parris rva a member of the 
house banking committee 
parris said the healthy portion of the sampl industry shouldnt be 
bled dry but he said the lobby group is just trying to put a 
sugar coating on a pretty bitter pill 
rep jim leach riowa said the league proposal represents a 
realistic recognition that tougher regulation is in order but an 
unrealistic expectation that the taxpayers should be stuck with the 
bill 
the more money the taxpayers are asked to eat the tougher the 
reform package should be said rep charles schumer dny 
the us league plan calls for the creation of a resolution 
corporation a new independent federal agency that would be 
responsible for liquidating or selling currently insolvent sampls as 
well as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next 
three years 
it also would take over all of the obligations the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp has acquired in rescuing 
institutions in the past 
the resolution corporation would raise money by issuing notes 
which would be guaranteed by the treasury any money the corporation 
gets from selling failed sampls to new investors or from selling the 
assets would go toward paying off the notes however the treasury 
would have to pay most of the bill 
in the meantime a new industryfunded fslic would be created to 
insure the deposits of healthy sampls which would pay an insurance 
premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to 
their fund the federal deposit insurance corp

the securities and exchange commission is 
looking at the possibility of making managers of companies involved 
in leveraged buyouts or takeover attempts disclose more information 
about their own fate in the transactions sec chairman david ruder 
said today 
ruder told the senate finance committee that managers involved in 
some recent takeovers have avoided sec regulations requiring them to 
disclose their own interest in the surviving company in thirdparty 
takeovers because they are not a direct participant 
they may have an implied promise by the takeover or financial 
people that technically falls outside the transaction ruder said 
technically our rules now dont require them to disclose that 
he said those assurances to managers usually take the form of 
we will not promise you equity participation in the new company 
but in our 45 previous transactions we always have 
ruder said the commission is now looking at revising its 
regulations on management disclosures to require them in all 
negotiated transactions but he said that no new legislation is 
needed to do it 
we have sufficiently broad rulemaking powers he said 
ruder was the second witness in two days of hearings by the 
finance committee into the mushrooming of junkbondfinanced 
leveraged buyout attempts some of them launched by managers of 
exisiting companies in the past year 
after rjr nabiscos managers tried to buy up all the publicly 
owned stock last november in a leveraged buyout only to be outbid 
with a 30 percent higher 25 billion offer from kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co there have been concerns about whether managements in 
such takeovers are acting in the best interests of stock and bond 
holders 
ruder said that as long as there is an auction process 
shareholders ususally end up maximizing their gain but he expressed 
concern they may not be getting the maximum value in deals where a 
companys publicly held stock is purchased in buybacks without an 
effective bidding process 
testifying tuesday before the same committee treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady estimated the cost of leveraged buyouts or lbos 
and takeover defenses at 60 billion in 1988 alone 
while many restructured companies find themselves in trouble 
because they cannot make the interest payments on their new debt 
the investment banks arbitrageurs underwriters and lbo managers 
involved in the deals collect hundreds of millions of dollars in 
upfront fees he complained 
sadly these same parties may have relatively little if any 
investment in the longterm success of the new enterprise he 
said given this arrangement it may very well be that the net 
effect of lbos is a financial snipe hunt where the new longterm 
investors flashlight in hand are left holding the bag 
bradys testimony on the wave of leveraged buyouts was the 
strongest indication yet that the new administration wants the trend 
reversed 
the treasury secretary said he would prefer that the gladiators 
in the arena the investment bankers corporate and insurance 
executives and pension fund managers who trade in highinterest 
highrisk junk bonds address the problem on their own but he 
coupled that with a warning 
it is the finest tradition of our democratic system that 
government look first to the people themselves for solutions and 
only act but do act when it is clear the people cannot solve the 
problem themselves he said 
however how far the government should go in restraining buyouts 
is wide open to debate 
the most widely discussed option is not allowing companies to 
deduct as an expense the high rates of interest they pay on junk 
bonds a move that both brady and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan attempted to discourage tuesday while acknowledging it may 
happen anyway 
greenspan told the house banking committee on tuesday that 
attempting to tax the interest on junk bonds would probably be 
ineffective because corporate lawyers would find some other way of 
taxfree debt financing 
brady agreed the long history of attempts to define problems 
out of existence has proved that the definees are more adept then 
the definers he said just as soon as the new regulations are 
written efforts are under way to render them irrelevant 
like greenspan brady said he would prefer that congress reduce 
the tax on dividends to encourage more equity financing of 
corporations but both men acknowledged that is unlikely because of 
the budget deficit 
when the reagan administration in 1985 proposed giving companies 
a tax credit for the dividends they pay the annual cost to the 
treasury in lost tax dollars was put at 7 billion

texas eastern corp officials said today they have 
begun scheduling appointments with possible buyers and denied that 
their claims of more than 50 suitors are meant to stall a coastal 
corp takeover attempt by boosting stock prices 
the process is well under way said texas eastern spokesman 
fred wichlep we have set up data rooms here in our building and 
have already started making appointments with representatives of 
other companies to come in and review our data and to hear 
presentations by officers of the company 
trading in texas eastern stock was suspended briefly tuesday on 
the new york stock exchange after a company lawyer told us 
district judge lynn n hughes that the naturalgas company might use 
a white knight to block coastals 26 billion takeover bid 
texas eastern attorney ewing werlein told hughes that the company 
has a list of more than 50 possible buyers 
officials of coastal another houstonbased naturalgas company 
later suggested that the comment was designed to inflate texas 
eastern stock prices to make coastals offer appear inadequate 
texas eastern officials said the number is legitimate and was 
provided only to inform hughes of their actions but they 
acknowledged they are trying to maximize their stock price 
this is a bona fide effort in our ongoing process to determine 
the maximum value of texas eastern stock wichlep said this 
morning 
texas eastern stock closed at 4825 tuesday down from its 
record 4850 close monday trading was suspended at 1120 am 
because of an imbalance of shares on the buy side but resumed at 
1209 pm 
coastal has offered 42 per share for all outstanding texas 
eastern shares the company already owns 4 percent to 5 percent of 
texas easterns stock 
during the threehour hearing hughes denied a texas eastern 
request to delay a feb 7 hearing in a coastal lawsuit designed to 
prevent texas eastern from using its poison pill plan and other 
antitakeover measures 
it was a major victory james r paul coastals president 
and chief operating officer said today in a statement texas 
easterns effort at delay is nothing more than a stall designed to 
deny their stockholders the right to ultimately determine the 
disposition of their stock 
paul said his company has asked texas eastern for information 
that would justify a higher bid but said the only response has been 
rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last sunday 
the meeting between executives of the two companies was the only 
facetoface contact since coastal announced its takeover bid jan

president bush said today that while hes 
determined to be an environmentalist he favors prudent 
development by oil companies in the arctic wildlife refuge 
commenting on an issue environmentalists say will be a litmus 
test of his intentions bush said he believes we can find the 
balance between environmental interests and national security 
interests to permit some development of oil and gas resources in 
the refuge 
environmentalists have been trying to enlist bushs support to 
keep oil companies out of the vast refuge 
for years there has been a fierce debate in congress and between 
environmentalists and the oil companies over whether a 
15millionacre coastal strip of the arctic national wildlife 
refuge in northeastern alaska should be opened for oil drilling 
in the final days of the reagan administration interior 
secretary donald hodel formally urged congress to clear the way for 
oil and gas development in the refuge and proposed a land swap deal 
as the best way to do it 
a dozen of the leading environmental and conservation groups 
including some of the movements biggest names urged bush in a 
letter tuesday to review interiors position with an eye toward 
reversing the departments recommendation to congress 
we have strenuously opposed this proposal as a shortsighted 
sacrifice of a national treasure for a few months of energy that is 
readily procurable elsewhere the groups said 
but in an oval office interview with a small group of reporters 
today bush said that brought to mind similar arguments made about 
the alaska oil pipeline 
i remember the pipeline i remember the arguments against it 
he said and i also know the effect it did not have on the 
caribou 
bush has said his administration intends to be a strong defender 
of the environment but also has indicated in the past that he 
favors expanded oil drilling in the arctic 
im in favor of prudent development there he said today 
i think im determined to be an environmentalist i am one and 
im concerned that we not do irreparable damage to the environment 
but bush also said that we have some national security 
interests at stake here in terms of making the country less 
reliant on imported energy supplies 
congress must approve opening up any of the 19millionacre 
wildlife refuge in northeastern alaska for drilling and it didnt 
take long for the issue to surface this year 
on the first day of the 101st congress legislation was 
introduced with 38 cosponsors in the house to declare the 
15millionacre coastal strip of the arctic wildlife refuge a 
protected wilderness on the same day other legislation also was 
introduced in the house to open the same land for oil and gas 
development 
the oil industry would like to move this fast and create a 
sense of national emergency before environmental groups can 
mobilize suggested george frampton jr president of the wilderness 
society 
hodels action last week at the end of his tenure as interior 
secretary infuriated the environmental movement which has vowed to 
fight any attack on the refuge home for the porcupine caribou 
polar bears and millions of birds 
michael fischer executive director of the sierra club called on 
bush to intervene in the rush to trample the arctic and said the 
presidents actions on arctic development will be the test of this 
administration on whether it is serious about protecting the 
environment 
earlier in the week many of the environmental leaders met with 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine to voice their 
concern about the wildlife refuge 
frampton questioned the need to open the arctic region now for 
drilling when there is no need for the additional petroleum in 
future years he suggested technology might be developed to protect 
the environment better 
we can postpone the decision and have it both ways wilderness 
and oil he said 
other groups that signed the letter to bush were the national 
wildlife federation the izaak walton league of america the natural 
resources defense council national audubon society national parks 
and conservation association friends of the earth environmental 
policy institute defenders of wildlife and the environmental policy 
institute

there is an hour wait on weekends for a table at 
the 140seat restaurant of the great lakes brewing co as patrons 
jam the bar to guzzle europeanstyle beer brewed on the premises 
were brewing around the clock and selling it as fast as we 
make it said daniel conway 27 who owns the bar with his brother 
patrick 
the brothers restored clevelands first tavern last september and 
started brewing beer part of a growing nationwide brewing trend as 
local brewers apply their craft in brewpubs and 
microbreweries offering a variety of beers to local clientele 
great lakes patrons can choose from three different brews at 
220 a glass with names such as eliots amber named for eliot 
ness who frequented the bar and ran for mayor of cleveland before 
gaining fame as a lawman said daniel conway 
brewer thaine johnson who worked for clevelands former 
christian schmidt brewing co was persuaded to come out of 
retirement and apply his skills on a smaller scale 
great lakes can brew 750 to 1000 31gallon barrels of beer a 
year a typical amount for brewpubs which offer beer for onpremise 
consumption 
microbreweries brew and bottle beer for regional consumption 
though the city of angels brewing co santa monica calif which 
operates a 250seat restaurant in a revamped furniture store hopes 
to offer their ale both ways 
we are hoping to offer people small plastic resealable kegs so 
people can take it home said bar manager jim lucitt adding the 
brewpub has attracted a number of celebrities since it opened a year 
ago 
michael keaton stops in every now and then wilt chamberlain 
was in the other night and magic johnson stops by lucitt said 
at the start of 1986 there were only 29 microbreweries 
breweries which produce less than 15000 barrels a year and 
brewpubs in north america according to the association of brewers 
boulder colo 
since then the number has doubled each year at the start of 
1989 there were 120 brewpubs and microbreweries operating in north 
america said charlie papazian who founded the association in 1978 
and edits the associations magazine titled zymurgy the branch of 
chemistry dealing with fermentation 
at the rooster court bar and grill in northampton mass patrons 
can try a brown ale named old brown dog or in the summer a light 
wheat beer said peter egelston a coowner of the brewpub 
the novelty of the beer is enough to bring people in the first 
time but not enough to bring them back egelston said 
in hartford conn the chester fife amp drum corps will help usher 
in connecticuts new brew feb 1 when john foley president of the 
connecticut brewing co rolls out the first barrel of nathan hale 
lager 
foley 26 developed his interest in beer at the university of 
notre dame where he reviewed the history of brewing for a seminar 
after graduation he worked in new york in invesment banking but 
continued to study the market for beer and after raising 500000 
founded the brewing company basing his beer on a recipe that dates 
to colonial america 
its a renaissance back to preprohibition days when manhattan 
had over 100 breweries foley said there were 4000 breweries 
in the united states in 1870 but by 1980 there were only 40 in the 
country 
but the brewing giants of the country need not fear competition 
from the new upstarts 
the boulder brewers association reports microbreweries and 
brewpubs brewed a total of 100000 barrels of beer in 1987 or about 
onehalf percent of all beer brewed and sold in north america that 
figure increased to 120000 in 1988 and papazian said the 
microbreweries and brewpubs may hit the 180000barrel mark in 1989 
the large breweries continue to dominate the domestic beer 
industry which in 1988 brewed and sold 188 million barrels of beer 
in the united states about the same amount as the year before said 
jerry steinman publisher of beer marketers insights which tracks 
trends in the brewing industry from west nyack ny 
you are obviously not talking about a major impact on the 
industry said steinman in the northwest some microbreweries 
may have an impact on some imports and superpremiums but they are 
not hurting the beer industry 
beer from microbreweries and brewpubs generally more expensive 
than domestic beer attracts the same consumers as import beers and 
could have an impact on overall sales of foreignbrewed beer which 
accounts for about 5 percent of beer sold in the united states 
steinman said

president bush said today he believes the 
economy is reasonably stable and hopes the federal reserve board 
wont overreact to inflationary fears by driving interest rates up 
further 
bush said in an oval office interview with two newspaper 
reporters that he had not yet read comments that federal reserve 
board chairman alan greenspan made tuesday to a house committee 
greenspan voiced concern about inflation and said the board would 
keep a tight grip on the money supply 
asked about this today bush said i must say that im 
encouraged that the markets at least recently have been saying 
that things are reasonably stable theres no signals out there 
in the markets that this economy is in real trouble 
the president said i havent talked to alan lately but i 
dont want to see us move so strongly against the fear of inflation 
that we impede growth we have to keep expanding opportunities for 
the working men and women of this country 
bush said however that he preferred not to get into 
commenting on greenspans testimony 
greenspan told the house banking committee he was worried that 
strains on factory capacity and a tight labor market particularly 
in the northeast are likely to keep inflation pressures bubbling in 
the near term 
as a result the central banks monetary policy should continue 
on the tight side he said 
the longrun costs of a return to higher inflation and the 
risks of this occurring under current circumstances are 
sufficiently great that federal reserve policy at this juncture 
might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness 
than of stimulus he said 
but in response to questions greenspan also indicated that the 
central bank would like to lower interest rates if it can be done at 
some point without causing an acceleration in price increases 
obviously we would prefer interest rates to be lower rather 
than higher all the time he said 
the stock market surged higher tuesday pushing the dow jones 
industrial average for the first time back to the levels it held 
just before the october 1987 market crash market watchers said 
investor optimism about greenspans comments helped fuel the rally 
the market reaction read it no 1 in the short term the fed 
will continue to tighten to ensure that inflation is under control 
but more importantly in the longer run greenspan leaned more in the 
direction of lower interest rates said john wilson chief 
economist of the bank of america 
however greenspans accompanying contention that economic growth 
must dip below 3 percent could spell serious trouble for the 
administration of president bush who is counting on high growth and 
lower interest rates to bring the budget deficit down 
the growth generates more tax revenue for the government while 
lower interest rates reduce the carrying costs on the 27 trillion 
national debt

philip morris cos inc said wednesday its earnings rose 269 
percent in 1988 but fell 285 percent in the fourth quarter because 
of a 348 million pretax charge to cover a restructuring at general 
foods 
philip morris the new yorkbased cigarette food and brewing 
giant that completed the purchase of kraft inc last month said it 
earned 342 million or 148 a share in the quarter down from 
478 million or 202 a share a year earlier revenue rose 199 
percent to 864 billion from 72 billion 
for the full year philip morris said its earnings rose to 234 
billion or 1003 a share from 184 billion or 775 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose 126 percent to 317 billion from 282 
billion 
the charge at general foods usa and general foods worldwide 
coffee amp international covered the closing of a jello plant in 
lafayette ind and other streamlining moves including layoffs 
excluding that charge fourthquarter earnings would have risen 159 
percent 
philip morris said its acquisition of kraft on dec 7 1988 
reduced its earnings by about 28 million including financing costs 
and amortization of goodwill but adoption of a new method of 
accounting for income taxes boosted net earnings for 1988 by 213 
million 
kraft contributed 821 million in operating revenue to philip 
morris since its earlydecember acquisition however the kraft 
purchase also boosted philip morriss debt by 106 billion 
including 1 billion that was on krafts books 
as was the case when we acquired general foods three years ago 
we are assuming large additional debt hamish maxwell the 
chairman and chief executive said in a statement 
we are confident of our ability to service this 
acquisitionrelated debt and to pay it down over the next few years 
as well as to sustain a good growth in earnings volume and market 
shares in 1989 and beyond maxwell said 
among individual market segments philip morris said revenue rose 
113 percent to 85 billion at philip morris usa rose 154 percent 
to 81 billion at philip morris international rose 98 percent to 
38 billion at general foods usa rose slightly to 44 billion

american express co reported wednesday that it 
made a profit in the fourth quarter following a yearearlier loss 
while earnings for all of 1988 nearly doubled 
the company attributed the improvement to record income in the 
divisions that run its credit card and financial services businesses 
and to a rebound in earnings from its bank following an easing of 
the third world debt crisis 
however its brokerage firm shearson lehman hutton holdings 
inc lost money in the final quarter and suffered a decline in 
annual income 
american express said net income totaled 231 million or 54 
cents a share in the three months ended dec 31 compared with a 
104 million loss in the 1987 quarter revenue jumped 34 percent to 
63 billion from 48 billion

loan losses at american express bank and 46 million in tax benefits 
from new accounting rules 
for the year american express netted 104 billion or 243 a 
share compared with earnings of 533 million or 120 a share in 
1987 revenue totaled 229 billion up 30 percent from 177 
billion in the previous year

annual results demonstrated our leadership position in travel and 
financial services

the united states has asked the european 
economic community to begin negotiations to ensure the american 
telecommunications industry has broad access to european markets a 
senior us official said wednesday 
we want a free and open market said alfred h kingon the 
us ambassador to the 12nation trading bloc also known as the 
common market 
he told reporters the 1988 us trade act targets the 
telecommunications area for discussions with leading trading 
partners it requires that negotiations in that field begin within 
30 days 
we want market access for the united states products and 
services he said 
we want nondiscriminatory procurement policies and 
nondiscriminatory standardssetting he said and we want some 
reasonable access to european telecommunications networks 
what we want in europe is what europeans want in the united 
states he said 
kingon said he discussed the request for opening the fresh talks 
with frans andriessen the eecs top trade official and filippo 
pandolfi who holds the telecommunications portfolio 
eec spokesman nico wegter said the eec had not received details 
about the us complaints pending this further information the 
community is indeed seriously concerned about this matter he said 
the world market in telecommunications equipment amounted to 90 
billion in 1986 according to eec figures the eec had 19 percent of 
the market share and the united states 38 percent 
the eec is to form a unified single market by the end of 1992 
when the dozen member states plan to remove the trade barriers 
separating them 
some in the united states worry that the community will use its 
newfound closeness to try to keep out us and other foreign 
competition 
telecommunications policies tariffs and certification vary among 
the member states the european commission the communitys 
executive body issued a plan last june for fashioning a common 
internal market for trade in telecommunications equipment and 
services by 1992 
kingon said the united states approves of the principles in that 
plan but he said we would have liked it to have gone perhaps 
a little further and state specifically rather than by inherent 
implication that thirdcountry exporters would have access to that 
market 
he said the telecommunications area was not covered effectively 
by regulations of the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
96nation free trade body international negotiations under the 
auspices of gatt are under way to press for further easing of trade 
barriers telecommunications is an area under discussion in those 
talks called the uruguay round 
kingon insisted the us decision to call for talks with the eec 
was not intended to spark a trade dispute 
it is not a new brawl it is not retaliation he said 
the new trade legislation gives us officials a year to complete 
negotiations but the president can grant additional oneyear 
extensions to complete discussions 
there is nothing in the law that mandates the president to take 
any kind of retaliatory action kingon said

futures prices of grains and soybeans were mostly 
lower wednesday at the close on the chicago board of trade 
there was no significant business in japan or europe to cause 
any buying today said jerry zusel manager of cbot floor 
operations for balfour maclaine corp 
soybean prices pulled back as much as 14 cents on the spot 
march contract because european markets didnt follow through with 
tuesdays rally in chicago and it appears the recent spurt of 
commercial buying has been completed said dale gustafson a grains 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
wheat prices were weighed down by the rainy weather forecast for 
the great plains growing areas and a slackening of us wheat 
exports said gustafson 
corn futures were lower in sympathy with the decline in wheat and 
soybeans 
at the close wheat was cent higher to 2 cents lower with the

weirton steel corp said wednesday it would 
go public to raise money for a 600 million modernization project 
under a plan allowing workers at the nations largest employeeowned 
company to retain a majority stake 
the countrys seventhlargest steelmaker said it will apply for a 
listing on the new york stock exchange when it goes public later 
this year pending approval of the plan by employees 
the agreement between the companys management and the 
independent steelworkers union would reduce the 8000 employees 
profit sharing from 50 percent to 35 percent of the companys 
aftertax income the companys pension plan would not change 
the agreement also calls for a public stock offering of at least 
50 million worth of the 65 million common shares now held by 
employees 
in addition it would create a new employee stock ownership plan 
or esop of 600000 convertible preferred shares that would ensure 
majority ownership by giving the new shares 10 votes each to one 
vote each for the common shares 
the preferred stock would not be traded employees upon 
retirement could either sell it back to the company or convert it 
into common shares the company said it would recycle into the esop 
employees could sell up to 35 percent of their common stock 
publicly under the agreement but they would have to retain the rest 
until they retire or leave the company retirees could sell all 
their stock 
new employees would have to wait three years before they could 
own stock 
the 13member board of directors would not change three members 
each from management and the union and the other seven from outside 
the company any issuance of new stock would require 90 percent 
board approval 
the company will have the economic basis to move forward with 
major modernization we have the opportunity to realize a bright 
future union president virgil thompson said 
last week weirton chief executive officer herbert elish said the 
company needs to invest 600 million over the next several years to 
modernize its plant and keep it competitive

renovation of its continuous slab caster to produce 100 percent cast 
steel completion of its hot mill renovations and renovations in 
its ironmaking blast furnaces and finishing mills

pepsicola co said wednesday it had signed pop 
star madonna for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said 
would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television 
commercial 
pepsi firing the latest volley in the newly escalating 
marketing war with cocacola co also will sponsor a planned world 
tour by the actresssinger later in 1989 after the release of 
madonnas first album in three years like a prayer 
the madonna announcement comes on the heels of industry leader 
cokes new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of diet coke past 
pepsi currently second in the market behind coke classic that 
effort marks the first time a major diet soda has squared off 
directly against a leading sugared competitor signaling a new 
intensity in the yearsold cola wars 
coke earlier this month signed pop singer george michael for a 
series of diet coke commercials on top of a campaign already 
featuring hockey star wayne gretzky model elle macpherson and 
miami vice star don johnson a onetime pepsi pitchman 
whats obviously shaping up is george michael and diet coke 
versus madonna and sugar pepsi coca cola usa spokesman anthony 
tortorici said frankly we like those odds 
terms of the madonna contract were not disclosed but if history 
is any guide the deal with the brash singer of like a virgin and 
star of the movie desperately seeking susan should be in the 
millions 
pepsis awardwinning ad campaigns featuring pop music began in 
1984 when the number two softdrink company signed michael jackson 
and his brothers to a 55 million oneyear deal that was the 
largest of its kind at the time 
two years later pepsi signed jackson for a reported 10 million 
to develop commercials over a threeyear period rock stars tina 
turner david bowie lionel ritchie and the miami sound machine also 
have appeared in pepsi ads 
pepsi has really pioneered the entire music marketing 
phenomenon pepsi usa spokesman tod mackenzie said people 
expect us to be on top of whats new whats hot and whats next 
madonna is next 
i think we set the trend and others have followed he said 
modeled as mini music videos the pepsi ads have taken the common 
tactic of celebrity promotions a step further by using popular songs 
as the center of a direct sales pitch 
the madonna deal adds another twist using a commercial to debut 
a song aimed at a popular audience 
pepsi said the title track to like a prayer would be heard 
publicly for the first time in a commercial to be aired in prime 
time early next month the single is scheduled for release march 3 
with the album to follow march 15 warner bros spokesman bob merlis 
said 
i dont recall anyone orchestrating the debut of a new record 
in a tv commercial said ken barnes editor of radio and records 
a music industry trade publication in los angeles its a new 
stage in the marriage between commerce and the arts 
barnes said pop songs long have emerged from commercials 
including the carpenters weve only just begun originally a 
bank ad and the recent british single the first time by robin 
beck which was spun off a coke commercial 
but gearing an actual planned commercial release for a tv spot 
i think is a new approach he said 
cocacola based in atlanta and pepsicola based in somers 
ny dominate the 432 billion us softdrink business 
according to the industry newsletter beverage digest coke 
classic topped all brands last year with 201 percent of domestic 
sales pepsi was second with 187 percent followed by diet coke at 
82 percent and diet pepsi at 52 percent

dana corp a giant auto parts company would 
buy 82yearold champion spark plug co for about 600 million in 
cash and stock under an agreement between the companies managements 
announced wednesday 
investors pushed champions stock above danas offering price 
indicating the belief that a higher offer might emerge from dana or 
another bidder 
the deal which must be approved by champions shareholders 
would end the independence of the spark plug maker that has been 
controlled by the stranahan family since its founding in 1907 
the two toledobased companies said the merger would unite 
champions famous name with danas farflung distribution system 
although not as well known as champion dana is a bigger company 
with 1987 sales of 49 billion it makes a variety of automotive 
parts including drivetrain components engine parts and chassis 
products 
champion had sales of 554 million through the first nine months 
of 1988 
champions stock already boosted by speculation of a merger 
rose 25 centsre in consolidated new york stock exchange trading to 
18 a share above danas offering price of 1750 a share in cash 
and stock 
dana fell 137 a share in consolidated nyse trading to 3837 
a share 
under terms of the deal dana will make a 1750ashare cash 
tender offer by feb 1 for 173 million shares of champion common 
stock or about 501 percent of the stock on a fully diluted basis 
champion spokesman anthony mougey said 
after the merger the rest of champions stock would be exchanged 
for cash or dana stock with a value of 1750 a share with an 
overall limit that no more than half of champions shares will be 
bought for cash the companies said 
the combination of dana and champion will allow us to serve the 
automotive industrial and aviation markets with a unique 
combination of wellrecognized brand names and a distribution system 
which is second to none said southwood morcott president of 
dana a toledobased automotive parts company 
o lee henry champions president and chief executive officer 
said the sale will strengthen both companies 
dana brands are very well respected in the marketplace and the 
dana distribution system is stateoftheart we are looking forward 
to working together and capitalizing on the strengths we each bring 
to the combination henry said 
echlin inc a branford conn automotive parts company had 
reportedly made a bid to buy champion last week a rumor denied by 
both companies echlin three years ago said it was interested in 
purchasing champion 
paul ryder echlins director of investor relations declined 
comment on whether the company would make an offer to buy champion 
even if we were considering it i wouldnt be able to disclose 
that information he said 
william prebe an auto industry analyst and former dana vice 
president and corporate economist said the 1750ashare offer is 
below what he believes the companys worth 
we were looking for something in the neighborhood of 20 up to 
22a share offer the price suggests that it was a very friendly 
composition between dana and champion he said 
prebe said it is possible another company would make an counter 
offer to buy champion 
you still have the bulk of the shares still traded on wall 
street if somebody wants to come in and get the remaining shares 
it would be a dirty fight that would raise the stock he said 
now is the nervous time for the guy sitting on the sidelines 
he is thinking should i take the 1750 or go along with something 
higher if nothing higher comes along and he hasnt taken the 
1750 it may drop the stock down to 14 15 dollarsashare he 
said 
market interest in champion increased with reports that members 
of chinook partners lp holder of 35 percent of champions common 
stock might dissolve the partnership 
chinook was founded three years ago when descendants of the 
companys founders frank and robert stranahan decided to pool 
their holdings to maintain a dominant voice in champions affairs 
the stranahan family members set an expiration date for the 
partnership of april 1 1989 and analysts speculated that the 
younger generation of the family was pushing to divest some of their 
holdings 
champions board of directors met in toledo on friday to discuss 
what it would do if the stranahans dissolved their family 
partnership the chinook members met afterward neither group would 
comment on the meetings 
david kubicki a united auto workers union international 
representative said he was surprised by the deal 
its difficult to really digest what has taken place and what 
the outcome and the future is going to be between the two parties 
said kubicki a former uaw unit chairman at danas toledo plant 
which has 340 workers 
champion earned 145 million or 41 cents a share on 554 
million in sales during the first nine months of 1988 compared to 
129 million or 34 cents a share on sales of 535 million in the 
same period of 1987 
champion which makes spark plugs and other automotive products 
employs about 10000 people worldwide including 2250 workers at 
its five us and canadian plants 
dana has 700 operations in 27 countries and employs about 35000 
workers

as a senate committee continued reviewing 
leveraged buyouts and whether they should be restricted wall street 
deal makers reacted with anger and skepticism wednesday about 
proposals to curtail the popular method for financing corporate 
acquisitions 
theyre trying to design a cure for something that has not been 
a problem said tony james a managing director at donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
on tuesday treasury secretary nicholas brady suggested to the 
senate finance committee that tax deductions for corporate interest 
payments be limited while a new deduction for stock dividends be 
created 
at issue is whether the government wants to discourage the 
buildup of huge amounts of corporate debt that are central to 
leveraged buyouts such as kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos recent 
record 2453 billion agreement to buy rjr nabisco inc 
in a leveraged buyout investors go heavily into debt to buy out 
a company the company than pays off the debt with its cash flow or 
by selling some of its assets 
but deal makers questioned the feasibility of limiting lbo debt 
and said it would be difficult to define how much of a firms 
interest payments are attributable to the cost of an acquisition 
joseph bartlett a partnr and lbo specialist at the law firm 
gaston amp snow said that even if lbo debt is limited acquirers would 
find ways around the restrictions 
instead of borrowing you will use saleleasebacks you say 
this isnt debt anymore he said 
bartlett also warned that too much tinkering with the corporate 
acquisition process could lead to unintended and unwanted 
consequences such as increased ownership of us companies by 
cashrich foreigners 
past proposals to limit takeovers have had a devastating effect 
on wall street in october 1987 congressional committees approved 
tax increase bills that some critics charged helped contribute to 
the stock market crash that month the house version included 
provisions to sharply restrict the deduction for interest expenses 
incurred in takeovers 
but observers generally doubted anything substantive would come 
out of this years hearings 
therell be a lot of discussion but in the end relatively 
little action said one principal in a major wall street 
investment partnership who asked not to be identified 
the only danger is that people get caught up in the theater of 
it all and they have some obligation to show some results he 
said that could be dangerous you could end up having stupid 
policy made 
there may be skepticism now but in 1988 deal makers who saw 
changes in the law looming on the horizon werent taking any chances 
last year brought a storm of buyouts and bids including the rjr 
nabisco deal and many securities analysts attributed the intense 
activity to acquirers trying to wrap up takeovers while the reagan 
administration still was in office 
the presidential election campaign brought a number of bipartisan 
calls for more reins on corporate takeover activity 
the feeling on wall street is that the hearings and proposals 
have grown out of a backlash from the takeover battle for rjr 
nabisco 
the politicians feel some negative reaction to the amount of 
money being made on wall street and so theres a lot of curbing the 
lbo trend or curbing the acquisition trend said the investment 
partnership principal 
there is is sort of a public consensus to do something about 
rjr nabisco said bartlett the problem is in washington they 
havent figured out what that something is 
another criticism is that any action would not only affect the 
big deals but also the smaller less highlypublicized buyouts that 
the observers say have benefited the country 
the buyout business isnt something new said edward gibbons 
a principal with the investment firm gibbons green van amerongen 
theyve turned out to be fairly good investments over the years 
in not all but in most cases weve seen the productivity of 
the businesses improve he said

the chicago mercantile exchange announced creation 
of a special panel wednesday to strengthen control over floor 
transactions as a federal grand jury convened to probe allegations 
of fraud in the citys powerful financial futures industry 
it matters not whether this federal investigation involves 
one member or many members of the exchanges said leo melamed 
chairman of the mercs executive committee and special counsel to 
the exchanges board of governors 
what matters is that we use this opportunity to act responsibly 
and make improvements where they are necessary he added there 
will be no sacred cows 
the panel which will be charged with reviewing trading 
procedures and practices and recommending changes where necessary 
is made up of five industry officials and five former or current 
public officials among them former sen thomas eagleton of missouri 
earlier in the day federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of 
the downtown everett dirksen federal building which in the past 
has been used for grand jury testimony and us attorney anton 
valukas in keeping with office policy declined even to confirm 
that an investigation was under way 
meanwhile several defense attorneys who advised clients to pass 
up government deals in exchange for cooperation complained of 
highpressure prosecution tactics wednesday as a federal grand jury 
convened to probe allegations of fraud in chicagos financial 
futures industry 
the complaints came a day after 200 subpoenas were served on 
prominent brokers traders and firms in a sweeping escalation of 
operation sourmash a federal undercover investigation of corruption 
at the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade 
the worlds largest futures exchanges 
federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the downtown 
everett dirksen federal building which in the past has been used 
for grand jury testimony and us attorney anton valukas in 
keeping with office policy declined even to confirm that an 
investigation was under way 
the investigation conducted by undercover fbi agents posing as 
traders reportedly centers on allegations that up to 100 brokers 
and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars via shady 
dealings on the exchange floors 
a number of wellknown defense attorneys in chicago said they had 
been retained by traders at the two exchanges and that subpoenas 
carried return dates of wednesday or feb 1 
several attorneys complained that federal prosecutors who 
accompanied fbi agents during latenight visits to some traders 
homes last week made veiled threats of confiscating property and 
other assets in hopes of enlisting the traders to cooperate or 
provide information about others 
if the idea was to make some people sweat theyve accomplished 
that said a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense 
attorney and asked not be identified but they might have gone too 
far in some instances 
people are used to thinking in terms of a conspiracy crimes 
going up a ladder said another attorney what you really have 
here appears to be a series of discreet acts that didnt stretch 
beyond one or two people at a time 
building conspiracy and racketeering cases and threatening to 
throw the book at people isnt going to make small catches any 
bigger 
but philip parenti a former federal prosecutor now in private 
practice said the subpoenas may signal a different tack 
they might have run out of people they they can squeeze 
information from easily and now theyre looking for witnesses 
not talkers 
from here on out anybody whos got exposure and goes in to see 
the grand jury is likely to be immunized or already has cut a 
deal he said and it seems too early for either of those things 
to have been done 
initial news reports panicked trading circles and spurred quick 
sales of seats on the two exchanges but by wednesday some of the 
clouds cast by the probe over the two exchanges had dispersed 
the exchanges reported sales of 32 full and associate seats 
through midday wednesday 
board of trade spokesman mark prout said a trend that saw the 
value of full seats slip steadily from 410000 last thursday to 
375000 monday had ended with a standing bid wednesday to purchase 
a seat at 383000 
id be careful to read anything into this especially at this 
early juncture said prout there are many more things that can 
move the markets than a pending investigation 
similarly trading volume in the soybean pits at the board of 
trade and the currency futures pits at the merc both apparently 
targeted by federal investigators were consistent with 
businessasusual projections 
andrew yemma a spokesman for the chicago merc said volume in 
the currency trading pits tuesday the last day for which full 
figures were available totaled 143698 contracts that compared 
with 170112 contracts traded thursday and 111284 traded monday 
prout said that trading in soybeans tuesday totaled 37223 
contracts tuesday compared to 46463 contracts traded thursday and 
32313 traded monday

texaco incs 1988 fourthquarter earnings rebounded from a 
multibillion dollar loss a year earlier and shell oil cos 
fourthquarter earnings tumbled 514 percent from a year earlier 
the petroleum giants said wednesday 
texaco reported net income of 296 million or 121 a share in 
the period vs a 467 billion in losses a year earlier attributed 
to a restructuring and the settlement of a lawsuit with pennzoil co 
shell said earnings fell to 212 million in the quarter down 
from 436 million in the same 1987 period the company does not 
release pershare figures because it is a subsidiary of royal dutch 
shell based in the netherlands 
shell president frank richardson said a recent rise in crude oil 
prices helped exploration and production performance but put 
pressure on refining and marketing costs 
for the quarter ending dec 31 texaco reported revenue of 847 
billion down 96 percent from 936 billion in revenue in the 1987 
quarter 
for the full year the nations thirdlargest oil company

351 billion compared with losses of 414 billion on revenue of 
353 billion in 1987 
texaco based in white plains ny said results from 
exploration and production in 1988 were hurt by low crude prices for 
most of the year and the loss of production in the north sea after a 
july platform explosion and fire 
but financial results linked to oil refining and marketing were 
positive because of lower crude oil acquisition costs texaco 
president james w kinnear said 
houstonbased shell the nations sixthlargest oil company said 
revenues for the quarter were 55 billion down 72 percent from 
the 59 billion for the same yearago period

two harvardeducated brothers are 
struggling for control of the uhaul rental empire founded by their 
father who pioneered the selftrucking idea at the end of world war 
ii and parlayed it into one of the countrys biggest familyrun 
businesses 
the squabble has made samuel w sam shoen and edward j 
joe shoen look like the bobby and jr ewing of doityourself 
moving both have allies among their 10 siblings and have sued each 
other in state and federal courts 
at stake is the destiny of an operation with about 13000 
employees 1 billion in annual revenue and a rental fleet of more 
than 100000 trailers and 64000 trucks emblazoned with the 
orangeandgray uhaul logo commonly seen on interstates nationwide 
the faction led by joe shoen a 40yearold attorney with a 
harvard mba currently runs uhaul and its parent company amerco 
which also has interests in other rental equipment selfstorage 
facilities and insurance the company is incorporated in nevada but 
most of its operations are based in arizona 
joe shoen and his allies won control via a stock maneuver last 
summer that gave them 53 percent voting power partly through the 
issuance of shares to nonfamily executives who were on their side 
the rival faction is led by sam shoen 43 a physician who also 
has an mba from harvard he quit as company president last summer 
because of frustration with family squabbling 
he has since challenged the legality of his younger brothers 
stock maneuver calling it a shabby move that cheated him and other 
shareholders 
sam shoens group is supported by patriarch leonard s shoen 71 
who had always wanted his eldest son to run uhaul and has expressed 
dismay at what is happening to his family and the business under joe 
shoens hand 
he now believes the entire company should be sold and knows of a 
buyer willing to pay 1 billion he said in an interview he 
wouldnt identify the buyer 
my son joe i think is incompetent the uhaul founder told 
the associated press by telephone this past week from his home in 
las vegas im not very pleased with his behavior 
sam shoen said in an interview that his father was a genius who 
had taken the company through four decades of impressive growth 
only to be undone by his childrens rivalries 
theres nothing very mysterious here sam shoen said im 
not going to imply that anybody has these particular problems but 
the problems are power control and greed 
he said leonard shoens weakness was the generosity that had 
prompted him to give each of his 12 children shares amounting to 95 
percent of the stock in amerco 
my father had a dream and his dream was that he would create 
this company which he did pass it on to his children which he 
did and that the children would work together which they did for a 
time and that it would be passed on to his grandchildren 
it was a wonderful dream but i dont know of a single case 
where its ever worked not with the kind of ownership dispersion we 
have sam shoen said 
the companys leadership is now so convoluted he said that he 
also wants to sell it despite what he called the sentimental value 
attached to his fathers american success story 
gary v klinefelter amercos secretary and general counsel 
declined to arrange interviews with joe shoen or other members of 
the controlling faction until the outcome of court proceedings but 
klinefelter claimed joe shoens move to take control was crucial for 
the companys survival 
leonard shoen struck a responsive chord in the american psyche in 
1945 introducing a fleet of rental trailers about the time many 
soldiers and sailors were returning home and looking for jobs around 
the country 
for many years uhaul grew with almost no competition operating 
out of franchised service stations in 1968 shoen moved from 
ridgefield wash where he started uhaul to the southwest basing 
the key operations in phoenix 
things started to get tougher for him in 1973 when the oil 
crisis crimped vehicle use meanwhile the uhaul fleet was aging 
zoning laws began restricting the location of rental trailers and 
competitors began muscling in on the companys dominance 
complicating matters were the shoen descendants themselves who 
by this decade had started vying for voices in the company unable 
to control it anymore the father retired in the fall of 1986 some 
say he was forced out by vindictive children 
in klinefelters view joe shoen helped save the business by 
reducing the average vehicle age to 7 years from 17 years doubling 
the number of north american dealers to 7500 scrapping a 
moneylosing fullservice moving van venture and introducing a new 
1ton toyota pickup truck rental 
the parent company is en route to record profits of 50 million 
on 1 billion in revenues for the 1988 fiscal year that began last 
april 1 klinefelter said 
the shoen family ties had eroded long before the squabbling 
turned legal he said 
this has been a very decentralized family he said the 
range of ages of these children is 21 to 43 with two different 
mothers then there is a minor child by a third mother 
sam shoen said his brothers group had done nothing unusual or 
innovative he claimed their father started the modernization 
the whole thing is a process he said its just replacing 
older vehicles with newer ones 
the underlying dispute he said is whether a minority of 
shareholders can issue stock to disenfranchise a majority its that 
simple 
despite the shoen family feud the company hasnt been hurt at 
least not yet securities analysts who follow transportation 
companies say 
i dont think there is any linkage between the family squabbles 
and the companys customer bases and demand for their product 
said thomas trantum who follows a key uhaul competitor ryder 
system inc for the jc bradford amp co investment concern 
customers are interested in the state of the equipment and the 
price trantum said they just want to move from here to there 
you just go to a couple of outlets check the prices and give the 
tires a kick then you take the best deal

bethlehem steel corp wednesday reported an 8 
percent decline in fourthquarter earnings largely because of costs 
associated with rehabilating one plant and selling or shutting down 
others 
specialty steelmaker lukens inc meanwhile said wednesday it 
enjoyed the best three months in company history with a 46 percent 
increase in fourthquarter earnings from 66 million or 78 cents 
per share to 96 million or 112 per share 
fourthquarter earnings for bethlehem the nations thirdlargest 
steelmaker fell from 715 million or 107 per share in 1987 to 
657 million or 79 cents per share sales climbed 10 percent from 
120 billion to 133 billion 
bethlehem charged 35 million against fourthquarter earnings to 
reflect increased operating costs at its burns harbor plant in 
indiana where it rehabilitated a blast furnace 
the company also took a 55 million charge to reflect losses on 
the sale of its remaining kentucky coal operations and for costs 
associated with previous plant shutdowns 
in 1988 a good year throughout the steel industry the company 
earned 403 million or 432 per share up from 1743 million or 
277 per share in 1987 sales rose from 462 billion to 549 
billion 
bethlehem lost a total of more than 2 billion in the five years 
from 1982 through 1986 
lukens quarterly sales rose 165 percent from 1335 million to 
1556 million 
the coatesville pa company also set records with annual profits 
of 334 million or 391 per share up 54 percent from 216 
million or 258 per share in 1987 sales rose 20 percent from 
5052 million to 6053 million 
healthy shipments nearcapacity operating rates and increased 
transaction prices more than offset rising scrap prices said 
lukens chairman wr wilson 
bethlehem chairman walter f williams predicted a profitable 
first quarter this year but no surge in demand 
we anticipate that steel consumption will remain relatively 
flat and domestic steel shipments will decline since customers are 
not expected to build steel inventories as they did in 1988 he 
said 
williams projected 1989 industry shipments at 77 million tons 
down from the estimated 83 million tons shipped in 1988 
we face a number of issues in 1989 which must be satisfactorily 
resolved if we are to continue our progress in achieving sustained 
profitability and rebuilding a sound financial base williams said 
we must negotiate a new agreement which will permit 
bethlehem to continue to remain competitive with other steel 
producers both domestic and foreign williams said 
bethlehems contract with the united steelworkers union expires 
july 21 
the major producers are also pressing president bush to fulfill 
his promise to renew the fiveyear voluntary steel import quotas due 
to expire in september 
we are relying on that commitment williams said the basic 
international conditions that required the policy excessive global 
capacity in steel and unfair trade in our market have not been 
corrected 
he said a fiveyear extension of the policy is essential 
the steel industry has not yet achieved an adequate and 
sustained level of profitability williams said

sales of existing singlefamily homes last year 
hit their highest level since 1979 as buyers shopped in lower price 
ranges rather than leave the market when costs rose a real estate 
trade group said wednesday 
the national association of realtors said 363 million homes were 
sold in 1988 up 29 percent from 1987 when 353 million homes had 
been sold it was the highest sales volume since 383 million homes 
were sold in 1979 
sales shot up 114 percent in december to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 409 million units it was the highest monthtomonth 
increase since an 116 percent rise in april 1986 
for the most part people seem to be buying lessexpensive 
homes said ira gribin president of the realtors group the 
demand is there people still appear to be going for the most they 
can afford they just cant afford as much 
home prices slipped slightly to 87700 in december compared with 
a median sales price of 88000 in november prices averaged 89100 
for all of 1988 a 41 percent increase from the previous year when 
the median sales price was 85600 
the strong sales volume of december combined with a decline in 
prices from november and overall modest price increases for the 
year suggest that the demand for home ownership is being fulfilled 
at the lower end of the market said john tuccillo chief 
economist for the realtors 
he predicted similar buying patterns this year but cautioned 
that with mortgage interest rates expected to continue rising 
economic conditions are not favorable to draw a large volume of 
sales 
interest on fixedrate mortgages averaged 1071 percent last 
week according to a national survey by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
economist mark obrinsky of the us league of savings 
institutions credited the strong 1988 home sales to the general 
health of the nations economy 
there is an underlying demand for housing thats fueled by 
visions of home ownership but also by the economic reality of an 
economy still in its expansion phase he said relatively good 
economic conditions are at bottom whats responsible for a fairly 
strong level of homes sales despite slightly higher interest rates 
he predicted there would be a slight decline in home sales during 
1989 as interest rates continue to rise early in the year and 
economic growth slows later in the year 
prices were up in 1988 in all regions of the country with the 
fastest rate increase coming in the west where prices rose 93 
percent from 1987 to reach a median of 123700 last year 
the northeast continued to have the highest sales prices of any 
region a median of 143100 in 1988 up 74 percent from a year 
earlier 
home prices rose 24 percent in the south to a median of 82300 
in 1988 while prices were up 35 percent in the midwest to a median 
of 68300 
the 114 percent sales increase nationwide in december followed 
two months where sales held even at a seasonally adjusted annual

smithkline beckman corp said wednesday its 
president has resigned amid differences over the direction of the 
giant health care company at a time it is faced with sagging sales 
of its blockbuster ulcer drug and takeover rumors 
george w ebrights resignation coincided with the release of 
smithklines earnings which showed a 60 percent drop in the 
companys 1988 profit 
ebrights resignation is effective immediately the company said 
his duties will be assumed by henry wendt smithklines chairman and 
chief executive officer 
george and i have had differences on matters of corporate 
policy nevertheless i accept his resignation with deep regret 
wendt said in a prepared statement he added that ebright has 
played a major role in the diversification of smithkline beckman and 
the building of our businesses 
smithkline said its fourthquarter net income rose 12 percent to 
1594 million or 128 a share from 1419 million or 114 a 
share in the yearearlier quarter revenue rose to 13 billion from 
12 billion in the 1987 period 
the fourthquarter figures were bolstered by income from the 
partial spinnoff of beckman instruments which brought in 461 
million the company said 
analysts said ebrights abrupt resignation probably stemmed from 
differences with wendt over the future direction of the company 
mr ebright was probably in favor of retaining control at the 
top and mr wendt was probably in favor of more independence of the 
units said ronald m nordmann a stock analyst with painewebber 
ebright who also was chief operating officer stood to loose 
responsibility with any independence given to the individual units 
nordmann said 
ebright 51 who became president april 1987 joined the company 
in 1963 in the accounting department wendt 55 became chairman the 
same month 32 years after joining smithklines international 
marketing division 
smithkline has strong managers in place at the corporate level 
and in our operating units and i am confident of their ability to 
lead our business into the future wendt said 
management has been under fire from critics who charge smithkline 
has failed to introduce a followup to its leading prescription 
ulcer medication tagamet as it has faced increased competition 
from londonbased glaxo holdingss zantac 
on the year smithklines profit fell 60 percent to 2292 
million or 184 a share from 5701 million or 450 a share 
the company reported its sales rose 10 percent to 47 billion from 
43 billion in 1987 
the yearly figures included a 3893 million charge associated 
with a corporate restructuring announced in september 
pharmaceutical sales were down 14 percent in the fourth quarter 
with tagamet and highblood pressure medication dyazide sales 
described as being down sharply tagamets sales for the year 
were 1020 billion 
a number of wall street analysts have labled smithkline a 
takeover target and largely on the basis of rumors of an imminent 
offer its stock has fluctuated widely in the past months 
the companys stock price was up 125 cents to 50 tuesday and in 
early trading today went up 125 the companys breakup value has 
been estimated at 75 to 91 per share 
the restructuring announced in september was viewed by many 
analysts as an attempt to fend off possible suitors 
but many said the partial spinoff of beckman instruments was not 
enough and wendt hinted in september that similar steps might be 
applied to their allergan and smithkline bioscience laboratories 
subsidiaries 
the company has said partial spinoffs would focus stock market 
attention on the value of the subsidiaries and thus increase 
smithklines value 
analysts said todays resignation likely signals more partial 
spinoffs within the corporation allergan and smithkline bioscience 
laboratories are likely candidates for such a move

a supreme court justice on wednesday allowed 
the resumption of a stock manipulation trial of gaf corp and its 
vice chairman 
justice thurgood marshall lifted an order he issued sunday that 
temporarily halted the trial 
gaf based in wayne nj and vice chairman james t sherwin are 
accused by the federal government of attempting to manipulate the 
common stock of union carbide corp in advance of gafs planned sale 
of a large block of carbide stock in november 1986 
a trial in the case began in december in new york city but ended 
in a mistrial on a motion by defense lawyers us district judge 
mary johnson lowe ruled that a prosecutor improperly but 
unintentionally withheld a report that key evidence had been 
altered 
a retrial began last week but while jury selection was under 
way lawyers for gaf asked marshall to block it on grounds that the 
defendants double jeopardy rights against being tried twice for the 
same alleged crime were violated 
marshall in an unusual move ordered an interruption in the jury 
selection sunday while he studied arguments on the double jeopardy 
issue he issued a brief order wednesday withdrawing the earlier 
order 
the justice department argued that retrying gaf and sherwin is 
permitted under a 1982 supreme court ruling that said double 
jeopardy rights are violated in such cases only when the prosecution 
intends to provoke a defendant into seeking a mistrial

coastal corp official james r paul said 
wednesday that texas eastern corps invitation to possible buyers 
is a ploy to delay coastals attempted 260 billion takeover bid and 
that the companys main goal is to remain independent 
i think theyre stalling to see whether they can find another 
alternative and theyre holding some remote hope of remaining 
independent i think their principal objective has been to remain 
independent said paul president and chief operating officer at 
coastal 
they talk about studying the idea of auctioning the company 
but they havent said theyre going to do it in fact to date they 
havent taken any specific action except to stall paul said 
however texas eastern officials said wednesday they already have 
started scheduling appointments witth possible buyers and denied 
pauls suggestion that their contacts with more than 50 possible 
suitors is meant to delay a coastal takeover by propping up stock 
prices 
the process is well under way said texas eastern spokesman 
fred wichlep we have set up data rooms here in our building and 
have already started making appointments with representatives of 
other companies to come in and review our data and to hear 
presentations by officers of the company he said 
trading in texas eastern was suspended briefly on the new york 
stock exchange tuesday after a company lawyer told us district 
judge lynn n hughes the company might use a white knight to 
block the coastal bid and has a list of more than 50 possible buyers 
coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed 
to inflate stock prices and make their 42ashare offer appear 
inadequate 
texas eastern officials say the number is legitimate and was 
provided in court only to inform hughes of their actions but they 
acknowledge that they are trying to maximize stock values 
this is a bona fide effort in our ongoing process to determine 
the maximum value of texas eastern stock wichlep said wednesday 
during the threehour court hearing tuesday hughes denied a 
texas eastern request to delay a feb 7 hearing date in a coastal 
lawsuit designed to prevent texas eastern from using any 
antitakeover measures 
wichlep said texas eastern would not discuss the number of 
companies planning visits to the companys houston headquarters or 
when they were expected all companies are being asked to sign 
confidentiality agreements he said 
analysts and industry officials expressed doubt wednesday that 
there may be a large number of serious contenders to take over the 
houstonbased natural gas company panhandle eastern corp arkla 
inc consolidated natural gas and burlington resources all have 
reportedly turned down requests to enter the bidding 
houstonbased enron corp which operates the nations largest 
natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a 
possible candidate for a texas eastern takeover will not say 
whether it is talking to the company 
others cited as possible suitors include houstonbased pennzoil 
and williams cos of tulsa okla british petroleum plcs bp america 
is said to have an interest in texas easterns considerable oil and 
natural gas reserves in the north sea 
paul said his company has asked texas eastern for information 
that would justify a higher offer than its 42ashare cash bid but 
said the only response has been rhetoric and a stonewall meeting 
last sunday 
the meeting between executives of the two houstonbased natural 
gas companies was the only facetoface contact to occur since 
coastals takeover bid was announced jan 16

from the previous year but that its profit for all of 1988 rose 2 
percent

previous ownership by the government conrail said it had earned 75 
million or 109 per share in the fourth quarter of 1987 the 
government sold the railroad in a public offering march 1987 
last october we cautioned that it would be difficult to match 
our fourthquarter 1987 performance which had benefitted from 
substantial increases in coal and steel traffic in fact we 
registered a solid quarter essentially equaling traffic volume 
said richard d sanborn conrail chairman and chief executive 
officer 
for the year conrail reported it earned 306 million or 444 
per share on revenues of 349 billion up from net income of 299 
million or 434 per share on revenues of 325 billion in 1987

loss tax credits and depreciation deductions 
in light of the discontinued tax benefits the company posted a 
224 percent increase over 1987 net income of 250 million or 362 
per share 
our continued strong performance in 1988 shows our ability to 
attract and transport higher volumes of freight traffic while 
continuing to control costs sanborn said 
the company carried 04 percent more freight in the fourth 
quarter of 1988 compared with the same period for 1987 conrail 
said for the year traffic was up 62 percent the company said

the baltimore sun announced plans wednesday for a 
fully computerized production system by 1992 that an analyst said 
would make it the nations most technologically advanced newspaper 
pagination as the process is called will eliminate the need for 
typesetting layout and pasteup operations and allow faster more 
efficient handling of news and better picture quality 
the newspaper has chosen crosfield electronic a computer systems 
developer to install the fullcolor electronic publishing system 
for 135 million 
if it is successful the sun would be the first newspaper in the 
country to have complete pagination according to john morton a 
washingtonbased newspaper industry analyst with lynch jones amp ryan 
many newspapers have plans for full pagination and a few already 
are using the process for classified advertising morton said 
all words stories headlines photo captions advertising copy 
etc will be written edited and positioned on a dummy page on a 
computer terminal 
photographs need not be produced as prints in a darkroom in 
technology known as electronic darkrooms images are stored as 
electrical impulses that can be enlarged or shrunk cropped 
lightened or darkened on a terminal 
pagination is just the latest in a series of evolutionary changes 
in the printing industry which not so long ago relied on hot lead 
type that was melted and reused for each edition 
it will spell the end of whats left of the composing room 
morton said 
richard m basoco the suns senior vice president and general 
manager said the system will eliminate twothirds of the current 
150 composing room jobs significantly reducing labor costs 
however workers contracts guarantee them lifetime job security 
so employment will be reduced only through attrition remaining 
workers will be offered transfers and retraining 
eugene bannister vice chairman of international typographers 
union local 12 at the sun said pagination was inevitable 
automation is trial and error bannister said they might talk 
about pagination but who knows whether its going to work 
basoco said the new system combined with new color presses 
would enable the sun to increase its use of color and to produce 
itself the work on its sunday magazine now performed by jobbers 
crosfield of glen rock nj is the north american operation of 
crosfield electronics ltd an english company owned by de la rue 
co the worlds largest nongovernment currency and security printer

a west german newspaper says a subsidiary of 
bechtel group inc provided financing for an iraqi poison gas 
factory in the mid1980s and 30 soviet experts helped build it 
rick laubscher spokesman for the american company said its 
an outrageous lie bechtel did not build design or finance anything 
of the kind in iraq during that period 
we have never participated in any such project nor would we 
ever 
the leftleaning west berlin newspaper tageszeitung in a report 
released wednesday and scheduled for publication thursday said it 
had a list of 31 foreign companies and 18 banks and financial 
institutions allegedly involved 
tageszeitung said it obtained the list from the united kurdish 
front a group opposed to the iraqi government it said the list was 
compiled by an official iraqi agency 
in addition to bechtel the newspaper said the list contained 
names of companies in west germany belgium france brazil italy 
britain yugoslavia and switzerland that directly or indirectly 
participated in building a mustard gas plant in iraq 
seven west german companies were named in the report but bechtel 
was the only name of a foreign firm included 
according to tageszeitung bechtel financing services in 
cooperation with britains midland bank helped finance the 
building of the plant beginning in 1984 the site was given as 
akashat 240 miles southeast of baghdad near the jordanian border 
iraq officially described it as a facility for producing 
fertilizers and pesticides the paper said but in reality 
mustard gas was produced there 
the kurdish group has a list of 30 soviet experts and engineers 
who helped with the facility tageszeitung reported 
it said the soviet union also provided technology but quoted 
kremlin arms expert viktor karpov as denying soviet involvement

president bush said wednesday his 
administration is considering charging depositors to help pay for 
the savings and loan crisis but members of his own party in 
congress quickly stuck a pin in the trial balloon 
im not going to say what im going to do but that is one 
option bush said in an interview with two reporters 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady in television interviews 
wednesday morning said a proposal under review by his department 
would impose an insurance fee of 25 cents for every 100 in 
deposits but he stressed that the option has not been forwarded 
yet to bush 
brady did not say how the fee would be collected but his 
spokesman arthur siddon said the fee could be imposed directly on 
depositors or it could be paid by the institutions as an increase 
in the insurance premium they already pay 
the fee or premium would apply to all federally insured 
financial institutions banks sampls and credit unions siddon said 
meantime the general accounting office is preparing a report 
which says that some of the nations largest accounting firms failed 
to uncover fraud and mismanagement at sampls the washington post 
reported in its thursday editions 
the gao the investigative arm of congress examined the audits 
of a dozen failed sampls which were given clean audits meaning 
no problems were found shortly before the sampls went under the 
newspaper said 
bush in an interview appeared to dispute a suggestion the fee 
could be considered a tax thus violating his read my lips no new 
taxes pledge 
i will answer the question with a question is it a tax when 
the person pays the fee to go to yosemite park using the park 
there will be a lively debate on this bush said 
john sununu white house chief of staff said an increase in 
deposit insurance premiums does not pass the duck test and 
therefore is not a tax sununu was referring to a statement by 
budget director richard darman who told congress that if a proposed 
revenue increase was widely perceived by the public as a tax 
increase it would not be proposed saying if it looks like a duck 
its a duck 
sununu suggested that the option under consideration could be 
considered a modernization of deposit insurance premiums which 
historically have proved to be too low 
federal regulators pledged more than 38 billion last year to 
close 205 insolvent sampls more than 350 other insolvent institutions 
remain open and billions of dollars more will be required 
the treasury department is working on a plan for bush that would 
raise money and institute reforms to prevent the problem from 
reoccurring sununu said bush could select a plan as early as next 
week 
members of congress said they have been contacted by treasury 
department officials over the last week or so seeking their reaction 
to a variety of moneyraising ideas 
one option would impose a user fee on mortgage borrowers others 
involve various ways to borrow the money either on or off budget 
with the treasury paying the interest 
but the deposit fee option reported in wednesday editions of the 
washington post stirred a furor in the industry and in congress 
the post quoting unidentified sources said the fee could raise 
9 billion a year which would cover interest payments on the 20 
billion to 30 billion the government will have to raise for several 
years 
the thing is dead on arrival for one reason it puts an 
imposition of a burden on the depositor and creates an unlevel 
playing field against insured financial institutions said rep 
stan parris rva a senior member of the house banking committee 
i havent found one member who thought it had any merit 
parris said warning that the fee could send deposits flowing into 
money market mutual funds and other uninsured investments offered by 
brokerage firms 
sen john heinz rpa a senior member of the senate banking 
panel called the idea incredibly illadvised 
i will only vote for this idea posthumously and only then if 
someone casts by proxy against my direct wishes expressed in my last 
will and testament heinz said 
i think its one of the more absurd ideas that has come down 
the pike said rep charles schumer dny a banking committee 
member at a time when were trying to encourage people to save 
to penalize them is nonsensical politically its going to be 
blown out of the water 
however other members of congress said the trial balloon should 
not be summarily dismissed 
i think it underscores how bad all the alternatives are said 
rep jim leach riowa the nature of the solutions is they are 
going to be uncomfortable all will pinch our choices are 
potentially increasing taxes potentially increasing the budget 
deficit or some sort of deposit insurance premium increase 
you have to ask yourself what is the least obnoxious of all the 
alternatives said rep john lafalce dny i dont think it 
should be precluded at this time some people want to put their 
heads in the sand and pretend theres no problem or pretend it wont 
be costly to solve but theres no free lunch 
bank executives in particular promised to lobby hard against 
the idea 
taxing bank customers to bail out the savings and loan industry 
would be a gross injustice ford wasnt asked to bail out chrysler 
newark wasnt asked to bail out new york said donald g ogilvie 
executive vice president of the american bankers association 
robert dugger chief economist of the association warned that 
customers would end up paying even if the institution paid the fee 
rather than the depositor 
one of the things that will happen is that interest rates on 
deposits will have to go down if the tax is collected through the 
banks a 5 percent rate will become something like 5 percent he 
said
