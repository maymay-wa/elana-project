a state appeals court has ordered hearings 
on damage claims against the state in the beverly hills supper club 
fire that killed 165 people in 1977 
the kentucky board of claims had summarily dismissed a group of 
claims filed against the state by the estates of seven victims of 
the fire at the club in southgate in northern kentucky 
the state court of appeals said friday that the board and other 
administrative agencies have no statutory authority to dismiss 
claims on their own 
the seven claims were consolidated when the boards action was 
appealed to campbell circuit court the circuit court was upheld by 
the 21 appellate ruling 
saying it had the inherent power to do so the board 
dismissed the claims without notice in 1987 the board said it would 
not have been liable to the claimants anyway 
but the appeals court said that administrative agencies unlike 
courts have no inherent powers 
the board was created by the general assembly to handle damage 
claims against state agencies 
the claims at issue were not filed against a specific state 
agency the board of claims suggested the proper agency would be the 
department of housing buildings and construction which includes 
the state fire marshals office the appeals court said

at lunchtime every friday its not 
difficult to find yale universitys bursar hes out picketing the 
ivy league schools health services building in a oneman protest 
against yale abortion policies 
francis r nicoll 58 the universitys bursar since 1974 began 
his weekly picketing in january and has missed only a couple fridays 
since then 
you need to do things regularly that you believe in said 
nicoll who is also yales assistant treasurer that is all that 
is needed you dont have to make a lot of noise 
nicoll who believes abortions under all circumstances are wrong 
said his protest is aimed at a policy that he said requires 
everyone including students and parents opposed to abortions to 
help pay for the procedures 
mandatory health fees which support the operations of university 
health services are included in tuition 
nicoll said he was told by a source at the health services 
center which also provides care to university employees that an 
average of four to five abortions are performed a week 
but alan west a health services spokesman said the figure was 
significantly lower and included both students and yale employees 
abortions are performed only one morning a week at the center he 
said 
nicoll who is joined by his wife about two fridays a month 
carries the same large picket at each of his protests it reads 
yale brutally murders unborn children here each week 
nicoll a 1952 yale graduate and founder of a group called yale 
for life also hands out literature 
about onethird of the students who enter the building accept his 
literature he said the rest either ignore him or tell him they 
oppose his position 
i dont know of any students seeking an abortion who because 
of frank nicoll say i am going to keep the baby and give it up 
for adoption west said i think the students are generally on 
the liberal side enough so that they think its a pesonal 
decision 
nicoll said administration officials have not tried to discourage 
him from protesting 
on the contrary they ordinarily say youre wrong we dont 
agree with you or way to go but they always say its great 
you have the freedom to say what you want the bursar said 
as bursar nicoll is responsible for collecting all tuition 
room board and miscellaneous charges as well as all student loan 
payments 
he has participated in several antiabortion marches in 
washington but said he didnt learn until last fall that abortions 
were being performed at the health services center 
abortions have been performed at health service since the late 
1970s or early 1980s west said 
nicoll said he will continue his weekly protest until yale 
changes its policy

welfare mother elyse sanchez had a lot of 
confidence when she accepted a teaching fellowship and moved her 
children from a ratinfested building in new york to a threebedroom 
apartment in view of open space and corn fields 
that was in august since then ms sanchez says her confidence 
has been tried by the rigors of academia at the university of iowa 
and the unexpected departure of her adopted daughter rochelle 
its harder than i feared it would be i came to see i didnt 
come fully prepared the education which i received in new york did 
not prepare me for graduate school in the 1980s ms sanchez said 
i feel as though im beating batter and im going to cook it on 
a wood stove while everyone else can just pop it in the microwave 
oven she said 
but shes also marveling at the strong sense of community 
ms sanchez 35 who had been living in the new york city borough 
of the bronx made national news when she graduated from lehman 
college in new york last summer with a 40 gradepoint average and 
was offered the iowa post 
adviser miriam gilbert said ms sanchez who will begin teaching 
in the english department next year is fitting in nicely 
i dont think its necessarily the easiest thing in the world 
to come with the spotlight on you ms gilbert said in my own 
class shes a wonderful asset full of contributions and ideas and 
sharing a great deal with others in the class 
but life at home has been tough adopted daughter rochelle 17 
who had been with ms sanchez since she was 3 and babysat ms 
sanchez three younger children while ms sanchez got her degree at 
lehman left in midoctober the university of iowa had waived 
tuition for rochelle as part of the fellowship agreement 
she had written something for her rhetoric class she said she 
hated me and always had it wasnt anything i had done just being 
in the room with me made her angry ms sanchez recalled in an 
interview so i said if youre really unhappy here why dont you 
think about maybe leaving 
within 10 minutes she packed her bags 
at that point i began to doubt what i was doing here because it 
had so many implications ms sanchez said i began to think i 
want to teach people her age and if shes so against work if this 
is the attitude an adolescent has and shes my own daughter how are 
a bunch of students going to accept me when i begin teaching next 
year 
she decided to tough it out concentrating on her workload of 
three courses and caring for her other three children aged 12 11 
and almost 9 
she explained her problems to english department chairman john 
raeburn and ms gilbert and credits the pair with helping her 
through that difficult period she said she wasnt accustomed to 
such a sense of community 
thats a nice feeling to have here that people understand 
ones problems said ms sanchez i had been told that when i 
got here it was going to be very cutthroat but it hasnt been 
ms sanchez said she and her children will go back to new york 
for christmas but she doesnt miss the city 
i dont feel this constant sense of anxiety anymore i think i 
picked the right place she said the kids like it here they 
absolutely adore it 
the big threat my parental threat is that ill take them back 
to new york if they dont behave she said

alvin ailey turns up the heat and speeds the 
blood pressure with opus mcshann his new dance created to 
recordings made by blues and boogie woogie pianist jay mcshann now 
72 
opus mcshann is one of aileys show biz dances which 
critics complain about when there are several in a row but miss when 
there are none for awhile opus mcshann has less glitz and more 
effectiveness than some in that category the new york premiere on 
friday evoked scenes from kansas city mcshanns headquarters for 
much of his career 
a man in purple tails beckoned the company onto the city center 
stage theyre all dressed up for dancing and strike a fashionshow 
pose before cutting loose with some limberlimbed downanddirty 
jazz dancing the woman in the most elegant formal gown will later 
prove to be a stripper 
carl bailey and gary deloatch are hilarious as the last drunks 
left under a swaying string of lights after a dance they may be 
drunk but they manage some fancy unison footwork mcshann plays 
doo wah doo and sings in his nasal blues style whos gonna 
carry me home i cant leave that gal alone 
eleven dancers probably in the bar of a sporting house dance 
confessin the blues sharrell meshalexander dances for an 
indifferent andre tyson while mcshann embellishes and improvises 
gee baby aint i good to you into an instrumental anthem 
finally tyson wakes up to the sexiness being displayed around him 
and pulls miss meshalexander now seated and her chair into the 
wings 
marilyn banks desmond richardson david st charles and stephen 
smith were outstandingly lithe and snakehipped to i aint mad at 
you 
a group lindy hop to jumpin the blues choreographed by 
swing society veterans frank manning and norma miller was broken up 
by four members of the ku klux klan 
dudley williams did a solo how long which became a 
meditation on antiblack activities during it the four klansmen 
melted away it was obvious that ailey was just mentioning this not 
doing a deep enough study of it to dent the rollicking goodtime 
mood of opus mcshann 
the blues can be a very ebullient music and ailey has created a

nato remains determined to continue a 
policy it believes has succeeded so far maintaining adequate 
military forces while seeking cuts in conventional and nuclear 
forces with the east 
the foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization 
ending a twoday meeting friday said they welcomed the unilateral 
offer by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to cut soviet forces 
by 500000 troops or nearly 10 percent over the next two years 
promising prospects are opening up for an improved eastwest 
dialogue they said in a statement 
but secretary of state george p shultz and other delegates said 
the west should not overreact to gorbachevs decision to withdraw 
50000 troops and 5000 tanks from eastern europe notably east 
germany czechoslovakia and hungary 
being encouraged doesnt mean that you just go bananas and 
forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the 
things that are constructive shultz told reporters 
he said that after the soviet troop cuts the warsaw pact still 
will have an enormous advantage in battle tanks artillery and other 
armaments 
the cuts will be significant and make a difference shultz 
said but they leave a situation still very assymmetrical 
he said the warsaw pacts edge in divisions would be reduced to 
291to1 from 299 in tanks to 218to1 from 276 and in 
artillery to 174to1 from 230 
nato secretary general manfred woerner said we look upon mr 
gorbachev with sympathy and encourage his reform efforts 
but he said nato must keep its defenses strong and modernize 
weapons even while negotiating cutbacks in conventional forces in 
europe with the warsaw pact in talks expected to open next month in 
vienna austria 
soviet forces in europe which nato estimates at 22 million 
still exceed any reasonable defense need the foreign ministers 
said in their statement 
on thursday the western allies gave a broad outline of natos 
negotiating position at the conventional stability talks with the 
warsaw pact 
the talks are to begin once a 35nation human rights conference 
in vienna ends 
the allies said they want to reduce the total number of tanks in 
the area between the atlantic ocean and the ural mountains to 
40000 leaving east and west each with 20000 
under the nato proposal the soviet union could keep a maximum of 
12000 tanks on the soil of its east european allies down from 
37000 now

a blowtorch of dry santa ana wind and blazing 
embers destroyed 15 expensive homes and damaged 25 others friday in 
a roaring 3000acre brush fire that chased residents from their 
beds for a third day and prompted the governor to declare a state of 
emergency 
the firestorm driven by erratic gusts of up to 70 mph blasting 
off the desert hit the northwestern san fernando valley it added 
new losses to the 22 homes burned and many others damaged wednesday 
and thursday when the wind toppled trucks and knocked out power to 
half a million customers 
late friday afternoon gov george deukmejian issued a terse 
order declaring a state of emergency in los angeles county the 
order makes people eligible to apply for aid under some state 
programs and is a first step toward seeking federal aid 
by nightfall friday the winds had eased somewhat and most of 
the thousands who had fled returned to their homes during the day 
schools were closed and evacuation centers were set up at campuses 
and a synagogue 
no serious injuries were reported but 45 firefighters suffered 
minor eye injuries from flying embers and five firefighters and two 
civilians were treated for smoke inhalation city fire spokesman jim 
williamson said 
we still face a very dangerous situation fire chief donald 
o manning said as the fire eluded control at midafternoon in 
nonresidential lands close to other residential areas were not 
out of the woods yet 
but by nightfall the winds had begun to slack and the fire began 
to calm the national weather service predicted continuing weakening 
winds slowing to 10 mph to 15 mph by saturday afternoon 
the fire was 50 percent surrounded by 8 pm as it continued to 
spread slowly northward into vacant hills and full containment 
expected by sunrise said county fire spokesman john lenihan 
fourteen houses and a mobile home were destroyed and 25 hours 
were damaged friday said fire department spokesman gary svider 
putting the loss at 43 million earlier officials had said 22 
homes were destroyed or damaged but a closer look at the burned 
area resulted in the higher estimate 
the fire raced from sunshine canyon through the santa susana 
mountains 25 miles northwest of downtown and down into the 
fashionable porter ranch development said county fire spokesman 
john lenihan 
helicopters braved fierce turbulence that made it difficult to 
make water drops accurate while vans carried ground crews up to the 
battle fire trucks stood guard around an oilfield 
two firefighters were hospitalized for embers in their eyes two 
suffered from inhaling fumes of chlorine from burning pool supplies 
and 30 firefighters and one civilian suffered smoke inhalation 
manning said 
seventy horses were evacuated to granada hills high school 
the fire was reported about 430 am by employees at the 
sunshine canyon landfill above granada hills and an arson 
investigation team searched for clues to the cause said battalion 
chief dean cathey 
the fire swept southwest in a blizzard of embers to porter ranch 
where residents awakened to choking smoke and an orange glow in the 
sky 
it was just like raining fire said tim dinsmore 16 who 
helped his father wet down the family home before they had to flee 
several blocks away as i was spraying water the neighbors houses 
started to burn thats when i got scared the dinsmores home

the house banking committee under a new 
chairman likely wont act on legislation revamping the nations 
banking laws before 1990 some industry representatives say 
all signals are slow said kenneth guenther executive vice 
president of the independent bankers association of america which 
is opposed to such legislation 
the new house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez 
dtexas said friday that the issue of whether to permit greater 
overlap of the banking and securities industries clearly must 
be on the priority list 
gonzalez added however at his first news conference since being 
selected chairman tuesday that he planned an extensive series of new 
hearings on the subject and said the panel would start fresh in its 
effort to write legislation 
the committee under outgoing chairman rep fernand j st 
germain dri who lost his bid for reelection started hearings 
on bank deregulation last year after a jurisdictional dispute with 
the house energy and commerce committee blocked the banking panels 
bill late in this years session st germain pledged to repass it 
before the snow melts next spring 
gonzalez seems in no hurry to complete work on this legislation 
you have to exercise as much or more care when you deregulate 
as when you regulated and fast legislation is dangerous 
legislation he said 
gonzalez has made the savings and loan crisis the committees 
first task and that at best will be resolved by august guenther 
said then if the bush administration makes banking reform a 
priority it could become a focus of congress in 1990 he said 
also the new chairman of the senate banking committee sen 
donald w riegle jr dmich is seen as more sympathetic to the 
concerns of the securities industry than his predecessor sen 
william proxmire dwis guenther said 
robert dugger chief economist of the american bankers 
association which has pushed for additional bank powers said the 
sampl crisis is so compelling that congress likely will deal with it 
quickly 
although gonzalez in the past has been skeptical of bank 
deregulation other members of the house committee are strong 
advocates he said adding that a proposed series of regional 
hearings on the issue need not delay action unduly 
gonzalez told reporters he intends to take testimony in january 
on the nations economy in preparation for writing new legislation 
then he said he wants the committee to hold hearings in each of the 
12 federal reserve bank districts around the nation to gather the 
views of little bankers and citizens 
we want to hear from those voices who dont have a chance to be 
heard in these great halls he said we have not had 
comprehensive testimony other than from the lobbies 
on other topics gonzalez said 
the federal reserve board which operates independently of money 
appropriated by congress should be held more accountable for the 
power it wields over the nations economy gonzalez is a longtime 
critic of the fed hes advocated subjecting it to auditing by 
congress general accounting office in the early 1980s when the 
board was fighting inflation with high interest rates he called for 
impeachment of the fed chairman 
industry proposals for resolving the savings and loan crisis are 
santa claus wish lists gonzalez along with the sampl industry 
advocates tapping the treasury to clean up insolvent sampls however 
he proposes splitting off the industrys regulator the federal home 
loan bank board from the fund that insures its deposits the 
largest sampl trade group the us league of savings institutions is 
seeking to preserve the current regulatory structure 
the accumulation of corporate debt from leveraged buyouts is a 
matter of great concern but he offered no remedies

a man who calls himself black santa 
is quitting after 26 years of helping the needy despite pleas from 
the mayor the governor and others that he reconsider 
robert say mcintosh said he feels exhausted unappreciated 
and dismayed by the growing influence of drugs and a disappearing 
work ethic among children and their parents 
im just disgusted with the whole thing i dont have the 
cheerful mind to be santa claus this year the 44yearold 
restaurateur said friday 
his announcement prompted pleas that he change his mind 
its really too bad said gov bill clinton say has done a 
lot for several years and i hope hell be back soon 
the governor has been an object of both praise and protests from 
mcintosh known for his free feasts for the poor and leaflets 
expounding on a range of subjects 
people will tell him he just cant give up said mayor lottie 
shackelford we dont have enough people who are committed as it 
is i just hope he will reconsider i just know he will 
we do love him and we care said dennis hamilton director of 
missions for the union rescue mission in little rock i think hes 
made a bigger impact on people than he possibly can understand 
mcintosh wasnt swayed 
im not going to change my mind he said im not thinking 
happy this year i dont deserve to be black santa 
mcintosh said he reshaped the image of santa claus for many black 
youngsters who have always seen santa depicted as a plump bearded 
white man if youre wearing that red suit youre santa claus 
he said 
mcintosh said that while giving to others he has taken a lot 
from himself 
he started playing santa in 1962 by buying 250 in presents for 
poor kids he estimated that over the years he has spent more than 
250000 on christmas gifts and free food no donor has kicked in 
more than about 1000 and the balance comes from his pocket he 
said 
it just aint right mcintosh said i keep on borrowing 
money to motivate people motivate this community help us love each 
other but work ethics is dead in america we have lost to drugs 
they have destroyed america 
his attitude changed with his sons imprisonment last year for 
possession of cocaine mcintosh said he became embittered when few 
people offered encouragement during his sons costly defense 
he said he would still feed the needy for free at his barbecue 
restaurant downtown though hes not planning the fullfledged 
dinners hes staged in the past 
what would persuade mcintosh to put on his custommade santa 
outfit again 
if i woke up in the morning and there are no drugs and no 
people on drugs if we came together as a community and cleaned up 
our community but that aint going to happen

even with soviet troop reductions announced 
this week the soviet union believes it could win a war in europe 
against nato according to a congressional report 
for that reason the report said the united states and its north 
atlantic treaty organization colleagues should be careful about 
soviet attempts to bargain for lower levels of troops 
the study did not specifically mention the 10 percent troop 
reductions announced at the united nations this week by soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev some of the cuts will affect troops and 
equipment in eastern europe 
the report released friday was written by the general 
accounting office the office of technology assessment and the 
congressional research service it was ordered by last years 
pentagon budget bill which directed a wideranging study of the 
military balance between the north atlantic treaty organization and 
the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies 
there were four warnings about soviet intentions in the 
longstalled effort to negotiate lower levels of troops and military 
power in the european theater 
first because the soviets do not believe that they must have 
superiority across the theater in order to achieve victory caution 
must be exhibited in any agreement for force reductions 
the soviets now have an edge of at least a 2to1 advantage in 
many major measures of military might the study said adding 
soviet writings suggest that the soviets could have a force 
advantage across the theater of as little as 125 to 1 or even 
parity and still achieve victory 
any overall symmetrical reduction in forces would not be to 
natos advantage given that lowering the density of forces by 
soviet calculations would aid the attacker and make rapid advance 
and maneuvers easier 
unless all equipment is disabled or destroyed the soviets 
could agree to force reductions knowing that a dramatically reduced 
division would be capable of regeneration in a few weeks 
finally nato should not expect any significant unilateral 
reductions on the part of the soviets either to promote good will 
or to pressure nato into an equivalent response that would not 
also be in the soviet unions own military and political interests 
currently soviet planners believe that they have a marginal 
advantage in the conventional balance in europe today although they 
are far less optimistic about the future 
the soviets apparently have concluded that a 15to1 force 
advantage or even parity across the entire theater may be sufficient 
to enable their forces to achieve a 3 or 4to1 force advantage on 
a few breakthrough sectors and 4 to 8to1 advantage at the 
tactical point of penetration the study said 
the study was prepared by a variety of experts including 
comptroller general charles bowsher head of the gao former arms 
negotiator jonathan dean rep charles bennett dfla chairman of 
the house armed services seapower subcommittee lawrence korb 
former assistant secretary of defense and james woolsey former 
undersecretary of the navy

oliver l north repeatedly lied to government 
officials to cover his tracks when confronted with complaints 
that iran was overcharged for us weapons during armsforhostage 
deals prosecutors say 
north persisted in a pattern of deception that enabled him to 
exploit the iran initiative by secretly using it to generate a pool 
of funds over which he exercised control without governmental 
accountability prosecutors said in a filing friday 
the former national security council aide initially lied to a 
defense department officer and two cia officials about the price 
iranian arms dealer manuchar ghorbanifar agreed on for 1000 tow 
missiles in january 1986 the filing said 
north made the critical misrepresentation during his report 
of the london meeting at which ghorbanifar agreed to pay 10 
million or 10000 a missile 
he told three officials that the iranian had agreed to pay 6000 
apiece for a total of only 6 million independent counsel lawrence 
e walsh said in the filing 
north pressed the cia to reduce the 6000 price even further and 
eventually it was set at 3700 per missile for reasons unrelated 
to norths statements walsh said 
the arms deals continued that year but by the summer of 1986 
fissures began to develop in norths scheme when iranians 
learned they were being overcharged as much as 600 percent the 
discovery was apparently made when they obtained an accurate 
microfiche price list for hawk missile parts walsh said 
north told cia officer charles allen to tell the iranians that 
the price they had paid was correct and that it was higher than the 
microfiche because it was difficult to locate hawk spare parts 
walsh said 
he later tried to persuade the cia to produce a fake price list 
to extinguish the complaints 
confronted by allen with ghorbanifars complaints that he was 
being unfairly blamed for the overcharges north questioned the 
trustworthiness of ghorbanifar 
north repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin of the 
inflated prices his own efforts to generate a surplus for the 
contras instead he attempted to cover his tracks and blame the 
problem on ghorbanifar walsh said 
in the memo filed with us district judge gerhard a gesell 
walsh said he will demonstrate at trial that north played a 
significant role in directing expenditures from the enterprise 
through witnesses such as willard zucker an american lawyer who 
operates a swiss financial company 
according to the filing allen is also prepared to testify that 
north impugned the trustworthiness of roy furmark when told that the 
canadian businessman had conveyed ghorbanifars suspicion that 
funds had been diverted to central america 
walsh also disclosed that north arranged to purchase a 
substantial quantity of weapons for the nicaraguan rebels known 
as contras with money left over from the aborted sale of hawk 
missiles by israel to iran in november 1985 
by this time north and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord a codefendant in the case had already started to set up a 
clandestine armssupply network for the contras an effort that 
walsh says amounted to a secret war in nicaragua 
walshs filing indicated prosecutors have evidence that 
contradicts norths congressional testimony last year that the 
diversion was suggested by ghorbanifar during their jan 22 1986 
meeting 
in the fall of 1985 north directed israel to place 1 million in 
a swiss bank account to cover the expenses secord would incur by 
selling the 80 hawk missiles to iran via israel the deal fell 
through after the first shipment of 18 hawks because iran was 
dissatisfied with the weapons it received 
much less than the full 1 million was necessary to cover 
secords expenses walsh said aided by this infusion in 
december 1985 the enterprise shipped a substantial quantity of 
weapons to the contras 
north and secord are charged along with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim with 
diverting more than 14 million in profits from a series of 
usiran arms deals in 1986 to the help arm the contras 
gesell has said he hopes to bring norths case to trial by late 
january at the earliest 
secord poindexter and hakim are to be tried separately after 
north

incoming white house chiefofstaff john sununu 
says a thorough background check is delaying the naming of 
presidentelect bushs defense secretary 
amid reports that an fbi check of top contender john towers 
personal life is slowing down the process supporters of the texas 
republican said the delay could scar tower politically 
you always wish things could go faster sununu said friday 
and yet in todays world the worst thing you could do is to do 
things quickly rather than thoroughly and that applies to all 
appointments not just the tower one 
you dont get any extra credit for being early the new 
hampshire governor said 
bush has yet to confirm widespread reports that tower who was an 
arms negotiator for president reagan and a former chairman of the 
senate armed services committee is his choice 
however a bush transition source who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said friday that tower still appears to be bushs first 
choice 
sen john mccain rariz a backer of tower and adviser to bush 
on defense indicated that a longerthananticipated fbi check was 
stalling a final announcement they fbi are checking allegations 
and rumors womanizing drinking involvement in defense 
contracts mccain said 
all allegations have to be put to rest so there is no 
embarrassment at a later date he said in an interview from 
their viewpoint i wouldnt do anything different its just sad that 
its harming john tower to some degree 
sununu would not comment on the reason for the delay but the 
transition source confirmed it was primarily due to an fbi check 
believed to be delving into the former texas senators personal life 
and allegations made by his exwife 
bush on friday continued meetings with various interest groups 
and individuals benjamin hooks the head of the naacp said after a 
private session with the vice president that bush had promised to 
put a black in his cabinet 
none of bushs appointments yet has been a black hooks who met 
with the vice president for about 30 minutes said the session was 
very cordial 
the vice president also met with a group of 13 prominent 
conservatives edwin feulner jr president of the heritage 
foundation said the group pressed bush to make sure that all 
parts of the conservative coalition continue to have a stake in 
his success once he becomes president 
as for tower mccain expressed concern about the delay saying 
the longer it takes theres bound to be an impact on his 
stature 
another supporter sen william cohen rmaine said i think 
anyone who is allowed to hang out as the designated nominee without 
any confirmation from the presidentelect is bound to suffer a 
thousand wounds 
bush said this week he was disinclined to believe negative 
allegations about tower 
a leading democrat on defense issues echoed the sentiments of 
republicans mccain and cohen 
in a speech house armed services chairman les aspin dwis 
said if tower is named defense secretary he will come into 
office in a weakened position for one thing with all that 
twisting in the wind questions will be raised about how much 
confidence the president has in him 
on other subjects sununu said 
he wants to be chief of staff for eight years with this 
president and has no plans of returning to new hampshire in two 
years to run for office although he is holding onto leftover 
campaign funds for a possible future race 
direct access to the oval office will be given to the chief of 
staff the deputy chief of staff and the national security adviser 
as for vice presidentelect dan quayle sununu said they bush 
and quayle are going to work out their arrangement and obviously 
whatever the vice president bush decides is the way to work will 
be the way we work 
that as reported bush adviser robert teeter had been offered 
the post of deputy chief of staff and counselor to the president 
and was taking a few days to think it over 
teeter said in a telephone interview from his home in ann arbor 
mich that he would decide in the next few days whether to take 
the job or return to michigan to resume running his polling service 
i dont know what im going to do yet he said 
meanwhile charles imbrecht chairman of the california energy 
commission said bush transition officials have spoken to him about 
the posts of energy secretary and environmental protection agency 
administrator 
i told them to make me an offer and well talk about it he 
said

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
remained hospitalized after suffering congestive heart failure 
which aides said was triggered by concern for his exiled daughter 
marcos 71 did not suffer a heart attack and did not require 
surgery doctors said refusing to release other details until test 
results were released later today 
marcos was in guarded condition late friday after undergoing 
tests including an electrocardiogram said st francis medical 
center spokeswoman norma kop 
he was expected to remain in the hospitals heart unit for about 
two days said kop she said he was in good spirits and that his 
wife imelda was receiving visitors in an adjoining room 
asked to comment on allegations that marcos who was deposed as 
philippine president in 1986 and is under indictment in the united 
states had earlier faked symptoms of illness kop replied he had 
a heart irregularity and that can be pretty serious 
he was taken by ambulance to the hospital and admitted on the 
recommendation of his cardiologist calvin wong due to the acute 
onset of congestive heart failure early friday marcos spokesman 
gemmo trinidad said 
congestive heart failure means the heart is unable to pump the 
amount of blood required by the body 
mrs marcos is very worried trinidad said shes in tears 
shes always in tears 
mrs marcos rode to the hospital in the ambulance she clutched a 
brown rosary and cried as marcos was wheeled into the emergency room 
on a stretcher 
marcos began having chest pains around 4 am after learning 
that his pregnant daughter imee manotoc who lives in exile in 
morocco had labor complications and would deliver by caesarian 
section trinidad said 
the president became so worried sick and upset that they 
called the doctor trinidad said 
marcos eldest daughter delivered a boy her third but her 
condition and that of the baby were not known trinidad said 
marcos was examined at his makiki heights home before being 
hospitalized at 1217 pm trinidad said 
marcos aide arturo aruiza said doctors urged marcos to seek 
treatment for chest pains for the past three weeks but he did not 
want to be hospitalized because he thought critics would accuse him 
of faking 
if he thinks he can take the pain hell take it 
a new york cardiologist who examined marcos has told a federal 
judge in new york that although marcos suffers various ailments he 
is well enough to travel to new york for arraignment on the 
racketeering charges the arraignment had been postponed after 
marcos doctors said he was not well enough to travel 
marcos repeatedly faked pain during the threehour examination 
according to the report by the cardiologist francis m weld 
the philippine consul general in hawaii tomas gomez said he did 
not believe marcos was sick 
here we go again the boy who cried wolf gomez said with 
all the publicity about his faking it i really dont believe 
him now 
the marcoses are accused of plundering their homeland and 
stashing millions of dollars in the united states mrs marcos 
pleaded innocent on the charges but marcos has yet to be arraigned 
they have lived in hawaii since his 1986 ouster in a 
militarycivilian revolt

a ninemonth surveillance spawned by a rash of 
commuter airline accidents that killed 56 people uncovered 
systemic deficiencies in management and operation of many 
commuter airlines the federal aviation administration says 
the faa said friday that while its special examination of the 
commuter industry found some carriers in full compliance with 
federal regulations others demonstrated a need for significant 
improvements 
the special inspections program which began in march covered 35 
airlines or about 20 percent of the commuter industry 
the faa said its inspections uncovered 1284 violations of 
airsafety regulations about onethird of which were considered 
serious enough to warrant a possible civil penalty 
commuter airlines which generally fly aircraft with 30 or fewer 
seats have become an increasingly important segment of the 
commercial airline industry bringing passengers from smaller 
airports to larger airports serviced by major airlines 
this year commuter airlines are expected to carry more than 32 
million people in and out of 800 cities 
the faa inspection was prompted early this year by a string of 
commuter accidents seven in four months during late l987 and early 
l988 in which 56 people were killed there have been no fatal 
commuter crashes since the review began in march faa spokesman fred 
farrar said 
faa administrator allan mcartor said he was particularly 
concerned about the systemic deficiencies with management 
personnel uncovered by faa inspectors 
the most serious findings of the inspections reflected a lack 
of management knowledge of and experience with complex commuter 
air carrier regulations as well as substandard administration of 
training and deficient aircraft inspection programs mcartor wrote 
in a letter to commuter airlines 
the faa attributed much of the industrys problems to the rapid 
growth of the commuter industry and the transition to larger more 
complex aircraft unfamiliar to many managers 
among the faa findings were that some airlines failed to fill 
management positions or filled them with inexperienced or 
unqualified people at times pilots did not complete required 
competency checks training records were incomplete or did not 
exist and aircraft were at times allowed to depart without repairs 
being fully performed 
the airlines inspected were selected at random according to faa 
officials the faa provided no breakdown as to what was found at 
each airline but did release a list of the air carriers inspected 
the commuter airline industry responding to the findings 
acknowledged some shortcomings and attributed many of the problems 
to the industrys rapid growth in recent years 
we were aware that the tremendous growth of regional airlines 
may have created difficulties for some carriers in filling 
operational and maintenance posts said duane ekedahl president 
of the regional airline association 
the industry association said it was forming a special task force 
of industry officials to find ways for commuter airlines to retain 
experienced pilots and management employees 
the faa identified the 35 airlines as 
40 mile air ltd air midwest inc air molokai air nevada 
airlines air new orleans inc alpha aviation inc atlantic 
southeast airlines inc aviation associates inc bering air inc 
business express inc capitol air service inc ccair inc

some television evangelists financial records 
are being investigated by the internal revenue service and two of 
the probes are criminal in nature the agency said 
the irs is looking at the records to determine if there was 
misuse of taxexempt contributions ellen murphy irs director of 
public affairs said friday 
ms murphy did not identify those being investigated saying the 
law prohibits such disclosure 
the washington post reported in todays editions that the rev 
jerry falwell had been notified that the irs will begin a review 
next month of falwells liberty university and may later look into 
his television show the old time gospel hour 
the post also reported that spokeswomen for evangelists pat 
robertson and oral roberts had confirmed the irs was auditing their 
operations both organizations said they had not received word on 
results of the investigations 
the post said the irs is looking into whether robertson used 
millions of dollars from his christian broadcasting network to help 
finance his bid for the presidency that probe reportedly is 
completed but cbn spokesman frankie abourjilie said another inquiry 
was under way into the operation of the taxexempt cbn network the 
post said 
former ptl host jim bakker who was indicted this week on wire 
and mail fraud charges is part of the irs investigation according 
to sources quoted by the post 
ms murphy said the irs routinely examines records of taxexempt 
organizations the investigations into various television evangelist 
ministries are in various stages and do not reflect any decision to 
take a major look at evangelists she said 
assistant irs commissioner robert i brauer wrote to rep jj 
pickle dtexas chairman of a ways and means oversight 
subcommittee that at least six probes involved television 
evangelists and two were criminal investigations ms murphy said 
the letter said the irs was examining whether contributions to 
the ministries were diverted for personal use but were not reported 
as income whether salaries and benefits received by evangelists 
were higher than that considered reasonable for taxexempt 
organizations and whether donations were illegally channeled into 
political activities the post said 
ms murphy said such investigations could lead to criminal 
charges or to an irs bid to revoke an organizations taxexempt 
status however she also said the irs generally tries to get an 
organization to make internal changes to allow it to keep its 
taxexempt status and such a move might not be made public 
a falwell spokesman said his organizations had been audited twice 
before and the irs found our books to be in good shape falwell 
welcomed the audit the post quoted the spokesman as saying

gov george deukmejian declared a state of 
emergency in los angeles county where flames fanned by santa ana 
devil winds destroyed at least 37 homes and blackened more than 
3350 acres 
it was hitting so fast i thought my hair would catch fire my 
clothing would catch fire said jane cody 41 whose house escaped 
damage from a wildfire that gutted 15 homes in the fashionable 
suburb of porter ranch friday as winds gusted to 70 mph on the 
brushy hillside 
all you could see was red all you could feel was wind 
santa ana winds calmed today and firefighters had the blaze more 
than half surrounded 
the fire that burned more than 3200 acres in the northwest san 
fernando valley was the third to ravage southern california in two 
days two windfanned blazes thursday burned 150 acres and destroyed 
22 homes in the suburbs of la verne and baldwin park 
by nightfall friday the winds relented and the fire slowed the 
national weather service predicted winds would slow to 10 to 15 mph 
the fire located in the granada hills area 25 miles northwest of 
downtown was 60 percent surrounded friday night as it spread slowly 
northward into vacant hills said county fire spokesman john 
lenihan full containment was expected today 
deukmejian issued the emergency declaration friday afternoon 
enabling victims to apply for state aid the order would also make a 
federal disaster declaration possible but it was not known if one 
had been requested 
the san fernando fire destroyed 14 houses and a mobile home and 
damaged 25 houses said fire spokesman gary svider damage was 
estimated at 43 million 
fortyfive firefighters suffered minor eye injuries from flying 
embers and five firefighters and two civilians were treated for 
smoke inhalation said city fire spokesman jim williamson 
the blaze began early friday in sunshine canyon then swept 
southwest in a blizzard of embers through the santa susana mountains 
to porter ranch where homes cost up to 500000 
residents awakened to choking smoke and an orange glow in the 
sky thousands fled their homes but others stayed behind as long as 
they could 
it was just like raining fire said tim dinsmore 16 who 
helped his father wet down the family home before they were forced 
to flee several blocks the home was unscathed 
fire officials wanted to question two men seen in the area in the 
hope they might provide clues on how the fire began williamson 
said they are not suspects he stressed 
fire investigators photographed downed power lines at the 
sunshine canyon landfill where the fire was first reported said 
landfill spokesman mark ryavec 
at the height of the blaze eight waterdropping helicopters 
dived on the flames as 1200 firefighters attacked on the ground and 
fire trucks guarded an oilfield installation 
seventy horses from stables in the fire area were evacuated to 
granada hills high school and classes were dismissed at many area 
schools 
this is a tragedy but when you think about it it could have 
been much worse mayor tom bradley told reporters during a tour of 
burned areas we are pleased with the expertise that was 
demonstrated here 
elsewhere firefighters contained at midnight a 1000acre brush 
fire that broke out late friday morning north of lake elsinore in 
rural riverside county state forestry officials said the fire was 
expected to be under control by this afternoon said foresty capt 
mike sowards 
the fire which came within a couple hundred yards of four homes 
was believed to have started accidentally but its exact origin was 
unknown said battalion chief ted pfeiffer 
the santa anas which picked up strength in the area wednesday 
are caused by the flow of air from high pressure over the western 
interior to low pressure offshore picking up speed and warmth as 
they hurtle down from the desert through mountain passes into the 
los angeles basin

invitation to a white house dinner 
the invitations to a recent family reunion were printed with a

the defense department learned about the invitations and the 
secret service asked local police to investigate said maj anthony 
ciaccia of the monroe county sheriffs department 
sheriffs deputies this week questioned several of the carluccis 
who insisted the invitations were a prank 
needless to say the local carluccis are mortified and 
apologized profusely said ciaccia alls well that ends well 
it never occurred to us that anyone would take it 
seriously said mary cilento of east rochester who helped send 
out the invitations the family held its reunion nov 25

residents shut themselves in after dark 
drew curtains and answered callers warily as police hunted for a 
gunman believed responsible for four shootings in as many nights 
the first victim was killed outside his auto customizing shop on 
monday three men were wounded by shots fired into their homes on 
each of the next three nights 
police on friday had patrols closely watching neighborhoods in 
this township of 23000 people on long island 
we can only assume that the killer has gotten scared because of 
the extra patrols or else hes taken the night off we just dont 
know detective sgt william armstrong of the southampton police 
said late friday 
the shootings have enough in common to point to one sniper but 
police so far say they havent found a common thread that would 
point to motive 
all the shootings have occurred after dark most around dinner 
time within a twomile radius in the towns of southampton and 
riverhead the two towns are about 75 miles east of new york city 
and near the exclusive beach communities favored by the citys 
wealthy 
the victims all bluecollar men in their 30s were shot with 
either a smallcaliber rifle or a lightweight shotgun friends and 
relatives described them all as hardworking family men and were at 
a loss to suggest a motive 
its scary said barbara bouchard who lives next door to one 
of the victims this is stuff you hear about in new york city 
around here the most serious thing is they catch people 
shoplifting 
an anonymous caller believed to have been the gunman contacted 
riverhead police after the first shooting monday and said death 
to drug dealers and crooked cops according to a source involved 
in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity a similar 
call came after the second shooting on tuesday he said 
but police said none of the victims was known to have dealt drugs 
and they apparently did not know one another 
there is a definite link with the four said the source we 
think there is a reason for these shootings a perverted type of 
thing 
southhampton police chief conrad teller said the victims appeared 
to have been specific targets and not chosen at random 
but he said we have nothing concrete to connect them

efforts expressed little fear of entering an unfamiliar corner of 
the world where tens of thousands of people have perished in one of 
the worst earthquakes of the century 
i have experience with disasters experience with soviet 
disasters said gale predicting that political complications in 
armenia would be less than those surrounding chernobyl which 
involved the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor 
i feel pretty confident that we know what we are getting into 
training is the key to the whole thing said steve mcconaughy a 
member of the canine team along with his wife carol the couple is 
from brookeville md and the pair are going to armenia with their 
black newfoundland dogs ebony and shasta

soviet diplomats met with state department officials late friday 
afternoon to make arrangements for sending the chartered plane us 
and russian spokesmen said

assistance to soviet union in the postworld war ii era the two 
countries were allies during the war 
the flight and many members of the team started from new yorks 
kennedy airport and the team added more members and the bulk of the 
supplies at the later stop at dulles 
the dogs will be used to help find possible survivors in the 
rubble left by the massive earthquake which soviet authorities 
estimated had killed 80000 people 
the us government offered to help thursday but received no 
response until late friday afternoon when yevgeny kutovoi 
ministercounselor at the soviet embassy met at the state 
department with mrs taft

for gifts and special teams of french and british dogs were already 
in yerevan helping search the rubble for survivors he said

the music strikes up at purdy high school 
tonight but some of the people who won a court battle against this 
southern missouri communitys centuryold dance ban wont be able to 
get footloose 
only current students will be permitted to attend the homecoming 
dance disappointing graduates among the 21 students and parents who 
sued two years ago to have the dance ban struck down 
school superintendent sheldon buxton saying he feared outsiders 
bent on disruption would be attracted by publicity about the dance 
and dance ban has restricted attendance to the 160 students 
enrolled at purdy high 
naturally that upsets me just a little bit because most of the 
people who were really behind it were in my class said amy wolf 
who graduated last year 
amother graduate george fox said he had planned to go to the 
dance before learning administrators had put strict restrictions on 
the event 
but i can miss it im not going to let it upset me fox 
said 
us district judge russell clark ruled last summer that the 
purdy school boards dance ban was unconstitutional saying it 
promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious 
reasons 
the school board appealed clarks order but suspended the 
nodance rule pending a ruling from the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals in st louis the appeals court is not expected to hear the 
case until the end of the year 
miss wolf now a freshman at missouri southern state college in 
nearby joplin recalls the homecoming games and crowning ceremonies 
of her high school years followed by a 15minute drive to a nearby 
town for a dance she said she had hoped for at least one dance in 
the high school gym before graduating 
i had no idea the court system would have taken so long to get 
anything done she said ive learned a lot about the way 
government works 
foxs younger sister nancy is student body president at purdy 
this year and he has several other younger brothers and sisters 
im not really sure if i got anything out of it or not fox 
said of the court battle but at least they his siblings will 
get something out of it 
purdy is a centuryold farming community of about 900 people deep 
in the ozarks of southern missouri and located about midway between 
springfield and joplin

the defense department is on the verge of 
approving a change in funding that could delay peak production of 
the b2 stealth bomber until the mid and late 1990s the los 
angeles times reported today 
the decision on the 685 billion stealth bomber program should 
come monday the newspaper said 
the times quoted unidentified pentagon officials who said the 
bombers production schedule clearly will be stretched out 
the news followed a meeting wednesday of the defense resources 
board the pentagons senior decisionmaking body for program 
management 
weve flattened out production to a more gradual increase than 
was planned a pentagon official told the times requesting 
anonymity 
air force officials are backing the change in production saying 
it will allow time to incorporate improvements that may be suggested 
during flight tests the newspaper said 
deputy defense secretary william h taft iv who chaired 
wednesdays meeting was expected to reach a final decision over the 
weekend following meetings with department officials the times said 
production plans call for building 132 of the planes 
the stealth a variation of a singlewing aircraft design and 
resembling a giant bat was unveiled last month when the first plane 
was rolled out at northrop corps production facility in palmdale 
the first bombers costing 500 million each were to be 
delivered to the air force in 1991 with planes reportedly being 
delivered at a rate of two per month by 1992 
production rates like nearly everything regarding the highly 
secret bomber have been classified but tafts decision could push 
back peak production two to three years 
that production rate is now unaffordable a defense official 
said 
some lawmakers had also indicated previously that production 
plans might have to be pushed back because of high costs 
we probably are going to have to slow down the stealth 
considerably sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate defense 
panel said on cbstvs face the nation on nov 27 
however such a change could jeopardize the financial stability 
of the bombers prime contractor northrop corp which derives 
about half its sales from the plane 
the company already has reduced its labor force on the bomber 
from a peak of 14000 to 12600 employees 
as word that the bombers production scale might be stretched out 
began to surface on wall street last week northrops stock dropped 
from 31875 a share to 29125 in new york stock exchange trading

a 24yearold wouldbe financial adviser who 
bilked investors out of 15 million is a product of our times 
says his lawyer but the judge who gave him an eightyear sentence 
called him a predator 
us district judge david n edelstein did not impose a fine 
friday but ordered david p bloom to make full restitution 
edelstein could have sentenced bloom to 10 years in prison and 20 
million in fines 
for the past few years my life has been out of control bloom 
told the judge before sentencing adding that he had undergone 
extensive psychiatric treatment 
the highliving bloom whose massive swindle scheme earned him 
the title wall street whiz kid pleaded guilty last march to one 
count each of mail fraud and securities fraud 
according to prosecutors the boyishlooking bloom used deceit 
and fraud to parlay a college investment club into a 
multimilliondollar investment operation with about 140 clients 
most of them friends of his parents 
bloom who was not registered as an investment adviser wooed 
investors for his nowdefunct greater sutton investors group inc by 
falsely claiming his clientele included the sultan of brunei the 
rockefeller family and entertainer bill cosby 
in a sentencing memo to the judge assistant us attorney robert 
l plotz said bloom victimized close friends of his parents and 
betrayed the trust not only of these friends but also of his 
parents 
noting that several of blooms victims had turned over pension 
plans and individual retirement accounts to him the memo said bloom 
took everything he could from people who loved him in so doing 
he exhibited a legal and moral depravity 
i have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and 
betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me bloom 
told the judge 
blooms lawyer urged edelstein to give his client a shorter 
sentence than the threeyear term handed ivan f boesky describing 
bloom as a greedy young man and a product of our times wall 
street speculator boesky pleaded guilty to securities law conspiracy 
and is cooperating with investigators 
when he grew up greed was on the ascendency said the 
lawyer david w oconnor david bloom shouldnt wind up being the 
scapegoat of the 1980s 
but edelstein said bloom was remorseless completely lacking in 
conscience he was a predator completely insensitive 
the judge sentenced bloom to four years on each count and in an 
unusual move ordered the prison terms to run consecutively as 
spectators in the crowded courtroom gasped 
bloom a 1985 duke university graduate with an art history 
degree told clients he was putting their money into the stock 
market when he actually was using it to pay for a lavish lifestyle 
that included art works worth 55 million an 830000 condominium 
on manhattans upper east side a beach house worth 19 million on 
new yorks long island and two cars an astonmartin convertible 
and a mercedesbenz worth 200000 
the securities and exchange commission last january brought civil 
charges against bloom who settled by agreeing to turn over his 
assets to a courtappointed receiver and to stay out of the 
securities industry for the rest of his life

residents of this little piece of armenia 
waited for news from their earthquakedevastated homeland as they 
struggled to deal with the latest calamity to befall their people 
it seems as though were always being persecuted one way or the 
other said carl takvorian 66 
about 6000 of watertowns 39000 residents are of armenian 
extraction the tidy middleclass suburb about five miles west of 
boston is believed to have one of the highest concentrations of 
armenians in america 
on friday the day after the quake hit soviet armenia churches 
were draped in black bunting children laid wreaths at a monument 
and charitable organizations geared up to aid victims 
we dont know why were being punished said retired 
policeman edward kazanjian 78 
kazanjian was one of dozens of people crowding the office of the 
st james apostolic armenian church community center awaiting any 
news from the disaster area 
the holocaust was bad enough he said referring to a turkish 
campaign to wipe out armenians that began in 1894 and reached its 
peak during world war i hundreds of thousands died and many others 
fled to the united states 
the first feeling to sweep watertown when word of the quake came 
was despair said ara kalaydjian editor of the armenian mirror 
spectator 
but now its changed into determination to build again and not 
for decades for centuries kalaydjian said 
friday morning donors with checks and clothing and offers to 
help raise money began arriving at st james 
people spoke of crying all night long children laid flowers at 
the granite monument memorializing the armenian massacre 
when the tears dried people put their energy into trying to 
contact friends and relatives in the soviet union and to donate 
money and other aid 
the armenian assembly of new england was to begin a telethon 
today to raise funds and asked that donations of food and clothing 
be brought to the twa cargo hangar at logan international airport 
for an emergency airlift 
armenians first settled in large numbers in massachusetts in the 
last century when wire manufacturers in the central massachusetts 
city of worcester recruited workers in the near east said the rev 
dajad davidian st james pastor the first armenian apostolic 
church in the united states was established in worcester in 1891 
some of those first settlers later moved to watertown then a 
center of the rubber industry 
on friday long faces spoke of shared grief and anxious hours 
trying to get through to armenia by telephone 
luda esserian said she learned through a call that her sister 
sofa and her family were safe the family lives in stepanavan an 
armenian village that sustained major damage although their home 
was leveled they were unharmed and are staying temporarily with 
relatives in yerevan 
we listen to the radio all day said sonya ourfalian owner 
of the massis bakery where shelves were stocked high with such near 
eastern delicacies as dried figs and pastries heavy with honey 
though of armenian extraction mrs ourfalian 49 grew up in 
lebanon and has no relations in the soviet union but she said the 
feeling of connection with the quake victims runs deep 
they are our people she said they are armenians

with firebombs and rocks after they were blocked from marching to 
the presidential palace

shopping district tearing chunks of concrete from sidewalks and 
pelting riot troopers with firebombs that burst in orange blasts of 
blazing gasoline 
arrest chun doohwan overthrow president roh taewoo 
protesters shouted 
police had no figures on arrests or injuries but officers and 
protesters were seen with blood pouring from head wounds and other 
injuries some police and protesters were brutally beaten after 
being caught by the other side 
violence broke out when more than 2000 people tried to march to 
the blue house presidential mansion after a rally at myongdong 
cathedral

alliance to push for chuns arrest and the overthrow of roh 
speakers said chun could not be brought to justice while the roh 
government is in place 
riot police blocked the marchers with shields students with iron 
bars and wooden clubs attacked police but were driven off by 
teargas grenades 
hundreds of protesters regrouped several blocks away and attacked 
police with firebombs police cleared the main streets several 
times but protesters repeatedly surged from backstreets and drove 
the troopers back 
terrified people many of them out christmas shopping fled as 
firebombs and teargas grenades exploded around them riot police 
chasing protesters hurled teargas grenades into subway stations 
the protest was much smaller than three major violent protests in 
seoul last month to demand chuns arrest for alleged corruption and 
human rights abuses during his seven years in office 
in another protest today four buddhist monks and 14 radical 
students clashed with police several hundred yards from the remote 
buddhist temple on the east coast where chun is in exile the former 
president went into exile after publicly apologizing for abuses 
committed during his sevenyear rule 
the south korean news agency yonhap said fighting began when 
police stopped protesters trying to approach the temple students 
and police fought with clubs and six people were injured yonhap 
said 
opposition leaders accused roh of delaying action against chun 
and repeated demands that the former president cooperate with the 
national assembly probe of misdeeds under his rule 
kim daejung who heads south koreas main opposition group the 
party for peace and democracy charged roh with moving backward 
another opposition leader kim youngsam urged roh to 
immediately remove all vestiges of the chun era and take 
tangible measures such as releasing all political prisoners 
roh asked the nation to forgive chun after the former president 
apologized and went into internal exile 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 stepped down in february at the end of a sevenyear term roh 
another exgeneral won presidential elections last december

a man who said he contracted aids from a blood 
transfusion during heart surgery was awarded 39 million by a jury 
which found a blood center negligent for not screening blood donors 
im going to spend the rest of my short life trying to help 
other people who are less fortunate than me and also help victims of 
aids no matter how they caught it said john carroll 63 of 
surburban brookfield 
carroll testified that he might die within a year 
the award was announced friday in circuit court carrolls 
attorney robert l habush said it was the biggest aids verdict 
in the us 
carrolls lawsuit said the blood center of southeastern wisconsin 
did not test blood that was shipped march 6 1985 to a hospital 
where he had heart surgery a month later 
the center did not begin testing donated blood until march 7 
1985 and was unaware until november 1985 when the donor returned 
that he carried the aids virus the lawsuit said 
carroll said he learned in 1986 from the center that he might 
have been exposed to the virus the hospital was dismissed as a 
defendant 
theyre going to have to review and analyze their procedures 
and their systems and i think they might well have to make many 
changes carroll saud after the award was announced 
james r gutglass attorney for the center said his client and 
its insuror would consider options in response to the verdict 
the center feels sympathetic for the family and saddened by 
what happened gutglass said 
earlier this month a jury in san francisco found a blood bank 
negligent for improperly screening its blood in the case of a 
5yearold boy who contracted aids through a transfusion the 
family was awarded 500000 in compensatory damages but nothing for 
pain and suffering 
the san francisco verdict was believed to be the first of its 
kind 
a denver jury in june cleared a blood bank of liability in the 
case of a woman who contracted aids through a transfusion a similar 
case in california in 1986 ended in a settlement before the trial 
ended 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring

presidentelect george bushs ability to 
control the 150 billion federal budget deficit and the trade 
deficit will have a lasting effect on his foreign policy a former 
secretary of state says 
economics and foreign policy are everincreasingly 
entertwined said cyrus vance who headed the state department 
under president carter 
vance one of five former secretaries of state here friday spoke 
at a news conference before they began taping a twohour television 
special to be aired by public broadcasting service stations jan 2 
vance said bush must deal strongly and effectively with the 
twin deficits the budget deficit and the trade deficit what he 
does in regard to that particular issue is going to have a major 
effect in the long run on our foreign policy 
the sixth annual report from the secretaries of state was 
sponsored by the atlantabased southern center for international 
studies and nashvilles david lipscomb university the former 
cabinet officials were invited here by gov ned mcwherter a trustee 
of the nonprofit educational organization 
the former secretaries said bush should continue president 
reagans policies toward russia but should not gear them to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
i think he may be gone in a couple of years vance said 
gorbachev acts as he does because he recognizes that the soviet 
economy is a mess and it has to be improved said henry kissinger 
secretary of state under presidents nixon and ford its a big 
mistake to gear our policies totally to one soviet personality 
vance agreed with kissinger that gorbachev faces an uphill battle 
in bringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fall 
from power if he fails 
william rogers also secretary of state under nixon said bush 
should continue the policies of the reagan administration i 
think the prospects for peace are very good but we have to remain 
strong militarily 
there was some disagreement with reagan 
kissinger opposed talks with iran regarding the lebanese 
hostage situation as the president suggested in a thursday news 
conference 
vance called refusal to admit yasser arafat into the country to 
address the united nations a serious mistake that will handicap bush 
policies 
kissinger said he was violently opposed to any talks on releasing 
hostages 
once you begin negotiating on the release of hostages you have 
indicated there is the price and the only thing left to negotiate is 
the price and therefore hostage taking has a reward kissinger 
said i know this sounds cruel i know this is tough on the 
families but i believe that devaluing hostages is the only way you 
can prevent hostages from being taken 
kissinger and edmund muskie who succeeded vance as secretary of 
state under carter predicted the hostages in lebanon will be 
released because it will be in irans interest to try to return 
relations with the united states to normal 
vance said secretary of state george shultzs decision not to 
grant arafat a visa to argue for a palestine state before the united 
nations was a serious mistake because it helped those who were 
opposed to progress in the middle east and it disadvantaged those 
who would like to see us get the peace process going ahead i think 
it makes it more difficult for the bush administration to act as an 
honest broker in the middle east

architect joseph esherick reluctantly 
stepped into the spotlight to accept his professions highest award 
the american insitute of architectures gold medal 
esherick 73 was named friday as the 47th recipient of the award 
but joining the ranks of architectural greats frank lloyd wright 
and im pei was a burden as well as an honor to the man who 
designed the cannery at fishermans wharf and the monterey bay 
aquarium 
theres a lot of explaining to do said esherick who was 
greeted by a 40footlong congratulatory banner signed by coworkers 
friday morning 
i dont mean that as false modesty or negativeness he 
continued i think what this represents is the aia recognizing 
somewhat more modest architecture less pretentious architecture 
that isnt attentiongrabbing 
esherick has designed more than 100 homes and everything from a 
ski resort in utah to several bay area rapid transit stations 
a building really ought to make peoples lives better he 
said friday it shouldnt get in the way of what theyre trying to 
do and it shouldnt dominate the scene 
youre not supposed to talk about spiritual things or beauty 
anymore but thats really what it comes down to he added 
in a statement aia 1989 president benjamin brewer jr called 
esherick an outstanding designer and a humanist whose 
overriding concern is to create wonderful places for people not 
extravagant statements 
the institutes selection of esherick is significant because it 
honors an unpretentious style of architecture said roger 
montgomery dean of the college of environmental design at the 
university of california at berkeley where esherick was a faculty 
member in architecture for 35 years 
esherick said his work has been influenced by traditions of the 
quaker religion which he learned about during his upbringing in 
philadelphia 
they do great things but they never force anything on 
anybody he said i think thats shaped very much my view of 
things

an executive of nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
was dismissed from his job in connection with a stock scandal that 
led to the resignation of the finance minister 
ei shikiba director of the telephone giants data communications 
department was relieved of his duties but will remain an executive 
director of the company with no specific responsibilities company 
president haruo yamaguchi said friday 
shikaba was dismissed for buying unlisted shares in recruit co 
the parent company of the recruitcosmos real estate company 
aides of more than a dozen influential politicians reportedly 
earned large profits by buying unlisted shares in recruitcosmos and 
then selling them after they were publicly listed in october 1986 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa resigned friday after making 
conflicting statements regarding the scandal 
he initially testified to a parliamentary committee investigating 
the scandal that a third party a friend of his former secretary 
purchased 10000 recruitcosmos shares and only borrowed the name of 
miyazawa 
he later admitted his exsecretary actually paid 30 million yen 
or about 246000 for the shares in september 1986 and sold them 
for 527 million yen or 431000 less than a month after they were 
listed 
miyazawa also insisted the stock purchase was not financed by a 
recruitlinked financial institution but refused to show bank 
documents to back up his argument 
ntt japans largest telephone company has been criticized for 
its close ties with recruit which reportedly include the leasing of 
large numbers of telephone circuits at reduced rates and the resale 
of two usmade supercomputers 
shikiba had previously admitted purchasing 5000 shares of 
recruitcosmos stock but did not notify the company of his 
acquisition of recruit shares news reports said 
opposition parties have demanded a full investigation into the

the death toll from israels deepest 
incursion inside lebanon in five years rose to 10 after a 
palestinian guerrilla died of his wounds police said today 
eight other guerrillas and an israeli officer were killed friday 
in nine hours of air sea and ground combat in hills overlooking the 
coastal town of naameh nine miles south of beirut 
three israeli soldiers were injured and 16 guerrillas were 
wounded including one who police said died during the night in a 
hospital 
lebanon requested an urgent meeting of the un security council 
to debate the attack which drew sharp condemnation from the united 
states and britain 
the israeli raid coincided with the first anniversary of the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip in which at least 320 palestinians and 11 israelis have been 
killed 
the target of the raid was a major base of the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command in the naameh bluffs 50 
miles north of the israeli border 
it was the first time the israeli army had come so close to the 
lebanese capital beirut since it evacuated the chouf mountains 
southeast of the city in 1983 ending a yearlong occupation 
israeli paratroopers were dropped from helicopters in to a ravine 
below an abandoned maronite catholic monastery and attacked the 
living quarters and training center of the guerrillas lebanese 
police said 
the israelis used dogs strapped with teargas canisters and 
explosives to flush out guerrillas from an underground network of 
tunnels popular front commander ahmed jibril told reporters 
one of his aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
palestinian fighters shot and killed five dogs 
several previous israeli air attacks this year have failed to 
eliminate the popular fronts naameh base 
the radical popular front which opposes palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat is armed by syria and 
bankrolled by libya 
during the fighting friday four israelis were cut off from the 
main landing force prompting the israeli command to mount a massive 
rescue operation 
waves of israeli fighterbombers thundered in on rocketing and 
strafing runs and naval gunboats shelled naamehs highlands until 
the four israelis were ferried out of lebanon at midmorning 
clinging to the struts of two helicopter gunships an israeli army 
officer said 
the israeli raid was the second biggest in terms of casualities 
this year at least 40 palestinian and proiranian shiite moslem 
guerrillas were killed when the israeli army mounted a threeday 
sweep in southeast lebanon in may 
in both attacks syrian troops stationed close to guerrilla bases 
did not intervene in the confrontations 
the syrians maintain about 40000 troops in north and east 
lebanon as well as beiruts moslem sector under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to control lebanons civil war now in its 14th year

lawyers for a man accused in the beating death of 
his illegally adopted 6yearold daughter say they will press ahead 
next week in asking the courts permission to pursue an insanity 
defense 
attorney ira london said friday that joel steinberg was 
delusional the night lisa steinberg was fatally injured 
london said steinberg thought lisa was staring at him because she 
was under the influence of a cult that hypnotized people and then 
used them for sex 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer raised lisa from birth but never 
formally adopted her 
a psychiatrist who twice examined steinberg has prepared an 
affidavit saying the murder defendant has a delusional disorder 
paranoid type and will testify to that in court london said 
he thought he was helping lisa not hurting her london said 
he thought he was saving her from the cult getting her out of her 
trance 
prosecution witness charles scannapieco said a few weeks ago that 
he saw steinberg slap lisa during an auto trip to albany he said 
steinberg explained that the child had gone into a trance and was 
staring and he was bringing her out of it 
london said that if steinberg is delusional then he cannot be 
guilty of depraved indifference in lisas death as prosecutors 
charge and the jury hearing the murder trial should be told this 
london said he will try to use testimony from lay witnesses to 
show steinberg is not criminally responsible if state judge harold 
rothwax rejects his request to present an insanity defense 
if were not permitted to present psychiatric evidence we can 
still present testimonial evidence from lay people to indicate 
that his conduct was not depraved but rather it was insane 
last week rothwax temporarily rejected the defense request to be 
allowed to present an insanity defense 
the judge said insanity pleas usually must come with in 30 days 
of a defendants plea to an indictment but he said he would allow 
the defense to apply again after the lawyers submitted papers 
explaining why the request is late and what new psychiatric evidence 
they have 
steinberg 47 denies that he hit the girl but hedda nussbaum 
steinbergs battered longtime livein companion has testified that 
he did 
lisa a firstgrader described as bright and outgoing was 
removed unconscious from steinbergs greenwich village apartment 
nov 2 1987 she died of head injuries three days later 
her death led to a reexamination of the duty and ability of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
london spoke about the insanity defense outside the courtroom 
after fridays court session was cancelled because two jurors were 
sick

a reporter six miles from the shattered soviet city 
of leninakan said today an earthquake has changed the landscape of 
the region which once was dotted with buildings and sparkled with 
city lights at night 
now looking at leninakan from the turkish border all you can 
see is a sort of hazy mist almost a cloud rising from the 
rubble and ruins of the town jane howard of the british 
broadcasting corp said in a radio broadcast 
ms howard said she went to the border after arriving friday at 
the northeast turkish town of kars 40 miles from leninakan one of 
the cities hit hardest in wednesdays killer earthquake about 
250000 people lived in leninakan the secondbiggest city in the 
armenian republic 
from the border you could actually look across and see the 
town ms howard said the earthquake really does seem to have 
changed the whole landscape of the area 
i was there when dusk fell and whereas last week you would have 
been able to see bright lights from street lights and security 
points along the border there was only a very faint glow there last 
night friday she said 
the one thing you can hear on the border is a sort of almost 
constant low rumble it is the drone of transport planes flying 
relief supplies in 
occasionally you hear a helicopter or see the light of a 
helicopter going in although most of the relief operation is being 
mounted from the armenian capital yerevan clearly they are 
mounting a huge 24hour operation over there the report said 
yerevan is about 60 miles southeast of leninakan 
ms howard said the temperature in the area has been below 
freezing but that there was no snow on the ground 
she said there was very little damage on the turkish side of the 
border

nobel laureate lech walesa of poland today praised 
reforms under way in the soviet union and told soviet dissident 
andrei sakharov the changes would be good for his country a walesa 
aide said 
the nobel peace prize winners met for the first time before 
ceremonies got under way marking the 40th anniversary of the 
universal declaration of human rights 
walesa spoke of the human rights problems in poland sakharov 
spoke of the human rights problems in the soviet union and walesa 
said he thinks perestroika is a good program for both countries 
bronislaw gemerek told reporters perestroika refers to soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs economic and social restructuring 
gemerek is traveling with walesa the leader of polands 
solidarity trade union movement he said the meeting lasted 45 
minutes 
the two men later met separately with premier michel rocard and 
then posed together with rocard 
to be simultaneously in the presence of walesa and sakharov 
means we are among the most courageous activists for human rights 
rocard said 
sakharov and walesa were among the dignitaries and activists who 
gathered in paris for ceremonies marking the 1948 global pledge to 
protect human rights president francois mitterrand and un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar were among the scheduled 
speakers 
the paris trip was the first time walesa has been allowed to 
leave poland since martial law was declared in 1981 he won the 
nobel peace prize in 1983 
sakharov who won the nobel peace prize in 1975 came to paris 
after a fourweek visit to the united states 
at a 90minute news conference at the soviet embassy on friday 
he called for more steps to reduce the size of the soviet military 
sakharov said one way to do this would be to limit the length of 
service for soviet draftees 
he said gorbachevs plans to cut the red army by 500000 troops 
or nearly 10 percent and withdraw thousands of tanks and troops 
from eastern europe is only a beginning 
sakharov said reductions in manpower and weapons can be done 
and will change in a major way the international situation 
gorbachev is going in this direction and this is very important i 
would have liked to see bigger cuts but what was done is important 
as developer of the soviet hydrogen bomb sakharov previously was 
barred from traveling abroad because the soviets said his scientific 
work gave him knowledge of state secrets 
he was also restricted to the closed city of gorky for seven 
years because of his outspoken opposition to soviet intervention in 
afghanistan 
but in 1986 gorbachev personally called him back to moscow 
since then sakharov has generally supported gorbachevs 
perestroika or political and economic restructuring while speaking 
out against some trends including the growing concentration of 
power in gorbachevs hands 
the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the un 
general assembly on dec 10 1948 is the basic document under which 
member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolish 
torture and slavery 
despite the declaration amnesty international alleges that 
torture is still practiced by about onethird of the worlds 
governments 
in paraguay police in the past three days detained about 30 
people including opposition leaders journalists and trade union 
members to prevent a march to mark todays anniversary the march 
planned in asuncion was declared illegal last week by the 
government of strongman president gen alfredo stroessner 
the president of cyprus george vassiliou meanwhile sent an 
anniversary message to the un chief appealing for help in 
restoring human rights which he said have been violated in his 
country for years 
this years anniversary is of particular significance to the 
people of cyprus whose human rights and fundamental freedoms have 
for many years been massively and ruthlessly violated the message 
said referring to the 14year turkish occupation of the north of 
the mediterranean island nation

the federal budget deficit may be the no 
1 problem facing the 101st congress but no easy answers were 
offered at the opening of this weekends symposium for 27 newly 
elected members of congress at harvard 
the problem is one we are going to be dealing with and i think 
not just in the next two years alice m rivlin founding director 
of the congressional budget office told the legislatorselect friday 
the budget deficit is going to dominate thinking about 
fiscal policies for the foreseeable future and i expect for much of 
your congressional careers which i hope are long ones she said 
rivlin now a senior fellow in economic studies at the brookings 
institution in washington briefed the new legislators for more than 
an hour on the budget shortfall and assorted theories on correcting 
it in the only public session planned during a fiveday series of 
seminars 
the program at harvards john f kennedy school of government is 
cosponsored by the house administration committee it has been held 
every two years since 1972 as part of the orientation for new 
members of congress 
the budget deficit which in the fiscal year ending sept 30 was 
1551 billion is the no 1 topic we discussed throughout our 
campaign and the one issue most on constituents minds newly 
elected georgia democrat ben lewis jones said 
to deal with it we are going to have to make some tough 
choices and they georgia voters sent me here to make those tough 
choices jones said 
but as democratic repelect richard neal of massachusetts said 
it is very easy to define the problems but its very difficult to 
provide solutions 
rivlin noted that the deficit has been shrinking and with good 
luck in the economy the budget deficit will come down a little bit 
more and that is progress 
but she said a large part of the reason for that progress is that 
surpluses in the social security system are being used to pay for 
current expenses of government and to offset the large deficit of 
the rest of the federal budget 
saying the money might be better used to buy back government debt 
and prepare for the large numbers of retirees who will be making 
claims on social security in the years ahead she said its 
important to be clear things are worse than they seem 
my own view rivlin said is that youve got to reach for 
some more revenue 
on a shortterm basis she suggested increases in excise taxes 
for such things as gasoline reducing medicare benefits and taxing 
social security 
newly elected mississippi democrat paul michael parker said that 
unlike the european community the united states is always looking 
for shortterm solutions we lack that longterm planning 
yet when rivlin offered longterm proposals to ease the deficit 
several new representatives bristled 
rivlin said congress could consider a broadbased valueadded 
tax such as a national sales tax and getting rid of some of the 
major functions of the federal government and turning them over to 
the states such as housing and education programs 
the legislatorselect challenged the sales tax idea as 
regressive or tending to hurt the poor and said putting more 
demands on the states would be unbearable for local governments

struggled to save men women and children buried in the rubble of an 
earthquake that officials say killed at least 40000 people

still be alive said bishop tiran durakyan of the armenian church in 
moscow 
firefighters said they pulled about 80 people out of the rubble 
in leninakan armenias secondlargest city 
in these conditions delaying by each hour means an additional

to the report 
the hardesthit cities were leninakan krovakan stepanavan and

the united nations chief today accepted the 
nobel peace prize on behalf of un peacekeeping troops but warned 
that their mission is threatened because the united states and other 
nations dont pay their dues 
peacekeeping uses soldiers as servants of peace rather than as 
the instruments of war it introduces to the military sphere the 
principle of nonviolence un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said 
his hands appeared to shake with emotion as he received the gold 
medal and prize certificate from egil aarvik chairman of the nobel 
committee aarvik noted that it was the first time in the prizes 
87year history it was awarded to military forces 
perez de cuellar said 733 men have been killed since un 
peacekeeping operations began in 1948 in all about 500000 
soldiers from 58 countries have served in the forces and 10000 are 
now on duty 
one of them us marine lt col william higgins is held 
hostage in lebanon the un leader noted and he appealed for 
higgins release 
never before in history have military forces been employed 
internationally not to wage war not to establish domination and not 
to serve the interests of any power or group of powers but rather 
to prevent conflict between peoples perez de cuellar said 
there is a new mood of understanding and common sense said 
perez de cuellar who was accompanied by an honor guard of the 
bluebereted peacekeeping soldiers 
the un chief cited progress on un efforts to end the 
iraniraq war and conflicts in afghanistan the western sahara 
southern africa and elsewhere 
on friday perez de cuellar accepted the monetary portion of the 
award 416000 a fraction of the 450 million in dues owed by 
un members 
i dont know how were going to cope financially he said 
in some ways its embarrassing because it forces me to say 
publicly that the united states still owes the united nations almost 
350 million 
the united states has withheld dues in recent years to protest 
what the reagan administration saw as mismanagement overstaffing 
and antiwestern bias at the 159member body president reagan said 
in september the united states would gradually repay all its dues 
asked when the un would pay its own peacekeeping force bills to 
norway denmark britain canada and other countries that provide 
troops perez de cuellar said they are all understanding they 
think we are honest people but unfortunately not everyone is 
honest with us 
in a report this week perez de cuellar predicted the world body 
would end next year with a loss of 246 million only 79 members 
had paid all their dues by nov 30 the report said 
he said friday that the soviet union owed about 100 million but 
he praised the soviets for setting a payment schedule and sticking 
to it 
the nobel check is usually presented after the medal ceremony 
but perez de cuellar had to fly immediately to paris after the 
ceremony for the 40th anniversary of the un human rights 
convention 
the medal ceremony is always held on the anniversary of the dec 
10 death of swedish philanthropist alfred nobel the inventor of 
dynamite

president corazon aquino vowed today 
to punish human rights violators in the military saying soldiers 
who abuse prisoners are also capable of plotting coups against her 
but mrs aquino in a human rights day speech blamed most abuses 
in the philippines on communist rebels and dared critics to prove 
charges that her government pays only lip service to human rights 
mrs aquino acknowledged sporadic violations of human rights 
by soldiers and said that although the government does not condone 
such abuses they are likely to continue because of the 19year 
communist insurgency 
yet i will not accept the heat of battle as an excuse for 
brutality toward the people we are pledged to protect and even 
toward our enemies mrs aquino said democracy needs force but 
this government will not stoop to terrorism to survive 
mrs aquino who has survived six reported coup attempts since 
she came to power in 1986 said she had every reason to punish human 
rights violators in the military because the hand that can abuse a 
prisoner will have the mind to plot a coup detat 
as the president spoke about 1500 students demonstrated in a 
downtown manila square denouncing human rights abuses which they 
blamed on the usaquino regime the rally ended peacefully 
this new government has never adopted by neglect or design a 
policy or pattern of human rights violations for any purpose mrs 
aquino said 
that violations will continue is inevitable in a country driven 
by a rebellion led by fanatics she said referring to the 
25000strong communist new peoples army which has fought since 
1969 to set up a marxist state 
if there is a conscious policy of terrorism in this country 
you will find it among them she added citing killings of police 
and soldiers by urban guerrillas executions of rebels planning to 
surrender and extortion of money from people in the countryside 
mrs aquino said she has ordered the military to step up its 
counterinsurgency to shorten the agony of her country 
the governments commission on human rights said it has received 
reports of 951 cases of human rights violations since june 1986 of 
which 578 were allegedly committed by rebels 303 by anticommunist 
vigilantes and 70 by soldiers most of the cases filed against the 
rebels were for insurgencyrelated killings 
a few hours before mrs aquinos speech a sixmember delegation 
representing various foreign human rights groups reported the 
results of a 10day factfinding tour of the philippines 
laurie wiseberg leader of the group composed of a canadian 
three australians and two americans said they received reports that 
human rights abuses have increased since a 60day ceasefire between 
the government and communist rebels collapsed in february 1987 
on friday mrs aquino ordered the justice department to 
investigate reported disappearances of human rights activists 
trade union and social activist organizations have complained 
that mrs aquino has failed to live up to a promise she made when 
she took power in 1986 to end human rights violations 
on tuesday human rights watch a new yorkbased civil liberties 
group said the philippines leads the world in the number of 
documented cases of violence against human rights workers 
the organization said 30 human rights workers worldwide were 
slain last year nine of them in the philippines

of international isolation and the bankruptcy of their occupation 
policy 
but my loved ones you must be on alert as they undoubtedly 
will resort to escalating the criminal oppressive measures of their 
socalled iron fist policy as well as the aggression against our 
refugee camps 
as we near victory the plo chief said we must realize 
that the most ferocious and bloody confrontations occur in the last 
quarter of an hour before peace 
arafat has often said that sustaining the intefadeh or uprising 
would eventually force israel and the united states to deal with the 
plo and endorse the palestinian quest for an independent state 
since the palestinian uprising began on dec 8 1987 322 
palestinians and 11 israelis have been killed 
in his speech arafat made no reference to his latest peace 
overtures including recent statements that some have interpreted as 
explicit recognition of israels right to exist 
he spoke only of the nov 15 declaration in algiers by the 
palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
proclaiming an independent palestinian state in the west bank and 
gaza and calling for a twostate solution that divides 
britishmandate palestine into jewish and arab states 
the united states has refused to deal directly with the plo until 
it recognized israel and renounced terrorism the united states and 
israel have said recent plo statements are insufficient 
what we aspire is palestinian peace not an israeli or american 
peace arafat said 
we want peace that guarantees our legitimate political rights 
foremost of which our right to return to selfdetermination and to 
our independent state with jerusalem as its capital 
the message signed your brother abu ammar arafats nom de 
guerre ended with a verse from the koran islams holy book that 
says patience leads to victory over the infidels 
in another development today a planned march in honor of the 
uprising at the university of jordan in amman turned into a 
stonethrowing brawl between palestinian and jordanian nationalists 
at least one person was injured officials said

the stabbing deaths of two american 
women whose bodies were found on a solitary beach shocked the 7000 
residents of this tiny picturepostcard island in the eastern 
caribbean 
they cant recall anything like it and even the police chief 
isnt sure when the british colony last had a murder 
we are so distressed here in anguilla said clive smith 43 
a construction worker and member of the anguilla assembly who found 
the bodies on nov 29 while taking a morning stroll 
we are not accustomed to this kind of violence and it happened 
just as tourism was booming he said 
susan galvin 39 and martha marie alsup 38 both 
psychotherapists from watertown mass were killed while exploring 
the island in a rented jeep their bodies clad in swimming suits 
were found in the desolate and rugged eastern tip of the island an 
area called windward point bay 
hardly anyone ever goes there because it is rocky and violent 
crashing waves make it impossible to swim 
when im not too busy i like to stroll there because it is 
empty and i feel closer to god said smith 
police say if it hadnt been for his walk the womens bodies 
might have not been found because the strong waves could have washed 
them off 
andy otto a 17yearold local boy who was arrested the day the 
women were found was charged wednesday with murder and robbery 
if convicted he faces a maximum penalty of death by hanging 
because police said he would be tried as an adult 
our investigation revealed the two women died from unnatural 
causes which led to the charges of murder and robbery police 
commissioner harold payne said he said the women were probably 
killed with a sharp instrument probably a knife 
although payne said the womens jewelry was not stolen robbery 
was suspected because there was some money involved payne would 
not elaborate 
the women arrived in the secluded island the weekend of nov 26 
about three days before their bodies were found 
ms alsup the daughter of the late illinois congressman john 
alsup and ms galvin originally from columbus ohio lived 
together in a watertown house they bought seven years ago they had 
separate practices 
the incident has sent shockwaves throughout the local community 
where a murder has not occurred in a number of years wrote the 
islands weekly newspaper vantage 
payne who has been commissioner since 1976 isnt even certain 
when anguilla last had a murder i think we had a crime of passion 
five years ago he said 
two scotland yard detectives helped in the investigation because 
local police lacked experience 
the 16milelong island was named anguilla after an eel because 
columbus thought it was shaped like one when he discovered it in 
1500 it has more than 30 unspoiled white sandy beaches bordering 
the aquamarine coastline of the caribbean sea and atlantic ocean 
this year anguilla had a tourism increase of 29 percent more 
than any other caribbean island besides aruba and officials hope 
the killings dont scare off future tourists 
anguilla is a tranquil peaceful island we dont want 
potential visitors to think this is a violent country because it 
isnt here theres no need to lock your car or even your house 
said julian harrigan the home affairs and tourism commissioner 
connell harrigan owner of the 14room beachfront bay shore 
resort where the two women were staying fears that will change 
i used to tell my guests anguilla was so safe they could sleep 
on the beach i cant do that anymore said harrigan

stealing an evergreen tree from city 
property to use as a christmas tree could cost a person a lot of 
friends the trees have been sprayed with a smelly brew of fox urine 
and skunk scent 
last year was the first year we did this and we didnt lose 
any trees said park foreman larry pruegner were hoping that 
it would be successful this year if we save even one tree then 
weve more than done our job 
westminster used to lose 15 to 20 of its colorado blue spruces 
and pines a year to people who helped themselves replacing a tree 
cost between 120 to 160 plus the cost of planting 
but last year parks director jerry royther heard about the 
university of nebraska using fox urine to prevent thieves from 
cutting down the trees on campus and he asked the staff to look 
into it 
i thought it was hilarious pruegner said but when you 
think about it it may not seem as funny as it sounds 
he said he decided to add the skunk scent on the advice of rocky 
mountain enterprises in fort collins which sells it to trappers 
they told me if you really want to make the concoction right 
put this in its pretty rank too he said 
its so rank he warned his staff you need very good rubber 
gloves to prevent the stuff from getting on your hands and be 
especially attentive to how the wind is blowing

us ambassador edward perkins 
condemned south africas human rights record saturday and two us 
senators warned of tougher sanctions after a deeply 
disappointing meeting with the president 
perkins the first black us ambassador to south africa said in 
a human rights day speech that security laws are being used in an 
ever more political manner he described the policy of detention 
without trial as one of the worst kinds of human rights abuse 
the other featured speaker at the johannesburg meeting was the 
rev frank chikane a former detainee who is generalsecretary of 
the south african council of churches perkins has had extensive 
contacts with black opposition leaders during two years in south 
africa but rarely has he shared a podium at a major public event 
with a militant activist such as chikane 
in cape town sens sam nunn dga and david boren dokla 
told a news conference they were pessimistic about south africa 
after completing a oneweek factfinding trip they met numerous 
government and opposition leaders 
the senators both influential committee chairmen said president 
pw botha bluntly rejected their request to meet with imprisoned 
african national congress leader nelson mandela one of the top 
priorities of their trip 
he botha gave a very rapid answer no youre not we 
repeated the question and got the same answer boren said 
boren chairman of the senate intelligence committee described 
tuesdays meeting with botha as the deepest disappointment of 
the trip 
we came as centrists as constructive people hoping to talk to 
the state president about the future of the country boren said 
the state president deeply disappointed us by wanting to talk 
only about the past not trying to engage and assess and share ideas 
about the future 
if bothas attitude was seen in washington as representative of 
government views intensified economic sanctions were likely boren 
said 
the senators in a prepared statement said bothas government 
had taken some positive steps including tentative approval of an 
accord to bring independence to namibia and release of some 
political prisoners 
in all candor however we must say that the pessimism which we 
feel comes from the alarming direction currently being taken by the 
government the statement said 
it cited the recent treason convictions of four antiapartheid 
leaders after a threeyear trial and intensifying restrictions on 
opposition activity 
if those who are working for real change are foreclosed from 
using nonviolent political methods it is our great fear that they 
will be forced to turn to methods that will undoubtedly lead to 
violence and tragedy the senators said 
perkins last week attended the final session of the treason 
trial in which four activists received prison sentences ranging 
from 6 to 12 years 
court decisions which convict genuine nonviolent community 
leaders of treason and terrorism cannot be expected to command 
respect he said 
one of the activists whom the senators met was albertina sisulu 
wife of jailed anc leader walter sisulu she is not allowed to make 
public statements or engage in political activity 
to be free means you can speak your mind and your conscience 
said boren it is unbelievable to me having met people like mrs 
sisulu how any kind of government keeps a person under those 
conditions 
nunn chairman of the senate armed forces committee said he 
would support tougher us sanctions if a vote were taken now but 
he added that in respect to forcing change in south africa you 
cant say sanctions have succeeded 
chikane speaking after perkins at a johannesburg church read a 
letter which he said was sent covertly by black detainees it said 
the government was conducting a concerted campaign of 
disinformation to convince western leaders that reform was 
occurring 
president reagan and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
continue to buy our repression at the cheapest rate of exchange 
and we hold them equally liable for our deteriorating conditions 
the letter said 
human rights day marks the 40th anniversary of the united 
nations adoption of the universal declaration of human rights 
south africa abstained rather than support the document

protesters were seen with blood pouring from head wounds and other 
injuries protesters and officers caught by the other side were 
brutally beaten 
protesters demanded the fall of roh and the arrest of former 
president chun doohwan for human rights abuses and corruption under 
his authoritarian rule dissident leaders announced at a rally at 
myongdong cathedral the formation of a new radical alliance to try 
and topple roh

riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets blocked 
marchers with shields as they tried to march from the cathedral to 
the presidential palace students with iron clubs attacked police 
but were driven off with tear gas grenades 
hundreds of protesters then regrouped several blocks away in a 
shopping district students attacked riot police with firebombs and 
paving stones they ripped out of the sidewalks a small group of 
police was surrounded and beaten to the ground by screaming 
protesters 
charging riot police swept protesters away several times but 
students repeatedly surged out of sidestreets to resume fighting 
hundreds of people were trapped in vehicles as the fighting swirled 
around them and police hurled tear gas grenades into subway stations 
the protest in freezing temperatures was smaller than three major 
violent protests in seoul last month to demand chuns arrest 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went into rural exile last month after apologizing to the 
nation several of chuns relatives and associates have been 
convicted or charged with corruption 
roh another former general asked the nation to forgive chun and 
installed a new cabinet nov 28 as part of efforts to defuse the 
furor roh is trying to distance his own administration from his 
former ally 
a small group of buddhist monks and students clashed saturday 
with riot police at the buddhist temple on the east coast where chun 
is staying in seclusion six people were injured in the clash 
dissident leaders announced at the rally the formation of a new 
alliance to seek chuns arrest and the overthrow of roh speakers 
said chun could not be brought to justice without toppling the roh 
government 
we declare that it will be possible to clarify the whole truth 
of the past misdeeds and punish those responsible only when chun and 
roh are brought to testify before investigators said a 
declaration by the alliance 
the radicals and dissidents do not have wide public support but 
many south koreans are angry over the handling of the chun issue and 
want action of some kind 
opposition leaders saturday accused roh of delaying action 
against chun and repeated demands that the former president 
cooperate with the national assembly probe of misdeeds under his 
government chun stepped down in february

things no one would know if the national 
archives didnt release a new batch of papers from richard nixons 
white house once in a while 
that ronald reagan once considered carla hills presidentelect 
bushs choice to be us trade representative too liberal for a 
senior federal post that cia director richard helms made points 
with his boss by sending complimentary little notes such as one 
critiquing a televised speech as most impressive in the best 
presidential tradition j edgar hoover did too 
that among the americans who praised nixon for his saturday night 
massacre of officials during the unraveling watergate scandal were 
hotel magnate j willard marriott and former milwaukee braves 
baseball manager fred haney that henry kissinger stiffed a cabinet 
member who wanted help in getting his son a visa for china 
and that a fifth grader got nixons attention with his profiles 
of former presidents like martian v buran 
these and other tidbits were gleaned from a comparatively modest

nixons mail was full of laudatory notes from officials who owed 
their jobs to him 
one was richard helms who was trying to hang onto his job as 
head of the cia he often wrote the president after public 
appearances and once sent him a package of peaches in one of his 
notes helms wrote 
without i hope being thought presumptuous may i say how 
effective i found your appearance on television last evening you 
were persuasive and constructive and it came over as a most 
impressive performance in the best presidential tradition it gave 
even me a big lift 
after a nixon speech on drugs helms promised that his agents 
would bust their buttons to improve intelligence collection on the 
drug traffic 
helms efforts didnt work at the end of his first term in 1972 
nixon replaced helms and made him ambassador to iran

from john ehrlichman the no 2 aide in the white house to 
rogers cb morton secretary of the interior memo dated feb 21 
1972 
it has been brought to the attention of the white house that 
the statue in front of the justice department on constitution avenue 
is actually that of nathan hale who as you know was executed by 
the british on 22 september 1776 
it occurred to ehrlichman that hale had no connection with the 
justice department and as more of a spook than gumshoe he would be 
more at home at the cia 
the agency operations division point out that a clandestine 
removal is entirely feasible and is now temporarily planned for the 
dark of the moon during the month of march ehrlichman wrote 
workmen will be disguised as paperboys department of commerce 
secretaries headed home after working overtime gsa trash removal 
men and tourists the actual removal is planned via a threeton 
truck disguised as a wholesale bread delivery van 
ehrlichman said he had been empowered to let morton in on this to 
ensure that mortons park police will not fire upon the agency 
workmen during this operation it is felt best if clandestine 
support is given to this operation by causing blank rounds to be 
issued to all park police 
there is no evidence of a reply from morton in the nixon files 
nathan hale still stands outside the justice department maybe 
morton got the joke

the fbi has confirmed that product tampering 
was to blame for the poisoning of three people who drank from 
bottles of cocacola laced with a deadly and outlawed rat killer 
officials said 
we know now we are not looking at an accident we are looking 
at a deliberate act polk county sheriffs spokesman steve hulsey 
said friday 
one person was in critical condition and on life support 
equipment 
officials would not discuss any possible motive in the case and 
said investigators have no suspects 
chemical tests revealed traces of thallium sulfate a rat poison 
and toxic insecticide banned for general use in 1965 in five 
bottles from which three members of one family drank on oct 31 
the 16ounce bottles were part of an eightpack found at the home 
of peggy carr 
tests performed by the fbi on the three unopened bottles also 
showed traces of the toxic chemical hulsey said 
deputies said the fbi examination showed the crimped metal caps 
on the three bottles had been removed and placed back on the 
bottles authorities earlier ruled out any tampering at the bottling 
plant 
based on the amount of thallium found in the residue in the empty 
bottles dr michael wilder state epidemiologist estimated each 
bottle contained about half a gram of thallium he said a gram of 
thallium generally is considered a fatal dose

george bush is proceeding cautiously in his 
early dealings with mikhail s gorbachev but republican senators 
say the soviet leaders troop reduction announcement is putting 
pressure on the presidentelect to make a quick counterproposal 
six weeks from taking power bush already faces the problem of 
how to respond to gorbachevs dramatic declaration that he will 
slash soviet military strength by 500000 men and 10000 tanks in 
east germany czechoslovakia and hungary 
gorbachevs move probably will intensify pressure in congress for 
deeper cuts in the pentagon budget and spark demands for reductions 
in american troops in europe 
for the moment bush has put the matter on the back burner 
telling gorbachev he needs more time he understood that said 
bush who still has to assemble members of his national security 
team and develop priorities and strategy for his administration 
while applauding the cutback plan bush said it does not compel 
the united states to do anything because it was a unilateral move 
by the kremlin 
even with the announced reductions bush said the soviets still 
will have a big advantage in battle tanks artillery and other 
conventional arms 
yet republicans say bush cannot let the soviet offer go 
unanswered 
its going to heighten expectations for further progress in 
arms negotiations said sen john mccain rariz its important 
the bush adminstration come forward with a counterproposal at the 
earliest opportunity 
sen william cohen rmaine said theres no doubt this will 
accelerate the need for bush to put his team together to formulate 
strategy it came at a time when president reagan is not in a 
position to make any concessions and presidentelect bush is not in 
a position to make any agreements 
it gives gorbachev about sixeight weeks of pretty highflying 
propaganda cohen said 
mccain and cohen stressed that any counterproposal must address 
the soviet edge in conventional forces and not allow them to expand 
their advantage 
along with president reagan bush spent two hours with gorbachev 
at a luncheon wednesday on governors island in new york harbor 
officials described the meeting as a warm encounter where neither 
side pressed very hard on substantive issues 
throughout the year bush has appeared more skeptical than reagan 
about the kremlins intentions and gorbachevs reforms saying at 
one point that the cold war is not over bush took a different tack 
last week warmly praising the communist leader 
there is no question that mr gorbachev is a very different 
individual from his predecessors bush said after the meeting 
he is a warm human being and people see that he is committed to 
change 
later in the week reagan said gorbachev has never shown any 
reason to be mistrusted and indeed has guided the kremlin away 
from its old goal of a oneworld communist state 
hardline conservatives say reagan is acting starryeyed about 
gorbachev and predict bush will be tougher 
reagan has bought the naive point of view that somehow mr 
gorbachev and he can make world peace together when it is the system 
we are confronting not some particular individual and gorbachev 
could be gone tomorrow said paul weyrich president of the free 
congress foundation 
departing the white house after a meeting between reagan and 
conservative hardliners weyrich said i dont think mr bush has 
any such illusions i have found him much more realistic than 
president reagan

fundamentalists at odds over how to 
implement islamic law clashed among themselves and attacked police 
this week killing one officer and leaving about 100 people injured 
official sources said today 
tension remained high among students belonging to the extremist 
moslem group known as gamaat islamiya and the moderate brotherhood 
who fought wednesday and thursday with knives chains and sticks 
said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
in the ein shams district of cairo on thursday and friday 
extremists attacked the police station with stones and flaming 
objects and 50 of them were taken into custody the sources said 
police said today they mounted a nationwide search for an 
extremist suspected in the stabbing death of police lt col essam 
shams on thursday in ein shams 
the interior ministry identified the assailant as sherif mohammed 
sherif 27 a clerk at a cairo high school who belongs to the 
underground group known as jihad the government has blamed jihad 
for the assassination of president anwar sadat on oct 6 1981 and 
a failed coup attempt two days later organized from assiut 
since the clashes security forces swept the ein shams district 
of cairo and detained more than 130 extremists said the security 
sources in the capital 
the clashes started at the university in assiut 237 miles south 
of cairo which for years has been a center of moslem extremist 
activity 
followers of brotherhood and gamaat have been feuding for months 
over religious differences such as which side should be allowed to 
deliver sermons in the mosques 
both moderates and extremists support implementation of sharia 
the islamic legal and ethical code that was introduced about 14 
centuries ago in the moslem holy book the koran 
extremists advocate using violence if necessary in support of 
the moslem laws while the brotherhood says it is in favor of 
peaceful action the government contends more than 90 percent of 
egyptian laws already conform to the laws of islam

president reagan got a clean bill of health 
from his physicians today who reported that lab tests of tissue 
taken from his colon show him to be free of cancer the white house 
said 
the tissue removed friday afternoon from president reagans 
colon for biopsy is benign said a statement issued by 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater no further examinations 
or tests are required the president is in excellent health 
the statement added that the small amount of tissue taken from 
the president was a benign adenomatous polyp a type of growth 
that is often found in men the presidents age 
on friday first lady nancy reagan was told her latest breast 
xray showed no evidence of cancer of any kind 
the couple both of whom have battled cancer while in the white 
house spent more than four hours friday at bethesda naval hospital 
for annual physicals and cancer checkups 
departing the hospital for the a weekend at camp david the 
president and his wife both smiled and gave thumbsup signs 
reagan sported a pair of blue running shoes for tests that required 
him to walk a treadmill he called out clean bill of health to 
reporters as he left the hospital 
col john hutton the presidents physician said doctors removed 
a small piece of tissue from reagans colon and that it 
appeared to be benign or noncancerous 
the tissue which was to be tested over the weekend resembled 
a small adenomatous polyp and was removed because it was 
suspicious hutton said 
there are several kinds of benign growths that can occur in the 
colon and they generally are divided into two types hyperplastic 
or adenomatous polyps hyperplastic polyps usually are not thought 
to be associated with cancers elsewhere in the colon while 
adenomatous polyps are a signal to be on guard for future growths 
reagans doctors have told him that he will need periodic colon 
tests for the remainder of his life 
hutton declared reagan to be in excellent health in 
remarkable physical condition 
the president has had polyps removed from his intestine in four 
of five colonoscopic exams he has had since a twoinch cancerous 
lesion was removed from his colon in july 1985 
the relatively small polyps such as those taken in the past from 
reagan tend to occur more frequently as people grow older the 
growths generally cause no serious symptoms but if left alone can 
become cancerous 
the colonoscopy was performed without sedation of any kind 
hutton said in a statement the examination involves the use of a 
long flexible scope that is inserted into the bowel if a polyp is 
found the physician can use a tiny wire loop at the end of the 
scope to snare the growth and clip it off the wound is sealed with 
an electrical current that runs through the instrument 
the statement added that the presidents chest xray was clear 
that his urine sample was normal and that there was no clinically 
significant change in his pulmonary condition 
the stress test and electrocardiogram showed the presidents 
cardiovascular system is unchanged and normal it said 
reagans catscan the computerized threedimensional xray of 
his internal organs showed no internal abdominal abnormalities the 
test checks against the spread of cancer to other vital organs in 
that region of the body such as the stomach or liver 
mrs reagan 67 had her second breast xray or mammogram since 
her cancerous left breast was removed in october 1987 hutton said 
the exam showed no evidence of cancer of any kind physical 
examination showed her condition was normal 
earlier friday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
reagan has received a positive report from his dermatologists who 
examined him at the white house on thursday and pronounced him free 
of any new skin cancers 
reagan had skin cancers removed from his face in august 1985 and 
july 1987

the promise that star wars research will spin 
off beneficial civilian technology appears largely illusory and 
continued heavy spending on the spacebased missile defense system 
could damage americas economic wellbeing a private study 
concludes 
the military goals of president reagans strategic defense 
initiative are so fixed that the plan is unlikely to produce 
significant commercial spinoffs despite a huge investment of us 
resources says a report by the council on economic priorities 
proponents of the reagan administrations sdi are positioning 
the program not only as a technological fix for the arms race but 
an economic cureall as well a 21st century industrial 
revolution that will put america securely ahead of its economic 
competitors says the report 
it said a oneyear council study finds that whatever commercial 
spinoffs result from sdi they are unlikely to be substantial in 
relation to the cost of the program 
and while the united states pursues technology development 
indirectly through sdi the europeans and japanese pursue it 
directly through sophisticated governmentindustry ventures 
presidentelect george bushs campaign promise to continue 
funding for sdi research and development bodes ill for the nations 
shaky competitive position in the world economy 
the defense department in a written response dismissed the new 
council study as fundamentally flawed and said the pentagon had 
never sought to justify star wars research with the promise of 
substantial commercial spinoffs 
the reagan administration is spending 41 billion during the 
coming year on star wars a research effort aimed at developing 
lasers and other exotic weapons that could be used automatically to 
shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the united states or its allies 
the council on economic priorities based in new york describes 
itself as public interest research organization specializing in 
studies of national security issues the environment and corporate 
social responsibility it has conducted numerous studies involving 
star wars over the past several years almost all of them critical 
the councils latest study concludes that between fiscal 1983 and 
fiscal 1989 sdi took up 22 percent of the increase in federally 
funded research and development 11 percent of national research and 
development and 26 percent of defense department research and 
development 
there is no doubt that the massive infusion of research and 
development funds for sdi will lead to some civilian spinoffs the 
report said 
the key question is not whether sdi will produce spinoffs but 
rather how costeffective these spinoffs will be 
the council said star wars is unlikely to produce many commercial 
innovations because of an emphasis on hardware development instead 
of basic research and reliance on a few large defense contractors 
instead of costconscious entrepreneurs 
the report said scientists working on star wars probably would be 
reluctant to transfer technology to the civilian sector because 
their careers depend on the defense sector 
indeed it said star wars research could cause a brain drain 
of topflight researchers from work on civilian goods and services 
the pentagon statement said star wars already had produced some 
commercial innovations but these benefits were a byproduct and not 
the primary reason for the program

the government is under mounting pressure 
from its people political parties army and western aid donors to 
end a debilitating civil war and to begin fighting the famine and 
economic ruin it has caused 
hesitant steps toward peace have been taken mainly a provisional 
peace pact signed nov 16 by the rebels and the democratic unionist 
party the junior partner in prime minister sadek elmahdis 
governing coalition 
but critics accuse elmahdi of dragging his feet in a ploy to 
ensure the democratic unionists cannot claim credit for restoring 
peace 
the provisional pact relaxed tensions to the point where the red 
cross and the united nations were able to begin emergency airlifts 
dec 4 with guarantees from both sides that planes would not be 
fired on 
the planes are taking food and medicine to hundreds of thousands 
of victims of warinduced famine blamed by un officials for more 
than 500000 deaths this year 
thousands of people died during the long months of 
negotiations said pierre pont khartoum representative of the 
international committee of the red cross i think both sides 
finally decided it was politically futile to continue to stop and 
impede the relief 
elmahdi has been getting a lot of political heat in the three 
weeks since john garang head of the rebel sudan peoples liberation 
army signed the agreement that among other things calls for an 
immediate ceasefire 
the prime ministers umma party gave its support to the plan but 
elmahdi has not presented it for cabinet consideration the 
thirdlargest party the fundamentalist national islamic front 
strongly objects to a key provision freezing implementation of 
harsh punishments under sudans islamic law and stopping discussions 
about a replacement penal code 
the islamic party would be certain to leave the coalition if the 
umma and democratic unionists joined with southern ministers to 
approve the plan that most likely would bring down the government 
once again elmahdi may be pursuing incompatible 
objectives said one western diplomat peace is clearly a 
popular demand and the islamic front is the only group critical 
of peace 
garang began his civil rebellion in early 1983 to press demands 
for what he considers fairer economic political and administrative 
treatment for southern sudan 
most people in the region are ethnic african christians or 
animists but the national government is dominated by arabdescended 
moslems garang has vowed not to stop fighting until islamic law 
decreed several months after he took up arms is abrogated 
diplomats say guns generally have fallen silent since the nov 16 
pact even though the agreement is not being implemented officially 
the prospect of peace is a hugely popular idea for the common 
sudanese 
the government was spending 1 million a day before the de facto 
ceasefire took effect a drain that ruined an already shaky 
economy the sudanese feel the drain daily in shortages of food and 
basic supplies soaring prices and frequent shutdowns of public 
utilities 
thousands turned out to greet the democratic unionists spiritual 
leader mohammed osman almirghani when he returned from ethiopia 
after negotiating the agreement 
last week the union of sudanese writers organized a peace 
night in khartoum at which almirghani and others spoke 
on a different level the united states and other aid donors are 
applying political pressure on elmahdis government 
at a meeting of western donors last month to discuss financing a 
407million plan to help sudan recover from major floods in august 
the united states essentially told khartoum to make peace first 
and urged other donors to take the same position 
reconstruction of the country while a ruinous civil war 
prevails is unimaginable said john koehring khartoum chief of 
the us agency for international development and washingtons 
representative at the meeting for this reason the us 
government is not in a position to pledge new assistance to the 
reconstruction effort 
the donors ended up promising sudan 300 million 
one diplomat from a donor country estimated that 90 percent of 
sudans people most political parties and the army clearly want to 
see the preliminary agreement end in a real ceasefire and peace 
talks 
the army has manifested its support in several ways 
defense minister abdulmaguid hamed khalil strongly endorsed the 
agreement on behalf of the military and the army was reported to 
have devised a plan for implementing the ceasefire once it is 
declared officially khalil is tapped to join foreign minister 
hussein suleiman abusalih as cohead of the negotiating committee 
which was to have flown to addis ababa on wednesday 
the delegation didnt go there were reports that garangs people 
had signaled khartoum that its negotiators were not welcome if they 
came without cabinet endorsement of the peace plan

secretary of education lauro f cavazos appears 
to be bracing for criticism over cuts in school support when 
president reagan presents congress with his final budget next month 
cavazos who promised at his confirmation hearing to fight for 
the best funding possible now says only i did the best i 
could in arguing for education money 
he did not disclose any figures for his department but office of 
management and budget officials have said they cut 35 billion 
across the government to hold the deficit to 100 billion in 
reagans lameduck blueprint for fiscal year 1990 
cavazos the junior member of reagans cabinet and one of the 
holdovers who will serve in presidentelect bushs cabinet was 
asked in an interview with the associated press if the budget will 
reflect his principles 
the former texas tech university president hesitated then 
replied i really dont know how to answer that and im honest 
about that i did the best i could thats all i can tell you 
thats going to be the budget and thats the one that i will 
defend 
cavazos said it is too soon to talk about what shape the budget 
will take in the bush administration or what programs he will 
launch to combat such problems as illiteracy and the steep dropout 
rate 
however bush did make several detailed campaign proposals to 
boost education spending including a new 500 million merit 
schools program to help the disadvantaged and 50 million for 
magnet schools 
cavazos told the senate labor and human resources committee at 
his sept 9 confirmation hearing i can promise this committee and 
promise this nation that i will do everything i can to get the best 
funding possible for our department of education 
in the interview cavazos a former medical school dean who was 
sworn in to reagans cabinet barely 12 weeks ago said some 
people have been concerned that ive not come up with specific 
programs on how to do that or do the other i think its premature 
very frankly 
ive said to people look i work for president reagan until 
noon on jan 20 and i will bring all of my skill my energies and 
my commitment to that presidency i signed on for that he said 
but im also a holdover he added in the bush administration 
we will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs 
cavazos the first hispanic to serve in the cabinet has cut 
quite a different figure than his brash predecessor william j 
bennett who made headlines with pungent criticism of teacher unions 
and others running americas schools and colleges 
cavazos has sought to mend fences with those same groups and to 
enlist them in what he hopes will be a national effort of 
unprecedented scope to educate every child to his or her fullest 
potential 
i really do believe that we are starting to come together he 
said the real change meaningful change comes about from 
bringing people together on these issues 
i think that those battles that you win by logic by 
discussion by building a consensus will in the long run be of more 
substance than those won by pounding on the desk or raising 
cain he said 
asked if he shared bushs desire to bring fresh faces to 
government cavazos said absolutely well have 90 percent 
turnover in the top ranks at the department of education 
cavazos said he thinks the public has not yet taken to heart the 
severity of problems in its schools despite the alarms sounded in 
the 1983 a nation at risk report 
although we have made some advancements weve fallen back in 
some other areas since then cavazos said we have not been able 
to stem the tide of dropouts our literacy numbers are terrible 
the american people must not recognize the seriousness of the 
problem or else theyd have gone out and done something about it 
said cavazos son of a foreman on the king ranch one of the biggest 
cattleraising operations in texas 
what makes cavazos think that he will succeed in solving these 
problems where others have fallen short 
i think that persistence has a lot to say about it you just 
continue bringing it forth until finally it reaches the national 
consciousness he said just keep pushing persistence

as the army struggles daily to put down the 
palestinian uprising a governmentfinanced advertising campaign is 
inviting israelis to settle in the heart of territory caught up in 
the revolt 
commercials with catchy jingles appear regularly on israeli 
television urging viewers to come enjoy the quality of life in 
the occupied gaza strip where 2500 jews live in 15 settlements 
that are surrounded by more than 650000 palestinians 
this isnt a place people usually come to visit said datya 
herskovitz a settlement coordinator for the gush katif region in 
southern gaza were just offering to show people whats really 
happening here 
the upbeat advertising campaign which features cheerful theme 
music and children playing soccer in tidy neighborhoods portrays 
the settler enclaves as wholesome places to raise a family live 
in a young effervescent community says one newspaper ad 
the ads dont mention the yearold uprising which has claimed 
the lives of more than 300 palestinians and 11 israelis 
were not trying to ignore reality ms herskovitz said in an 
interview we just want people to take a different look at gaza 
the 25milelong stretch of desert has been a focal point of 
antiisraeli violence since the uprising began in gazas refugee 
camps last december 
jewish settlers have demanded more protection from israels army 
against arab stonethrowers thirtyone civilians in gaza have been 
wounded in stonethrowing attacks since the start of the uprising 
ms herskovitz said the longterm goal of the 50000 promotional 
drive is to help boost the territorys outnumbered jewish population 
from 3000 to 30000 during the next 10 years 
the ads placed by the government and private agencies are part 
of an annual campaign to increase settlement in the occupied land 
with this years effort focused on gaza 
some backers of the ad campaign admit it isnt easy to sell the 
idea of moving to gaza during the uprising 
eli kubasi a spokesman for the world zionist organization said 
settlement leaders who hope for a jewish population boom in gaza 
during the uprising have set their expectations too high 
things were easier before the intefadeh kubasi said using 
the arabic word for uprising now people think twice about whether 
they want to live there 
dedi zucker a leader of the leftwing citizens rights movement 
said encouraging more settlers could undermine future efforts to 
exchange portions of the occupied territories for a peace agreement 
with israels arab enemies 
the united states also has called the 130 settlements in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip obstacles to peace 
the settlements in the west bank some almost commuter suburbs 
are far more popular than those in gaza which are far from israels 
main population centers 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt during the 1967 middle east war prior to the war 
palestinians fleeing israel flocked to gazas overcrowded refugee 
camps 
the israeli government built the first settlements in southern 
gaza in 1967 as a buffer against the egyptian border and ongoing 
palestinian attacks other enclaves and a beach resort for settlers 
have been put up since 
few settlements have been built in the past four years because 
the leftleaning labor party and rightwing likud bloc which make 
up the current joint government disagree on settlement policies and 
were unwilling to provide funds 
zucker said the ad campaign was totally unrealistic and a 
waste of government funding that could be put to better use within 
israels pre1967 borders 
its difficult to understand why anyone would want to live in 
the middle of all that craziness zucker said in an interview i 
guess well have to wait to see how many lunatics there are 
but ms herskovitz the settlement coordinator said the gaza 
settlements would grow despite the uprising 
we decided this was the time to go on tv because were ready 
for more people she said the sole purpose of this is to bring 
more families to live with us

doctors pronounced president reagan cancerfree 
and in excellent health saturday after laboratory tests on a 
polyp removed from his colon the white house reported 
no further examinations or tests are required the president is 
in excellent health said the statement issued by presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the 77yearold president was spending the weekend resting at his 
mountain retreat at camp david md with his wife nancy he was 
informed of the final results by his physician col john hutton 
the tissue removed friday afternoon from president reagans 
colon for biopsy is benign the statement said 
it identified the small amount of tissue taken from the president 
as a benign adenomatous polyp a type of growth that is often 
found in men of reagans age 
the president and mrs reagan traveled to bethesda naval medical 
center in suburban maryland for their annual physical examinations 
friday afternoon and for routine checks intended to detect any 
recurrence of their past cancers 
the president had a twoinch cancerous lesion removed from his 
colon in july 1985 the first lady had her left breast removed last 
year after a quarterinch malignancy was discovered 
mrs reagan 67 was told friday that her second breast xray 
since that surgery revealed no evidence of cancer of any kind 
leaving the hospital after a fourhour visit the president and 
his wife both smiled and gave thumbsup signs and reagan called out 
clean bill of health to reporters he still wore a pair of blue 
running shoes for stress tolerance tests that required him to walk a 
treadmill 
shortly after the tests hutton said in a statement that doctors 
had removed a small piece of tissue from reagans colon and that 
it appeared to be benign or noncancerous but was removed 
because it was suspicious 
there are several kinds of benign growths that can occur in the 
colon and they generally are divided into two types hyperplastic 
or adenomatous polyps hyperplastic polyps usually are not thought 
to be associated with cancers elsewhere in the colon while 
adenomatous polyps are a signal to be on guard for future growths 
reagans doctors have told him that he will need periodic colon 
tests for the rest of his life 
the president has had polyps removed from his intestine in four 
of five colonoscopic exams since the cancerous lesion was removed 
from his colon three years ago these small polyps tend to occur 
more frequently as people grow older and can become cancerous if 
left alone 
hutton said the colonoscopy was performed without sedation 
this technique involves use of a long flexible scope that is 
inserted into the bowel if a polyp is found the physician can use 
a tiny wire loop at the end of the scope to snare the growth and 
clip it off the wound is sealed with an electrical current 
delivered by the instrument 
the statement said the presidents chest xray was clear his 
urine sample was normal and there was no clinically significant 
change in his pulmonary condition 
the stress test and electrocardiogram showed the presidents 
cardiovascular system is unchanged and normal it said 
reagans catscan the computerized threedimensional xray of 
his internal organs showed no internal abdominal abnormalities the 
test checks against the spread of cancer to other vital organs such 
as the stomach or liver

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address given from the presidential retreat at camp david 
md 
my fellow americans on wednesday this week i met with soviet 
president gorbachev for the fifth time together we stood under the 
gaze of lady liberty speaking of the prospects of peace for the 
peoples of our two nations and for all the world 
yes since our first summit in geneva three years ago weve 
traveled a great journey that has seen remarkable progress a 
journey we continue to travel together 
im pleased that the soviet union has accepted our offer of 
humanitarian aid in the wake of their devastating earthquake tragedy 
this has also been a period of important change inside the soviet 
union the greater openness permitted by moscow can be found in 
films art and literature theres greater tolerance for those 
seeking to peacefully assemble and the official press carries more 
independent opinions and factual reporting 
and just a few years ago who would have anticipated seeing a 
soviet leader stand before the world community heralding a plan for 
economic restructuring and military redeployments and promising to 
meet the world communitys highest standards of human rights 
if this vision is realized and these promises are turned into 
deeds we would be witnessing a dramatic change in the soviet 
system a long awaited break with the past and the opening of a new 
era in international affairs 
certainly the soviet reforms have their limits and brave 
dissenters within that country who have sought a fuller measure of 
openness continue to be dealt with harshly but i was encouraged by 
the new promises of reform that mr gorbachev made before the united 
nations and hope to see these and past promises translated into 
permanent institutional changes that will signal to the peoples of 
the soviet union and the world a courageous commitment to a new path 
of democratization 
we already see unprecedented diversity in eastern europe with 
some countries pursuing reforms that go even beyond the soviet 
example while other countries continue to lag behind we hope to 
see the day when all countries of eastern europe enjoy the freedom 
democracy and selfdetermination that their peoples have long 
awaited 
just a decade ago some intellectuals widely predicted what they 
called convergence the idea that the democratic world and the 
communist world would merge into one hybrid system the main 
question amounted to how much freedom would democratic nations have 
to give up in the bargain but instead the free world held firm to 
its democratic values cleaving to truths deeply rooted in western 
culture and our judeochristian tradition 
moreover we spoke openly of the moral superiority of our ideal of 
freedom we candidly criticized the violations of human rights 
occurring behind the iron curtain we rebuilt our defenses and with 
our allies worked to counter international aggression by our 
totalitarian adversaries and we exhibited that scarcest of 
commodities patience 
and our steadfastness our policies our whole approach has born 
fruit perhaps the most dramatic achievement came one year ago when 
mr gorbachev and i signed the historic inf treaty to eliminate an 
entire class of us and soviet nuclear missiles 
next week the prime ministers of two of our key nato allies 
turkey and italy will visit washington and certainly along with 
other issues we plan to discuss this weeks visit by mr gorbachev 
and the strategic situation in europe 
for some time now the soviet block has had overwhelming 
superiority in conventional forces in europe so we welcome the 
soviet force reductions that are promised but lets remember this 
even after these redeployments are completed in 1991 the warsaw 
pact will still have a large conventional advantage an edge of 
about five to two in tanks and artillery and some 300000 more 
troops 
these unilateral reductions would however give a long awaited 
encouragement for our efforts to achieve the genuine balance in 
conventional forces that would assure greater security and stability 
in europe 
well in these brightest of times let us recall that in the 
darkest days of world war ii when hopes for the free world seemed 
most bleak winston churchill rallied us to carry on saying that 
we have not journeyed all this way because we are made of sugar 
candy 
by summoning all their strength and courage and by pulling 
together the allies prevailed the war was won 
the decades following world war ii were filled with political 
tensions and threats to world freedom but in recent years weve 
seen hopes for a free and peaceful future restored and the chance 
for a new ussoviet relationship emerge 
to the american people and to our allies i would echo churchill 
and say we have not come this far through lack of strength or 
any weakness in our resolve nor has there been anything inevitable 
about what weve achieved the unity confidence power and 
firmness of the democracies has brought us forward and maintaining 
a strong alliance will keep us moving forward 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

electric prods and rubber batons saturday to prevent them from 
holding a march to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the universal 
declaration of human rights 
several dozen people were reported injured including rafaela 
guanes de laino wife of arrested opposition leader domingo laino 
and ilde silvero director of the roman catholic weekly publication 
sendero

of 300 at the office of the united nations the groups were to have 
marched between the two buildings in downtown asuncion which was 
packed with shoppers 
when about 700 people gathered again at the un office security 
forces waded into the crowd and beat demonstrators and shoppers 
the incident quickly turned into a demonstration against the 
president gen alfredo stroessner the government had banned the 
march saying it was intended as an antistroessner protest 
the military dictatorship is going to fall the demonstrators 
chanted the people united can never be defeated 
small groups of protesters gathered at streetcorners chanting 
antigovernment slogans and then dispersing before police could 
attack them 
we should keep fighting for the effectiveness and respect of 
human rights in paraguay within the framework of nonviolence 
carlos romero pereira a leader of dissidents within the governing 
colorado party said in front of the abccolor newspaper building 
the paper was closed by the government in 1984 
euclides acevedo president of the opposition revolutionary 
febrerista party said the repression of the marchers reflected 
paraguays prehistoric state of authoritarianism under 
stroessners 34year rule 
the march was organized by groups representing students unions 
churches and opposition political parties 
the universal declaration adopted without dissent by the general 
assembly on dec 10 1948 is the basic un document under which 
member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and abolish 
torture and slavery

president reagan by seeking accommodation with 
americas principal world adversary encouraged but did not bring 
about mikhail s gorbachevs reform in the soviet union experts 
say 
it was the basketcase soviet economy rather than a change in 
reagans unstintingly harsh rhetoric after his first term that 
impelled the changes brought about by gorbachev since early 1985 
these experts said 
reagan talked very tough about the soviet union from 1981 through 
1984 at least in part to build on his perceived election mandate to 
rebuild americas defenses 
several scholars and analysts said in interviews however that 
reagan should now be applauded for recognizing the opportunity 
afforded by gorbachevs policies 
reagan they said moved quickly to reestablish the kind of 
working ussoviet relationship that had been virtually scrapped 
after the red armys invasion of afghanistan in 1979 
for his part reagan said last week that he wasnt trying to take 
credit for gorbachevs reforms 
i cannot tonight attempt to put all these events in 
perspective or still less to claim credit for any person or 
administration the president told reporters thursday at perhaps 
his final news conference 
yet reagan in his weekly radio address on saturday took some 
credit for the changed ussoviet relationship saying our 
steadfastness our policies our whole approach has borne fruit 
the president pointed to his administrations adherence to 
democratic values its criticism of human rights violations in the 
soviet union and its military buildup for helping bring about the 
changes 
reagan never met with a soviet leader until he and gorbachev sat 
down in geneva in november 1985 after that they held four more 
including the turbulent talks in reykjavik iceland in october 1986 
along with summits in washington moscow and wednesdays luncheon 
summit on governors island in new york harbor 
paul weyrich chairman of the free congress educational and 
research foundation a strategic affairs analyst and one of reagans 
longtime conservative backers charged that the president had been 
overcome by sentiment in his dealings with gorbachev 
originally i thought the administration ws dealing with the 
soviets through strength but now we have a president who actually 
believes probably influenced by nancy reagan and others that he 
can actually make peace with gorbachev as if gorbachev were an 
individual popularly elected like himself and not a part of a 
different system weyrich said 
gorbachev could be replaced tomorrow and there we would be 
holding the bag he said 
i think the major accomplishment of ronald reagan is not so 
much having affected soviet policy in significant ways but 
basically that he in his person has made arms control and 
negotiating with the soviets legitimate again especially with 
regard to the conservative right said neil mcfarlane an 
associate professor in the government and foreign affairs department 
at the university of virginia 
mcfarlane said that gorbachevs moves were to some extent spurred 
by us policies particularly american assistance to the rebels 
fighting the sovietimposed government in afghanistan where the 
soviets now are withdrawing their forces 
but he said for the most part us actions have been more or 
less incidental to changes in the soviet union gorbachev quickly 
recognized that the soviet union wouldnt survive as a world power 
if it did not correct problems in the economy he said 
raymond l garthoff a senior fellow at the liberaloriented 
brookings institution said i think he reagan should be given 
credit for recognizing change on the soviet side but certainly that 
change hasnt been determined by the hard policies he pursued during 
his first term 
alexander dollin a professor at stanford universitys center for 
russian and east european studies said as i see it the reasons 
why gorbachev came to power and followed a reform program at home 
and abroad had nothing to do with ronald reagan 
if another leonid brezhnev had come to power instead of a 
gorbachev things would have been very different and the reagan 
administration would have had nothing to take credit for he said 
bill taylor vice president for political and military affairs at 
the center for strategic and international studies said during the 
reagan years the soviets at least rhetorically have made 
changes but he said that his orians may only tell years from 
now what impact reagan had on this change 
the reagan backers will attribute it to the foreign policy and 
the defense buildup taylor said others to the moderate center 
and the left wing will question that the far left will deny it

jim and tammy bakker midwestern 
sweethearts from humble beginnings built one of americas most 
successful television ministries raising hundreds of millions of 
dollars only to lose it in a shot 
now after a nearly twoyear hiatus they are fighting to get 
back on the air despite a federal indictment accusing bakker of 
pocketing millions of dollars from faithful viewers 
these people have lost so much and they want to come back to 
share what they have learned said jim toms a lawyer who has 
represented bakker since his 1987 resignation from ptl in the 
jessica hahn sexandmoney scandal 
love them or hate them the bakkers have one quality resiliency 
on monday bakker and three former aides were indicted on charges 
of fraud and conspiracy still the couple plan to tape several tv 
specials at home and hope to be on the air within a month bakker is 
trying to line up stations to carry the show 
i think well see a more introspective and cautious jim bakker 
in his message toms said 
toms said bakker will plead innocent thursday to the charges 
which carry up to 120 years in prison and 6 million in fines 
bakker and richard dortch his top deputy at ptl are accused of 
diverting more than 4 million for personal use of the 158 million 
raised in lifetime partnerships from 1984 through 1987 
the bakkers new goals are modest compared to their successes 
in 1986 bakkers last full year at ptl the ministry boasted 
annual revenue of 129 million and employed 2000 people an 
estimated 6 million visitors came that year to ptls 2300acre 
heritage usa christian retreat near charlotte 
three months ago bakker couldnt raise a 3 million down payment 
to regain control of ptl whose assets are being auctioned off 
monday in us bankruptcy court to pay off an estimated 130 million 
in debt 
in the beginning bakkers ambitions were humble the youngest of 
four children he was born jan 2 1940 in muskegon mich 
bakker was brought up in the assembly of god church but became 
active only after he ran over a young boy with his fathers car when 
he was 18 the youngster survived and bakker said he was 
transformed 
at that point jesus became the only thing in my life he 
wrote in his autobiography move that mountain 
bakker met tamara faye lavalley of international falls minn at 
north central bible college in minneapolis they married in 1961 and 
spent the next five years crusading 
pat robertson hired them in 1965 at his christian broadcasting 
network jim and tammy bakker were hosts of a puppet show and 
bakker later became cohost with robertson of the 700 club 
in 1974 the bakkers moved to charlotte and began putting 
together ptl which stands for praise the lord or people that love 
in a short time bakker was preaching to overflow crowds viewers 
of the weekday talk show ptl club were sending in millions of 
dollars renamed the jim and tammy show it was carried by 1976 
by some 70 stations and 20 cable tv systems 
in 1978 the ministry purchased 1100 acres in south carolina and 
built a 1 million satellite system a home for handicapped children 
and a water park estimated at 10 million 
in 1986 ptl launched plans for a 15 billion project called 
villages of the world including condominiums a golf course and a 
hotel in 1987 ground was broken on a 30000seat 100 million 
crystal palace 
the bakkers spending habits have been well documented including 
stories about luxury cars expensive homes on both coasts and 
shopping sprees 
speaking about heritage usa bakker once asked why should i 
apologize because god throws in crystal chandeliers mahogany floors 
and the finest construction in the world 
it all came crashing down in march 1987 the bakkers told viewers 
that tammy was being treated for drug dependency two weeks later 
bakker resigned over his 1980 sexual encounter with ms hahn a 
church secretary from west babylon ny 
bakker said he had been blackmailed by treacherous former 
friends but admitted having sex with ms hahn and paying her hush 
money 
other allegations have surfaced in recent months former ptl 
club cohost john wesley fletcher was quoted by penthouse magazine 
last week as saying that he was bakkers male prostitute 
while bakker has remained silent his wife said thursday that 
fletcher was lying ive lived with that man for 27 years and i

for three days and nights agam adamyan and scores 
of other moscow volunteers have packed and loaded tons of clothes 
bedding and baby food to ship to earthquake victims in armenia 
unshaven and haggard adamyan appeared a man with a mission 
saturday as he scurried through winding corridors of the armenian 
government building directing newcomers to the basement where 
cardboard boxes and black plastic bags of donations reached the 
ceiling 
plump russian women carrying bulging suitcases mingled in the 
lobby with darkhaired armenians who raced around looking for string 
and the rare roll of packing tape 
were getting lots of help from moscow residents adamyan 
said people are coming of their own initative everybody here is 
a volunteer and armenians and russians are working together 
when a russian receptionist said the director of the office was 
very busy and asked a reporter to leave the premises adamyan 
stepped in and said those are not objective grounds come take a 
look at what we are doing 
the relief effort is unusual for the soviet union because it is 
spontaneous and voluntary rather than ordered by officials 
black ribbons marking two days of official mourning in armenia 
fluttered from the ends of flagpoles holding the armenian and soviet 
flags above the pale yellow armenian government building located a 
10minute walk from the kremlin in central moscow 
in one room armenian and russian university students chattered 
and sorted through mounds of childrens clothes stuffed animals and 
boxes of baby food and tossed them into the appropriate boxes 
above all we have got to get more childrens food and blankets 
for the homeless adamyan said pillows thick wool blankets and 
heavy comforters are piled in another room 
outside the building other volunteers tossed packages onto a 
waiting bus from the soviet travel organization intourist to be 
taken to the airport 
so far the volunteers have dispatched more than 20 tons of 
donations to yerevan and have said they will stay as long as people 
continue to donate 
at least three other collection points have been set up in the 
soviet capital by the komsomol the communist party youth 
organization and representatives of the armenian church in moscow 
met to intensify relief efforts 
volunteers also are manning an aroundtheclock telephone 
switchboard to field inquiries to the armenian government offices 
a page of typewritten verses from an anonymous moscow poet hung 
on the bulletin board at the entrance to the building 
i saw the mountains of ararat where noahs ark supposedly 
landed and there was trouble and the tremor of the earth and i am 
with you brother wrote the poet who signed his lines simply as 
muscovite

chinese troops in the tibetan capital shot into 
crowds of people demonstrating for human rights saturday apparently 
killing two people and wounding three including a dutch woman 
witnesses said 
an official at the tibetan foreign affairs office in lhasa zhu 
jianhua said police fired warning shots in the air and hit some 
people by accident but he did not know how many zhu said he could 
not confirm the report of deaths 
in a report late saturday chinas official xinhua news agency 
said a group of buddhist monks and nuns started a riot in lhasa 
but it said nothing about casualties 
the xinhua report said the nuns and monks walked from one temple 
to the central market near the jokhang temple one of the holiest 
sites of tibetan buddhism and were joined by other people 
on the way some other people joined in some of them were seen 
waving flags in support of the independence of tibet the report 
said 
as the crowd grew unruly policeman on duty began to take 
measures to stop the marchers who were later dispersed the 
report said 
it was the third time since last year that blood has been shed in 
lhasa during demonstrations by tibetans against chinese rule 
protests in october 1987 and march left at least 38 people dead 
dozens injured and hundreds arrested 
the demonstration came as the chinese government and tibets 
exiled leader the dalai lama were exchanging proposals about a 
possible meeting in geneva to discuss ways of bringing peace to the 
remote himalayan region 
the demonstrators who were commemorating the 40th anniversary of 
the un declaration on human rights gathered before noon in front 
of the jokhang temple said two western tourists at a lhasa hotel 
and a tibetan worker 
the witnesses reached by telephone from beijing said protesters 
holding the banned tibetan flag entered the marketplace near the 
temple and crowds of tibetans surged toward them chinese troops 
opened fire on the crowd and tibetans threw rocks at the chinese 
tear gas filled the air sending protesters fleeing the witnesses 
said 
about an hour later the protesters returned but were dispersed 
again after chinese troops fired guns in the air they said 
about 30 tibetans walked into the marketplace near the temple 
at around 1130 am said lucia dezries of urk the netherlands 
who said she witnessed the events they were walking in twos the 
first man was holding a tibetan flag a crowd in the marketplace 
began to encourage them then the soldiers began shooting 
the crowd began pelting the soldiers with rocks but it was not 
clear which came first the rockthrowing or the shooting she said 
ms dezries said a 25yearold woman also from the netherlands 
was shot in the arm by chinese forces and hospitalized but was not 
seriously hurt 
she said she saw two tibetans lying in pools of blood later 
two westerners told me that they had died she said 
i saw women carrying their bodies said the tibetan worker at 
another hotel who spoke on condition of anonymity i have been 
told they are dead 
an american tourist contacted at another hotel said she 
witnessed the demonstration and believed that two people had been 
killed she declined to give her name 
the deaths could not be independently confirmed 
ms dezries said she also saw two tibetan women being helped from 
the marketplace with what appeared to be bullet wounds in their 
legs they were both bleeding and they couldnt walk she said 
ms dezries said she did not see police arrest any tibetans 
after the demonstration ms dezries said pilgrims continued to 
pray around the jokhang temple two pools of blood lay on each side 
of the temple and tibetans placed stones on the blood along with 
candles and sticks of incense 
ms dezries quoted monks as saying there would be more 
demonstrations sunday but she said police told tourists the jokhang 
temple would be closed for three days 
she said it was not clear whether the tibetans participating in 
the demonstration were buddhist monks because they all were in 
street clothes 
monks have traditionally been at the head of tibets independence 
movement and have led a series of antichinese protests beginning 
in september 1987 
at least 14 people were killed oct 1 1987 when a protest 
turned into an attack on a local police station in march 
proindependence tibetans clashed again with police and western 
travelers quoted tibetans as saying at least 24 people died chinese 
reports said hundreds were arrested 
chinese officials have said most of those arrested in the october 
and march protests have since been released 
communist chinese troops entered tibet in 1950 tibetans rose up 
in a mass rebellion in 1959 but chinese troops crushed them and the 
current dalai lama fled to exile in india 
the dalai lama said in july that he was willing to accept chinese 
control over tibets foreign affairs and a chinese military presence 
there if china would give the region autonomy in domestic matters 
china rejected the proposal but in september said it was willing to 
meet with him

presidentelect bush called saturday for a free 
flow of aid to earthquake victims in armenia and the soviet 
ambassador said his countrymen have been deeply moved by the 
outpouring of sympathy 
if something has to be changed to expedite help to the people 
it should be done bush said as he paid a condolence call at the 
soviet embassy i know of no barriers 
bush and his wife barbara dressed in black were among a stream 
of visitors saturday to sign a book at the embassy and look at news 
photographs of the earthquake damage in armenia where soviet 
officials estimate as many as 45000 people were killed 
secretary of state george p shultz came a few minutes later and 
had a private discussion with soviet ambassador yuri dubinin who 
delivered a letter from soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
dubinin would not disclose the contents of the letter and shultz 
left the embassy without saying what was in it 
the state department has set up an aroundtheclock task force to 
monitor the situation in armenia and relay information two teams of 
disaster relief specialists left the united states on saturday 
aboard planes that also carried supplies 
this is an immense tragedy and we are responding to is in 
every way we can shultz said 
the embassy which has opened its iron gates to anyone wanting to 
sign the book of condolences has had to install extra telephone 
lines to handle all of the calls that have been coming in since the 
earthquake on wednesday said soviet spokesman boris malakhov 
dubinin said we are deeply moved by the response we are open 
to all assistance necessary to help people at the top of the list 
of items needed were medical equipment and supplies he said 
robert gale the los angeles physician who helped treat victims 
of the chernobyl nuclear disaster in the soviet union was among 
those heading for armenia 
dubinin told reporters that gales presence did not mean that the 
earthquake had damaged nuclear facilities in the area 
there is absolutely no information about any radiation 
difficulties he said a nuclear power station in armenia was 
unaffected by the earthquake he said 
dubinin said the response to the tragedy was part of a new 
political spirit in the world adding that people should be united 
not only in disasters 
the bushes accompanied by incoming national security adviser 
brent scowcroft entered the embassy through a mirrored hallway and 
were escorted up a redcarpeted staircase beneath a large portrait 
of lenin where they were greeted by dubinin 
mrs bush kissed liana dubinin the ambassadors wife before 
they entered the room where the book was kept on a reddraped table 
trimmed in black a soviet flag topped with two black ribbons stood

covered in black 
with anguish in our hearts for all those in the soviet union 
who lost loved ones bush wrote in the book

the united nations peacekeeping forces who 
received the nobel peace prize on saturday could hand the nations 
of the world a bill for services rendered totaling nearly 1 billion 
in unpaid un dues 
un figures show the 159 member nations owe the world body 
9791 million dollars in unpaid regular dues and peacekeeping 
assessments with the united states being the chief deadbeat 
on friday when un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
accepted the nobel prize award money in oslo norway on behalf of 
the more than halfmillion peacekeepers who have served the united 
nations he observed 
in some ways its embarrassing because it forces me to say 
publicly that the united states still owes the united nations almost 
350 million 
un member nations owe the world body 4501 million in regular 
dues 3601 million in dues for the lebanon middle east and 
iraniraq peacekeeping forces and 1689 million in unpaid 
contributions to the cyprus peacekeeping force 
the cyprus force is supposed to be financed through voluntary 
contributions the united nations uses to reimburse the participating 
nations australia austria britain canada denmark finland 
ireland and sweden 
president reagan said in september that the united states would 
gradually repay all its dues it has withheld money in recent years 
to protest what the reagan administration saw as mismanagement 
overstaffing and an antiwestern bias at the united nations 
the soviet union owes 72 million in regular dues and 1513 
million in peacekeeping dues which it is repaying on a schedule 
worked out with the united nations

soviet scientists are trying to determine why the 
armenian earthquake toppled whole cities and killed more than 40000 
people one us expert blamed much of the devastation on poorly 
constructed buildings 
soviet seismologist igor nersesov told a news conference saturday 
a commission was sent to the armenian city of leninakan to determine 
why threequarters of the buildings in the city of 250000 tumbled 
when construction supposedly was sufficient to withstand some 
shaking 
wednesdays quake measured 69 on the richter scale and its 
epicenter was not far from the surface a similar earthquake in 
southern california would have killed about 1000 people acting 
state geologist brian tucker told the associated press in california 
on friday 
tucker who spent two years in armenia on a research project 
blamed the high death toll in armenia on local construction which 
tends to be loosely connected unreinforced concrete slabs in the 
city or adobe in the villages 
nersesov told reporters in moscow that with a duly organized 
scientific system of observation and research we could have 
predicted the quake 
he said a team of seismic experts also had been sent to armenia 
in an attempt to predict aftershocks 
the latest seismic records for northwestern armenia were 
destroyed in the quake along with the institute of seismology in 
leninakan nersesov said the institute had been researching 
earthquakeproof construction techniques 
like western scientists the leninakan researchers were hampered 
by the difficulty of testing their theories the university of 
california at irvine recently built a complex engineering laboratory 
with the ability to simulate earthquakes 
nersesov said construction in the leninakan area should have been 
sufficient to withstand the force of an earthquake rated 8 on the 
12point soviet scale of potential earthquake damage that level is 
described in reference books as destructive causing cracks on 
sharp slopes and wet slopes monuments are moved or turned over 
houses are considerably damaged 
officials say wednesdays quake was closer to a 10 on the 
12point scale 
in answer to a question nersesov also said buildings are not 
always constructed according to regulation

a top democrat praised president reagan on 
saturday for an extraordinary role in changing us relations 
with the soviet union and called george p shultz one of the great 
secretaries of state of our time 
house majority leader tom foley of washington endorsed both 
reagans expression of hope that soviet general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms will become permanent and the presidents 
cautions about continued soviet military strength in europe 
reagan in his weekly radio address repeated yet again his 
upbeat assessment of last weeks meeting in new york his last as 
president with the soviet leader 
gorbachev in an address to the un general assembly on 
wednesday pledged to unilaterally slash soviet troop strength by 
500000 men and 10000 tanks within two years 
if gorbachevs vision is realized and these promises are 
turned into deeds we would be witnessing a dramatic change in the 
soviet system reagan said 
the president said however that his administrations military 
buildup adherence to democratic values and criticism of soviet 
human rights violations helped bring change 
he said that even if promised soviet troop and equipment 
reductions occur the warsaw pact will retain a large advantage 
over the nato alliance 
foley in the democratic response to reagans address said it 
was fair and accurate for reagan to note that soviet forces 
remain superior over nato 
while we must thus be cautious about the extent of our 
optimism he said americans will agree with president reagans 
comment that if the gorbachev program is carried out in full we 
would be witnessing a dramatic restructuring of soviet society 
which history would regard as tremendously important 
foley said gorbachev appeared to be offering cooperation rather 
than confrontation 
president reagan has played an extraordinary role in bringing 
about these important changes in our relationship the democratic 
leader said adding that most of the presidents actions in foreign 
affairs have strong bipartisan support in congress exceptions he 
noted have been reagans policies toward nicaragua and south africa 
in addition to the president on the administration side great 
credit must go to secretary of state george shultz whose forthright 
dealings with the congress and skillful diplomatic leadership will 
mark him as one of the great secretaries of state of our time 
foley said 
he said democrats trust and believe that the incoming 
administration of presidentelect bush will recognize what 
bipartisanship has accomplished and that together we can usher in a 
new era of cooperation as we face our national challenges at home 
and abroad 
meanwhile un ambassador vernon walters sounded a cautionary 
note its a long way before the soviet union becomes a democratic 
country like the countries of western europe he said in an

a computer hacker who has breached 
lowlevel security at a top federal weapons laboratory about 10 
times in the past week is being urged by officials to contact the 
lab to find out what he wants 
the lawrence livermore national laboratory has spent nearly 
100000 in lost resources and attempts to stop the invader who 
gains access through a national computer communications network lab 
officials estimated 
no files or data in the computers appear to have been altered 
ive offered an invitation for him to call me through the 
media said charles cole the labs computer security manager 
id like to talk to him my numbers listed or if he called the 
laboratory he could get me very easily 
lab officials also are considering trying to contact the hacker 
the next time he logs onto their computers by leaving a message for 
him 
in one sense it would be nice if the hacker went away but 
id rather he stayed with us for a while so we can find out what he 
wants cole said 
what worries me is where is he in the system that we dont 
know about he added 
the lab run by the university of california berkeley is one of 
the nations two centers for design manufacture and testing of 
nuclear weapons the other is at los alamos nm 
no classified computer systems have been affected cole said 
the hacker appeared in the labs computers last weekend and has 
been on and off the system ever since the most recent appearance 
was thursday night cole said 
as best we can determine he hasnt altered anything with the 
exception of creating a password for himself so he can get back 
on he said adding 
but he hasnt done anything really destructive on the system 
and before he would be inclined to do that i hope he would talk to 
me about what his problem is 
the infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a 
computer virus that struck nationwide last month and by another 
hacker two weeks ago both of the latest invasions were through 
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access 
points that have not been patched 
cole said the intrusions do not involve a virus a program that 
can order a computer to replicate itself or send it on to another 
computer this attack is being done by someone or a group who are 
maneuvering into the system manually he said 
the hacker has already broken federal laws which prohibit 
unauthorized use of federal computer systems cole said and he may 
have violated state laws as well 
cole speculated that the hacker is simply joy riding 
it was determined that stanford university and the university of 
washington were gateways from which the hacker entered the livermore 
system by means of the internet communications system but it is not 
known if the hacking originated there 
part of the problem in tracing a hacker on internet is that it is 
so large internet is used by research facilities and military 
contractors nationwide and there is no single path through which 
messages must travel 
the lab has closed the holes which they believe the hacker used 
but a couple of computers have been left unprotected in an attempt 
to make contact or trace the person 
we could close up our system in which case he would move on 
cole said

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address given by rep tom foley 
good afternoon this is representative tom foley of the state of 
washington majority leader of the united states house of 
representatives 
we americans have traditionally appreciated the bold stroke at 
the united nations this past wednesday soviet general secretary 
mikhail gorbachev gave us a splendid example of a bold stroke he 
offered a farreaching proposal to unilaterally cut soviet forces by 
half a million troops over the next two years 
this reduction would include the withdrawal of some 50000 troops 
and 5000 tanks from three east european countries and the 
restructuring of the remaining soviet forces in a more defensive 
posture 
on a broader scale the secretary general appeared to promise an 
end to persecution for political or religious beliefs and offered 
the incoming administration of presidentelect bush a ready 
negotiating partner to continue work on cuts in overall strategic 
arms and conventional forces in europe 
in speaking on the politics of change he clearly appeared to be 
offering cooperation rather than confrontation 
as president reagan said today it is certainly true that the 
soviet union has far to go in its full economic restructuring and 
in its recognition of human rights it is also fair and accurate to 
note as the president did that soviet forces would still retain 
superiority over nato in important categories even if the announced 
reductions are fully implemented 
while we must thus be cautious about the extent of our optimism 
americans will agree with president reagans comment that if the 
gorbachev program is carried out in full we would be witnessing a 
dramatic restructuring of soviet society which history would regard 
as tremendously important 
the secretary generals early departure from the united states 
was required by a disastrous earthquake in armenia which has left 
tens of thousands dead and injured 
we join the president in expressing our heartfelt sympathy and 
sorrow to the victims of the devastating earthquake and we stand 
with him in his continuing offer of us humanitarian assistance in 
this tragedy 
the full import of general secretary gorbachevs plan remains for 
the weeks and months ahead but his remarks alone tell us how far 
soviet policy and our own relationship with the soviet union have 
come over the past few years 
president reagan has played an extraordinary role in bringing 
about these important changes in our relationship but as strong 
democratic party congressional approval of the inf treaty 
demonstrated the presidents efforts have had strong bipartisan 
support 
in fact with the exceptions of disputes about our policy toward 
nicaragua and south africa president reagans administration has 
enjoyed the traditional bipartisan support in foreign policy 
in addition to the president on the administration side great 
credit must go to secretary of state george shultz whose forthright 
dealings with the congress and skillful diplomatic leadership will 
mark him as one of the great secretaries of state of our time 
we trust and believe that the incoming administration of 
presidentelect bush will recognize what bipartisanship has 
accomplished and that together we can usher in a new era of 
cooperation as we face our national challenges at home and abroad 
the american people have recently concluded an election which 
have left the executive and legislative branches of government in 
the control of different parties although the campaign was 
occasionally acrimonious elections are not an end to themselves 
but a means to an end 
if there is a political mandate in the 1988 elections it is the 
publics expectation that a republican president and a democratic 
congress will now together address our pressing national issues 
that is the publics rightful expectation and our shared 
responsibility 
since world war ii this shared responsibility has been the rule 
rather than the exception and experience has shown us it can work 
from the marshall plans economic reconstruction of western europe 
in the 80th congress to the uscanada free trade agreement in the 
100th congress 
as presidentelect bush prepares to take office the 
administration and the congress face daunting challenges in such 
areas as medical care education the environment economic 
competitiveness agriculture national security and foreign affairs 
it is important to recognize that if we are to continue making 
progress in the vital area of ussoviet relations which has so 
highlighted these last years of president reagans presidency we 
must have a strong economy and a strong society at home 
the first task of the new administration and the 100th congress 
must be to face the unprecedented budget and trade deficits 
these issues are too important now and for the future 
generations for one branch of government or one political party 
to act alone solutions will require the active consent and 
cooperation of the president and the congress democrats in the 
congress stand ready to work with presidentelect bush in this 
spirit of conciliation and cooperation 
this is representative tom foley thank you for listening

when marlan perhus asked will you 
marry me lisa verwest was almost too frightened to answer 
perhus an aviation student at the university of north dakota 
popped the question at an altitude of 2500 feet as the engine of 
his cessna 172 sputtered and coughed 
it was an emergency perhus said he cooked up as part of an 
elaborate plan to propose to miss verwest a north dakota state 
university student 
perhus had hidden a redwrapped box containing a diamond ring in 
the pouch behind his pilots seat when he and miss verwest went for 
a sunday morning flight last month to celebrate their first 
anniversary of going out 
his flight plan was to put the planes engine on low idle and ask 
miss verwest to reach into the pouch for an emergency checklist in 
hopes she would find the ring instead perhus said 
i had just reduced the power like when you take your foot off 
the accelerator in a car perhus said which made the planes 
engine pop and sputter a little bit 
but miss verwest in her nervous search for the emergency list 
missed the ring box perhus had to help 
when she saw it thats when i said will you marry me 
perhus recalled after the fear subsided she said a great big 
yes with a hug and a kiss or two 
i was basically stunned miss verwest said 
the couple plan to finish college before they set a wedding date 
perhus said after he earns his degree in aviation he hopes to 
work with the federal aviation administration as an accident 
prevention specialist

a stock scandal widened saturday when the opposition 
japan socialist party released the names of 17 business and 
government officials reportedly involved in questionable stock 
purchases news reports said 
two municipal assembly members whose saitama and kanagawa 
regions form the hub of development in the outer tokyo area were 
included on the list along with banking real estate and company 
officials kyodo news service said 
okiyuki hoashi member of the urawa assembly in saitama 
prefecture and chikau matsumura former member of the yokohama 
municipal assembly in kanagawa prefecture were among 17 people 
reportedly offered 170000 shares in the real estate firm 
recruitcosmos co prior to their public listing the report said 
political commentator kiyoshi iijima who often appears on 
television was also named as a figure in the stock scandal in 
which a large number of influential individuals were offered 
bargainpriced shares of recruitcosmos along with interestfree 
financing for the purchase 
kiichi miyazawa the finance minister and deputy prime minister 
resigned from the cabinet on friday to take responsibility for 
delivering conflicting testimony regarding his role in the purchase 
of recruitcosmos stock 
also on friday ei shikiba an executive of the nippon telegraph 
and telephone corp was removed as director of the telephone 
giants data communications department for buying unlisted 
recruitcosmos shares the companys president haruo yamaguchi 
said skikiba would remain an executive director of the company with 
no specific responsibilities 
nippon telegraph and telephone japans largest telephone 
company has been criticized for its close ties with recruitcosmos 
which reportedly include the leasing of large numbers of telephone 
circuits at reduced rates and the resale of two usmade 
supercomputers 
more than a dozen leading politicians including prime minister 
noboru takeshita and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone have 
been linked to the stock profiteering deal devised by japanese 
businessman hiromasa ezoe founder of the information conglomerate 
recruitcosmos 
but among the top politicians only miyazawa was directly 
involved he claimed he had not been informed that his former aide 
purchased and then sold 10000 of the shares in miyazawas name for 
a profit of 185000 
ezoe reportedly offered individuals from the world of government 
business media and finance the opportunity to buy shares in 
recruitcosmos a recruit affiliate prior to their overthecounter 
listing in october 1986 
shortly after the shares were offered for public trading their 
value rose sharply and earned large profits for holders in japan 
shares usually rise upon the start of public trading and those who 
obtained recruitcosmos shares would have known they stood to profit 
in the deal 
opposition leaders spearheading a probe of the stock deal charge 
that government officials were offered recruitcosmos shares in 
return for political favors and have blocked parliamentary debate on 
a proposed package of tax reform bills to press their demands for 
fullscale investigation of the affair 
miyazawa said he hoped his resignation would pave the way for 
passage of the tax bills and following his departure the governing 
liberal democratic party set a timetable for debate on the tax 
reform bills 
if deliberations are carried out smoothly the package will pass 
before dec 28 when the current parliamentary session is due to 
end and as early as dec 23 according to press reports saturday

a top west german military official 
said saturday that the fiery crash of a us air force jet that 
killed six people will further erode popular support for national 
defense programs 
in the city of remscheid fire brigade leader berthold hoehler 
said the body of a construction worker was pulled from the rubble of 
a house destroyed in the accident raisng the death toll from the 
accident to six seven people hurt in thursdays accident remained 
in critical condition he said 
later saturday at least 4000 people took part in a torchlight 
vigil and procession in downtown remscheid to remember the victims 
and to demand an end to lowlevel flight training missions 
a us air force a10 thunderbolt ii jet tore a swath of 
destruction through a workingclass neighborhood in the central west 
german city of remscheid rescue workers continued to comb the 
debris saturday as work crews tore down the remains of demolished 
houses 
in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper the inspector 
general of west germanys military said the crash was certain to 
have a serious impact on already sinking public support for defense 
issues 
we are in a very difficult psychological situation dieter 
wellershoff was quoted as saying 
wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling 
public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction 
over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers 
i am alarmed that many west germans have lost sight of the hard 
facts of defense realities in their hopes for continued peace 
which hinge on west germanys and natos security preparedness he 
said 
west germany a staunch nato ally borders east germany and 
czechoslovakia thus putting it on the front lines of the eastwest 
struggle 
wellershoffs comments were to appear in the newspapers sunday 
editions the text of the interview was telexed in advance to other 
news media 
west germanys skies are crowded with hundreds of jets and 
helicopters each day a series of deadly accidents has fueled 
growing calls for a halt to or drastic reductions in lowlevel 
training flights 
even before thursdays fatal crash 12 major accidents of 
military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone they 
included 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at the 
us base in ramstein in august 
following the remscheid crash temporary suspensions of lowlevel 
training missions were ordered 
the us air force said in a statement saturday that the pilot of 
the a10 inadvertently flew into clouds while attempting to join 
in close formation with another aircraft 
the air force statement quoting maj gen marcus a anderson 
said the pilot then initiated a separation maneuver as is normal 
if two aircraft in formation lose visual contact 
the statement said the lead aircraft climbed above the clouds 
but that the second a10 continued in a descent 
we do not know why anderson said in the statement 
west german military officials have speculated that the pilot may 
have become disoriented when he tried to climb out of the bad 
weather 
witnesses on the ground however have said they saw one of the 
jets two engines on fire before it crashed

irans chief justice who has declared 
that captured rebels should be executed said saturday that tehran 
will pardon some political prisoners 
the move apparently was aimed at countering allegations that 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis fundamentalist regime has executed 
thousands of prisoners since august 
ayatollah abdulkarim musavi ardebili the chief justice said the 
prisoners would be freed in february when the islamic republic 
celebrates the 10th anniversary of its islamic revolution according 
to the official islamic republic news agency 
a number of prisoners will be freed after it is certain that 
they will not break the law afterward irna quoted musavi as 
telling a tehran news conference 
irna monitored in nicosia reported that ardebili did not say 
how many prisoners would be released but noted that all had been 
arrested in connection with terrorist activities 
he said iranian authorities in the past have freed large 
numbers of convicted terrorists and their sympathizers who have been 
reformed in prison 
ardebili denied allegations of widespread human rights 
violations including mass executions made by iranian opposition 
groups the united nations and the londonbased amnesty 
international human rights group 
in response to the negative publicity by world oppressors about 
human rights violations in iran we announce that we are willing to 
provide any international body with the necessary documents 
statistics and evidence in order to show that this publicity if 
without basis he said 
the iraqibased rebel group mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy 
warriors has said 12000 political prisoners including large 
numbers of their activists and sympathizers have been executed in 
iranian prisons in recent months 
irna has said that scores of counterrevolutionaries drug 
traffickers and iraqi agents have been publicly executed in 
several cities 
irans president ali khamenei last week acknowledged some 
executions but said they involved people who were convicted by 
islamic tribunals for various crimes 
but the un general assemblys third committee which deals with 
human rights adoped a resolution dec 1 accusing iran of human 
rights abuses 
it voiced concern at a renewed wave of executions resulting 
in the death of a large number of persons because of their political 
convictions 
iranian dissidents said the latest wave of executions began after 
iran unconditionally accepted a unsponsored ceasefire in the 
8yearold war with iraq after a string of battlefield defeats 
before the truce took effect aug 20 the mujahedeens military 
arm the national liberation army of iran captured two western 
iranian towns in an offensive 
the nla claimed its forces killed or wounded 40000 iranians 
before withdrawing across the border into iraq tehran claims the 
assault was bloodily repulsed 
the mujahedeen said the offensive alarmed the iranians who 
launched a bloody purge of nla supporters and other dissident 
factions 
ardebili along with other leading iranian figures publicly 
called for the execution of counterrevolutionaries without 
trial 
there is no need for any trial he said in an aug 5 tehran 
radio broadcast the crime is clear and the punishment is also 
clear i pray to god that all of them are destroyed 
dissident sources have said that many of the victims of recent 
executions including moslem clergymen were linked to ayatollah 
hussein ali montazeri khomeinis designated successor 
they said this pointed to an intensification of the power 
struggle within the tehran hierarchy as rival factions struggle for 
supremacy after the death of khomeini 88 and reportedly in poor 
health

president reagan on saturday praised social 
reforms and military forces cutbacks proposed by mikhail s 
gorbachev but said that the soviets are keeping a big advantage in 
ground troops and conventional weapons 
i was encouraged by the new promises of reform that mr 
gorbachev made before the united nations and hope to see these and 
past promises translated into permanent institutional changes that 
will signal to the peoples of the soviet union and the world a 
courageous commitment to a new path of democratization reagan 
said in his weekend radio address 
reagan lauded gorbachev for his proposed reforms and attempts to 
open soviet society saying if this vision is realized and these 
promises are turned into deeds we would be witnessing a dramatic 
change in the soviet system 
the soviet president in an address to the un general assembly 
pledged to slash soviet troop strength by 500000 men and 10000 
tanks within two years he offered to withdraw six tank divisions 
from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary by 1991 and to reduce 
soviet forces in those countries by 50000 men and 5000 tanks 
these unilateral reductions would give a longawaited 
encouragement to our efforts to achieve the genuine balance in 
conventional forces that would assure greater security and greater 
stability in western europe reagan said 
in his fiveminute talk delivered from the camp david retreat in 
the catoctin mountains outside washington reagan maintained the 
upbeat tone hes set since concluding his final meeting with 
gorbachev on wednesday in new york 
we welcome the soviet force reductions that are promised but 
lets remember this even after these redeployments are completed in 
1991 the warsaw pact will still have a large conventional advantage 
an edge of about fivetotwo in tanks and artillery and some 300000 
more troops he said 
the president took some credit for helping bring these changes 
about saying our steadfastness our policies our whole approach 
has borne fruit 
we have not come this way through lack of strength or any 
weakness in our resolve nor has there been anything inevitable out 
what weve achieved 
the unity confidence power and firmness of the democracies 
has brought us forward and maintaining this firm alliance will keep 
us moving forward

rallies to mark the first anniversary of the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied territories collapsed 
in brawling and confusion saturday 
the head of jordans professional associations accused government 
agencies of provoking the disruptions 
a planned noon march at the university of jordan by proplo 
supporters ended in stonethrowing clubswinging battles with 
jordanian nationalists who ripped up pictures of palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat 
reporters saw at least one person injured but there was no 
official report on the number of casualties 
in the evening the professional associations union canceled a 
series of events scheduled to commemorate the anniversary of the 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip after a jordanianbased 
palestinian dissident group disrupted a scheduled lecture 
these people are sent by the government because they want to 
stop our activities said laith shubeilat head of the council of 
11 associations that represent most of the countrys doctors 
nurses engineers lawyers journalists and other professionals 
these hired hands and hired voices under the protection of the 
government interfered uninvited on the premises shubeilat told 
the associated press 
an estimated 15 million palestinians live in jordan most of 
them in the capital amman 
most fled from palestine after israel was created as a state in 
1948 and when israel occupied the west bank and gaza strip during 
the 1967 middle east war 
at the university reporters saw about 100 students chanting 
slogans in favor of king hussein and throwing rocks at about the 
same number of students gathering to start a march to mark the 
uprising anniversary 
after retreating into the engineering association building some 
of the proplo students emerged and battled the jordanian 
nationalists before security forces stopped the fighting 
on thursday a palestinian faction led by plo dissident atallah 
atallah packed a conference hall hours before the start of planned 
lectures sponsored by the professional associations union and then 
interrupted the speakers and clashed with arafat supporters 
about 200 of atallahs followers arrived early saturday for a 
scheduled poetry reading in honor of the uprising and shubeilat 
said the association canceled the event to avoid disturbances 
he said folklore and musical programs planned for sunday and 
monday also were canceled 
atallah opposes arafats leadership of the plo and favors strong 
ties with jordan which has granted his organization unusual freedom 
of action he denies plo allegations he is backed by jordan 
jordan has been under martial law since the 1967 war 
public demonstrations are rarely permitted and husseins 
government is wary of expressions of palestinian nationalism since a 
1970 war with palestinian guerrillas that drove thousands of 
palestinian refugees into lebanon 
hussein renounced sovereignty over the west bank july 31 
formally giving the plo responsibility for the area he declared 
that jordan is not palestine and called for jordanian citizens 
to honor their duties to their own country

at saturdays rally the crowd chanted freedom release 
political prisoners and long live charter 77 during an hour of 
speeches by activists from the charter 77 human rights movement and 
other dissident groups 
the rally called to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1948 
declaration of human rights had been scheduled for pragues

center but approved of another site about a mile away 
after the speeches the crowd shouted approval of resolutions 
including publication of the human rights declaration and other 
human rights pacts in school texts public participation in the 
preparation of a new constitution and negotiations with the 
nations churches for full religious freedom 
it was the first time since january 1969 that the communist 
authorities had permitted a rally by independent groups 
banned playwright vaclav havel was the first to address the crowd 
three weeks ago when i was in pragues ruzyne prison 
wondering how long i would be there if anybody told me that i would 
be having breakfast with the french president and the next day 
addressing a permitted meeting i would have said he was joking 
he said 
he said saturdays rally would not have been possible without the 
brave participation of thousands of people in the august and 
october demonstrations which were broken up by police 
havel said he did not know if the permission for the rally marked 
a major change by the authorities but he said one thing is 
certain the situation is open and it is up to us all how it is 
going to develop 
havel was one of eight dissidents who met with mitterrand friday 
to discuss human rights 
a governmentsponsored forum on human rights also was held 
saturday at at an exhibition hall in a prague park 
the delegates approved the creation of committee on human affairs 
that speakers said would improve laws on health and social affairs 
and guarantee existing laws are not violated 
but the organizers did not admit three dissidents who tried to 
attend the forum 
there are no rights and freedoms without the duty not to exceed 
the determined borders said keynote speaker josef mecl dean of 
the law faculty at pragues charles university

south africas release of journalist zwelakhe 
sisulu and better treatment of longimprisoned black nationalist 
leader nelson mandela are timebuying tactics by the white minority 
government members of sisulus family said saturday 
the relatives were in atlanta to accept the third annual 100000 
cartermenil human rights prize at the carter center 
in remarks prepared for delivery at the ceremony saturday night 
former president jimmy carter said that despite improvements in the 
middle east latin america and the soviet bloc i cannot really 
say that the human rights conditions in the world have improved 
significantly in 1988 
sisulu editor of the new nation and one of south africas most 
prominent black journalists was arrested two years ago hours after 
new censorship laws were imposed he was held without charges until 
his unexpected release dec 2 
sisulu 37 a former nieman fellow at harvard university is 
under indefinite orders not to work for a newspaper give 
interviews be in the presence of more than 10 people at once or 
visit schools he must report to police twice a day and stay at home 
between 6 pm and 6 am 
the regime wants a pat on the back said max sisulu a 
brother who is active in the banned african national congress and 
has lived in zambia since 1963 they release some but they arrest 
more it will continue 
the restrictions he said are making his brother his own 
jailer it is the most vicious form of restraint he is a journalist 
and he cannot earn a living 
their father walter a former anc official has served 24 years 
of a life sentence and remains jailed 
max sisulu and sisters lindiwe who is studying in england and 
beryl who lives in johannesburg came to accept the award on behalf 
of the family they said the money likely would go to a trust fund 
to help families of political prisoners 
they urged international sanctions to try to halt south africas 
policy of apartheid or racial separation peacefully if possible 
but max sisulu questioned whether it would work 
when the regime closes peaceful avenues what is left for the 
people to do he said in an interview people are starting not 
to see the government as a vehicle for change 
carter in a brief interview said presidentelect george bush 
may take a stronger stand against south africa than president reagan 
has 
bush he predicted may not be so readily inclined to veto 
political and economic restrictions the us congress would like to 
put on south africa 
he agreed with the sisulus that apparent concessions to black 
dissident leaders have been largely windowdressing 
mandela 70 recently was moved to a house on a prison farm after 
being treated for tuberculosis he was sentenced to life in prison 
in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government 
dominique de menil a houston philanthropist who funds the prize 
said the answer lies with the south african government as to 
whether apartheid ends peacefully or through bloodshed 
carter and ms menil picked the sisulu family to win the award 
from a list of candidates drawn up by a committee of human rights 
representatives 
last year the award went to the a group called la vicaria de la 
solidaridad of santiago chile for its work in human rights in 
1986 the award was shared by soviet dissident yuri orlov and the 
mutual support group of guatemala which works with missing family 
members of victims of political violence in that central american 
country

the united nations chief accepted the nobel 
peace prize on behalf of un peacekeeping troops on saturday and 
said their success illustrates a new mood of understanding and 
common sense in the world 
but the un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar also 
said the peacekeepers crucial mission is threatened because the 
united states and other nations dont pay their dues to the world 
body 
never before in history have military forces been employed 
internationally not to wage war not to establish domination and not 
to serve the interests of any power or group of powers but rather 
to prevent conflict between peoples perez de cuellar told an 
audience that included king olav v 
despite conflicts and terrible new weapons collective 
responsibility for peace can be evolved in a truly representative 
international system perez de cuellar said there is a new mood 
of understanding and common sense 
his hands appeared to shake with emotion as he accepted the gold 
medal and prize certificate from egil aarvik chairman of the 
norwegian nobel committee the peacekeeping forces are the first 
military force ever to win the award 
in a whitetie ceremony in stockholm sweden five americans 
shared the science prizes with three west germans a briton and a 
frenchman 
literature laureate naguib mahfouz of egypt could not attend for 
health reasons and was represented at the ceremony by two daughters 
he is the first arab writer to win the prestigious award 
swedens king carl xvi gustaf awarded the prize for physics to 
americans leon m lederman melvin schwartz and jack steinberger 
lederman said the greatest benefit of the awesome tradition 
of the nobel prizes was to encourage greater public understanding of 
the sciences he quipped that it was the scientists modest goal 
to understand the universe 
johann diesenhofer robert huber and hartmut michel all west 
germans received the chemistry award 
sir james black of britain shared the medicine prize with 
gertrude b elion and george h hitchings both of the united 
states and maurice allais of france won the memorial prize in 
economics 
this years prizes are worth 416000 per category for reasons 
never explained swedish industrialist alfred nobel stipulated in 
his will that the peace prize be awarded in norway and the other 
prizes in sweden 
the first prizes were handed out in 1901 and the nobel memorial 
prize in economics was set up in 1968 by the national bank of sweden 
an audience of 600 at oslo universitys aula hall observed a 
moment of silence for the 733 peacekeepers who have died on duty 
the first un force went to the middle east in 1948 since then 
half a million soldiers from 58 countries have served in trouble 
spots around the world keeping combatants apart and monitoring 
ceasefires 
the un has 10000 soldiers in the field today and perez de 
cuellar noted that one of them us marine lt col william 
higgins is held by kidnapers in lebanon he appealed for higgins 
release 
on friday perez de cuellar accepted the money portion of the 
award worth 416000 but said peacekeeping forces were threatened 
by failure of the united states and other countries to pay their 
un dues 
i dont know how were going to cope financially he told 
reporters un members owe about 450 million in back dues and the 
united states is the biggest debtor with nearly 350 million 
outstanding he said 
the reagan administration has been holding back money from the 
world body on grounds that is overstaffed wasteful and has an 
antiwestern bias 
president reagan has said the debt will be paid eventually but 
perez de cuellar suggested that could come too late 
in addition to the seven peacekeeping missions now on duty 
additional forces have been suggested as early as next year for 
southwest africa the western sahara afghanistan cambodia and 
central america 
perez de cuellar said the forces act as an international police 
force 
peacekeeping uses soldiers as servants of peace rather than as 
the instruments of war it introduces to the military sphere the 
principle of nonviolence he said 
we can and must achieve what we have dreamed of for so long 
that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the 
exception in world affairs 
afer the ceremony perez de cuellar left for paris to attend 
ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the un human rights 
convention

tourists can walk cobblestone streets 
and see buildings standing since this seaports whaling days but 
the slayings of at least five women this year have focused 
outsiders attention on seedy weld square 
five bodies of women have been found dumped along highways since 
july and three have been identified and linked to the square an 
area known for drugs and prostitution a few blocks from the historic 
section 
saturday skeletal remains of a sixth body were found in the 
area but police did not immediately determine whether they were 
part of the string of killings 
police said at least one of the women whose bodies were found 
earlier was strangled the victims skeletal remains have been sent 
to the fbi for examination 
while dozens of investigators comb the region for more bodies and 
for any suspects prostitutes still walk the streets of weld square 
day and night 
im worried yeah but ive got to make a living said one 
woman who said she was a prostitute and declined to give her name 
mayor john bullard said the killings have not frightened most 
townspeople 
the people who have reason to be terrified are the prostitutes 
but that is a very small very identifiable problem bullard said 
there is no reason for people who are not prostitutes to feel 
threatened by this 
in fact the mayor said he is more concerned with the citys drug 
problem 
the biggest problem is the waste of human lives that takes 
place off the front pages bullard said thats a much greater 
impact than five people having their lives taken 
in nearby dartmouth police said that skeletal remains located 
saturday were found by hunters in a gravel pit about a quartermile 
into the woods off interstate 195 the other five bodies found since 
july were within 25 feet of the interstate or route 140 in dartmouth 
and freetown 
neither the bodys sex nor the cause of death could be 
immediately determined authorities said police gave no indication 
they had any evidence other than proximity to link the body to the 
five slayings 
the killings have added a new chapter to the towns troubled 
history 
a city of highs and lows new bedford was once the whaling 
capital of the world that industry rapidly collapsed and textile 
manufacturing swiftly took its place then the mills migrated south 
toward cheaper labor earlier this century leaving an economic wound 
in new bedford that has only recently begun to heal 
today despite higherthanaverage unemployment and a polluted 
harbor this city of 98000 about 50 miles south of boston boasts 
the nations richest fishing port in the dollar value of its catch 
but more people remember the city for the 1983 gang rape of a 
woman on a pool table at a bar called big dans in the citys 
scruffy south end the case resulted in four convictions and 
national television and newspaper coverage 
earlier this summer as the first bodies in the murder case were 
discovered in dense woods near two highways a movie based on the 
big dans case drew protests from some residents 
efforts to improve new bedford and its image have taken many 
forms 
the new bedford whaling museum is famous across the country the 
mayor is trying to bring a state park to the city the downtown area 
has preserved its appearance and one can walk for blocks on 
cobblestone streets among whalingera buildings 
not far from downtown joe thomas works on a periodical devoted 
to new bedfords history it is called spinners after the 
millworkers who flocked to the city at the turn of the century he 
said he worries about problems more permanent than the series of 
murders 
i am concerned with the way people see themselves i dont care 
what other people think thomas said he said new bedford has a 
pretty low wage level its got a pretty low housing level its got 
a pretty low education level 
james mathes executive vice president of the new bedford area 
chamber of commerce said the city will be able to recover from the 
latest round of bad news by going out and telling people that this 
is a nice community 
murder is clearly a terrible thing it happens throughout the 
united states he said but when you have something this wacky 
that happens multiple times it just hurts

someone identifying himself as boxing legend 
muhammad ali has made hundreds of phone calls to politicians and 
journalists asking for help on three projects one potentially 
worth millions to ali according to a newspaper report 
ali in a facetoface interview told the atlanta journal and 
the atlanta constitution he did not make the phone calls and had no 
idea who did the newspaper reported in sunday editions why would 
a black muslim mess with politicians ali said i dont care 
many of the ali calls to journalists were arranged by his 
attorney richard m hirschfeld of charlottesville va the 
newspaper said it quoted business associates of ali and hirschfeld 
as saying the lawyer does a convincing impersonation of the former 
heavyweight champion 
the newspaper said its attorneys sent a list of questions to 
hirschfeld including one asking whether he had ever impersonated 
alis voice to a third party 
hirschfeld in a letter did not answer the questions but 
instead said that ali denied making statements the newspaper 
attributed to him including the statement denying that he knew 
anything about the phone calls the paper said 
a call saturday from the associated press to hirschfelds office 
was not returned 
the newspaper reported that the ali voice this year has

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
promised visiting us congressmen that he will make life miserable 
for drug traffickers in mexico the lawmakers said saturday 
the congressmen said they were optimistic about the new mexican 
administrations attitude toward the battle against drugs after a 
40minute meeting with salinas on friday 
the 14 lawmakers members of the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control are on a 12day factfinding trip to 
mexico and other nations in the caribbean basin 
two years ago on a similar factfinding trip committee chairman 
charles rangel dny said he was disappointed by what he 
perceived as lack of cooperation by mexican officials 
salinas who took office dec 1 told the congressmen he was 
reorganizing the office of the attorney general with a special 
narcotics enforcement division and planned to implement stiffer 
criminal penalties and increase seizure of assets of drug dealers 
i will make life miserable for drug traffickers in mexico 
before they make life in mexico miserable the congressmen quoted 
salinas as saying 
the congressmen said salinas gave no specifics about how he 
planned to step up the fight against official corruption or any 
details of the use of seizure laws 
mexico has in the past expressed discontent with us drug 
policies saying that they lean too much toward enforcement and that 
mexico cannot be blamed for the tremendous demand for drugs that 
creates a market in the united states 
rangel said us policy has recently shifted to an emphasis on 
education treatment and rehabilitation rather than simply 
enforcement 
we have an upbeat attitude as to looking forward to the new 
relationship betwen our presidents and our congresses said rangel 
rep william j hughes dnj said mexican authorities 
expressed interest in reviewing us statutes on money laundering 
and bank privacy but he did not know how they planned to use the 
information 
weve made errors and mistakes and we hope mexico can benefit 
from them said rep frank j guarini dnj 
salinas said he personally intervened to press an investigation 
into the killing of us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena salazar said rep mike oxley rohio 
oxley said he told salinas that a speedy resolution of the 
camarena case would send a positive signal about the mexican 
attitude on drug trafficking 
camarena was killed in 1985 while investigating rafael caro 
quintero allegedly one of mexicos top drug barons 
a mexican drug trafficker rene verdugo urquidez was convicted 
in los angeles and sentenced to 240 years in prison in the case in 
october his attorneys argued that he was a scapegoat 
caro quintero has been sentenced to 34 years in prison in mexico 
on narcotics and weapons charges stemming from the case 
several other people including mexican police officials have 
been convicted in the case us authorities have accused mexico of 
footdragging in the investigation causing strains in usmexican 
relations 
the next stop on the delegations tour is belize just south of 
mexico the delegations itinerary after that is not yet set 
committee staff members said 
committee staffer rich baum refused to comment on reports the 
delegation is going to cuba but he said the island was of interest 
because of its strategic location between the united states and 
drugproducing areas in south america 
he said the united states had tracked drugcarrying planes and 
ships that appeared to originate in cuba 
cuban president fidel castro last week rejected accusations that 
cuba was serving as a drug transshipment point and said that his 
nation was the most drugfree nation in the western hemisphere

rights movement and other dissident groups 
walesa leader of polands banned solidarity labor movement and 
sakharov the soviet human rights activist met privately at their 
hotel for about 45 minutes saturday morning in a very friendly and 
very warm session according to bronislaw gemerek an adviser to 
walesa who is acting as translator 
walesa spoke of the problems in poland sakharov spoke of the 
problems in the soviet union and walesa said he thinks 
perestroika is a good program for both countries said gemerek 
speaking in french to reporters 
perestroika is the word used to describe soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs program of political or economic restructuring 
neither walesa nor sakharov commented publicly on their meeting 
saturday but gemerek later described the encounter in detail in an 
interview with the associated press 
sakharov told walesa that the immense difference between the 
russian and polish societies is that polish society wants reform 
while in the soviet union people fear it gemerek said 
walesa emphasized to sakharov that the main problem is the 
democratization of the system when you have mass support you can 
have reform without the democraticization of the old stalinist 
system gorbachevs policies will always be vulnerable 
gemerek said solidarity planned to step up contacts with 
independent soviet movements and activists he also said walesa and 
sakharov hoped to meet again during the weekend

trade federation in a communist state 
sakharov who won the nobel peace prize in 1975 came to paris 
after a fourweek visit to the united states 
sakharov a nuclear physicist who played a key role in developing 
the soviet hydrogen bomb previously was barred from traveling 
abroad because the soviets said his scientific work gave him 
knowledge of state secrets 
for seven years he was also restricted to the closed city of 
gorky because of his outspoken opposition to soviet intervention in 
afghanistan 
but in 1986 gorbachev called him back to moscow since then 
sakharov has generally supported gorbachevs reforms while speaking 
out against some trends including the growing concentration of 
power in gorbachevs hands

the blowtorch santa ana wind calmed saturday 
after driving flames that destroyed or damaged more than 60 homes 
but firefighters said droughtdry hillside brush will remain a 
threat until it rains 
firefighters doused lingering hot spots by early evening in the 
most recent blaze which burned 40 homes caused 43 million damage 
and charred 3200 acres of brush in the san fernando valley said 
fire department spokesman gil espinoza 
its out kaput history espinoza said no firefighters 
remained at the scene by early evening he said 
the cause of that blaze in the fashionable porter ranch 
subdivision remained under investigation espinoza said the blaze 
friday destroyed 14 houses and a mobile home and damaged 25 houses 
officials said 
two other windfanned fires destroyed 22 homes thursday in the 
suburbs of la verne and baldwin park but a damage estimate had not 
been completed officials said 
the drop in the wind saturday removed only one element from the 
potential for disastrous fires said county fire inspector elvin 
miranda 
we have had drought conditions for the past two years he 
said this causes the fuel brush moisture to drop 
because so many years have passed between fires some areas have 
brush stacked up to 25 feet high he added 
from july 1 to dec 10 los angeles received just 079 of an inch 
of rain compared to 469 inches last year said bill hoffer of the 
national weather service in los angeles 
normal precipitation for the period is about 3 inches but hoffer 
noted that even in the best of times southern california gets only 
12 to 14 inches annually 
the chaparral brush covering southern california hillsides 
mostly manzanita scrub oak and mountain mahogany is especially 
explosive because it has adapted to drought by covering its leaves 
with a volatile resin to retain moisture 
a square mile of chaparral that hasnt burned for 30 years holds 
about 25000 tons of dry resinous wood a fuel that firefighters 
often liken to an equivalent amount of gasoline 
when wind drives fire into such heavy brush witnesses have seen 
hillsides explode into flame with burning boughs hurled skyward 
it was raining fire just orange everywhere said porter 
ranch resident eric struthoff whose home friday was reduced to a 
brick chimney and barbecue 
city fire chief donald manning said many of the burned houses had 
wood shingle roofs which he called a disaster waiting to 
happen untreated wood shingles are prohibited on new homes in 
fireprone areas of the city but the code is only a few years old 
and not retroactive 
the northeasterly santa ana winds began blowing from the desert 
wednesday at 30 to 70 mph but by saturday most stations reported 
calm hoffer said 
the santa ana winds are typically caused when a highpressure 
system forms over the northern rocky mountain states while a 
lowpressure system hovers over baja california 
air rushing across the western deserts from high to low pressure 
heats up and dries out and then roars through the passes of 
mountains around the los angeles basin

went right out the front door 
the cause of the fire had not been determined harold said 
more than 125 firefighters five fire engines and two trucks 
battled the blaze which was largely confined to on the 
100footwide 120footlong pier which is surrounded on three 
sides by water and the beach 
harold said problems getting water out to the pier and wind 
helped the fire spread initially and slowed efforts to control it 
late saturday freezing temperatures hampered firefighters 
the trump air helicopter pad at the landward end of the pier was 
closed and scheduled flights to and from new york city were 
rerouted to bader field atlantic citys airport said robert 
shamberg the manager on duty at resorts international
