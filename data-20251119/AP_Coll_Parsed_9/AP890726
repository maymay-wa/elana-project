president bush on wednesday ended the nations 
last price controls on natural gas and announced his administration 
will travel the country soliciting suggestions for an energy policy 
keyed to market forces 
our task is to build the national consensus necessary to 
support this strategy the president said in signing a bill 
ending the last wellhead price controls on natural gas 35 years 
after they were begun 
the law bush signed before a white house audience of members of 
congress from oil producing states and industry representatives 
removes controls on the remaining onethird of natural gas supplies 
subject to price ceilings the ceilings will be abolished by 
january 1993 for existing wells and by may 1991 for wells drilled 
from now on 
the end of price controls is expected to have little or no 
effect in consumer markets since gas is selling well below the 
current ceilings 
years of price controls proved bad for producers and consumers 
bush contended and were responsible for the damaging natural gas 
shortages of the 70s and for gas market distortions that exist to 
this very day 
natural gas supplies one quarter of the nations energy a 1978 
law permitted the decontrol of most supplies starting in 1985 but 
the bill bush signed was necessary to free the rest 
gas prices have fallen from a peak average of 269 per thousand 
cubic feet at the wellhead in 1984 when homeowners paid an average 
of 612 to 171 last year when homeowners averaged 546 
bush called the natural gas deregulation his administrations 
first major energy initiative 
experience shows that deregulation works to serve consumers 
and to serve an expanding economy bush said in a billsigning 
ceremony in the east room its a tribute to the american 
political system that after decades of disagreement over the merits 
of gas decontrol we can gather here today to state a clear message 
for all to hear 
we have learned form the past we are united in the conviction 
that the best way to deal with our energy problems and serve the 
american people is to let our market economy work 
bush announced he was directing energy secretary james watkins 
to come up with a national strategy that will seek to balance the 
nations need for reasonably priced energy supplies commitment to 
a safer and healthier environment a strong economy and reduced 
dependence on foreign energy suppliers 
bush said he would continue pushing for tax incentives to prop 
up declining domestic oil production although he acknowledged he 
was unlikely to win action in congress this year 
many in the industry have advocated protective tariffs or import 
quotas to support domestic production now only 62 percent of 
consumption but both the bush and the reagan administrations have 
resisted on the grounds such protection by raising prices would 
cost more jobs than it would preserve 400000 vs 120000 
according to a 1987 energy department study of a 10 per barrel 
tariff 
the administrations policy drafting comes when 
environmentalists are increasing their attacks on the use of fossil 
fuels which worsens the greenhouse effect warming of the 
globe and when the exxon valdez tanker spill in alaska has 
prompted congress to expand the areas of federal offshore waters 
that are closed to oil and gas exploration 
later before skeptical members of the senate energy and natural 
resources committee watkins defended the need for new hearings 
with the lack of credibiity my department has right now i 
dont think we can pontificate on what the energy policy should 
be watkins said 
sen wendell ford dky noted that national energy issues have 
been studied for a decade and it seems like were kind of 
stirring the broth again 
this is no time for complacency bush said said our 
energy security problem continues conservation achievements are 
leveling off domestic oil production continuing its downward 
trend and petroleum imports are increasing and our need for a 
cleaner environment is obvious to all 
watkins cited several administration concerns domestic oil 
production is at its lowest point in 25 years while imports still 
almost 20 percent below the 1977 peak are 65 percent higher than 
in 1985 
environmental concerns are putting new pressures on our 
ability to use our most abundant domestic fuels like coal 
electricity reserve margins are shrinking across the country 
watkins said 
further he said public confidence in the energy industry is 
at a new low aggravated by alaska spill 
even as watkins was speaking utilities in the pjm power pool 
serving 21 million people in most of new jersey maryland and 
pennsylvania and all of delaware and the district of columbia 
imposed a 5 percent voltage reduction the third this year to 
preserve generating capacity on a hot day of heavy electricity 
demand when seven generating plants were out of service 
watkins said his department will hold public hearings beginning 
tuesday in washington and followed by sessions in tulsa okla on 
aug 8 boise idaho on aug 23 seattle on aug 30 and louisville 
ky on sept 8 all aimed at producing a draft plan by april 1 
he said the administration had no central preconceived focus 
for the strategy and would evaluate every energy source including 
conservation but he indicated he will be pushing for renewed 
emphasis on nuclear power 
he said he would be taking unspecified steps to keep new york 
state from dismantling the shoreham nuclear power plant on long 
island a fully licensed plant that has never operated commercially 
sen phil gramm rtexas who attended the ceremony said 
decontrolling natural gas takes this wet blanket that has crushed 
incentive off the industry and with environmental concerns 
increasing the attractiveness of gas opens up the ability to 
have a fullblown exploration boom 
sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the senate energy and 
natural resources committee said in a statement everybody is a 
winner

bishop rock lighthouse off the isles of scilly at 356 am 1056

crossing aboard the 72foot powerboat virgin atlantic challenger ii 
in three days eight hours and 31 minutes 
gentry tried the break the record in july 1988 but equipment 
aboard his 110foot powerboat continental proud bird was damaged in 
heavy seas and he was force to abandon the crossing after traveling 
1500 miles 
branson whose business interests include the airline virgin 
atlantic and a records and entertainment empire tried to claim the 
150yearold blue riband trophy for his 1986 crossing which cut 
two hours and nine minutes off the speed record held since 1952 by 
the american liner united states 
but the us merchant marine museum at kings point new york 
refused to hand over the trophy museum curator frank braynard said 
at the time that it was for ocean liners not little toy boats 
like virgin atlantic challenger ii 
branson then offered his own virgin atlantic challenger trophy 
to anyone who could beat his record saying he wanted to promote 
and encourage new technology

for a country still with a monarchy after more 
than a thousand years many britains are dunces about their kings 
and queens according to a survey released today

half of those questioned did not know how many wives king henry 
viii had 
six out of 10 did not know which monarch was beheaded by 
parliamentarians eight in 10 could not name the king in power 
during the american revolution and just three people in 10 knew who 
would follow prince charles to the throne 
comments on the poll results said more men than women knew about 
the violent aspects of the monarchy including beheadings and 
battles but more than half the women knew that queen elizabeth i 
was known as the virgin queen while only four men in 10 had the 
right answer 
of the 917 people across the country were interviewed last month 
for the survey those who displayed the greatest ignorance were in 
the 16to24 age group no margin of error was given for the survey 
the answers 
duke william of normandy defeated king harold ii at hastings in 
1066 and then had himself crowned king william i in westminster 
abbey the modern monarchy is dated from william but he was 
preceded by 17 saxon and three danish monarchs 
king henry viii had six wives he divorced two had two 
beheaded one died and one outlived him 
king charles i was beheaded in 1649 by parliamentarians led by 
oliver cromwell

its so hot in britain that an overheated hedgehog 
got its head caught in a water tap and shrimp are mysteriously 
turning up in cheshire tap water 
its hot enough to fry a cliche on the sidewalk though it must 
be said that the sunnysideup egg commissioned for tuesdays 
editions of the tabloid daily mirror appeared distinctly 
undercooked and runny 
it was have mercy a scorching 88 degrees in great malvern 
on tuesday a sizzling 86 in london 
saturdays high of 935 degrees at heathrow airport was the 
hottest temperature recorded on the sceptered isle since a 966 
reading on july 3 1976 
if that sounds like blessed relief to residents of bullhead 
city ariz where it was 117 on monday bear in mind that this is 
britain where 99 is the alltime high 
this is the island vladimir nabokov once joked where spring 
and summer come nearly every year 
keep in mind too that britain isnt designed for summer 
commuter trains dont have fans only windows that provide a 
cooling breath if the train happens to be moving 
ice is a rare commodity in stores air conditioning is spotty 
and refrigerators are often puny little things 
its also been dry with places in the southwest getting less 
than one inch of rain since may 
to judge by londons tabloids the suffering is intense 
baking britain put the worlds hot spots in the shade the sun 
reported tuesday appending a highly selective list of places that 
happened to be cooler bullhead city wasnt mentioned 
the heat wave was believed to be a factor in the strange 
appearance of shrimp some half an inch long that were an 
unexpected bonus in tap water in cheshire the north west water 
authority said the shellfish were harmless though some customers 
it conceded might be put off 
businessmen dared to go bare a lot of men are wearing shorts 
to work said janice english of the british clothing industry 
association and a plumber was seen strolling into the prime 
ministers residence at 10 downing st wearing only his shoes and a 
pair of cutoff jeans 
in neighboring ireland ice cream sales are up 30 percent or 
more from last summer according to the valley ice cream co but 
all the sunshine has been murder on the trout with hundreds 
reportedly dying in depleted streams 
the hot days have been especially miserable in west london 
where hundreds of homes lost their water supply authorities had 
shut down part of a treatment plant to deal with a mayfly 
infestation the customers having found the fly larvae unacceptable 
in their tea or bath 
it was the heat according to firemen in lincoln that drove 
that hedgehog to stick its snout too far into a garden tap 
it was hot tuesday so hot that the forestry commission was 
thinking gloomy thoughts about christmas the heat the commission 
said was stunting the christmas tree crop in sherwood forest

the london festival ballet opened for two weeks 
at the metropolitan opera house with sir frederick ashtons romeo 
and juliet and the evening was a triumph for peter schaufuss as 
romeo 
schaufuss at 40 looked youthful and singlemindedly ardent 
about juliet danced tuesday by 20yearold susan hogard a native 
of australia voted best newcomer by a dance magazine two years 
ago miss hogard is very good but her juliet stopped short of being 
incandescent 
miss hogard seemed more comfortable with the later part of the 
ballet when juliet is making more mature decisions about how to 
keep from marrying paris than in the beginning when the character 
is more girlish 
schaufuss has been the companys artistic director since 1984 
one of his first moves was to talk sir frederick into helping stage 
his romeo for this company sir frederick choreographed it to 
prokofievs music in 1955 for the royal danish ballet where 
schaufuss mother mona vangsaa was the original juliet and his 
father frank schaufuss was the original mercutio the company 
dropped the ballet in 1965 and schaufuss didnt want it to be lost 
it is more spare in numbers of dancers scenery and general 
ambiance than sir kenneth macmillans 1965 romeo and juliet 
for the british royal ballet 
nielsbjorn larsen the original tybalt helped stage this 
production on tuesday frank schaufuss was the prince of verona 
who tries to keep the peace the wellknown british dancers 
alexander grant and lynn seymour were lord and lady capulet graham 
bond conducted the evening which was dedicated to the memory of 
sir frederick 
one high point of the opening night performance was the trio 
showing happiness and friendship of romeo mercutio maximiliano 
guerra and benvolio matz skoog guerra a native of argentina 
who won a gold medal at the varna international ballet competition 
last year was a charming fleet lighthearted mercutio 
his opposite the heavyhanded arrogant tybalt was danced with 
aplomb by londonborn nicholas johnson a company member since 1975 
the london festival ballet changed its name to the english 
national ballet on june 1 but appeared last week in washington and 
now in new york under the old name its last american tour was 11 
years ago 
princess margaret who has been the companys patron for 13 
years was in the audience tuesday night making her last official 
appearance as patron her suggestion that the princess of wales 
succeed her when the name changed has been taken

scores of reinforcements moved into 
central idahos gospel hump wilderness on tuesday in a second day 
of battling two raging wilderness fires one of which doubled in 
size for the second day 
meanwhile smoldering embers from last weeks series of 
drylightning storms sparked another blaze to the south in the 
boise national forest 
additional manpower was added to the 340 firefighters on the 
johnson butte fire after it broke through containment lines again 
monday to sweep across grass and scattered stands of ponderosa 
pine doubling in size to 1000 acres in steep rugged terrain 
the target for containment was pushed back two days to saturday 
and officials predicted the fire would cover 5000 acres before it 
was finally reined in 
nez perce national forest fire bosses also hoped to bring 
manpower up to as many as 300 on the smaller but more intense cape 
horn fire burning on 170 acres of heavier fuel in an almost 
inaccessible canyon about 12 miles to the east 
no private property was threatened by either fire 
meanwhile far to the northeast hundreds of fires had blackened 
more than 22 million acres of forest in northern manitoba and 
saskatchewan canadian officials said the flames had forced the 
evacuation of more than 19000 people 
thousands of gallons of chemical retardant were dropped by 
aerial tankers in an unsuccessful bid to stop the johnson butte 
blaze monday flames overran a break on the northern fire line and 
began spreading south to the main salmon river 
the johnson butte fire grew from 1000 to 2000 acres on tuesday 
as crews worked to establish lines of defense against the flames 
burning through grass and scattered stands of ponderosa pine 
the fire moved more quickly than they estimated so they had to 
abandon that line spokeswoman elayne murphy said its just 
real steep rugged terrain and inaccessible so in order to fight 
this fire what theyre doing is identifying places that are 
accessible and digging in there 
ground crews backed up by five helicopters had three miles of 
fire line but had to carve six more miles 
crews had to hike four miles just to get to the perimeter of the 
cape horn fire and began work on a landing zone to make that blaze 
more accessible three helicopters were prepared to ferry 
firefighers in and out 
no containment target was set yet 
to the south firefighters on monday contained the 230acre 
trail fire near sun valley in central idahos sawtooth national 
forest the resort area was not threatened 
what really saved us was that they already had an air tanker 
in the air yesterday and they diverted it to us spokeswoman 
barbara todd said those four or five retardant drops helped 
out 
elsewhere in idaho the situation was improved from last week 
when a series of storms hit western and central idaho forests with 
hundreds of dry lightning strikes

space shuttle columbia could be 
launched on a secret military mission in about two weeks if nasa 
officials turn up no problems during todays flight readiness 
review 
one possible hitch could be a valve problem the cause of which 
engineers have been seeking for two days if the valve must be 
replaced it could add two to three days to the launch processing 
time 
the space agency said last week it hopes to launch columbia 
during the week of aug 7 with five astronauts and a defense 
department payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance 
satellite 
a firm launch date announcement was expected late this afternoon 
after the valve problem has been thoroughly assessed and the 
readiness of the orbiter the payload the global tracking network 
and all other mission elements have been evaluated 
the decision will come at the conclusion of a twoday review 
headed by bill lenoir national aeronautics and space 
administrations acting associate administrator for space flight 
the valve problem was detected early monday following a brief 
test firing of columbias three auxiliary power units which 
provide hydraulic power for moveable control surfaces such as wing 
flaps rudder and speed brake 
radio data indicated a hydrazine fuel valve serving one of the 
units was stuck open when it should have been closed 
initial analysis indicated the valve worked properly and that a 
bad sensor might have given a faulty reading engineers continued 
studying the situation to learn exactly what went wrong

a mans dispute with his estranged wife led 
him and his halfbrother to open fire on church members during a 
bible study class killing the wifes cousin and an elderly woman 
police said tuesday 
albert lewis jr 33 and his halfbrother anthony oliver 27 
were arrested at 7 pm monday for investigation of murder in the 
friday night shooting by two hooded gunmen at mount olive church of 
god in christ said cmdr william booth they were held without 
bail 
just hours before the attack a judge ordered lewis to remain 
more than 100 yards from the church and several family members 
after his wife cynthia worthenlewis claimed he had abused her 
according to court records 
mrs worthenlewis said that lewis had called her earlier in the 
week and said he was going to kill me according to her court 
declaration to obtain a restraining order 
mrs worthenlewis is the cousin of gospel singer patronella 
worthen luke fatally shot in the attack that also killed 
76yearold mae lee and wounded mrs lukes husband in the leg 
booth said 
we want to assure the public that this was not gangrelated 
booth said detectives believe the shooting stemmed from a 
domestic dispute 
clergy members and parishioners had voiced fear that the 
killings were committed by gang members or drug dealers in the 
churchs neighborhood 
ms lee appeared to be a bystander hit by gunfire as she went 
toward the church door but police were investigating whether she 
was linked to the luke or lewis families said lt charles massey

a state judge on tuesday upheld gov mario 
cuomos agreement with the long island lighting company to have the 
state buy the shoreham nuclear power plant for 1 and have it 
dismantled 
a group of long island residents taxpayers business groups and 
labor unions had challenged the deal on the grounds that cuomo had 
usurped the legislatures power 
last year cuomo and lilco officials had negotiated a similar 
shoreham closing deal only to see it fall apart because the 
legislature wouldnt give its required approval 
cuomo castigating the legislature for being afraid of potential 
political fallout reached a new agreement with lilco officials in 
february that he said did not require legislative input or approval 
lou lewis a poughkeepsie ny lawyer representing the long 
island opponents of the agreement said kahns ruling would be 
appealed 
i feel the judge made some serious errors of fact and law 
said lewis i find this decision very surprising 
lewis said he had no fear of shoreham quickly being torn down 
he noted that in addition to his lawsuit a group of pronuclear 
scientists represented by the conservative atlantic legal 
foundation also has a suit against the agreement pending in state 
court and he noted that the federal nuclear regulatory commission 
still must approve the transfer of the shoreham license from lilco 
to the state 
under the shoreham agreement already approved by lilco 
shareholders and several state agencies involved the completed 
55 billion plant on the eastern end of long island would be sold 
to the state for 1 and then the state would tear it down at 
lilcos expense 
in return lilco has won agreement from the state for a series 
of annual electric rate increases of about 5 percent that are 
expected to go on for a decade or more lilco customers already pay 
among the highest electric rates in the nation and the agreement to 
have even higher rates is what had some legislators upset about 
backing any such deal 
cuomo has maintained that it is cheaper to close shoreham than 
to allow it to operate hes also argued that its unsafe to 
operate the plant because the area surrounding it couldnt be 
safely evacuated if there was an emergency 
should the agreement be completed it would mark the first time 
in this nations history that a completed nuclear power plant has 
ever been dismantled before going on line the shoreham plant 
has never operated at anything above a 5 percent testing level

many puzzling cancers and inherited 
diseases might be explained by a radical new finding that not all 
genes are created equal genes passed on by fathers may be 
different from those passed on by mothers 
researchers are beginning to accept evidence that began to 
appear in the early 1980s suggesting that mothers and fathers each 
imprint genes with different signals before passing them on to 
their children 
the findings contradict one of the principles of genetics 
established in the last century by gregor mendel that it made no 
difference to a child whether it inherited a genetic trait from its 
mother or its father 
that now seems wrong genetic imprinting by mothers and fathers 
may be responsible for many kinds of cancer and inherited diseases 
said dr judith hall of the university of british columbia in 
canada 
this is just absolutely mindboggling hall said during a 
meeting of geneticists at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor 
its a new way of thinking nobody believed this stuff until just 
about now 
she said that only about onethird of inherited diseases are 
explained by conventional mendelian genetics 
the problem has been how to explain the other things she 
said 
imprinting may be the answer 
for example children have 23 pairs of chromosomes and they 
normally get one set from each parent but children who mistakenly 
get two copies of chromosome 7 from their mother and no copy from 
their father can have severe growth retardation before and after 
birth 
conventional genetics says that shouldnt happen all you need 
is two good copies of the chromosome and it shouldnt matter which 
parent they came from 
in another example hall listed children who get a defective 
copy of chromosome 15 from their fathers and a normal one from 
their mothers can inherit a disease called praderwili syndrome 
marked by muscle disorders and extreme obesity 
children who get a defective copy of chromosome 15 from their 
mothers and a normal one from their fathers get an entirely 
different disease it is called angelman syndrome and is marked by 
bizarre inappropriate laughter and jerky movements 
halls hypothesis is that the defective chromosome 15 from the 
father had a different genetic imprint than the defective 
chromosome 15 from the mother 
john shire a geneticist at the university of essex in england 
said experiments with mice also have shown evidence of imprinting 
genetic engineering can be used for example to create a 
fertilized mouse egg that has two sets of normal maternal 
chromosomes and no paternal chromosomes 
the egg has the appropriate number of chromosomes but its 
development is severely arrested the egg develops into a fetus 
when implanted into a mouse but it does not produce a healthy 
placenta and the embryo dies 
when researchers make a mouse egg with two sets of normal 
paternal chromosomes the placenta develops nicely but the fetus 
doesnt and again it dies 
it takes a set from mom and a set from dad in mammals to be 
viable said hall 
this seems to be true only in mammals not in birds or other 
animals she said 
cancer research has shown that in some cases losing a chromosome 
from a mother is more likely to cause cancer than losing a 
chromosome from a father 
in most spontaneously arising cases of a kidney cancer called 
wilms tumor and a bone cancer called osteosarcoma a mothers 
chromosome has been lost not a fathers 
researchers do not know why imprinting occurs one guess is that 
it has something to do with allowing a fetus to grow inside a 
mother a phenomenon peculiar to mammals without being rejected 
or taking over the mothers body hall said 
some evidence of imprinting has existed since the early part of 
the century shire said but scientists couldnt explain it 
when you get odd results the natural feeling is to put them 
on the back burner and hope one day youll understand them he 
said

as japan reels from a sex scandal 
that helped topple a prime minister the sexcapades of 
philippine lawmakers are providing filipinos with what has turned 
into a political soap opera 
on monday japanese prime minister sousuke uno announced he will 
resign over his partys loss of 33 upper house seats due in part 
to published reports alleging uno had kept several paid mistresses 
meanwhile philippine newspaper and radio commentators have been 
titillating their audiences for weeks with rumors of affairs by 
their own senators and members of the house of representatives 
the only casualty so far has been sen orlando mercado who 
resigned this month as senate majority leader after rumors that he 
was involved in a sex scandal mercado denies the allegation 
mercados resignation followed newspaper reports that an 
undisclosed senator had impregnated the daughter of an upper house 
colleague 
on friday columnist julie yap daza wrote in the manila standard 
that according to the latest rumor an unnamed woman senator was 
having an affair with her chauffeur 
that rankled the two women in the 23member senate sen leticia 
ramosshahani and sen santanina rasul both well into middleage 
they demanded an investigation by the senate ethics committee to 
put a stop to the rumors 
according to another rumor the chauffeur of a prominent male 
senator quit his job because of the pressure of trying to keep 
track of his bosses multiple mistresses 
in a roman catholic country that forbids divorce keeping 
mistresses referred to here as second wives is not uncommon 
some prominent figures make little attempt to hide their second 
wives 
but some commentators fear the rumors cheapen the government 
institutions which were supposed to have elevated political life 
after the 1986 ouster of president ferdinand marcos 
the obsession with sex scandals also distracts public and 
legislative attention from pressing national problems such as 
poverty the communist insurgency and the breakdown in law and 
order 
the point is that sex gossip about congress members have 
become conversation pieces no longer because of their serious moral 
implications but for their comic relief wrote hern zenarosa in 
the philippines journal 
senate president jovito salonga has resisted an investigation 
into his colleagues sex lives the constitution provides for 
censure of congressmen guilty of disorderly behavior 
salonga suggested that whatever happens in the bedroom cannot 
be considered disorderly except by your mate 
the rumors are fueled by a practice in philippine newspapers of 
printing thinly veiled accusations often with no source at all for 
the information 
such allegations rarely include names nonetheless they are 
often accepted as gospel by a public that still distrusts 
government after 20 years of misrule under marcos 
who is that ranking congressman who regularly takes his 
girlfriend via governmentowned helicopter to an island mountain 
resort wrote columnist emil jurado in the manila standard 
would you believe that an illegitimate son of a ranking member 
of corys president corazon aquino cabinet has been appointed to 
a very juicy position in his fathers department he added

a continental dc9 skidded to an emergency 
landing tuesday night at newark international airport after a 
hydraulic failure but none of the 89 people aboard was injured 
officials said 
in another incident tuesday a united airlines pilot who thought 
his jet had lost its hydraulic system switched to a backup system 
and diverted the plane to a landing at dallasfort worth 
international airport 
flight 354 from chicago to newark made the emergency landing 
shortly after 8 pm said vincent bonaventura the general manager 
of the airport 
continental spokesman ned walker said in a telephone interview 
from houston that the plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one 
of its hydraulic systems and a partial loss of the other 
the plane blew four of its six tires upon landing walker said 
lynn tierney a spokeswoman for the port authority of new york and 
new jersey said the plane dumped an undetermined amount of fuel 
before landing to reduce the possibility of a fire 
the captain had full control of the aircraft at all times 
full control of the landing gear and flaps walker said he said 
that on a dc9 the operation of certain controls is improved by 
the hydraulics systems but they continue working if the hydraulics 
are lost 
he said the tires blew out because the captain following 
established procedures turned off the antiskid system which is 
designed to prevent the wheels from locking up 
the plane ended up perpendicular to the runway after using about 
threequarters of the runway port authority officials said 
the flights 82 passengers who were told to brace themselves 
for the emergency landing went down an emergency ladder from the 
plane along with the seven crew members 
passengers said they were shaken by the accident after last 
weeks united crash in iowa 
i realized i didnt want to die this way passenger trent 
webb said you think about the crash before 
sgt anthony infante who works on the port authoritys rescue 
squad said there have been 320 hydraulic alerts this year at 
newark but he said that inlcudes everything from a stuck light to 
something as serious as tuesdays incident 
in the second incident united flight 275 en route from chicago 
to houstons hobby airport made its landing at dallasfort worth 
international airport late tuesday afternoon the airline said 
it was not an emergency landing it was a precautionary 
landing said united spokeswoman sara dornacker 
the boeing 737 was carrying 64 passengers two pilots and three 
flight attendants none was injured she said 
the pilot suspected the jet had a hydraulic problem when a 
warning light flashed on 
the aircraft was checked out and the mechanics found no 
problem with it ms dornacker said the flight resumed at 530 
pm and landed in houston at a little more than an hour later 
a complete hydraulic failure forced the emergency landing last 
wednesday of united flight 232 at sioux city iowa the dc10 
somersaulted broke apart and burst into flames killing 111 people 
an engine apparently blew itself apart on flight 232 and severed 
all three hydraulic systems depriving the pilot of controls other 
than the throttles

at one point tuesday exactly 254 tourists sat in the senate 
visitors gallery awaiting a thrilling debate they peered down on 
a nearly empty chamber where only two senators sam nunn of 
georgia and john kerry of massachusetts chatted amiably 
it was kind of boring to me said bob duax of davenport 
iowa who waited five minutes for something to happen and then left 
i expected to see all the senators debating a bill and sending 
runners here and there to pick up something he said but then 
i figured its 12 oclock and theyre all at lunch 
duax thought a moment and added we pay them enough they 
ought to be working 
i was disappointed schoolteacher karen white of detroit 
said later they were not the great orators id imagined she 
complained particularly about sen alan dixon dill he spoke 
poorly he wasnt prepared the analogies he drew were

a survey of cardiac specialists suggests that 
as many as 3000 patients may have died prematurely after taking 
heartbeat control drugs that were found to increase risk of sudden 
death among some types of patients 
dr joel morganroth professor of medicine at the university of 
pennsylvania said he estimated the toll after surveying 1000 
cardiologists to learn how many prescribed encainide or flecainide 
for patients who had mild heartbeat irregularities after recovering 
from a heart attack 
morganroth who also is director of cardiac research at graduate 
hospital in philadelphia said the estimate of 3000 premature 
deaths was a rough number 
lets call that the worst scenario he said 
none of the surveyed doctors were involved in drug trials that 
tested encainide and flecainide but the physicians were 
prescribing the drugs for the same type of patients in the trials 
encainide and flecainide were approved in 1987 for preventing a 
type of cardiac arrhythmia that features extra ventricular beats 
a national study of the drugs called the cardiac arrhythmia 
suppression trial or cast began in june 1987 it was halted 
abruptly in april when data showed sudden death rates increased 
among patients taking the drugs 
morganroth said he conducted a random survey to determine how 
many premature deaths outside the study could be associated with 
the drugs 
he said 250 cardiologists responded to his survey half saying 
they had prescribed the drugs based on these results morganroth 
said he extrapolated the number of premature deaths by factoring in 
national heart attack death rate statistics and the prescription 
record for the two drugs 
fifteen hundred to 2000 died if all the assumptions are 
appropriate in the year before the cast study was revised he 
said for the previous year when the drugs were not as widely 
used he estimates the premature deaths at 750 to 1000 
physicians weekly which reported on the survey called the 
drug trials a suddendeath debacle 
before a trial found that two drugs to block sudden death 
actually triggered it thousands may have died prematurely the 
magazine said 
patients in the cast studies which were initiated by the 
national institutes of health had suffered a heart attack and then 
experienced very mild irregular ventricular heart beats these 
arrhythmias caused no noticeable problems to the patient and were 
thus called asymptomatic 
morganroth said it was known that the sudden death rate among 
such patients was 15 to 2 times greater than among heart attack 
patients who had no such arrhythmias 
casts objective was to take people with these arrhythmias 
give half of them sugar pills and half a drug that suppresses the 
irregular heartbeats he said it was hoped that the group 
getting encainide and flecainide would have less death than the 
people who got sugar pills 
it turns out these two drugs paradoxically surprisingly 
unexpectedly had the opposite effect 
use of encainide and flecainide in the cast trials ended after 
an nih panel discovered that 57 of 730 patients taking the drugs 
died of cardiac arrest while only 22 of 725 patients taking the 
placebos died of cardiac arrest 
dr thomas bigger a columbia university heart researcher who 
was chairman of the cast studies said the episode with encainide 
and flecainide is such a startling finding that everybody is 
rethinking the use of drugs to control irregular heartbeats 
encainide marketed as enkaid by bristolmyers and flecainide 
sold as tambocor by 3m riker are still being prescribed but only 
for patients who have lifethreatening levels of irregular 
heartbeat said dr lawrence friedman the nih director of the cast 
studies 
the drug companies have sent out revised labeling on what type 
of patients should receive the medication 
there certainly is a place for these drugs friedman said 
but from our study it is clear that people with mild arrhythmias 
should not be treated with these drugs

president bush hopes tough talk will force 
foreign governments to stop subsidizing their domestic steel 
industries but lawmakers in us steel states remain skeptical 
after months of internal debate in his cabinet bush said 
tuesday he was extending steelimport restrictions for 2 years 
the steel industry had sought a fiveyear extension 
the voluntary import quotas which cover 29 countries were due 
to expire sept 30 they will be extended to march 31 1992 if 
congress as expected agrees 
bush said the extension would give us trade representative 
carla hills time to negotiate an end to unfair steel subsidies 
provided by other countries 
if the subsidies arent removed foreign producers will be 
vulnerable to having unfair trade complaints lodged against them 
which could boost the cost of their products in the united states 
bush said 
but sen john heinz rpa complained that bushs decision 
undercut hills negotiating position by fixing a date when the 
quotas would end 
the chances are slim to none that even the most determined 
us negotiators can end a generation of government subsidizing and 
unfair practices in a mere 2 years he said 
under the voluntary restraint agreements 29 countries 
including japan south korea brazil and the 12nation european 
community had agreed to limit their imports of steel to 184 
percent of the us market 
the quotas were imposed by the reagan administration in 1984 
after an intense campaign waged by steel companies and unions 
representing steel workers 
there was never any question that bush would support some quota 
extension because he had promised to do so in a letter to heinz 
four days before novembers presidential election 
but bushs advisers were deeply split on the issue with some 
arguing that the us steel industry which enjoyed profits of 2 
billion last year no longer needed protection 
bushs announcement was greeted favorably by steel users who 
praised the presidents commitment not to extend the quotas beyond 
30 months the coalition against the quotas ranged from us 
automakers to farmers who must buy farm equipment made from steel 
tim elder of caterpillar inc one of the companies lobbying 
hardest against the quotas said the 2year limit was the light 
at the end of the tunnel for steel consumers after that time he 
said the market would determine steel availability and prices 
bushs action was expected to have little trouble winning 
congressional approval 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski whose 
committee has jurisdiction over the measure praised bush for 
striking a careful balance between producers and consumers 
house minority leader bob michel rill said the decision was 
in the best interests of our steel companies our steel users and 
american workers and consumers 
but lynn williams president of the united steelworkers of 
america said bushs action fell short of his campaign promise to 
heinz 
our members have already made deep concessions to help the 
industry survive williams said but we have found the 
government to be unwilling to respond to a systematic malaise of 
unfair foreign steel practices 
howard m love the chairman of national steel corp the 
countrys sixthlargest steel company said he was disappointed 
with the administrations decision because 30 months was a short 
time to try to eliminate the unfair and illegal subsidies of 
foreign steel producers by their governments 
hills said the administration would try to get the foreign 
subsidies eliminated both in countrybycountry negotiations and in 
the 96nation trade talks aimed at liberalizing the world trading 
system 
bushs quota extension will allow the foreign market share to 
rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are phased out 
entirely hills said that yearly increase would be allocated to 
countries that exhibit the most willingness to stop subsidizing 
their domestic industry 
when the steel quotas were imposed in 1984 imports accounted 
for 265 percent of the american market last year that dropped to 
207 percent

marines fight better when they fight smarter 
says the commanding officer so the order of the day mandates more 
reading 
for sergeants a book list starts by saying read a minimum of 
two books ideally four annually the mandate for colonels is 
three to start with six ideally 
the idea to tote books not just guns comes from the commandant 
of the marine corps gen am gray 
i firmly believe that professional reading is essential to the 
professional growth of our leaders gray said in a recent message 
to all marine barracks the profession of arms in particular 
has a profound body of knowledge which requires constant study if a 
leader is to remain proficient 
all of the books on the list give some military lessons whether 
it be leadership qualities from eb hubbards a message to 
garcia or tactics taken from mao zedongs on guerrilla 
warfare 
the marines can select from biographies such as the patton 
papers or the years of macarthur leo tolstoys war and 
peace is on the list along with alexander solzhenitsyns 
august 1914 von clausewitzs on war and neil sheehans 
pulitzer prize winner a bright shining lie 
the study of our profession through the selected readings will 
assist each marines efforts to achieve operational competence and 
to better understand the nature of our calling as leaders of 
marines gray said 
the reading program is part of an overall educational update for 
the corps explained chief warrant officer eric carlson a marine 
corps spokesman who added marines already do a lot of reading 
on their own 
carlson said the educational program also calls for setting up 
the marine corps university at the combat development command at 
quantico va starting aug 1 he said the university will act as 
an umbrella for the corps four officers training schools at 
quantico and will provide uniform training

americas wives are bringing home a lot more 
of the family bacon than they used to but still trail their 
husbands by a wide margin the census bureau reports 
wives earned just 57 percent of what their husbands brought in 
as of 1987 although their income had increased nearly twice as 
fast as the mens during the decade 
between 1981 and 1987 the average earnings of wives rose 233 
percent while husbands income climbed 118 percent according to 
the study earnings of marriedcouple families 1987 
that brought average income of all wives including those not 
employed outside the home to 13245 in 1987 compared with 
29154 for all husbands 
a major reason for the gain by women was that more of them are 
working yearround full time instead of part time census 
statistician robert w cleveland said tuesday in past years he 
said women were more likely to accept parttime jobs resulting in 
lower average income 
also more women are in professional and technical jobs which 
tend to have better pay cleveland said adding that one factor 
in the change is the tendency of women in recent years to pursue 
more education 
i think there is more equal treatment things are not as 
discriminatory for women the opportunities are more available for 
them now than in the past cleveland said 
wives working full time at least 50 weeks per year averaged 
18929 in 1987 only 57 percent of the average 33005 annual 
earnings of husbands who worked full time 50 weeks or more 
recent government statistics for all men and women showed women 
averaging 65 percent of mens income somewhat more than the 57 
percent for fulltime working wives 
wives are more likely to have to take time off to tend children 
or to have delayed careers during child rearing than women in 
general 
indeed the effect of children may be noted in the incomes of 
wives by age as reported in the study 
the most rapid income rise between 1981 and 1987 was among wives 
aged 35 to 44 who saw their average jump 315 percent more than 
triple the 98 percent increase for husbands in the same age group 
in that age bracket the kids are grown the women can enter 
the labor force and start working full time cleveland said 
for all wives those with no children averaged 14256 in 1987 
compared with 13067 for women with children aged 6 to 17 12163 
for those with children under age 6 and just 10732 for those with 
children in both age groups 
husbands averaged 31636 for those with children aged 6 to 17 
while those with some under 6 and some 6 to 17 averaged 29564 
for those with children under 6 average income was 28181 and it 
was 27755 for husbands without children 
while husbands may bring home most of the bacon for a majority 
of families that isnt a universal situation 
about 53 million wives earned more than their husbands in 1987 
about 18 percent of the 291 million married couples in which both 
husband and wife had earnings the report said 
in many cases husbands were 55 or older and often partly 
retired cleveland said while their wives tended to be slightly 
younger and still working full time wives who earned more than 
their husbands were more likely than other wives to have attended 
college and to have no children at home the report found

the emerging third world was once viewed 
eagerly as one of the american farmers best hopes of staying in 
the export bigtime a foreign market that grew by huge leaps and 
showed little sign of slackening 
but that was before huge debt problems settled on the third 
world today brazil leads the list with foreign debts totaling 
120 billion and mexico is not far behind at 107 billion and 
there are others 
the debt problem has proved to be highly intractable and will 
probably limit growth in the world economy for years to come 
says agriculture department economist matthew shane 
estimates indicate that third world debt has reduced us 
agricultural exports by about 3 billion a year since 1982 shane 
said in the august issue of agricultural outlook magazine published 
by the departments economic research service 
before the debt problem developing countries were the fastest 
growing market for us agricultural exports said shane deputy 
director of the agencys agricultural trade analysis division 
during the 1970s developing countries increased their purchases 
of us farm products by nearly 11 percent per year after 
inflation 
but in the 1980s purchases dropped at an annual rate of 4 
percent even so the third worlds share of us commodity exports 
has risen to more than 40 percent 
the debt problem has constrained imports of third world 
countries in two ways he said first governments immediate 
response to a debt repayment problem is to reduce imports freeing 
foreign exchange earned from exports for additional debt payments 
second in the longer term debt payments compete with 
investment for national savings reduced investment lowers 
longterm economic growth and thereby shrinks demand for us 
agricultural products 
shane said that between 1973 and 1981 us agricultural exports 
to countries now considered problem debtors climbed an average 
of 154 percent a year 
but from 1981 through 1987 exports to those countries fell an 
average of 10 percent annually 
although brazil and mexico head the list of debtburdened farm 
customers other problem debtors include argentina chile morocco 
nigeria and the philippines 
a problem country in the context of us agricultural exports 
was defined as one with foreign debt over 10 billion and having 
repayment problems since 1982 
the share of total agricultural exports going to problem 
debtor countries rose to 14 percent in 1980 but has since fallen to 
10 percent shane said without substantial debt relief these 
countries will become stagnant markets for us farm products 
shane said that in contrast to the debtburdened countries

54 percent compared with a 34 percent growth in overall us farm

consumers soon may be enjoying homegrown 
cocoa from puerto rico instead of relying entirely on foreign 
production according to a team of agriculture department 
scientists 
cocoa the raw ingredient of chocolate was tried in the 1940s 
as a crop in puerto rico but failed because of disease and insect 
problems said agronomist edmundo rivera of the departments 
agricultural research service 
however he said in a report tuesday by the agency puerto rico 
has been free of black pod fungus the disease that threatens 
production in other areas but problems still persist including 
the ability of cocoa crops to tolerate acid soil and resist insect 
damage 
last year the united states imported more than 800 million 
worth of cocoa beans powder and cocoa butter the nations entire 
supply from brazil the main exporter and other producers 
including west africa central america and the dominican republic 
heber irizzary an agency horticulturist said cocoa can be an 
alternative crop that puerto rican farmers can grow on steep 
marginal soils or on land once used for sugar cane 
cane once a staple of the islands economy has become less 
profitable because of low yields higher costs of production and 
lower market prices 
irizzary and rivera who work at the usda agencys tropical 
crops and germplasm research laboratory in mayaguez for the past 
eight years have been studying cocoa hybrids from many countries to 
adapt them to puerto rico 
experimental trials of cocoa strains from costa rica in the 
early 1980s last year produced a yield potential of 3500 pounds to 
4000 pounds per acre from 6yearold trees they said yields of 
2000 pounds per acre are considered marketable 
also the agency said cocoa from the test trees has been 
evaluated favorably by four of the largest us chocolate 
manufacturers 
rivera said cocoa would meet the need for crops in puerto rico 
that are suited to small family operations since it can be grown 
with a minimum amount of tillage and doesnt require expensive 
machinery

a tax deadlock between congress and president 
bush is dampening hopes for a 1991 budget deal but lawmakers are 
pushing ahead with six multibillion dollar spending bills for the 
coming fiscal year 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said tuesday that bushs 
aggressive campaign to cut the capital gains tax is troubling and 
may result in democrats leaving the president with the task of 
proposing how to slash the 1991 federal deficit to 64 billion 
the budget blueprint for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 calls 
for 53 billion in new tax receipts 
to raise most of that money bush has been trying to persuade 
wavering democrats on the taxwriting house ways and means 
committee to join republicans and cut the capital gains tax paid 
when property is sold at a profit 
the administration says a lower rate would stimulate sales of 
property and thus generate money for the government democrats say 
the cut would mainly put money in the pockets of the rich and cost 
the government revenue in the long run 
coupled with bushs continued refusal to raise taxes the 
presidents effort is annoying growing numbers of democrats among 
the angry lawmakers are some who hope to negotiate a budget deal 
for fiscal 1991 in talks later this year including house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
panetta said it would be hard for him to hammer out a 
deficitcutting agreement with the white house if its seen as 
purely a political operation that doesnt want to work out a 
resolution on substance 
on more immediate business congressional committees approved 
six fiscal 1990 spending bills tuesday with less than six weeks of 
congressional business left until oct 1 the house has passed five 
of the appropriations bills needed annually to keep the government 
functioning and the senate has approved none 
the house appropriations committee approved an 184 billion 
measure for the treasury postal service and a slew of other 
agencies a 1552 billion bill for the departments of health and 
human services labor and education and a 58 billion package for 
the departments of commerce justice state and the federal 
judiciary 
across the capitol the senate appropriations committee passed 
bills containing 44 billion for agriculture programs 18 billion 
for energy and water projects and 105 billion for the interior 
department and for federal cultural programs 
the senate finance committee also approved adding 60 billion to 
the amount the government can borrow enough to see it through oct 
31 the 28 trillion debt limit is expected to be breached 
sometime next month and lawmakers want to add some leeway before 
they leave aug 5 for their fourweek recess

michael dukakis walked off the stage after his 
final debate with george bush and told a top aide i blew it 
according to a new book about the presidential race 
dukakis knew he had committed a serious error by responding 
without emotion to a question about the possibility of his wife 
being raped and killed political columnists jack germond and jules 
witcover write in whose broad stripes and bright stars the 
trivial pursuit of the presidency 1988 
aides were baffled at dukakis fumbled answer because the 
massachusetts governor had rehearsed an effective answer to a 
softoncrime question 13 times during debate preparations 
advance copies of the book published by warner books drew 
notice earlier this month for critical comments about vice 
president dan quayle attributed to quayles campaign aides 
president bush said he was offended by republican advisers 
quoted by germond and witcover who called quayle a lightweight 
and described him as having a childlike immaturity 
dukakis debate response widely criticized at the time was to 
a question by moderator bernard shaw of cnn who asked if he would 
favor the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered 
germond and witcover write that the three other journalists on 
the panel were told of shaws question in advance and tried 
unsuccessfully to talk him into softening it 
dukakis response began no i dont bernard and i think you 
know ive opposed the death penalty all of my life i dont see any 
evidence that its a deterrent and i think there are better and 
more effective ways to deal with violent crime weve done so in my 
own state 
dukakis answer was flat and bloodless and it was remembered by 
voters because it captured the candidates most glaring 
vulnerabilities according to the book 
the authors say dukakis walked off the stage in los angeles and 
told top aide john sasso i blew it 
the book also describes the bush campaigns successful focus on 
a handful of issues used to create negative feelings about dukakis 
those issues included dukakis veto of a bill requiring students to 
say the pledge of allegiance his support for a law allowing 
convicted murderers to be furloughed from prison and opposition to 
the death penalty

transportation secretary samuel skinner says 
dc10 airliners are safe and that theres no need for federal 
intervention as a result of last weeks crash in sioux city iowa 
skinner said tuesday that he based his decision on the record of 
the more than 400 triplejet dc10s in service its manufacturer 
douglas aircraft says dc10s have flown 745 million passengers 7 
billion miles over two decades 
however dc10s have been in some of historys worst air 
disasters including a 1979 chicago crash that killed 275 people 
that crash was blamed on a faulty maintenance procedure by american 
airlines 
nothing in the planes record indicates its either inherently 
unsafe or that anything needs to be done that hasnt been done 
skinner said 
if evidence is uncovered during the national transportation 
safety boards investigation of the july 19 iowa crash that killed 
111 people that indicates a problem action will be taken skinner 
said 
investigators are focusing on evidence that the tail engine of 
the united airlines dc10 blew up disabling its hydraulic steering 
system but they are still trying to determine what caused the 
explosive engine failure 
the federal aviation administration has the power to ground an 
airplane as it did with the dc10 after the 1979 crash

senate republican leader bob dole says 
partisan differences over a democraticbacked disasterrelief bill 
could scuttle chances of getting quick assistance to farmers who 
have lost crops 
however democrats say dole is exaggerating the dispute over the 
955 million measure which the senate agriculture committee 
approved tuesday on a partyline vote 
the legislation costs at least 300 million less than the house 
version but thats 70 million more than president bush wants to 
spend republicans say the measure covers too many crops more than 
500 
weve got to find some way to bring the two sides together 
or there may not be a drought bill said dole concerned about 
getting help to droughtstricken wheat farmers in his home state of 
kansas 
calling the legislation a disaster itself dole said 
differences may not be resolved in time to get drought relief to 
the presidents desk before the august congressional recess 
sen bob kerrey dneb said the differences between committee 
republicans and democrats were almost indistinguishable 
committee chairman patrick leahy dvt had postponed a vote 
last week in the hope of reaching a bipartisan accord he brought 
the bill to a vote tuesday after it became apparent republicans 
would insist on targeting disaster relief to soybeans and crops in 
the governments farm program primarily wheat corn rice and 
cotton 
wheat and other crops have been damaged because of the lingering 
drought across much of the great plains from texas to north 
dakota and flooding has destroyed rice and cotton in the south 
the senate democrats bill would cover the same crops as the 
house legislation but farmers would have to show a bigger loss to 
qualify for disaster relief and the government payments would be 
smaller 
the administration is trying to limit disaster relief to 870 
million but senate democrats argue that an additional 85 million 
could be made available if some of the payments come from this 
years budget instead of next years 
the administration insists all the drought relief come from the 
1990 budget 
under the committee bill farmers who grow wheat corn and other 
program crops could qualify for relief if they lost at least 40 
percent of the grain farmers of other crops would have to show a 
45 percent loss to qualify 
the minimum loss required by the house bill is 35 percent 
democrats say that the gop position that crops in the farm 
program should get first crack at drought relief is unfair to 
farmers who grow other commodities discourages farms from 
diversifying and makes it politically more difficult to pass the 
legislation 
the debate spilled onto the senate floor after the committee 
vote tuesday when dole denounced the democratic bill 
the american farmer doesnt expect us to shovel out money 
every time something happens dole said

most medical waste that washes up on the 
nations beaches comes from illegal drug users and individuals not 
hospitals according to a new study 
the medical waste policy committee said in its report that a 
federal law that took effect last month wont do much to reduce the 
used needles syringes and other medical trash plaguing the 
nations shoreline 
legislators have said the law will prevent a repeat of last 
summer when waves of medical waste washed up along popular east 
coast beaches 
laws and regulations specifically aimed at medical waste such 
as the medical waste tracking act are unlikely to have a 
significant effect on the amount of medical waste found on the 
beaches said richard a bernstein head of general medical corp 
and chairman of the committee 
the problem bernstein said isnt with hospitals but with home 
health uses which account for nearly 1 billion syringes annually 
the committee under the auspices of the rockefeller institute 
of government at the state university of new york encouraged 
public education programs on proper disposal of used medical items 
bernstein presented the results of the sixmonth study tuesday 
to the house small business subcommittee on regulation and business 
opportunities 
authors of the measure defended it 
there is no reason why medical waste shouldnt be tracked in 
the same way other hazardous waste is tracked that was a hole in 
the law said jason isaacson spokesman for sen christopher j 
dodd dconn a chief backer of the legislation 
did it finally resolve all present and future problems with 
medical waste of course not is there room to do more of course 
there is but it was a substantial first step isaacson said 
robin woods of the environmental protection agency said the 
law would help because it regulates for the first time small 
healthcare providers such as clinics laboratories and doctors 
offices 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the subcommittee said the 
research shows that this country badly needs a clear uniform 
policy that creates incentives for safe costeffective management 
of this waste 
one year after needles on our beaches were frontpage news 
the bulk of this waste remains largely unregulated and 
uncontrolled wyden said

into complaints against gop whip newt gingrich 
the panel said tuesday it had asked the house administration 
committee to hire the chicago law firm of phelan pope amp john ltd 
at a cost of 150000 
wright resigned from the house last month after the ethics

outside income and a house rule preventing acceptance of gifts from 
those with a direct interest in legislation 
gingrich the secondranking house gop leader called 
alexanders charges baseless and said any serious review of 
the allegations would indicate how politically motivated they 
were 
alexanders complaint focused on the cos limited partnership 
which consisted of 21 investors who contributed 5000 each to 
promote window of opportunity a book written by the georgia 
republican his wife and a third author 
gingrich was not an investor but his wife was paid for running

drug czar william j bennett says his national 
drug program will focus on the battle against crack 
its crack that is responsible for the disorder in many of our 
cities bennett said tuesday describing the strategy his office 
of national drug control must unveil by sept 5 
its crack which is endangering the lives of so many innocent 
civilians because of the tendency for violence its crack which is 
appearing with terrible frequency as the drug sought out by 
pregnant addicts 
crack is a cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine that is 
smoked 
while programs focusing on other illegal drugs also are 
important the campaign against crack takes precedence because it 
presents the clearest most immediate danger to the largest 
number of people bennett said 
bennett also told reporters that states that fail to impose 
strict antidrug policies may risk losing federal funds 
we will expect states to do certain things if they want 
federal funds he said we will expect educational institutions 
to finally do certain things if they want education funds 
he did not give any details 
a draft of the drug strategy which congress has required be 
completed by sept 5 is being reviewed by the various agencies 
affected including the national security council bennett said 
president bush who is to announce the program will have the 
final say 
it is his strategy bennett said 
also tuesday bush announced that he will nominate us marshals 
service director stanley e morris as deputy director of bennetts 
office in charge of drug supply reduction

nomination of the other top deputy herbert kleber rounds out

congressional economists say the capitalgains 
tax cut favored by a majority of the house ways and means committee 
is tilted more toward highincome americans than the measure backed 
by president bush 
eighty cents of every dollar of benefit in the capitalgains cut 
that has become the major issue in the committee would go to those 
with incomes above 100000 a year according to figures prepared 
by the joint committee on taxation 
bushs proposal would earmark slightly less 797 cents of 
every dollar for the over100000 group but it would give 25 
percent of the total tax relief to those with incomes under 30000 
a year compared with 18 percent under the bill being debated in 
ways and means 
either plan would cut taxes for about 79 million couples and 
individuals who would be expected to have profits from the sale of 
stocks and other assets in 1990 capital gains are taxed as 
ordinary income at rates of 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent 
depending on total income 
bushs proposal which would result in a top capitalgains rate 
of 15 percent would produce a tax cut of 30820 for the average 
investor with over 200000 of total income the other proposal 
which would have a top 20 percent rate for two years and then a 28 
percent rate would be worth 24906 a year to the average 200000 
investor 
bush and other supporters of a capitalgains cut say it would 
boost the economy by encouraging saving and reducing us business 
costs of investment 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee told reporters tuesday that any capitalgains cut to 
temporarily raise revenue would be gimmickry that would complicate 
the future deficit picture

a connecticut company alleges in a 15 
billion antitrust suit that a congressionally created corporation 
is fixing prices and blocking competition for international 
satellite communications services 
pan american satellite of greenwich conn alleges that 
communications satellite corp or comsat is blocking cheaper 
and better satellite communications services in order to line its 
own pockets and protect an outmoded monopoly 
comsat sells us companies access to intelsat the 117nation 
consortium of satellite telecommunications users 
pas chairman rene anselmo said comsat had illegally 
monopolized the market by price fixing and conspiring to block 
competition we want to bust open their monopoly 
the suit filed tuesday in the us district court for the 
southern district of new york seeks 500 million in actual damages 
which would be trebled under us law and a permanent 
injunction enjoining comsat from engaging in alleged illegal 
activities 
pas is the first privately owned international satellite 
communications company it launched its pas1 satellite in june 
1988 at a cost of about 100 million and began service in september 
to latin america and europe 
but pas alleges that comsat has tried to put it out of business 
by supporting a boycott of separate satellite systems 
misrepresenting facts to pas customers using predatory pricing 
tactics and conspiring with foreign telecommunications companies to 
block pas business opportunities 
comsat spokesman bob hunter said the pas suit has absolutely 
no merit describing it as another in a series of actions taken 
by pan american satellite to find every opportunity to lodge 
complaints and in fact attempt to impede and or harass comsat in 
its own mission 
congress created comsat in the communications satellite act of 
1962 until 1971 comsat oversaw intelsats growth comsat owns 26 
percent of intelsat and accounts for more than 50 percent of all 
intelsat traffic pas said 
comsat is a private publicly traded company that leases 
intelsat circuits to companies such as american telephone amp 
telegraph co mci us sprint and television networks

human rights activists say their campaign to 
abolish the death penalty when this british territory is handed 
back to china has a new sense of urgency after beijings executions 
of prodemocracy protesters 
we certainly are intensifying our efforts said andrew 
stables a former chairman of the local amnesty international 
branch 
amnesty today submitted a petition to local lawmakers urging the 
abolition of capital punishment saying that events in china had 
heightened concern of local residents over the issue 
it doesnt require too much imagination to think of 
possibilities of abuse of the death penalty in hong kong after 
1997 when the colony reverts to chinese sovereignty stables said 
murder and treason are capital crimes under hong kong law but 
the colonial governor has commuted all of the more than 230 death 
sentences since 1966 usually to life imprisonment because 
executions are not allowed in britain 
when hong kong is returned to china laws previously enforced in 
the territory will be kept on the books while capital punishment 
may remain there is no guarantee the automatic commutation of 
sentences will continue 
after 1997 we are not sure whether this tradition of 
commutation can be respected said rev louis ha spokesman for 
the local catholic church which has long opposed the death penalty 
what human rights campaigners find particularly worrisome is in 
the words of stables the fairly liberal use of the death 
penalty in china 
several dozen executions are known to have occurred in china 
since the prodemocracy movement was crushed by troops june 34 
but beijing authorities have linked just 12 of those reported to 
the protests 
many chinese believe the number is far higher 
hong kong government officials say they have not removed the 
death penalty statute because the public supports the law they 
claim there is no evidence that recent executions in china have 
swayed local opinion 
so far we havent seen any change in the mood yet said 
nancy law a top official in the government security branch 
although acknowledging that no survey has been done 
ngai shiukit a member of the lawmaking legislative council 
says he remains a staunch supporter of the death penalty and 
believes executions should resume in hong kong where more than 100 
people were put to death from 194666 
theres an old chinese saying blood for blood ngai said 
we must maintain this severe punishment to maintain law and 
order he said he believes the death penalty for murder should be 
kept after 1997 although he seemed less certain about executions 
for treason 
other hong kong residents may be questioning their earlier 
support of the death penalty 
whatever ones view about morality or the efficacy of the 
death penalty i think it would be naive to believe that hong kong 
people would not have revised their opinions in the last few 
months said raymond wacks head of the law department at the 
university of hong kong 
wacks noted that since the bloody chinese crackdown hong kong 
people have been preoccupied with seeking the right to live in 
britain and securing passports to other countries 
he expressed surprise that there has been little debate about 
retaining the death penalty but believes interest will pick up 
i suspect this is just one of many issues that will be discussed 
in the next few months he said 
perhaps the death penalty will generate more interest when the 
government unveils later this year a bill of rights for hong kong 
one of the actions being taken to restore confidence in the colony 
stables said amnesty international will urge that the document 
outlaw capital punishment in the territory

rose douglas son played with a 
yellowish resin near their mobile home and ate vegetables grown 
from her garden 
on tuesday the federal government confirmed what she had feared 
for most of the 9 years shed lived at the forest glen trailer 
park the site is heavily polluted with carcinogenic chemical 
wastes 
like the situation in nearby love canal 10 years ago the 
government said the site poses a significant risk to human 
health it is offering to pay to relocate temporarily some 51 
families under a voluntary program 
echoing the comments of many of the 150 or so people living on 
the 11acre site douglas wants out but she wants the government 
to pay for a permanent move 
if its that bad that they have to temporarily relocate us 
why not just buy us out she asked 
a federal environmental protection agency spokesman richard 
salkie said the contamination is so pervasive he thinks every 
resident eventually will have to leave for good 
any further remedial action could not be performed without 
totally disrupting the trailers that might remain he said 
the trailer park is located just north of a landfill operated by 
cecos international inc a hazardouswaste disposal company 
toxic wastes and carcinogenic industrial compounds such as 
aniline phenothiazine and benzothiazole have been found in the 
soil and ground water at the site officials described the 
materials as cancercausing byproducts of chemical production 
epa official joseph rotola said no evidence exists that forest 
glen was a recognized landfill at any time but aerial photos and 
the accounts of longtime residents indicate the land was previously 
used to bury chemical wastes 
before residents can be permanently relocated the site must be 
placed on the epas superfund national priorities list salkie 
said he said the epa will ask the federal agency for toxic 
substances and disease registry to issue a public health advisory 
the first step toward inclusion on the list 
on tuesday that agency released a preliminary assessment that 
found significant health risks in the park 
forest glen is several miles from the love canal neighborhood 
which was declared a national environmental disaster in 1978 
state health officials originally evacuated 237 families whose 
homes were built on or adjacent to love canal the state later 
offered to buy homes in a 10block area around the former 
occidental chemical corp dump 
salkie refused to identify which of a halfdozen chemical 
companies near forest glen are being investigated for contaminating 
the site saying officials havent determined who put what in the 
ground 
federal officials predicted there would be considerable 
resistance to temporary relocation 
douglas agreed saying residents were very upset scared and 
very confused at being offered only temporary help 
douglas said residents are asking where are they going to put 
these people how long is it going to be and whos going to take 
care of our homes while were gone 
they are our homes they may be trailers to everybody else who 
reads this but this is our lifes savings invested here 
officials had few answers tuesday salkie said it would be 
months before a decision was made on the sites fate 
douglas said residents have been aware of contaminants for 
years particularly after sewer and power lines were dug into the 
site 
we came across yellow resins an actual clump that when heated 
by the sunlight would really smell she said weve thrown 
clothes away my oldest when he was a baby played with it like 
clay

spokesman rob doughty said flight attendants sit in jump seats 
which are bolted to bulkheads in reinforced sections of the cabin 
thats so they can help passengers get out of the airplane he 
said 
ms hayes said she could see the fear on the flight attendants 
face she said flight attendants issued instructions on what 
passengers should do right up to the time the crippled jumbo jet 
hit the ground 
it must have been very difficult for them to do that she 
said 
ms hayes said passengers were calm but tense before the crash 
people were very quiet you could feel the fear in the air 
she said people were very tense

reenactments of reallife events once 
limited to racy crimestopping television shows like americas 
most wanted have arrived on network news startling some eminent 
broadcast journalists 
by showing a brief reenactment friday abcs world news 
tonight has drawn criticism even from some staffers 
we were wrong with what we did sam donaldson a veteran abc 
correspondent said in a telephone interview tuesday 
abc anchorman peter jennings apologized in his tuesday newscast 
for the networks failure to identify the segment as a simulation 
the controversy was sparked by an abc news report using two 
staged images to intimate that veteran us diplomat felix s bloch 
had handed a briefcase to a soviet agent 
bloch has not been charged with any wrongdoing 
donaldson said abcs depiction of the alleged transaction easily 
could have led viewers to believing that they had actually seen 
the event and they might say well i saw the dirty 
sonofabitch pass the briefcase to a dirty commie spy well 
no they didnt they didnt see that at all 
fred friendly a former cbs news president said this fooled 
everybody a friend of mine looked at abcs bloch story and said 
he had no idea it was a simulation 
in the version of world news tonight seen by most of its 
nearly 20 million viewers the 10second recreated scene was not 
labeled as staged 
richard wald senior vice president of abc news defended the 
networks use of the reenactment earlier this week he did say the 
network made a terrible mistake in failing to label them 
consistently as simulations 
but other news officials said abcs mistake wasnt just its 
failure to describe the segment as fabricated but its decision to 
use a news recreation in the first place 
i think its very dangerous i think it was particularly 
unfortunate that they tried to fake the look of an fbi surveillance 
film said lawrence grossman a former nbc news president i 
just dont think the news divisions should be in the business of 
creating fiction or fiction based on fact 
the broadcasting techniques are beginning to overwhelm the 
old standards 
ed turner executive vice president of the cable news network 
said that cnn doesnt do theater in the round we dont do drama 
with actors 
said turner theres enough real drama that we dont have to 
recreate it it is the function of the reporter on the story 
to tell the tale to relate the events in narrative fashion rather 
than to use some form of dramatic reenactment to try to sustain 
viewer interest 
yet sustaining viewer interest especially in a tightly 
competitive television environment has become crucial 
nbc news yesterday today amp tomorrow will use two news 
recreations when the show debuts aug 2 and news simulations are 
among the options being weighed for cbs news west 57th which 
will be redesigned for the fall with connie chung as host 
nbc news president michael gartner said tuesday that 
yesterday today amp tomorrow a primetime newsoriented 
program will use reenactments only when there is no existing 
video or film footage of the events 
gartner said he cannot conceive of an example where we would 
use recreations or simulations on nbc nightly news 
its not television journalism friendly said its 
television carnival there are people who have dedicated their 
lives to the concept that what you see on the air or hear on the 
radio is what happened not what got simulated 
grossman said nbcs today show has already started 
manipulating stories without other broadcast technologies adding 
mood music to some news reports for added emotional appeal 
when you start mucking up reality even though it may be 
justified in a particular instance it really creates a very 
dangerous pattern grossman said 
defenders of reenactments liken them to artists courtroom 
sketches and animated simulations of lunar landings 
but as donaldson pointed out in the case of the abc simulation 
about bloch people werent watching an artist who did see it 
who said i was there 
ernie leiser the former executive producer of walter cronkites 
newscast said much depends on how reenactments are used 
if it is made clear that it is a simulation and if its done 
because you dont have pictures and it clarifies the story youre 
trying to tell i see nothing wrong with it in principle he said

after rejecting president wojciech 
jaruzelskis offer to join a governing coalition solidarity leader 
lech walesa said he intends to form a shadow cabinet and prepare 
for inevitable control of the government 
he said he told polands communist chief during a twohour 
meeting tuesday that the bold solution to polands leadership 
crisis would be for the ruling communists to let the free trade 
union movement govern 
solidaritybacked candidates won all but one of the seats they 
were allowed to contest in june parliamentary elections 
walesa said everything indicates the communists are still 
unwilling to surrender power to the popular movement they tried to 
crush in december 1981 with martial law 
for my part i intend to form a shadow cabinet to prepare for 
the solution that sooner or later will become inevitable he said 
in making public a statement he gave jaruzelski 
walesa said his private talks with gen jaruzelski were very 
interesting but did not produce any agreement 
he said jaruzelski who has led the country for eight years as 
communist party first secretary and was elected by parliament last 
week to the newly powerful presidency has not yet decided what 
government to nominate 
walesa said he would not stand in the way of solidarity members 
accepting appointments as government ministers but that they would 
be acting as individuals 
he told reporters the union fears it would not have enough 
strength within a governing coalition to force through its own 
policies but would be held accountable by the public for 
government decisions anyway 
we are remaining an opposition that will ensure that the 
government does not leave the path of reforms walesa told a 
brief news conference 
he added it will be more comfortable for us in the opposition 
because we will focus on making sure that the path of reforms is 
kept and not on other things for which we are not yet mature 
tuesday was not the first time communist authorities had asked 
solidarity to join a governing coalition 
the government negotiated solidaritys april reinstatement many 
believe because it desperately needs to cooperation of the 
opposition if it is to revive the countrys crippled economy 
inflation is running at 160 percent and poles are beset by 
worsening shortages of food and other consumer goods 
in june solidarity won 99 out 100 seats in the freely elected 
senate but was allowed under the april accords to contest just 35 
percent of the 460 seats in parliaments more powerful lower house 
the sejm 
walesa referred to solidaritys electoral victory when asking 
for control of the government 
the continuously deteriorating economic situation and 
growing social tensions make necessary bold and decisive solutions 
concerning the formula of exercising power 
the only reasonable decision would be to hand over the 
government to those forces which enjoy the support of the majority 
of society his statement to jaruzelski said 
only such a bold solution would have a chance of convincing 
society of the irreversible nature of the changes and the necessity 
for quick and thorough economic reforms which inevitably carry 
costs he said 
solidarity lawmakers were to meet today to discuss the next 
government 
parliament elected jaruzelski president last week with the bare 
minimum number of votes required thanks to the tacit support of 
some solidarity lawmakers who deliberately absented themselves from 
the balloting 
as president he is required to nominate a prime minister to 
assemble the next government subject to parliamentary approval 
jaruzelski has said the government should be formed as quickly 
as possible

cuba has a better record than the united 
states of punishing narcotics smugglers the countrys deputy 
foreign minister said in response to us charges that his 
government is soft on drugs 
the diplomat ricardo alarcon told a news conference tuesday 
that while us officials accused of narcotics trafficking go 
unpunished cuba has acted decisively against officials guilty of 
the same crimes 
two weeks ago cuban authorities executed gen arnaldo ochoa and 
three colleagues after a courtmartial found them guilty of drug 
smuggling and other charges 
alarcon said us authorities refused to act on information 
several years ago suggesting that highlevel american officials 
were involved in cocaine trafficking from central america to 
florida he said former national security aide oliver north was 
among those involved 
us officials have said those allegations have little 
credibility partly because they were based largely on comments made 
years ago by convicted drug smugglers 
american skeptcism of cubas commitment to fighting the drug 
trade was reaffirmed tuesday during a house hearing in washington 
melvyn levitsky assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters said there was a sharp increase in drug 
shipments through cuban territory in the first six months of this 
year 
some evidence suggests that cuba simultaneously facilitates 
the flow of drugs in selected cases while prosecuting other cases 
to conviction levitsky told the house foreign affairs committee 
narcotics task force 
alarcon said cuba will not tolerate the least flexbility the 
slightest concession toward this vice nor toward any person related 
to this vice 
he also said that tons and tons of marijuana packages have 
washed ashore in cuba over the years indicating that american 
traffickers were responsible 
given the magnitude of the overall drug problem alarcon said 
both countries could benefit from a cooperative effort in combating 
drug trafficking 
alarcon spoke to reporters on the eve of tonights speech by 
president fidel castro marking the 36th anniversary of his first 
armed attack against the military dictatorship he ousted in 1959 
hours after alarcon spoke an official of the department of 
revolutionary orientation jorge gomez barata protested bush 
administration plans to beam television broadcasts to cuba 
he said cuba has the technology to jam the broadcasts

two ptl aides convicted of tax evasion 
harbored no bitterness over ministry founder jim bakkers decision 
not to testify in their defense their attorney says 
brothers david and james taggart were convicted tuesday of 
evading 525000 in income taxes on 12 million they took from the 
television ministry to buy condominiums furs jewelry and nearly 
100000 worth of shoes 
bakker invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination last week when the defense called him to the 
stand bakker and former ptl executive vice president richard 
dortch are scheduled to go on trial aug 28 on wire and mail fraud 
and conspiracy charges 
obviously we would have preferred it if he testified said 
defense attorney ben cotten 
he said his clients were not bitter at their former boss 
they recognized he followed his constitutional rights just 
like we have cotten said hes going to face some of the same 
things we faced in this trial 
federal prosecutor david brown said he would recommend a stiff 
sentence each taggart faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and 
more than 1 million in fines a tentative sentencing date was set 
for aug 25 
greed doesnt pay no matter how rich you are youve got to 
pay your taxes brown said 
a us district court jury found david taggart 32 and his 
35yearold brother james guilty on identical charges conspiracy 
to impede the irs in collecting income taxes and filing false tax 
returns for the years 1984 through 1987 
brown said the verdict was not a statement about ptl the 
televangelism empire started by jim and tammy faye bakker in the 
early 1970s the ministry was well known for the bakkers tearful 
televised pleas for money 
it was a statement about david taggart and james taggarts 
obligations to pay their taxes no matter how much they own and what 
kind of lifestyle they live he said 
the taggarts joined ptl in 1978 as piano players by 1980 david 
was bakkers top personal aide james became the interior designer 
at ptls heritage usa christian retreat just south of charlotte 
both taggarts were fired when jerry falwell took over at ptl in 
early 1987 following bakkers resignation 
the taggarts were charged with tax evasion after they allegedly 
spent nearly 12 million in ptl money on personal luxuries such as 
condominiums including one at trump tower in new york city 
jewelry and designer clothes 
cotten said the money was approved by bakker 
brown said the taggarts used their credit cards to make the 
purchases and over four years took out about 750000 in cash from 
ptl to pay off the bills 
the taggarts declined to comment following the verdict 
cotten still maintained his clients were innocent 
they were innocent going in and they are innocent coming 
out he said 
a woman who answered the telephone at the bakkers home in 
orlando fla said there would be no comment from the bakkers she 
declined to give her name 
bakker and dortch were indicted dec 5 on charges they diverted 
more than 4 million to support lavish lifestyles if convicted on 
all charges each man could be sentenced to more than 120 years in 
prison and fined more than 5 million 
bakker quit ptl in march 1987 in a sex and money scandal brought 
on by his confession of a sexual liaison with former church 
secretary jessica hahn

a high school biology student who refused 
to dissect animals claimed vindication when officials agreed to 
recalculate her failing grade but she said her religious beliefs 
still cause problems at school 
school officials agreed to honor maggie mccools beliefs and 
recalculate her biology grade of a d on tuesday hours before an 
administrative law judge was to begin a trial on the girls lawsuit 
i learned that its worth it in the end to act on your 
convictions the slight softspoken 16yearold said 
miss mccool had charged that the woodstownpilesgrove board of 
education violated her freedom of religion by giving her failing 
grades for refusing to dissect frogs worms or a fetal pig in her 
10thgrade biology class last year 
board attorney michael jordan said the district decided to 
settle because miss mccool probably would have proved at trial that 
her refusal to cut up dead animals stemmed from sincere religious 
beliefs the district also agreed to pay 12500 in legal fees 
which will go to the american civil liberties union 
a federal judge dismissed a similar lawsuit one year ago in 
california when high school officials agreed to let the student a 
vegetarian use photographs of a frog that was killed by natural 
causes 
miss mccool said her battle has not been without its trials and 
many classmates have ostracized her because they think her 
convictions are weird 
she recounted one incident when a classmate spotted a mouse 
running across steps outside the school when he saw miss mccool 
was only a few feet away he ran over and stomped the rodent to 
death 
the fact that he took a life to torment me was very 
upsetting she said 
jordan said it was unclear early in the case when miss mccool 
first informed her adviser she would not dissect animals and that 
her objections were grounded in religious convictions 
we thought we were dealing with a curriculum dispute he 
said 
but a lawyer for the girl maintained from the beginning that her 
spiritual doctrine bars her from harming animals 
they should have known absolutely if they had asked maggie 
the question she would have answered it that it was a religious 
belief said e elizabeth sweetser her lawyer 
jordan said that on the eve of the trial the board voted 
unanimously to settle the legal fight 
miss mccool who will enter the 11th grade at woodstown high 
school this year said she refuses to wear leather or wool or drink 
milk she also shuns makeup which is often tested on animals 
she likens many of her beliefs to those followed in jainism an 
ancient hindu religion that emphasizes asceticism and reverence for 
living things although she does not consider herself a member of 
the religion 
her household has been vegetarian since she was a small child 
the rest of the family does not adhere to as strict a system of 
beliefs but her father joseph mccool said he and the other 
family members believe in a doctrine of harmlessness 
jordan said that in future cases the board will accommodate 
other students who refuse to dissect or observe dead animals based 
on religious beliefs but little deference will be given to 
students who refuse just because theyre squeamish 
if a kid says they dont feel like touching dead worms and 
fetal pigs theyre going to have to learn to deal with dead worms 
and fetal pigs there are very few people who have lived the kind 
of life miss mccool has lived and we feel this is a sincere 
religious belief jordan said 
even with the recalculation miss mccool figures her d grade 
will only be boosted to a c 
science is not her strong suit ms sweetser said

fourteen indian peacekeeping soldiers 
were killed and three injured when tamil rebels detonated 
remotecontrolled explosives in northeastern sri lanka military 
officials said today 
the indian soldiers were travelling in a truck when the 
explosion occured tuesday at mullipothnai about 160 miles 
northeast of colombo the sri lankan officials said 
indian diplomats said they had no immediate information on the 
report 
the sri lankan military officials said 17 indian soldiers were 
in the truck when explosives buried in the road were detonated 
the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
blamed the attack on the dominant tamil rebel group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam 
tamil rebels started a violent campaign in 1983 to carve out a 
separate homeland claiming their ethnic minority was being 
discriminated against by the sinhalese majority 
tamils form 18 percent of the islands 16 million people while 
sinhalese make up 75 percent and dominate the government and 
military 
neighboring india sent a peacekeeping force to sri lanka nearly 
two years ago to disarm tamil guerrillas and oversee a peace 
accord but the tamil tigers refused to surrender their weapons 
india got involved in the conflict because it is the dominant 
power in the region and because of the sympathies of its own 60 
million tamils 
president ranasinghe premadasa has demanded that the india 
withdraw its troops by the end of july but indian says a premature 
pullout would lead to even more violence about 15000 people 
including 1000 indian soldiers have been killed in the past six 
years of ethnic violence 
work in almost all state and commercial banks and some 
government and private offices in colombo came to a standstill 
today as workers heeded a call by the workers action front for a 
threeday protest against the indian presence 
the front a shadowy group whose orders are issued through wall 
posters and leaflets organized the transport strike that crippled 
most of the country from midjune to midjuly 
sri lankan military officers say the workers action front is 
linked to a sinhalese extremist group the peoples liberation 
front which accuses the government of making too many concessions 
to tamils and not being firm enough in getting rid of the indian 
soldiers 
the government blames sinhalese extremists for 4000 political 
killings in the past two years including 3000 since premadasa 
took office as president in january most of the victims were 
sinhalese government officials or supporters 
fourteen people including three soldiers and two policemen 
were killed by sinhalese extremists tuesday and early wednesday in 
the sinhalese heartland of southern and central sri lanka 
officials said

federal judge alcee hastings fighting 
impeachment charges before a senate panel already has convinced 
one panel member that wiretap charges are too weak to warrant 
removing him from the bench 
sen slade gorton rwash surprised his fellow panel members 
tuesday when he said that even if the wiretap evidence were viewed 
in the most damaging way it would be too weak to warrant removing 
hastings from the us district court bench in florida 
hastings testified before the panel tuesday that he never leaked 
wiretap information to the mayor of dade county fla and was not 
offered money to fix a case 
i did not tell mayor steve clark anything about anything 
anytime on earth hastings said appearing as a witness before 
the 12member panel hearing evidence in the case i take great 
stock in my ability to keep a secret 
the wiretap charges contend that hastings compromised three fbi 
investigations by leaking wiretap information over which he had 
jurisdiction 
hastings 52 also is accused of plotting with washington 
attorney william borders to obtain a 150000 payoff 
the panel is hearing evidence to report to the full senate 
which will decide whether to remove hastings who is paid 89500 a 
year 
gorton told fellow lawmakers his conclusion did not apply to the 
other articles of impeachment against hastings approved by the 
house a year ago no other lawmakers joined in his statement 
sen gorton as he said was speaking for himself sen 
arlen specter rpa told reporters adding that he preferred to 
wait until all the evidence was presented to decide 
hastings is expected to return to the witness chair later to 
testify on the bribery allegations 
sen patrick leahy dvt however asked the judge tuesday if 
money to fix a case had ever been offered by borders once an 
influential figure in washington who was convicted of bribery 
conspiracy in 1983 and now is refusing to answer questions before 
the panel 
none whatsoever hastings replied 
hastings told the panel that when he was confronted by two miami 
reporters concerning rumors that he had disclosed the wiretap 
information i was absolutely livid in the way this information 
was coming to me 
it was rife in the courthouse and it was bouncing all over the 
place hastings said it is hard for me to control my rage as i 
speak now 
he acknowledged under questioning from lawmakers that he did not 
cooperate at first with the justice departments investigation of 
the wiretap leak 
he said that was because he felt officials treated him unfairly 
in connection with the bribery conspiracy case and that he thought 
they were likely to do so again

a federal judge has ruled that immigration 
officials acted improperly in denying political asylum to six 
salvadorans casting doubt on the method used to curb the influx of 
central american refugees 
regulations require the immigration and naturalization service 
to adjudicate requests for work authorization from any alien who as 
filed an application for asylum that is nonfrivolous 
but in a ruling that suggests that the ins has been dismissing 
asylum applications as frivolous without fully considering their 
merits us district judge william wayne justice ordered the 
agency to readjudicate work authorization requests for six 
salvadorans 
the ruling signed friday but only released to lawyers in the 
case monday also ordered the ins to consider a work authorization 
request from a seventh salvadoran 
the ruling is particularly significant in south texas where the 
ins detains refugees and considers most applications frivolous 
according to robert rubin a san francisco lawyer who represents 
the salvadorans 
the ins sees the denial of work authorizations as a means to 
discourage persons from pursuing their asylum claims rubin 
claimed tuesday 
the new york times today quoted rubin as saying he had already 
filed a petition to make the judges ruling apply to all asylum 
applicants in texas 
the newspaper also said government lawyers arguing the case had 
told the judge the country would face a flood of illegal aliens 
if the policy for considering work authorization requests was 
struck down 
the ruling relaxes the burden of proof placed on the alien 
seeking asylum and it imposes a new standard for determining 
whether an asylum application should receive work authorization 
james reynolds counsel for the dallas ins office told the times 
the agency was reviewing the decision and hasnt decided yet 
whether to appeal he said 
immigration attorneys have accused the ins of denying 
applications for political asylum by improperly assuming that 
refugees seek it only for economic reasons 
a report issued tuesday by an american bar association committee 
said the ins is unjustly denying people the opportunity to apply 
for asylum 
the texas ruling went against us attorney general richard 
thornburgh whose office represented the ins in the case 
from the evidence adduced to date it appears that the 
defendant misapplies its interpretation of the term frivolous with 
respect to its review of both the factual allegations and legal 
theories underlying claims for asylum wrote justice 
the inability to work for the extended period during which the 
asylum application is considered by the ins and federal courts may 
compel an applicant to abandon his or her asylum application and 
return to his or her native country he wrote 
not only would this deprive the applicant of the opportunity 
to urge his or her application through the entire review process 
but would in substantial likelihood subject the applicant to even 
more persecution upon return to the country that he or she has 
attempted to flee

agency estimated the damage to crops and livestock in the millions 
of dollars 
bhaji is about 165 miles southeast of the state capital bombay 
large boulders and tons of mud crashed down on houses built on 
the hill during the storm said a police official in pune the 
closest town to bhaji 
it is highly unlikely that survivors will be found said the

lawyers considering a challenge to georgias 
156yearold antisodomy law said a mans prison sentence for 
having sex with his wife shows the statute could be abused in 
bitter divorce fights 
james moseley a 34yearold carpenter was convicted of one 
sodomy charge after admitting on the witness stand that he engaged 
in oral sex with his commonlaw wife of four years bette roberts 
sodomy is a felony in georgia even if the parties are 
consenting husband and wife 
moseley was charged with two counts of rape two counts of 
aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated anal sodomy 
stemming from two february 1988 encounters with ms roberts 
in may 1988 a jury acquitted moseley of five of the six 
charges but convicted him of one sodomy charge because of his 
admission on the stand moseley was sentenced to five years in 
prison the couple is divorced 
the american civil liberties union is considering asking the 
state court of appeals to accept a late appeal on moseleys behalf 
or filing a habeas corpus action directly challenging his 
incarceration said judd herndon an aclu attorney 
heterosexuals today do not perceive themselves to be at risk 
under the sodomy law they felt themselves immune mr 
moseley has rudely found out that husbands and wives are not 
immune herndon said 
the georgia sodomy law now becomes a weapon that can be used 
by feuding spouses in a divorce action and that ought to scare 
every husband and wife in this state 
there are sodomy laws in 25 states and seven of those apply the 
law only to relations between homosexuals according to the 
national gay and lesbian task force 
steven lister moseleys lawyer at the trial said he had no 
idea moseleys confession would be used against him 
superior court judge william h ison told the jurors that they 
had the option of finding moseley guilty of the lesser crime of 
simple sodomy 
state rep charles thomas chairman of the georgia house 
judiciary committee said he doubts lawmakers will attempt to 
change the sodomy law in 1990 unless the courts tell them to do so 
georgia attorney general michael bowers said tuesday his office 
isnt involved in the case yet and declined to say what stand he 
would take on an appeal 
he also noted that the state argued in an earlier case involving 
homosexuals that the sodomy law could not be applied to consensual 
acts within a heterosexual marriage 
in the earlier case michael hardwick of atlanta was arrested 
for engaging in oral sex with another man 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled 21 in 1985 that 
the law violated hardwicks right to privacy on appeal the us 
supreme court ruled 54 in 1986 that the constitution does not 
protect homosexual relations between consenting adults even in the 
privacy of their homes

a ku klux klan leader who agreed to 
attend a race relations course to settle a lawsuit over a clash 
with civil rights marchers says the classroom sessions wont change 
his attitude toward blacks 
i will sit through that course but i will leave with the same 
opinion i walk in there with roger handley said tuesday 
handley former grand dragon of the knights of the ku klux klan 
was one of 10 people named in a federal lawsuit stemming from a 
1979 clash between robed klansmen and black civil rights marchers 
in decatur 
under a settlement filed tuesday in us district court the 
defendants agreed to pay 11500 in damages to the marchers 
perform community service and refrain from harassing blacks or 
joining any klan or white supremacist group for up to five years 
the klansmen also agreed to take a race relations course taught 
by civil rights leaders the rev joseph lowery president of the 
southern christian leadership conference said he would help lead 
the two onehour sessions probably next year in birmingham 
handley told the birmingham postherald the settlement was 
just a way of getting out of the lawsuit 
we could have been in court for six weeks and with attorneys 
fees wed be getting into thousands of dollars just to defend 
me he said 
but i havent changed my opinions whatsoever i know 
racemixing is wrong he said adding i dont believe god 
meant for any two races to live in one nation 
lowery said he was hopeful the course would ease racial tensions 
this workshop will be an opportunity for these people who are 
acting out of racial prejudice to understand themselves a little 
more and for us to understand their motives and what misled them 
and we hope they can see the need to accept the oneness of the 
human family lowery said from sclc headquarters in atlanta 
handley however said the class could serve another purpose 
ive always felt like the more you know about an enemy the 
better off you are its possible i may get some very valuable 
information that ill use later on he said 
handley said he would abide by the part of the settlement 
requiring him to refrain from joining any white supremacist group 
including the klan for two years 
the civil lawsuit was filed after investigators from the 
southern poverty law center in montgomery uncovered evidence that 
prompted the justice department to reopen its investigation of the 
may 26 1979 incident in decatur 
the blacks led by lowery were protesting the conviction the 
year before of a 19yearold mentally retarded black man for raping 
three white women two klansmen and two blacks were wounded by 
gunfire in the ensuing struggle 
handley and nine other klan members were indicted in 1984 on 
civil rights charges all either pleaded guilty or were convicted 
earlier this year handley and six others drew federal sentences 
ranging from two months to two years for their roles in the 
violence one of the 10 has died 
handley a 44yearold disabled sheet metal worker spent four 
months in jail earlier this year but he said he committed no crime 
and pleaded guilty on the advice of his attorney 
the civil case was to have gone to trial next week the 
settlement still must receive court approval

the city council president said he wants to 
put witnesses under oath to get to the truth about murky financial 
dealings that have been linked to mayor tom bradley 
john ferraro also said tuesday that the council should have the 
power to issue subpoenas and hire special counsel an apparent sign 
of impatience with other investigations of the mayors affairs 
city auditors meanwhile revealed more details about 
alterations to the citys financial records saying certain details 
in bids for city deposits submitted by a savings and loan had been 
blotted out with typewriter correction fluid 
bradley denied any knowledge about the alterations and dismissed 
speculation that he might resign 
to anyone who has any such thoughts ill be around here four 
years from now as mayor of this city bradley told repvestments nor 
have i in any way tried to cover up 
but rittenberg was unable to satisfy council members about the 
alterations during his second day of testimony 
he said two staff members have accused each other of whiting 
out the reference to the mayor on the far east form those two 
staff members were expected to be called to testify later this week 
this whole thing reeks councilman zev yaroslavsky told the 
treasurer 
bradley said he would not comment on the matter until city 
attorney james hahn has completed an investigation 
nobody wishes that that thing would be over faster than i 
do bradley said 
but ferraro the council president complained about the pace of 
the attorneys probe jim hahn talks rather slowly and i think 
the investigation is moving rather slowly too he said 
the committee also heard reports of other altered documents 
typewriter correction fluid often was used to blot out interest 
rate details on bids submitted by gibraltar savings and loan for 
city deposits said john pearson an auditor for the city 
administrative office bradley personally held a bond that earned a 
favorable interest rate from gibraltar 
in one case pearson said a gibraltar bid of 76 percent was 
blotted out and a revised bid of 75 percent was entered in 
another the bid dropped from 78 percent to 74 percent 
the difference of a few tenths of a percent represents tens of 
thousands of dollars in interest payments to the city pearson said 
gibraltar an ailing beverly hills thrift was seized by the 
federal home loan bank board which declared the institution 
unsound on march 31 
a statement issued by the thrift tuesday said an internal review 
showed gibraltar received no special benefit from its transactions 
with the city 
we will continue to cooperate fully with city investigators 
and will readily comment further when the investigation is 
complete gibraltars statement concluded

a continental airlines dc9 suffered partial 
hydraulic failure and fishtailed in an emergency landing at newark 
international airport none of the 89 people aboard the flight were 
injured officials said 
a light indicating a hydraulic problem lit up in the cockpit of 
flight 354 about 20 minutes before its scheduled landing at newark 
tuesday evening spokesman ned walker said in a telephone interview 
from continentals headquarters in houston the flight was coming 
from chicago 
the plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one of its 
hydraulic systems and a partial loss of the other walker said 
but unlike the dc10 that crashed in iowa last week the dc9 
doesnt require hydraulics for maneuverability he said 
four of the dc9s six tires blew out and the plane fishtailed 
as it skidded threequarters of the way down the 9800foot runway 
shortly after 8 pm it ended up sitting perpendicular on the 
runway 
the captain had full control of the aircraft at all times 
full control of the landing gear and flaps walker said control 
of a dc9s landing gear and flaps is improved by the hydraulic 
systems but they continue working if hydraulics are lost he said 
the tires blew out because the captain following established 
procedures turned off an antiskid system designed to prevent the 
wheels from locking up walker said 
lynn tierney a spokeswoman for the port authority of new york 
and new jersey said the plane dumped fuel before landing about 
six fire trucks and ambulances were waiting at the runway she said 
tom broyles a passenger from houston said his first thoughts 
flashed to last weeks united airlines crash in sioux city that 
killed 111 people 
ive been flying about 40 years and this was the worst he 
said while my head was down between my legs i took the 
opportunity to say my prayers 
walker said the 82 passengers were instructed to brace for the 
landing they and the seven crew members disembarked on an 
emergency ladder

elgort came to the 93rd annual cheyenne frontier days with two 
models and 10 crew members to shoot a spread for italian vogue but 
he quickly found out they stuck out like tumbleweeds in manhattan 
with their preppie attire 
we came in with ll bean shoes brooks brothers shirts 
little checked chefs pants i always work in chefs pants elgort 
said now theyre quietly hanging in my room 
the entourage was barred from some sections of the rodeo arena 
because they didnt have proper western wear 
organizers of the daddy of em all are used to the dilemma 
and have a closet full of plaid check and fringed shirts along 
with a stack of straw cowboy hats but the vogue crew decided only 
a shopping spree could solve their problem 
everyone in our group must have spent 300 in western 
outfitters today and thats the joke of its all it will even go 
over well in new york elgort said

talks among warring cambodian factions will resume 
thursday two days after they broke up in disarray over the khmer 
rouges future role resistance coalition leader prince norodom 
sihanouk announced 
but the talks will now be limited to the single issue of 
establishing who will represent cambodia at an important 
international peace conference scheduled to open sunday sihanouk 
told a news conference today 
sihanouk insists on a single cambodian delegation including all 
four factions the vietnamesebacked government of prime minister 
hun sen the chinesebacked khmer rouge the noncommunist khmer 
peoples national liberation front and sihanouks own group 
hun sen wants two delegations one for his vietnameseinstalled 
government and one led by sihanouk representing the rebel 
coalition he blamed the presence of the khmer rouge for blocking 
all chance of agreement 
underlying the dispute is a disagreement over the khmer rouge 
participation in the negotiations and in any postwar coalition 
government after the promised sept 27 withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops 
the khmer rouge are monsters its understood sihanouk 
during todays news conference at a hotel near charles de gaulle 
airport but that is no reason that we should become a 
protectorate of vietnam 
the strongest rebel group the khmer rouge was responsible for 
nearly 1 million deaths as it tried to radically restructure 
society during a threeyear reign that ended with the vietnamese 
invasion in 1978 
the khmer rouge armed force of 45000 men has not been beaten by 
the vietnamese army and is the strongest of the resistance factions 
after tuesdays meeting the first official encounter between 
the four factions the participants said they had reached an 
impasse 
its like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot 
continue its journey hun sen said he blamed the khmer rouge for 
the breakdown in talks 
i will not change my position it is clear there is no use 
meeting again sihanouk told reporters tuesday as he left the 
18th century chateau west of paris where the fourhour meeting took 
place 
but further discussions behind the scenes tuesday night were 
able to get the talks restarted the prince said french officials 
had asked him to keep trying so that there might be at least a 
few small steps toward a solution 
sihanouk met hun sen separately on monday and on tuesday was 
joined by the other members of the resistance son sann a 
moderate former prime minister and head of the khmer peoples 
national liberation front and khieu samphan the nominal chief of 
the khmer rouge 
sihanouk has contended that not including the khmer rouge would 
lead to civil war vietnam the soviet union the united states and 
most of the international community want to make sure the khmer 
rouge never takes power again in cambodia 
two of the issues to be discussed next week are how power will 
be shared and how to verify that vietnamese troops have gone home 
and not just changed into cambodian uniforms 
resistance forces maintain that more than 30000 vietnamese 
troops have been integrated into hun sens army 
sundays conference will include the participation of india 
japan canada australia the five permanent members of the united 
nations security council the united states the soviet union 
china britain and france also attending is the sixmember 
association of southeast asian nations indonesia thailand 
malaysia philippines brunei and singapore 
the talks have coincided with a surge in fighting between 
cambodian guerrillas and vietnamesebacked government troops along 
the thaicambodian border thai and western officials there said 
several thousand khmer rouge guerrillas have taken part the 
western analysts said speaking on condition of anonymity 
today cambodian government gunners shelled at least four thai 
villages as part of an intensified campaign against cambodian 
guerrillas along the thaicambodian frontier thai military 
officers said 
last week shelling believed to have been conducted by 
provietnamese troops forced the evacuation of nearly 40000 
refugees from a khmer rouge border refugee camp known as site 8 
most have since returned

the government today announced a winning bid 
for a key downtown property that was far below original 
expectations the latest gauge of how chinas bloody crackdown has 
shaken this territory 
great eagle co bid 346 million for the 95000squarefoot lot 
the last major tract of downtown land expected to be sold by the 
government before 1997 when britain returns hong kong to china 
hong kong government property sales are carefully scrutinized 
because of the importance the real estate market plays in the 
colonys economy and the disproportionate significance property 
groups have on the stock exchange 
the property had been expected to fetch perhaps as much as 641 
million before chinese troops on june 34 crushed the prodemocracy 
movement killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
but chinas suppression has increased fears about the colonys 
future under chinese rule and since the crackdown estimates on 
the winning bid had been around 385 million or slightly higher 
bob pope acting director of the governments buildings and 
lands department said he was satisfied with the winning bid in 
view of recent events in china even though it was below his april 
estimate of 513 million 
i regard it as a vote of confidence in the future he said 
of the winning bid noting that the entire project involves an 
investment of about 641 million great eagle is expected to build 
two office towers on the site 
the sort of returns that are expected probably equate to a 
drop in the market somewhat but not as great as indicated in the 
press he said 
the stock market fell sharply on friday when news began to leak 
about the bids for the lot it closed today at 248903 a modest 
drop from tuesdays 251702 closing

a company sold millions of cases of orange juice 
as 100 percent pure but had substituted beet sugar waste water and 
other products in violation of federal law the goverment said in 
an indictment 
the government said those substitutes accounted for 15 percent 
to 40 percent of the orange juice concentrate sold by the now 
defunct bodines inc of chicago from 1978 to 1985 
the federal indictment announced tuesday charges two former 
owners and a top executive of the orange juice company with 
conspiracy 
the indictment cites 18 instances in which beet sugar corn 
sugar monosodium glutamate grapefruit solids and other 
substitutes were used in the orange juice concentrate in violation 
of the federal food drug and cosmetic act said us attorney 
anton valukas 
the company increased its annual sales from 5 million to 100 
million over the same period the indictment said about the same 
time concentrated orange juice solid cost 129 per pound 
compared with 29 cents a pound for beet sugar 
the food and drug administration began its probe of the company 
in the early 1980s after a customer suffered a negative reaction 
to the sugar content in a can of juice valukas said 
between 1983 and 1985 about 7 million cases of products were 
produced for sale nationwide to more than 150 supermarket chains 
and wholesalers under 50 different labels among the best know 
labels were scot brand heritage house and red owl 
there are no allegations that consumers were at risk as a 
result of the substitutions even though they used at times 
the waste water stream from a distillation system said assistant 
us attorney pierre talbert obviously though they were able 
to undersell their competition 
named in the indictment were bodines former owners edward 
boden sr and edward boden jr both of chicago and roger walsh 
jr formerly vice president of finance and now a texas resident 
if convicted all three face a maximum of 57 years in prison and 
475 million in fines 
roger walsh sr a former chief executive officer of bodines 
who held a 20 percent share of the company also was named as an 
unindicted coconspirator 
the manufacturing operation located on the citys west side 
was sold in 1985 to mccain oj inc talbert said mccain was not 
connected to the scheme alleged in the indictment

house taxwriters disagree about whether the 
hardfought changes they voted in the financing of catastrophic 
illness insurance for older americans will stop the complaints of 
those who have to pay 
as a rule couples with incomes below 25000 and singles with 
incomes under 15000 would pay slightly more than under current 
law except for those with highest incomes most others would pay 
less 
the most important change is cutting by half the surtax paid by 
about 40 percent of those 65 and older 
its a major gain for middleincome seniors who would pay a 
lower surtax under the amendments approved tuesday by the house 
ways and means committee said rep sander levin dmich 
but people with incomes under about 20000 a year will have to 
pay a higher flat monthly premium said rep brian donnelly dmich 
thats regressive he said adding that he will continue 
efforts to repeal the program 
the committees amendment approved in a closeddoor session by 
a 1917 vote would allow older americans a onetime chance to turn 
down catastrophic coverage but only if they also give up medicare 
part b which covers doctors bills 
because of that condition donnelly said the program is about 
as voluntary as a prison sentence 
the panel reversed itself and agreed to retain the law that 
permits individuals to deduct 10 percent of interest on credit 
cards education loans and car loans next year to help pay for 
continuing a special tax benefit for banks and corporate 
executives the committee had voted earlier to end the writeoff 
after this year when a 20 percent deduction is permitted 
resolving the catastrophic issue left the committee with one 
major issue whether to reduce the tax on capital gains which 
applies to profits from sales of stocks and other property 
president bush wants a reduction to stimulate the economy 
saying it would raise revenues democratic leaders including 
speaker thomas foley and committee chairman dan rostenkowski of 
illinois oppose a cut because the bulk of the benefit would go to 
highincome americans democrats also insist a cut would lose money 
after a year or two 
a majority of the committee 13 republicans and six democrats 
backs a capitalgains cut but rostenkowski has delayed a vote 
while he attempts to change some minds 
on the catastrophic illness issue the committee voted to 
cut the surtax in half current law requires anyone eligible 
for medicare to pay a surtax of 15 percent of federal income tax 
over 150 but no one with less income pays the surtax about 60 
percent pay some surtax but fewer than 6 percent pay the maximum 
which this year is 800 
under the committee action the surtax would be cut to 75 
percent this year and 125 percent next year it would rise to 14 
percent by 1993 
raise the flat monthly premium that all but the poorest 
retirees pay for catastrophic coverage current law sets that 
premium at 4 in 1989 490 next year and 1020 by 1993 that is 
in addition to the monthly premium now 2790 paid for part b 
medicare coverage the charge is scheduled to rise to 29 next year 
and to 3340 by 1993 
the committee voted to raise the total monthly premium to 3840 
in 1990 with additional increases of 50 cents in 1991 and 10 cents 
in each of the following two years 
increase the prescription deductible the annual amount of 
outofpocket expenses for drugs that a beneficiary must pay before 
catastrophic reimbursement begins to 650 in 1991 and 950 in 
1992 those figures are 200 and 300 respectively above current 
law most of the drug coverage does not begin until 1991

it is now illegal in france to tie an elastic band 
to your feet and jump off into the void 
the practice had become a minor fad with the courageous or 
reckless flinging themselves off for example the eiffel tower and 
bouncing headfirst several times in midair 
the government issued its temporary ban last week after a third 
death this year resulting from the fad 
emmanuel bottin a 27yearold frenchman was killed july 18 
when the elastic band attaching him to a bridge in the alps snapped 
on the third bounce dropping him into the rocks 100 feet below 
this is a new and dangerous physical activity the french 
interior and sports ministries said in a joint statement late last 
week such an activity cannot continue without serious guarantees 
for the safety of the participants being required of organizers 
there was no indication how long it would take to draw up 
regulations under which the sport could resume

why the moon why mars asked president 
bush because it is humanitys destiny to strive to seek to 
find 
and he might have added not to yield 
that at least is how tennyson phrased it in ulysses the 
poem that served as a source of inspiration for bushs 
speechwriters on the 20th anniversary of mans first steps on the 
moon 
bush enunciated lofty goals for a us space program fallen on 
harder times since its apollo glory days 
first a space station then back to the moon and then a 
journey into tomorrow a manned mission to mars declared the 
president standing beside the graying heroes of apollo 11 neil 
armstrong buzz aldrin and michael collins 
if royalties were payable on 19th century poems the heirs of 
alfred lord tennyson would be raking in money ulysses is one 
of the most widely quoted poems in the language a favorite of 
politicians and english teachers alike its ringing rhetoric fits 
many occasions from high school graduations to affairs of state 
british prime minister margaret thatcher used the phrase to 
strive to seek to find in welcoming ronald reagan back from a 
summit in moscow with mikhail gorbachev in 1988 
sen edward kennedy of massachusetts borrowed the same words in 
a dramatic speech at the 1980 democratic national convention in new 
york conceding victory to jimmy carter 
had he but time enough there was more that bush might have 
borrowed from this archly romantic poem about the wily warrior of 
greek myth 
it is a poem about ulysses not in his prime not in his myriad 
of misadventures on the circuitous 20year route home from the 
trojan wars but about the ennui that settled in after he has been 
back in ithaca for a few years 
it little profits that an idle king 
by this still hearth among these barren crags 
matchd with an aged wife i mete and dole 
unequal laws unto a savage race 
that hoard and sleep and feed and know not me 
like the peripatetic bush who has traveled the world in his six 
months as president this senescent adventurer cannot wait to hit 
the road again 
i cannot rest from travel i will drink 
life to the lees 
much have i seen and known cities of men 
and manners climates councils governments 
myself not least but honord of them all 
this ulysses having outwitted the cyclops navigated scylla 
and charybdis escaped the clutches of circe and rescued his wife 
the faithful penelope from her overbearing suitors wants to 
leave the dull business of running the island to son telemachus 
whose disposition apparently was more suited to bureaucratic 
affairs 
he works his work i mine said the father 
as the poem builds to its stirring climax ulysses summons 
former comrades to join him in pursuit of new adventure 
the long day wanes the slow moon climbs the deep 
moans round with many voices come my friends 
tis not too late to seek a newer world 
push off for my purpose holds 
to sail beyond the sunset and the baths 
of all the western stars until i die 
scholars differ on whether tennyson intended to lionize this 
geriatric adventurer or debunk his dreams 
on capitol hill where bush said our future as a spacefaring 
nation will be decided the presidential rhetoric rang hollow to 
many 
democrats said the soaring speech failed to address how much 
bushs space goals would cost or where the money would come from to 
pay for them 
the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can 
marshal the words but the resources to restore americas 
preeminence in space chided house majority leader richard 
gephardt of missouri 
gephardt didnt resort to verse but he got his point across 
in sum mr president theres no such thing as a free 
launch

the government has ignored its own warnings to 
improve defenses against spies the senate intelligence committee 
says in a report that comes as embassy security undergoes new 
scrutiny in the felix s bloch espionage case 
in unusually harsh language the committee said bureaucratic 
infighting has paralyzed the new security evaluation office 
established last year under cia director william webster to bolster 
antispy efforts at us embassies around the world 
it has failed to achieve its objectives the panel said in 
an assessment written before last weeks public revelation that 
bloch once the no 2 official at the us embassy in vienna was 
under investigation for allegedly passing secrets to the soviet 
union ranking committee members had been informed of the bloch 
case absent his name in late june 
while the report deals mainly with technological efforts to 
thwart spying at us posts abroad it highlights the state 
departments longstanding reputation among intelligence 
professionals for giving short shrift to security 
the panel noted for example that the state department has 
failed to create a toplevel office for a director of diplomatic 
security despite the administrations own recommendation for such 
a position following a series of studies ending in 1987 
but several former diplomats and counterintelligence officials 
said in interviews tuesday that the department has tried to improve 
antispy efforts 
james nolan the recently retired head of the departments 
office of foreign missions and longtime deputy fbi 
counterintelligence chief said several fbi experts have been hired 
by the department 
and george a carver jr who was deputy for national 
intelligence for two cia directors said one of the toughest 
things to do is have counterintelligence in an open society im 
not suggesting we become a police state but i think we do need to 
review our policies carver supports lie detector tests for 
foreign service officers like those given regularly to 
intelligence officers 
since the year of the spy in 1985 when 12 americans were 
arrested for spying espionage cases have not abated either in 
terms of their number or their seriousness the senate committee 
said 
in a bill authorizing intelligence activities for the two years 
beginning oct 1 the panel has mandated that the fbi be given 
primary responsibility for investigating spying by anyone 
associated with the us government 
the move follows criticism of the naval investigative services 
initial investigation of reports that marine security guards at the 
us embassy in moscow let soviet agents roam the building after 
hours 
but the documents recommendations also can be read as 
applicable to initial moves n the bloch case where the first 
interviews with him were conducted by state department security 
officers 
bloch was suspended with pay and his state department clearance 
lifted on june 22 but government sources said he had been tipped 
earlier by the soviet kgb spy agency that he was under surveillance 
soviet government spokesman gennady gerasimov asked at a news 
briefing in moscow today whether bloch was ever connected to the 
kgb or other east bloc intelligence agency said that is pure 
speculation told by reporters that he could end the speculation 
he said the speculation has not been confirmed 
congressional intelligence officials who declined to be 
identified by name said tuesday it is odd that the government has 
not yet been able to pull together enough information to arrest the 
diplomat ranking members of the congressional intelligence 
committees typically are briefed about such cases only when an 
arrest is likely within hours or days in the bloch case such 
briefings took place roughly a month ago 
the senate committee last week cut the bush administrations 
request for the security evaluation office from 9 million to 45 
million because of lack of cooperation demonstrated by both state 
department and the intelligence community the money will be 
restored if the organizations can learn to work together it said 
the office was intended to assemble intelligence experts to 
evaluate security threats vulnerabilities and countermeasures 
the committee said but the state department has failed to consult 
the office on embassy security and intelligence officials have 
been unwilling to recognize legitimate department concerns the 
report said 
the panel reserved its strongest language for a warning against 
trying to salvage the partially completed new us embassy building 
in moscow which is riddled with kgb listening devices the cia 
still does not completely understand 
president reagan concluded the structure should be demolished 
but the bush administration is reconsidering reversing that 
decision would invite another security disaster and confirm signs 
that the executive branch is incapable of effective action in this 
field the committee said

the fouryearold night stalker serial 
killing trial of richard ramirez is nearing its finale as the fate 
of the 29yearold drifter is submitted to jurors who will weigh 13 
murder charges 
in the final hours of closing arguments a prosecutor called for 
ramirez to be convicted of gruesome crimes he called consummate 
acts of cowardice 
a defense attorney urged jurors to bring in verdicts of 
innocent claiming there was reasonable doubt that ramirez really 
was the devilworshipping night stalker who murdered raped and 
robbed his victims while forcing some to swear to satan 
ramirez once shouted hail satan in court and displayed a 
pentagram the inverted star symbol associated with devil worship 
drawn on his palm 
superior court judge michael tynan planned to instruct jurors in 
the law today then submit the case for deliberations 
the tall shaggyhaired ramirez of el paso texas is charged 
with 13 murders and 30 related felonies during a series of slayings 
in the summer of 1985 witnesses have identified him as the 
intruder who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors 
these were murders of men in their sleep rapes and sodomy of 
women after their husbands were dead declared deputy district 
attorney p philip halpin in the final moments of his reply to 
defense arguments tuesday the prosecutor reminded jurors of 
physical evidence found at several murder scenes that linked 
ramirez to the killings among the items were pentagrams 
some of these cases are carbon copies of each other said 
halpin 
you have all the evidence in the world to reach the logical 
and reasonable conclusion that the defendant is guilty as 
charged he concluded 
earlier defense attorney ray clark suggested there was 
reasonable doubt about ramirez guilt that witnesses wrongly 
identified him as the night stalker 
im asking you to go in take a look at all the evidence 
discuss it among yourselves and come back with 43 notguilty 
verdicts he told the jury 
he acknowledged that ramirez confessed he was the night 
stalker but insisted he did it because he thought such 
bravado would impress other prisoners 
jail is a dangerous place to be clark said and in the 
pecking order the murderers get the most respect 
halpin in his reply stressed that ramirez has no contact with 
other prisoners 
if murderers are treated better in jail it doesnt matter 
he said because hes kept segregated hes off in a room alone 
for obvious reasons 
two witnesses have said ramirez told them i am the night 
stalker

cargo ships sailed into christian ports 
today to deliver food to the besieged christian enclave drawing 
only light fire from syrian gunners a newspaper said an informal 
truce was in effect 
a police spokesman said two of the vessels dropped anchor at 
beirut port in the citys christian sector and three arrived in the 
port of jounieh in the christian heartland 
the spokesman refused to give any information about the ships 
he said syrian gunners deployed in moslem west beirut fired 
only six howitzer shells at the christiancontrolled coastline 
as the ships steamed slowly into dock 
he said no casualties were reported and noted it was very 
unusual of the syrians not to fire heavily at ships heading for 
ports in the 310squaremile christian enclave 
the daily newspaper annahar said an undeclared truce had 
taken effect in the 19week confrontation between gen michel 
aouns christian forces and moslem militias allied with syrian 
troops the report could not be confirmed 
the syrian land and sea blockade imposed march 8 has left the 
christian community desperately short of fuel food and other 
supplies it was imposed after aoun blockaded illegal militiarun 
ports south of beirut 
a spokesman for aouns headquarters who refused to be named 
confirmed that several vessels anchored at christian ports 
overnight and said the syrians fired a only few rounds i dont 
know why their barrage was not as intense as it usually is 
also today syrian and christian forces skirmished with 
automatic rifles across beiruts dividing green line wounding nine 
people 
that raised the overall toll to 453 killed and 1869 wounded in 
the current round of lebanons 14yearold civil war 
annahar said a threemember arab league committee had won a 
temporary truce after discreet contacts with the warring sides 
the paper said the combatants agreed to give the committee 
another chance to bring about a peaceful end to the conflict it 
did not elaborate 
annahar noted however that in the absence of any official 
truce announcement it is not known how long the ceasefire would 
last 
king fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of morocco and 
algerian president chadli bendjedid were asked at an arab league 
summit in may to settle the lebanese conflict by november 
the kuwaiti daily newspaper alqabas in a frontpage report 
said the arab committee has decided to freeze its mediation due to 
syrias refusal to accept aoun as a negotiating partner 
the paper quoted syrian president hafez assad as telling the 
saudi moroccan and algerian foreign ministers during a recent 
meeting in damascus if our lebanese allies accept aoun as a 
negotiator on behalf of the other party we will not accept him 
this is a final and irreversible decision 
accordingly the threemember commitee has decided to freeze 
its activities for a short period of time pending a solution to 
this snag the report added 
aoun a maronite catholic declared a war of liberation 
against syrias 40000 troops who were deployed in predominantly 
moslem sections of lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate 
the christians contend the syrian troops betrayed their mandate 
by fighting on the moslem side in the civil war

president bushs nominee to head the federal 
railroad administration says he supports phasing out amtrak funding 
rather than abruptly cutting it off as proposed in the presidents 
budget 
gilbert e carmichael said during a senate hearing tuesday that 
if confirmed he would not push for a cutoff of amtrak funding next 
year 
the reagan administration tried for several years to get 
congress to drop the subsidy of the increasingly successful 
passenger rail system but congress has kept the funding the cut 
also is proposed in bushs fiscal 1990 budget 
amtrak is seeking a 656 million subsidy for fiscal 1990 which 
begins oct 1 the railroad took in a record 11 billion in 
revenue on its own last year

position and said his nomination has wide support among committee 
members the hearing was held by the commerce science and 
transportation committee 
im pleased to recognize your support for amtrak said exon 
dneb

position meant he would seek selfsufficiency for amtrak a few 
years down the road rather than in the next year 
carmichael is a meridian miss automobile dealer and real 
estate developer with wide experience in regional rail issues 
carmichael has served for the past four months as a consultant 
in the transportation department preparing for approval of his 
nomination 
i am committed to the preservation of a national rail 
passenger network as part of a balanced transportation system and 
helping it to be selfsupporting and a vital part of the 21st 
century he told the committee 
he said he also wanted to play a key role in developing 
highspeed trains to go up to 300 mph and trains operated by 
magnetic levitation 
carmichael said that with gridlock on some roads and in the 
skies over big cities americas railroads are the one 
transportation mode with excess capacity he said only about 25 
percent of the nations rail capacity is being used 
carmichael has lost republican races in mississippi for 
governor lieutenant governor and the us senate he served in 
1976 as a federal commissioner for the national transportation

austrian officials investigating a senior 
us diplomat suspected of spying want to question a call girl with 
whom he was involved a senior government official said 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov today 
ducked questions about the us diplomat who is suspected of 
spying for the soviets 
the austrian official who spoke tuesday on condition of 
anonymity confirmed a newspaper report quoting interior ministry 
officials as saying the envoy felix s bloch was involved with a 
call girl 
there is a woman with whom mr bloch has maintained a long 
relationship in austria the official said 
abc news reported from washington last weekend that during 
initial questioning by us authorities bloch claimed at one point 
that he spied because he fell into a soviet sex trap but the 
network said investigators have discounted that story 
the austrian official told the associated press that the woman 
is on vacation and believed to be out of the country 
we have no reason to look for her abroad but when she comes 
back from her vacation we are going to talk to her to find out 
whether she had any suspicions of spying in any direction he 
said 
she is a source of information for us but there is nothing 
pending against her he said adding that the woman who was in 
her 30s was an austrian citizen and a vienna resident 
he emphasized this was just one of the lines being pursued by 
the austrian and american officials probing the bloch affair 
at a news briefing in moscow today gerasimov was asked if bloch 
was ever connected to the kgb or any east bloc intelligence agency 
he called such reports pure speculation 
pressed by reporters who suggested that an explicit answer could 
end speculation he said only the speculation has not been 
confirmed 
in washington state department officials declined to discuss 
the report about the call girl they have refused to respond to all 
questions that could have a bearing on the investigation 
formerly the no 2 official in the us embassy in vienna the 
54yearold bloch was placed on leave with pay on june 22 he has 
surrendered his diplomatic passport and state department 
credentials but he has not been charged with any crime nor has his 
travel been restricted 
former us ambassador to austria helene von damm has said 
bloch had the same top clearance as an ambassador for topsecret 
information and thus knew the identities of cia agents in vienna

blacks will seek medical care 
at eight whitesonly hospitals next week as part of a defiance 
campaign protesting discrimination and segregated national 
elections antiapartheid leaders announced today 
the activists detailed the first phase of the campaign a day 
after law and order minister adriaan vlok threatened to crack down 
on revolutionaries and radicals who were organizing the 
protests 
vlok contended that the civil disobedience campaign as well as 
terrorist attacks had been ordered by the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement in an effort to disrupt the 
sept 6 parliamentary elections parliament has chambers for 
whites asians and people of mixedrace but the black majority is 
excluded 
a coalition of antiapartheid groups in statements issued at a 
news conference accused vlok of trying to foster paranoia among 
white voters and said the defiance campaign would be nonviolent 
it is our right to defy the criminal and illegal apartheid 
regulations which are denying our people the right to health care 
education housing one statement said the government claims 
to be dismantling apartheid our experience tells us otherwise 
saki macozome an official of the south african council of 
churches said nonwhites who required medical care would seek 
treatment starting aug 2 at four white hospitals in transvaal 
province and four in natal province 
we will consider all hospitals to be open to all people from 
aug 2 onwards said a statement endorsed by the church council 
and several leading antiapartheid groups these included the black 
sash civil rights organization and the congress of south african 
trade union the countrys largest black labor federation 
the groups gave no details about other planned actions during 
the defiance campaign but they confirmed that segregated 
recreational facilities would be targeted activists denied vloks 
allegation that the campaign would include firebomb attacks on the 
homes of parliamentary candidates 
health minister willie van niekerk said the authorities would 
not allow health care to be disrupted by protesters 
any patient suffering from an acute illness will not be turned 
away before receiving the necessary treatment regardless of their 
population group van niekerk said adding that such patients 
would be charged standard fees 
people not requiring urgent care will be requested to leave 
the premises in an orderly fashion he said 
vlok in a speech tuesday said disruptions of the election 
campaign must be stopped at all costs 
however the antiapartheid groups said a crackdown on peaceful 
protests could trigger a backlash 
while the white leaders are campaigning to be elected they 
are once again planning to place the black leadership behind 
bars the statement said such actions by the state are 
precisely what would precipitate the kind of uncontrolled violence 
which vlok is accusing us of planning

ethnic russians stopped operations at 19 
industrial plants in estonia today and held protest meetings about 
legislation they say favors the republics ethnic estonian 
majority strikers and news reports said 
the walkouts which began at seven plants on tuesday escalated 
as soviet officials ended a potentially disastrous strike by 
roughly half the nations 1 million miners 
as many as 25000 workers in estonia stopped working halting 
operations at enterprises from electronics plants to a defense 
industry factory said yevgeny kolekhnik chairman of the strike 
committee at the baltic shipyard in tallinn the estonian capital 
tens of thousands of workers attended protest meetings this 
morning said yaroslav tolstikhov head of the economics section at 
sovietskaya estoniya tallinns russianlanguage communist party 
daily 
thousands tens of thousands of people took part its hard to 
say just how many tolstikhov said in a telephone interview 
the strike isnt having a great economic impact he added 
it is mostly psychological many tallinn industries are closed 
for routine summer vacations 
strikers are complaining about a proposed law requiring that 
people live in the republic two years before they can vote 
according to rahve haal and sovietskaya estoniya two communist 
party dailies in estonia 
they see the law as one more estonian assertion of power in 
1988 thousands of ethnic russians migrated to estonia because the 
republic enjoys a higher living standard than other parts of the 
soviet union therefore the law making people wait before voting 
would primarily affect them 
the estonian strike comes as more miners returned to work they 
began striking july 11 and the unrest eventually closed mines from 
the ukraine to the arctic 
miners began returning to work thursday after officials agreed 
to most of their demands including increases in deliveries of meat 
and soap and rights to share management of their industry 
many miners who had refused to return went back tuesday after 
president mikhail s gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
signed a letter guaranteeing pay raises longer vacations and other 
benefits said yuri a bolderev a strike leader from the donetsk 
basin the biggest soviet coal field 
coal ministry officials said tuesday that 79 mines remained 
idle most in the donetsk basin 550 miles south of moscow in the 
ukraine tass reported 
the national parliament the supreme soviet appealed tuesday to 
soviet workers not to strike 
lawmakers said they would adopt laws by autumn giving workers 
more control of management and profits and ensuring democratic 
elections of local government officials kremlin leaders and the 
miners have accused local authorities of insensitivity to workers 
problems 
the coal strikes crippled coke and steel plants in much of the 
soviet union and meeting the miners demands will cost an 
estimated 46 billion to 86 billion said viktor g kurcherenko 
head of the parliamentary budget commission 
the estonia strike appeared minor in comparison 
but it signals a possible increase in ethnic tension in estonia 
which leads the drive in the 15 soviet republics for greater 
economic and political autonomy from moscow 
estonians who make up 65 percent of the republics 16 million 
people have pushed through their parliament a law making estonian 
the official language causing protests among russians who comprise 
28 percent of the population 
it was unclear whether the national parliament would allow the 
proposed election law to stand the central newspaper komsomolsaya 
pravda reported from tallinn that just 58 of 244 deputies present 
in parliament monday opposed the law virtually guranteeing its 
passage 
but the parliament decided to withhold final passage for at 
least 10 days said tarmu tammerk of tallinns weekly newspaper 
kodumaa 
in october the national parliament vetoed an estonian law 
giving the republic wide autonomy but on monday gorbachev said he 
would allow regional authorities greater latitude in carrying out 
local elections scheduled for spring 
the estonian strike was organized by the union of soviet working 
collectives according to komsomolskaya pravda and press reports 
read by tammerk 
sovietskaya estoniya carried photographs showing signs plastered 
on the gates of the dvigatil defense industry plant and one of the 
shipyards saying in russian we are on strike

former beatle ringo starr on his first us tour 
in more than a decade has succeeded in blocking the release of an 
album that hes displeased with 
the album due to be released this week was put on hold tuesday 
for 30 days by a superior court judge while lawyers for the rock 
star and a memphis producer try to settle the issue 
judge ralph hicks continued a temporary order starr had obtained 
monday after he said he didnt like his drum performances and 
wanted to redub them before the albums release 
starr also balked at a demand by crs records of college park and 
producer chips moman of memphis tenn that he pay them 146239 
to prevent release of the recordings which starr made in february 
and april 1987 moman had rejected starrs offer of 100000 
starrs lawyers accused moman of trying to release the album on 
an unheardof label to take advantage of the former beatles 
concert tour which began earlier this month 
attorney jane stevens said crs records which moman formed with 
a partner in april could not handle the album in a manner 
befitting an artist of starrs stature 
moman acknowledged that the label is new and operates out of his 
lawyers offices but he said he wants to put the album out before 
starr has a chance to put out a live recording from his tour and 
kill any chances i got of getting anything off this product 
he also said he was frustrated by repeated efforts to reach the 
singer and by starrs refusal to use any song from the album during 
his tour 
starr contended in his lawsuit that the original recordings 
quality was not up to his standards because moman brought alcoholic 
beverages to the recording sessions

pope john paul ii today appointed four 
bishops in czechoslovakia marking another breakthrough in vatican 
relations with the soviet bloc 
the appointments were made after years of negotiations with 
czechoslovakias communist government which maintains rigid 
controls on organized religion the vatican estimates that 60 
percent of czechoslovakias 15 million people are catholic 
the popes special envoy for eastern europe archbishop 
francesco colasuonno took part last week in the latest in a series 
of talks in czechoslovakia 
the announcement came a day after the papal appointment of the 
first bishop in the soviet republic of byelorussia in more than 60 
years and the recent reestablishment of diplomatic relations with 
poland 
these appointments do not mean that everything has been 
resolved for the church in czechoslovakia we are still in the 
initial stages said deputy vatican spokesman the rev giovanni 
dercole 
appointed were monsignor jan sokol 55 promoted from apostolic 
administrator of trnava to archbishop of that city the rev josef 
koukl 62 a theology professor as bishop of litomerice the rev 
frantisek tondra 53 a parish priest as bishop of spis and the 
rev frantisek vanak 73 a parish priest as apostolic 
administrator of olomouc 
a written statement by dercole said vanak has all the powers of 
a residential bishop and is expected to be given the rank of 
archbishop soon 
with the appointments the church has now filled six of the 13 
dioceses with bishops 
the pope has often lamented the lack of bishops and the advanced 
age of church officials who are led by 90year cardinal frantisek 
tomasek the archbishop of prague 
dercole said negotiations are continuing to fill all the posts 
we hope this is a question of months and not years he said 
the vatican has refused to appoint any bishop who is a member of 
the governmentsponsored organization of clergy called pacim in 
terris and the dercole said none of the four appointed today 
belonged to it 
in the first step forward in 15 years the pope named three 
bishops in may 1988 but none held the rank of residential bishop 
the papal envoy colasuonno has been negotiating with vladimir 
janku head of the governments religious affairs office

the sek kong detention center where more than 7000 vietnamese are 
kept in tents

colony after fleeing their communist hommeland by boat 
authorities claim the violence began when about 200 vietnamese 
hurled stones sunday night at guards who were trying to prevent 
detainees from slipping through holes cut in the barbed wire 
fencing around the camp the unrest flared again several hours 
later 
police originally said only four vietnamese requested treatment 
for injuries after the incident including three who said they were 
hurt accidentally police also said the death of a vietnamese man 
that night was not due to natural causes but provided no further 
details

behavior

house democrats today pushed ahead with a bill 
to ban flag burning after overruling republican demands for a 
constitutional amendment as the only way to overcome a supreme 
court ruling legalizing that form of protest 
rep jack brooks dtexas chairman of the house judiciary 
committee squelched a gop attempt to substitute an amendment for 
his proposed statute outlawing desecration of the flag including 
burning with penalties of up to a year in jail plus a fine 
brooks ruled that the amendment backed by president bush and 
offered by rep james sensenbrenner rwis was nongermane to the 
committees business today 
keeping the constitutional amendment from a vote is going to 
come back soon enough to haunt those who made the decision 
because a statute would never work sensenbrenner argued 
committee debate brought out strong views on both sides of the 
issue 
rep george crockett dmich said he thought the supreme court 
was correct when it protected flag burning as a means of protest 
it was only an issue in congress he said because the flag was 
used as a weapon by bush in the 1988 campaign and democrats were 
running scared whenever the question of the flag has been 
raised 
but rep chuck douglas rnh said the american people were 
demanding action and the democrats claiming they were protecting 
the first amendment by blocking a constitutional amendment reminded 
him of repression in poland and hungary 
those who scream first amendment the loudest are the ones 
shutting off debate he said 
the democraticcontrolled committees meeting today was cut 
short because the house republican leadership has refused unless a 
constitutional amendment is also voted upon to waive a rule 
barring committees from voting on bills when any legislation is 
being considered on the house floor 
the panel was to resume its work thursday 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and the other top 
democrats contend the statute can pass constitutional muster 
because it doesnt take into account whether the flag burning or 
other mutilation was part of a protest or similar act 
brooks bill also makes an exception so that veterans groups and 
others can continue to dispose of old wornout flags for which 
burning is the traditional method 
the bill also provides for the law to get expedited review by 
the supreme court which started the political fire last month when 
it threw out by a 54 vote a texas statute against flag burning 
the court said the statute banned political expression which is 
protected by the bill of rights 
the ruling was widely condemned by lawmakers in both parties 
but president bush made it an intense political fight when he said 
he would support only the constitutional amendment approach to 
overcoming it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday that bush 
remained adamant in his belief that the flag should be 
constitutionally protected 
the justice department concluded that no simple statute could 
accomplish the goals of those who want to protect the flag 
fitzwater said 
the house judiciary subcommittee on constitutional rights heard 
testimony from the justice department and from scholars including 
harvard university constitutional expert laurence tribe who said 
the court might ok a regular statute 
the democratic leadership has tentatively scheduled a vote on 
the statute next week in the hope support for a constitutional 
amendment will cool during congress august recess 
the senate has scheduled votes on both the amendment and a 
statute in october

halting operations at enterprises from electronics plants to a 
defense industry factory said yevgeny kolekhnik chairman of the 
strike committee at the baltic shipyard in tallinn the estonian 
capital 
the walkouts there began tuesday 
strikers are complaining about a proposed law requiring that 
people live in the republic two years before they can vote 
they see the law as one more estonian assertion of power in 
1988 thousands of ethnic russians migrated to estonia because the 
republic enjoys a higher living standard than other parts of the 
soviet union therefore the law on voting primarily would affect 
them 
estonia leads the drive in the 15 soviet republics for greater 
economic and political autonomy from moscow 
estonians who make up 65 percent of the republics 16 million 
people have pushed through their parliament a law making estonian 
the official language causing protests among russians who comprise

it was unclear whether the national parliament would allow the 
proposed election law to stand 
the estonian strike escalated as coal miners began ending a 
series of strikes that began july 11 
miners began returning to work late last week after officials 
agreed to most of their demands including increases in deliveries 
of meat and soap and rights to share management of their industry

commuted to life imprisonment life sentences were reduced to 10 
years and other punishments were cut by twothirds the order said 
criminal cases still being heard are to be closed 
the amnesty applies only to those who committed offenses before 
sept 18 1988 the day the military moved to crush a nationwise 
prodemocracy uprising it does not apply to cases of high treason 
or breaches of martial law stipulations imposed since then 
martial law is aimed at preventing an upsurge of popular 
discontent against authoritarian rule similar to that seen last 
year gatherings of more than five people are forbidden and 
freedom of speech is greatly curtailed 
on july 18 the eve of a planned opposition rally the military 
tightened martial law and threatened death sentences for offenders

newspaper in burma said 3944 prisoners had been released

arrest but that is like being only slightly pregnant he said he 
spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with british custom 
the spokesman said the foreign office had summoned the burmese 
ambassador in london and protested strongly about the treatment 
of aris 
how can they forbid a british subject with a valid visa for 
burma to see someone from the embassy in rangoon he is a british 
subject and he has every right to go to the embassy the 
spokesman said 
the foreign office said britains charge daffaires had been

soviet union in a sexforsecrets deal he was sentenced to 30 
years later reduced to 25 years 
lonetree fired kunstler and stuhff after his conviction 
if it helps the client they can say anything they want about 
the lawyers kunstler said tuesday i almost wish they were 
right kunstler said he cannot recall any government offers that 
were not communicated to lonetree 
the appeal claims lonetree was not told by kunstler or stuhff 
that early in the case the government would have agreed to a 
fiveto10year sentence in return for cooperation 
the appeal filed by washington lawyers lee calligaro and daniel 
johnson also said a military attorney representing lonetree was 
rebuffed by kunstler and stuhff when he sought to pursue 
pleabargaining negotiations before trial 
stuhff said the appeals characterization of his efforts on 
lonetrees behalf are completely dishonest he said plea 
bargaining was aggressively pursued the government never offered 
to settle for as little as five years and lonetree was informed of 
all offers

a united airlines pilot declared there 
is no hero in the fiery dc10 crash in which survivors 
outnumbered fatalities and said he learned a new way of flying in 
the final minutes of flight 232 
it was just a group of four people who did their job said 
capt al haynes in his first public comments since the july 19 
crash it was an unusual circumstance but we put our best 
resources and knowledge together and did what we felt was best 
haynes said the flight crew never doubted the stricken jetliner 
would make it to sioux gateway airport where the jetliner 
crashlanded short of a runway flipped and broke apart of the 296 
aboard 185 people survived 
we must not forget that 111 people perished in this accident 
this crew is dedicated to finding the cause of this accident so 
we can maybe never have it happen again said haynes a 33year 
united pilot 
later he and his wife darlene flew home to seattle to 
applause and hugs from family and neighbors outside their small 
yellow house a few blocks east of seattletacoma international 
airport 
its just great to be home the 57yearold pilot told a 
crowd of reporters outside if you can give me a few days maybe 
we can all get together and talk about this 
united spokesman rob doughty said however it might be a month 
or more before the crew would give any interviews 
at tuesdays news conference haynes said he heard a very loud 
report as the dc10 flew over northwest iowa on a flight from 
denver to philadelphia via chicago he immediately began shutting 
down the jetliners no 2 tailmounted engine 
it was very shortly after this that we realized we had more 
than just an engine failure said haynes it was apparent to us 
that we had lost all of our hydraulic fluid 
when he asked flight engineer dudley dvorak for the procedure 
for that he said there isnt one so we made it up as we went 
along haynes said 
the hydraulic systems allow pilots to set key wing and tail 
panels that control the dc10s altitude and direction without 
them the pilot has little control over the airplane other than his 
throttles 
aviation experts have credited haynes with keeping the craft 
aloft until he reached the airport where hundreds of emergency 
workers were waiting 
asked about passengers who characterized him as a hero haynes 
said im not so sure i know how to answer that there is no 
hero 
haynes appeared with dvorak at the news conference but united 
officials said in advance that dvorak would have no comments 
dvorak 51 returned home to tacoma wash on tuesday 
haynes had scars from the crash on his face and hands in 
addition to casts on his broken ankles he appeared relaxed and 
joked occasionally with the horde of reporters who showed up for 
the hospital news conference 
he wouldnt answer questions about details of the crash his 
suspicions of its cause and the reasons for his decisions citing 
the ongoing probe by the national transportation safety board 
investigators are attempting to piece together the tail system 
in an airport hangar they theorize that pieces hurled from the 
engine may have shattered the jets hydraulic lines the probe 
however has been hampered because key sections of the engine 
havent been found 
despite the damage to the aircraft haynes said the thought of 
a crash didnt enter his mind as he focused all his attention on 
the stricken craft 
i really didnt think about it he said we were just 
going to go in and land and thats what we tried to do 
haynes also credited other crew members copilot william r 
records and denny fitch an instructor pilot who works for united 
but was a passenger on flight 232 records and fitch remain 
hospitalized 
we became a fourman crew instead of a threeman crew said 
haynes 
in washington meanwhile transportation secretary samuel 
skinner said that nothing about the crash indicates that other 
dc10s are unsafe or that anything more now needs to be done to 
make them safer he defended new federal aviation administration 
head james busey who declared the dc10 a safe aircraft even 
though the cause of the crash has not been determined 
ntsb inspector jack young arrived today at a general electric 
co jet engine plant in the cincinnati suburb of evendale to 
examine the manufacturing records for the engine that blew apart 
the plant made all three of the dc10s engines

housing secretary jack kemp today pledged not 
to overlook his departments duties to the poor and elderly as he 
tackles the herculean task of cleaning up the scandalplagued 
agency 
we are going to both clean up hud and make it work while 
moving forward on goals that congress and president bush have laid 
out kemp told the house select committee on aging during a 
hearing on housing for the elderly 
alluding to recent allegations about fraud and 
influencepeddling under his predecessor at hud kemp said it was 
appropriate that he address the aging committee because there is 
no secretary in the cabinet who is aging faster 
he pledged that as we go about the herculean task of cleaning 
out the aegean stables i feel quite confident that we can move 
forward on policy programs reports to meet the great goals of the 
department of housing and urban development 
on tuesday kemp said in an interview on cbstv he believes 
therell be some people that go to jail and some ought to go 
to jail for their roles in the scandal he did not identify any 
individuals he had in mind 
kemp said he was shocked at the extent the scandal reached 
into the management of hud in the previous administration 
kemps predecessor samuel pierce wont have to return until 
september to testify before a panel investigating alleged fraud and 
influencepeddling at the department of housing and urban 
development 
pierce had been scheduled to testify aug 3 but the house panel 
investigating the hud case granted an extension to give him more 
time to prepare 
rep thomas lantos dcalif chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing said in a letter 
to pierce he agreed to the delay based on your apparent 
difficulty in retaining counsel to represent you at the 
subcommittee hearing 
pierce had been scheduled to face questions on his role in hud 
approval of more than 15 million in grants and subsidies for a 
north carolina project that was supported by a former law partner 
of pierce 
in his prior appearance before the subcommittee pierce said he 
took no direct role in hud funding decisions 
since then however there have been a number of indications 
that pierce was more active in hud projects than his testimony 
indicated including sworn testimony from a former hud official who 
said pierce personally ordered her to approve funding for the north 
carolina project 
also on tuesday the justice department said it is sending two 
attorneys to denver to help federal prosecutors in colorado 
investigate cases of fraud against hud 
william c hendricks iii head of the departments fraud 
section said hud fraud in colorado is so extensive that a large 
number of foreclosed properties on the market has depressed the 
building market 
denver will become the second city where washingtonbased fraud 
prosecutors have been detailed to investigate hud cases three 
justice department prosecutors have been working for the past year 
in oklahoma city assisting in the prosecution of hud and 
bankfraud cases in oklahoma 
so far the oklahoma city task force has obtained 16 felony 
convictions 
also the new york times reported today that hud documents 
provide the latest republican luminary to be tied to hud lobbying 
former sen george murphy of california lobbied on behalf of boston 
housing projects that later received millions of dollars in 
assistance 
the documents the newspaper said also show that murphy 
discussed potential business deals with former hud official deborah 
gore dean including a proposal for her to serve as a book agent on 
his memoirs murphy was quoted as saying in an interview that the 
book deal was not pursued and that his contacts with ms dean were 
proper

july 19 
the item sumter sc on the b2 bomber 
for taxpayers the b2 stealth bomber is the best and worst of 
defense items even if production of the fleet of planes stays on 
budget which is unlikely it is by far the most costly plane in 
history thats the bad news 
yet its promised capability to replace the uss aging 
longrange bombers make it one of the key components to defending 
america into the next century 
lines are being divided in congress with most of the division 
coming over the cost of the plane not whether it is a reliable 
deterrent to war 
unlike industry which can do testing and market research in 
private us defense is developed out in the open that is how it 
should be 
but it unfortunately allows decisions to be based on factors 
other than need while the need for star wars defense has always 
been open to debate the need for a new bomber system is not 
congress should continue full funding for research and 
development of the b2 and be ready to fund it if the tests 
results are positive

philadelphia daily news on the b2 bomber 
the b2 flew the other day it didnt go far or fast but it 
flew 
under ordinary circumstances this would not be impressive 
after all the least a 500 million airplane should be able to do 
is fly a little but these are not ordinary times 
some people are presenting this unimpressive feat as vindication 
of 22 billion already spent on the b2 and an excuse to spend 
another 70 billion 
jimmy carter canceled the troubled b1 program in 1980 on the 
ground that we could wait for the b2 reagan decided to do both 
the b1 works sometimes the b2 may never work neither has a 
mission at least one that makes any sense in the modern world 
instead of wasting more piles of money it would be more useful 
to revive the old idea of the marshal plan send all that b2 money 
to places like poland and hungary where it can be put to use 
curing a dreadful pollution problem and rebuilding an industrial 
base 
that would go a lot further toward ensuring the security of the 
united states than a fleet of incredibly expensive warplanes with 
no reason for existing

at long last a step has been taken in the right direction on 
the issue of campaign reform

of campaign funds would be prohibited and carrying over funds from 
one campaign to the next would be barred the proposal would also 
mandate the disclosure of indirect campaign contributions called 
soft money

that steps are being taken to end the backstage financing of 
congress members

the wichita kan eaglebeacon on president bushs clean air 
bill 
president bush last week proposed a weaker air pollution bill 
than hed led americans to expect 
last month when bush announced that he supported a tougher 
federal clean air law and outlined what provisions he thought such 
a law should have he seemed ready to take on the nations largest 
pollution source the car 
but his proposal actually could increase auto pollution in 
some regions 
bush at least is on board and congress is desirous of updating 
the woefully inadequate clean air act passed in 1977 
chances are good in brief that a better bill than bush 
proposed will come out of the congressional pipeline 
the process is off to a good start

waco texas tribuneherald on protecting the environment 
environmentalism has come a long way in the last two decades 
americans now generally accept the notion that society has a 
responsibility to defend the environment just as it defends 
citizens and the country 
the business of defending against ecological crimes has become 
much more intricate since the infancy of the environmental 
protection agency 
since the inception of the epas office of criminal 
investigations in 1982 the government has had considerable success 
in catching polluters in the act it has convicted 145 corporations 
and 375 people 
up until recently however the effect of such convictions was 
lessened by the fact that generally companies faced only fines 
since few of the crimes had felony status 
however in recent times congress elevated violations of the 
clean water act and superfund law to felony status meaning prison 
for the executives who oversee the crime 
thats as it should be when a company uses illegal dumping as a 
practice and can afford to risk the fine levied against it the 
management will hardly be deterred however when its executives 
know they can go to prison for illegal dumping they will stop and 
think 
americans have come to behold crimes against the environment as 
crimes against themselves it makes sense to have punishment that 
fits such a crime

albany ore democratherald on the space program 
if america wants to lead the way in space exploration as it 
should now is the time to start 
on the 20th anniversary of the first moon landing july 20 
president bush called on the united states to build a permanent 
base on the moon in the next century and then to send explorers to 
the planet mars these are worthy goals and they can be met but 
they cant be met the way things are going now 
the government in the 1960s could afford an ambitious space 
program today it cant 
a space program to colonize the moon and strike out for the 
planets might cost around to take a wild guess 100 billion a 
year to start 
bush congress and the american people ought to make up their 
minds to overcome the present hurdles and to tackle this project 
to start tens of billions of dollars going to the pentagon for 
expensive and unlikelytowork weapons should be diverted to nasa 
instead

postbulletin rochester minn on the space program 
the question is not whether america should renew and extend its 
commitment to space exploration it must do so 
the essential questions are about the priority this commitment 
should have relative to other national purposes and about the 
goals the program should accomplish 
a manned flight to mars as suggested by president bush would 
be a challenge equal to the moon flight but the 30 billion cost 
would be staggering and a project of that magnitude should require 
more specific justification than the desire to demonstrate our 
virtuosity in space 
what are the specific scientific goals what are the practical 
benefits either now or in the future 
the national aeronautics and space administration should not 
have the last word on such a project it is a vast bureaucracy that 
needs an new mission to justify future expansion 
the president and congress should consult the best scientific 
minds in the country before making irrevocable decisions on the 
issues 
it would profit us little to conquer mars while losing our base 
on earth to poverty crime and pollution 
a sense of proportion is needed as well as the desire for 
adventure and discovery in space

the seattle times on offshore drilling 
to hear interior secretary manuel lujan jr tell it the answer 
to the nations energy needs lies just several miles off our 
shores and in alaska 
since imported oil accounts for a significant part of the 
countrys total energy requirements lujan said were still 
vulnerable to a paralysis like the one created by the arab oil 
embargo of the 1970s 
the speech gave off disturbing signs that the bush 
administration is no more sensitive than its predecessor to the 
serious environmental issues involved in expanding offshore 
drilling in areas such as alaskas arctic national refuge and 
fragile sections of the washington and oregon coasts 
lujans remarks also signified that the administration is 
totally out of touch with the hot anger still being felt by most 
americans over the oil spill outrages of recent months 
lujan is right to remind americans that the nations domestic 
energy suppliers do not meet demand but a longterm solution to 
the problems of us dependence on foreign oil will be found 
elsewhere a greater emphasis on conservation for example 
the bush administration ought to be more aggressive in 
stiffening the timetable for fuelefficient vehicles and 
encouraging a faster search for environmentally safe alternatives 
to the burning of fossil fuels

the leafchronicle clarksville tenn on changing us coins 
does abraham lincoln need a facelift 
the image of mr lincoln as well as of the other former 
presidents who appear on the obverse of us coins will be 
revamped if congress has its way the flip side of the coins will 
be completely changed 
the director of the us mint donna pope testified before a 
house committee that she hasnt heard any demand from the public 
that the coins be altered in fact she said that the only people 
who seem to be calling for new coins are coin collectors 
regardless congress appears ready to go ahead with the 
redesign pending legislation would give the former presidents a 
new look and replace the tails images of the lincoln memorial 
monticello and the bald eagle with themes and freedoms guaranteed 
in the us constitution and the bill of rights 
coins would continue to be the same size weight color and 
metal content all current inscriptions would also remain 
including in god we trust 
congressional supporters of the change have pointed out that 
other western countries alter their coinage every few years in 
contrast mr lincolns face on the penny has been the same since 
1909 
well so what with the united states falling behind some 
nations in vital areas such as the production and export of 
technology should congress be worrying about keeping up on pocket 
change 
in the end the legislative debates promise to be time consuming 
and the redesign procedure costly 
to recoin a phrase the pennys image saved is a penny earned

the pressenterprise riverside county calif on the trade 
deficit 
any way theyre read the trade statistics for the month of may 
are not good news 
the nation seems to be exporting its manufactures about as fast 
as it can in april american exports amounted to 3076 billion 
the most ever and in may they were off a bare 1 percent call it 
a wash 
going as fast as it can the nation still lost ground like mad 
aprils trade deficit of 829 billion may sound like a lot on its 
face but in fact it was the best month of the young year in may 
its now reported the deficit puffed up to 1024 billion 
imports were up on every front but where consumers usually get 
the blame the fingerprints of american businessmen are all over 
this deficit imports of capital goods as opposed to consumer 
goods led the parade 
its one thing the experts reasoning goes to have consumers 
splurging on vcrs cds and video cameras there is a reasonable 
expectation that binges like these have to end sooner or later 
its another thing to have businesses importing supplies and 
equipment that probably means that these materials are not being 
made in this country at least not any more 
that dovetails uncomfortably with the fact that a lot of popular 
consumer electronic items no longer are made in america that all 
represents a competitive failure and nothing says that has to be 
a temporary condition

the house ways and means committee which every year gets the 
first chance to tell americans how heavily they will be taxed the 
year after is having a hard time keeping its eyes on the target 
it is true that taxpayers might applaud the committee if it does 
not pass a tax bill at all but the members do have a job and 
they should do it 
yet rather than addressing such issues as capital gains tax 
cuts and reductions in the levy on the retired elderly for 
catastrophic health insurance the panel has voted 16 billion to 
fund a childcare bill yet to be enacted 
the tax panel has already spent a lot of time finding taxes and 
fees to increase that is slicing the sausage thinly in order not 
to alarm president bush who during the presidential campaign 
pledged to hold the line 
until the democrats on capitol hill face up to the election

the joplin mo globe on the cause of the alaska oil spill 
a 110page report to the national transportation safety 
commission by alaska concludes that poor management by exxon 
shipping co was responsible for the nations worst oil spill when 
the exxon valdez went aground march 24 in alaskas prince william 
sound 
in fact said the man who headed the states inquiry management 
lapses and failures were so numerous that it is a wonder the 
exxon valdez was the first tanker grounded 
that condemnation should come as no surprise it was apparent in 
the first hours after the tanker struck the reef and began losing 
11 million gallons of oil that no one really had any idea of what 
to do vital equipment reportedly was out of service emergency 
plans for dealing with a spill of such magnitude were either 
nonexistent or fantasy 
oil spills simply must not be considered a risk of doing 
business congress must ensure that the oil companies have in place 
the methods and means for handling future calamities as well as for 
preventing them and exxon shipping co and alyeska pipeline 
service co must be required to pay dearly for their failures

can try their luck at picking the winning teams each week in the 
nfl state officials say they expect their take to be 4 million to 
9 million annually which would then go to support athletic 
programs at the states universities and colleges 
but before oregon starts counting its source of revenue it 
would be wise to take another look at its odds for success smart 
money says the nfl will file a lawsuit which is likely to 
involve years of costly delays 
then there is the matter of bookies for one thing they pay a 
higher return than the state and they never ask bettors to report 
their winnings to the internal revenue service the football 
lottery may be something less than a smash hit with the public 
some bettors will like the convenience of one stop shopping that 
allows them to pick up butter eggs and the seattle seahawks at 
plus three points at the local supermarket but is this really the 
best way to fund college sports not by a long shot

a chemical fire in a derailed tanker car 
burned into a fifth day today after firefighters failed to snuff 
it and an estimated 1000 residents were forced to spend another 
night away from home 
officials decided to let the fire burn itself out after attempts 
on tuesday to smother it with sodium bicarbonate powder were 
unsuccessful said a tittabawassee township fire department 
dispatcher who refused to give his name 
authorities met again this morning to discuss whether there is 
any way to get the fire out quicker they have said they cannot 
predict how long it will burn because they dont know how much 
chemical the car contained 
the car has been burning since a train owned by csx 
transportation inc derailed around midday saturday about 90 miles 
northwest of detroit 
meanwhile tuesday four cars of another csx train derailed in 
chatham ontario about 80 miles east of detroit police said 
authorities evacuated about 400 residents from a 1squaremile area 
as they unloaded butane and propane gas from the tankers none of 
which were ruptured 
in freeland at least 3000 people were forced to evacuate 
initially but most of them were allowed to return monday when the 
evacuation zone around the accident site was reduced from 15 square 
miles to 4 square miles 
the area wouldnt be decreased further until the chemical 
chlorosilene in the car burned off and two other derailed cars 
containing toxic plastic ingredients are removed csx spokesman r 
lindsay leckie said 
the other cars remained near the burning car but neither was 
leaking or burning leckie said 
hydrochloric acid fumes from the burning chlorosilene were 
dissipating in the air csx officials said 
officials have reported no serious injuries from the accident 
but many residents have experienced eye and skin irritation 
four people were released from st lukes hospital in nearby 
saginaw following treatment monday for eye and skin irritation and 
nausea hospital spokeswoman sally meter said

district of columbia police ordered two dozen 
women to walk more than a mile from a downtown street frequented by 
prostitutes to the virginia line and lawmakers from the state are

we get all the sludge all the garbage most of the prisoners and 
now their prostitutes said republican rep stan parris a 
frequent critic of how the nations capital is governed 
sen john warner rva went to the senate floor today to 
denounce the predawn tuesday incident as an indignity to the 
commonwealth of virginia he demanded that district mayor marion 
barry investigate the circumstances surrounding the police action 
and discipline those involved in this incredible almost 
unbelievable episode in law enforcement 
district deputy police chief edward j spurlock said tuesday 
that he would investigate the incident 
its definitely not something i would approve he said it 
sounds awful bizarre to me i assure you thats not the kind of 
thing we encourage 
police spokesman reginald l smith added this is not standard 
operating practice it is not a sanctioned effort the 
commanders of two police districts also denied their officers were 
responsible for the forced march 
the angry women were rounded up about 130 am tuesday and 
forced to walk through the business district and across the mall 
they said they were taking us to virginia that we could work 
over there said a woman who identified herself as a prostitute 
named toni they said wed go to jail if we stopped 
police who escorted the women with flashing lights on their 
squad cars made no arrests 
a washington post reporter and photographer recorded the 
incident

two men have been arrested after they 
mistakenly called police instead of the cab company they needed for 
their getaway after allegedly comitting a burglary 
we dont know how or why they called the liberty police 
department unless they knew they were being chased by police and 
dialed it subconsciously said chief edward eisely 
he said police received a report tuesday that someone had been 
robbed of 40 by two men 
shortly after the dispatcher alerted local taxi companies a man 
called saying he needed a cab right away for a ride to loch 
sheldrake a village 3 miles away 
the dispatcher advised them that they were talking to the 
police department and they immediately hung up eisely said 
cab companies were again notified and police followed and 
stopped a taxi that picked the suspects up eisely said 
the two men were charged with seconddegree burglary 
the only other time i can think of something like this 
happening was a few years ago in new york city when these guys 
tried to rob a bank during fbi payday eisely said they asked 
the teller for money and they heard about 15 guns clicking behind 
them

the 65mileperhour speed limit adopted for 
some rural interstate highways caused 550 additional deaths last 
year the insurance institute for highway safety said today 
in a report to congress the institute said highways with the 
higher limit had a 30 percent increase in fatalities twice the 
increase recorded by the institute and the transportation 
department for 1987 
brian oneill president of the research institute which is 
financed by insurance companies said states that kept the maximum 
speed limit at 55 mph had no significant increase in road deaths 
the speed has been increased to 65 on rural interstate highways 
in 38 states maximum speed elsewhere has remained 55 mph for 15 
years 
oneill said the conclusion that fatalities had increased 30 
percent on roads where the speed limit had been increased was based 
on an institute analysis of transportation department highway 
fatality records the department has not released its own 
interpretation of the data 
its a much greater increase in deaths than would have been 
expected if speed limits hadnt been changed oneill told a 
science space and technology committee transportation subcommittee

the united auto workers and nissan made 
lastminute appeals to 2400 workers and both sides prdicted 
victory today in balloting to decide if their plant will become the 
first union shop owned solely by a japanese automaker 
the uaw aired radio commercials tuesday echoing its theme that 
the fast work pace at nissan has increased injuries 
the significance to us has to do with the problems that nissan 
employees have theyre suffering a very brutal line speed and high 
injury rate union spokesman maxey irwin said 
the company has disputed this although it drew a 5000 fine 
from tennessee authorities now under appeal for refusing to 
show its injury log to a group of workers 
nissan meanwhile reportedly warned workers on closedcircuit 
videos that uaw representation could mean a loss of benefits for 
production line workers 
at a news conference today arranged by nissan antiunion 
employees predicted the uaw would be defeated 
i think its going to go fairly heavily for the plant against 
the union maybe 75 percent ken roden a 28yearold worker in 
the trim and chassis department 
uaw organizer jim weaver had the opposite view 
i think it really looks great the momentums building and 
people were coming out of the plant all excited this morning 
weaver said 
the company has declined to talk publicly about the campaign 
we dont want to conduct this election in the media president 
jerry benefield said earlier this month 
benefield addressed about half of the plants work force 
tuesday prounion workers said the speech was interrupted with 
chants of union union they added that some employees gave 
benefield a standing ovation 
the speech was closed to reporters and nissan officials 
declined to comment on it 
workers at nissan motor manufacturing co usas 
autoandtruck plant south of nashville were to begin voting today 
in an election thats crucial for the uaw 
reflecting an overall decline in union strength uaw membership 
has fallen from more than 15 million in the late 1970s to about 1 
million today hopes of stopping the decline rest largely with the 
growing number of plants operated by japanese automakers 
the union has organized workers in three joint ventures a 
mazdaford plant in flat rock mich run by mazda motor corp the 
new united motor manufacturing inc factory in fremont calif a 
venture of general motors corp and toyota motor corp and the 
diamondstar motors corp plant in bloomington ill a venture of 
chrysler and mitsubishi motors corp 
but workers at toyotas georgetown ky plant at honda motor 
corps marysville ohio facility and at nissans smyrna plant 
arent unionized 
an effort to organize the honda plant failed badly three years 
ago and labor observers say another defeat could cripple uaw hopes 
voting at smyrna is scheduled to end early thursday 
union spokesman irwin played down the votes importance 
within the uaw its not a question of if nissan or the other 
japanese assembly plants will be organized irwin said 
tuesday it is simply a question of when they will be organized 
nissans messages to workers reportedly blamed the union for 
layoffs at general motors and promised tough negotiations if the 
uaw wins 
the nashville banner reported today that it obtained an audio 
copy of a company tape in which a voice says that a uaw victory 
would mean the company would have to negotiate with the union not 
the workers 
who wins in negotiations is usually decided by who is in the 
strongest position so at nissan you start out knowing the company 
will not be easy in bargaining the tape said 
the tape also said employees should be concerned about strikes 
and that a strike could hurt them more than it could nissan 
television reports of strike violence and unsuccessful strikes are 
included in the videotape the newspaper reported 
union spokesman frank joyce said the tape was an inaccurate 
attempt to intimidate nissan workers 
the idea that somehow nissan is currently in a bargaining 
relationship on an individual basis with workers is pretty absurd 
nissan employees do not set their own wages benefits or working 
conditions joyce said if they want to declare in advance that 
they will be hard to bargain with were used to that

record companies and electronics manufacturers have 
reached an agreement over digital audio tape recorders opening the 
way for widespread marketing of the machines industry sources said 
dat equipment uses the same digital technology employed by 
compact disc players resulting in recordings that are close to 
perfect record companies have opposed the recorders out of the 
fear that they could be used to make highquality copies of cds and 
damage their sales 
the sources who spoke tuesday on condition of anonymity said 
us european and japanese record and electronics industry groups 
had agreed on an international standard that would allow sales of 
dat recorders that can make a direct digital recording from a 
digital source such as a cd 
but the dat machines would not be able to make copies of the 
copy the sources said because of an inaudible electronic signal 
added to the tape by the dat recorder such protection would 
prevent the multiple creation of lowcost pirate copies of 
expensive cds 
the accord will be publicized on thursday through press releases 
and private briefings trish heimers a spokeswoman for the 
recording industry association of america in washington said 
today she declined to give any details in advance 
represented in the working group that reached the agreement are 
15 japanese and european manufacturers the washingtonbased 
electronic industries association and two recording industry trade 
groups the recording industry association of america and the 
londonbased international federation of phonographic industries 
according to ron petty a sony corp of america spokesman in park 
ridge nj 
the copy protection system is one devised by nv philips of the 
netherlands and known as solo said albert ruttner a vice 
president of north american philips corp in new york 
it is expected to take several months for the manufacturers to 
add the copyprotection circuitry to the machines and bring the 
devices to market 
dat machines are now being sold in japan and parts of europe 
but the equipment currently on the market cannot make direct 
digital recordings from cds they must convert the digital signals 
first into analog mode and then reconvert them to digital 
resulting in a slight audio degradation 
the sources said the industry groups plan to apply to their 
governments for approval of dat sales under the new standard 
japanese electronics makers which manufacture most dat 
equipment have refrained from actively selling dat machines in the 
united states because of opposition from the us record industry 
the agreement is expected to result in the beginning of 
widespread us sales but the sources said they did not know 
exactly when marketing would start

romanias president indirectly denying 
widespread reports of economic hardship said in an interview 
published wednesday that living standards in his country rose 
greatly in the last decade 
president nicolae ceausescu told the rightist daily newspaper 
abc that living standards and state investment increased at the 
same time that romania managed to pay off its foreign debt romania 
first announced in april that the debt at 11 billion in 1981 
had been eliminated 
in this manner the repayment of the foreign debt not only did 
not affect our projects but economic development and the standard 
of living increased said ceausescu 
romania used to be known as the breadbasket of central europe 
before world war ii but agricultural production decreased by the 
1950s after the communist leadership decided to invest 
predominantly in heavy industry 
shortages increased with ceausescus decision in the 1970s to 
funnel most of romanias foreign currency earnings into debt 
payments as a result agricultural and manufactured goods needed 
at home frequently were exported investment went into nowoutmoded 
industries and western experts generally agree that industrial and 
agricultural production figures are below preworld war ii levels 
western journalists who traveled to bucharest this month for a 
meeting of the warsaw pact nations reported that most staple 
commodities were rationed 
answering nine questions accepted from a list presented by the 
newspaper ceausescu said romanias industrial output had increased 
135 times since 1945 and agricultural production has increased 
tenfold 
the subject of ceausescus succession was not included in the 
list of acceptable questions ceausescu 71 came to power in 1965 
he said sanctions imposed by the european parliament the 
12nation common markets legislature for alleged human rights 
violations didnt represent general opinion in western europe and 
business goes on 
the newspaper said the romanian leader asked those comments be 
off the record but it published them anyway 
ceausescu said there is no restriction on emigration but the 
government discourages romanians from leaving his comment 
contrasted with claims of harassment by those who have applied to 
leave and documented cases of border shootings of others trying to 
flee 
we believe people should not leave the country of their birth 
that they should remain and work to create a better future he 
said 
each year 11000 ethnic germans born in romania are allowed to 
emigrate to west germany in exchanged for hardcurrency payments by 
bonn

on the cover is a halfnaked woman blood 
trickling from her mouth 
inside are 110 pages of small type and penandink sketches of 
men with cigarettes clenched in their teeth and women with tears 
streaming down their faces and dresses sliding off their shoulders 
it must be the writing that makes the demon couple sell 
a tall shadow comes through the door she wants to cry out 
she wants to struggle but everything is so sudden the shadow sits 
on the edge of the bed and undoes her buttons 
it is the kind of sexually explicit sensationalist story that 
officials and editorial writers have condemned as spiritual 
drugs as they conduct a national magazine and book banning and 
burning campaign to root out alleged western liberal influences 
but the demon couple and similar shortstories all 
unthinkable in the more puritan atmosphere of a decade ago remain 
on the market their lurid covers framing many private bookstalls 
hardcore pornography is available too only slightly less boldly 
displayed 
the china daily said tuesday that authorities had seized 236000 
pornographic books and magazines nationwide this year but 
booksellers say most of what seized is political books with somber 
titles such as america as a riddle by journalist liu binyan and 
a 10year history of the cultural revolution 
booksellers keep these hidden under their tables 
when yan former head of the chinese academy of social sciences 
political science institute published his book several years ago 
it gained popularity among students for its insights into past 
factional fighting but yan spoke out in support of student 
prodemocracy protesters this spring and fled the country to 
escape arrest now he is referred to in the official media as 
the wanted yan jiaqi 
liu was in the united states during the protests but he 
condemned the crackdown putting himself in the ranks of the 
ostracized 
he has become so taboo that an editor at a publishing company 
who put out a book about him was arrested and copies of the book 
were ordered burned 
the state press and publications administration said last week 
it had made a list of 60 banned books but did not identify them 
these can only be deduced from what the culture ministry has seized 
from private stalls and what has disappeared from the shelves of 
staterun stores 
they include biographies of ousted communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang and several histories of modern china 
it is almost impossible to buy the narrative from the popular 
television program river elegy which stirred up controversy 
when it was shown last year for disparaging such chinese cultural 
totems as the great wall 
aging revolutionary veterans reportedly were incensed but hu 
qili the top party official in charge of the arts said at the 
time leading cadres may comment on literary and art works but 
their remarks should not be regarded as mandatory at no time 
should such questions be handled by launching a political 
movement 
the veterans have won the day however hu was purged in june 
along with party general secretary zhao ziyang and one of the 
authors of river elegy su xiaokang is reported arrested the 
peoples daily recently devoted onethird of its front page to a 
bitter attack on the show stations are barred from airing its 
sequel and sus other writings are banned 
the china daily said monday that authorities in southwest 
chinas sichuan province shut down the provincial academy of social 
sciences publishing company accusing it of printing an book that 
curses the communist party party leaders and workers 
movements the book was not named 
tales of illicit love and crime meanwhile sell briskly to 
chinese seeking escape from their drab workaday lives 
the plots vie in sensationalism women are seduced by evil 
gamblers drugged and raped by city slickers forced into 
prostitution by factory bosses many commit suicide young men 
slide into lives of crime and end up as murderers 
the communist party is promoting alternate summer reading 
senior leader deng xiaopings statements on quelling the student 
protests and compilations of newspaper editorials arguing that 
socialism is chinas only hope at least three special books on the 
protests have been issued or announced so far 
but store clerks say the chief purchasers are work units 
ordering by the dozen for political study classes 
the masses of readers seem to prefer stories of the kind the 
party has dubbed spiritual opium 
the stories are bizarre and they draw you in said a young 
woman reader they are not reallife but if you come home from 
work and are tired you sit down and read one and you cant put it 
down 
what about dengs speech meiyisi its boring

every morning at 6 oclock when 
many homes in eastern el salvador listen to guerrillarun radio 
this towns 2000 families tune in a social service program to hear 
if their us dollars have arrived 
paulina cabrera you have correspondence from the united 
states please come pick it up says an announcer 20 miles away 
in san miguel while reading the list of residents favored by the 
latest international courier delivery 
every single family here has at least one relative living in the 
washington area one resident says almost as many intipuquenos have 
gone to washington as remained behind 
the chainreaction from one residents journey 22 years ago has 
made intipuca an island of prosperity in a sea of backwardness 
it also underscores the dependence of tens of thousands of 
salvadoran families and the national economy as a whole on 
money sent by relatives working in the united states 
the amount sent back to this tiny warravaged central american 
country from about 500000 salvadorans who emigrated northward is 
believed to roughly equal annual us economic aid to el salvador 
which stands at 433 million 
the signs of intipucas properity are everywhere television 
antennae sprout from almost all its red tile roofs which sit atop 
decorous brightly painted homes even latemodel japanese pickups 
and fourwheel drive vehicles some with virginia or district of 
columbia plates are parked on the streets 
the land around intipuca in the easternmost province of la 
union is no more fertile than elsewhere in el salvador 
it provides enough corn and beans to keep hunger at bay 
however there is no way to escape the poverty unemployment 
disease and ignorance that characterize the lives of most rural 
salvadorans 
this town is better off than its neighbors for one main reason 
sigifrido chavez ventured to washington in 1967 
things went well there for the industrious young man who 
started out washing dishes moved on to construction and eventually 
started a small business 
he returned to intipuca a year after leaving but only to visit 
show off his new wardrobe and take back his brother to washington 
before long young men and women were taking advantage of the eras 
freely granted visas and emigrating there by the score in hopes of 
getting ahead 
most of them did 
its because of the unity the solidarity among intipuquenos 
that they have done well one helps another he helps the next and 
so on said maximiliano arias 
arias who heads the town council that decides how to spend 
communal funds sent by a washington committee of intipuquenos said 
intipucas latest census shows a population of just over 11000 
thats about how many intipuquenos we calculate are in 
washington said arias who has two sons there 
he said the us connection provides an estimated 100000 a 
month familytofamily and several thousand dollars more a year in 
funds for community projects 
the intipuca community in washington holds dances and barbecues 
at which donations are made for the hometown 
such contributions paved the towns streets and renovated the 
church and school current projects include construction of a 
basketball court and establishment of a rehabilitation center for 
handicapped children 
in september 1983 the town was overrun and held for a day by 
leftist guerrillas nearly 10 years of revolution have provided 
other reasons to emigrate 
domitila blancos daughter flor and her son julian left in 
the six months after the guerrilla raid the period marked a surge 
in emigration 
mrs blanco runs a dry goods store and letterforwarding service 
in intipuca she praises the us connection 
before people were so poor here they would go to the sea to

advanced jet fighters during a visit that he said reflected the 
easing of eastwest tensions

soviet defense minister to visit a nato country since the end of

capabilities by flying backward 
yazov on the second day of a fourday official visit later 
visited the british aircraft carrier hms invincible off the 
scottish coast 
at an impromptu news conference in leuchars yazov said that 
during a meeting tuesday with prime minister margaret thatcher the

william lucas gained ground today in his 
campaign for confirmation as the nations chief civil rights 
enforcer winning support from sen arlen specter rpa who had 
been viewed as a key undecided vote 
i do not support william lucas because he is black but i do 
believe his background will give him special insights into the 
civil rights laws specter told the senate one day after a 
meeting with the candidate 
specter until now seen by lucas critics as perhaps the only 
judiciary committee republican who might oppose confirmation said 
he was convinced the nominee is conversant with the civil rights 
laws and would be able to draw expertise from a battery of 
attorneys available to him 
president bush is prepared to make personal telephone calls to 
drum up votes for lucas white house spokesman b jay cooper said 
today the president has not made any phone calls but he 
may if his involvement is seen as important cooper said 
the judiciary committee could vote as early as thursday on 
whether to recommend lucas confirmation to the full senate the 
panel is believed to be sharply split with a few undecided 
lawmakers holding the balance 
the issue has become a political tugofwar between the bush 
administration and a number of civil rights groups which oppose 
lucas even though he is black on grounds he lacks experience 
specter told the senate it has become a great american sport 
to use nominees as target practice in washington dc 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan declared that the 
media and the liberal establishment have stabbed bill lucas in the 
back and that frankly its a disgrace 
bill lucas is a profile in courage what we are seeing with 
the bill lucas nomination is a profile in liberal politics dole 
said 
lucas in written responses tuesday to questions from judiciary 
committee members stressed his commitment to civil rights but said 
there has not been enough time to assess recent supreme court 
rulings on the issue 
i agree with the president and the attorney general that it is 
still too early to assess the practical impact of these rulings 
lucas said 
lucas answers on tuesday followed his refusal at a committee 
hearing last week to criticize recent supreme court decisions that 
have come under fire from civil rights groups 
however lucas said i will not tolerate the misuse of any law 
or court decision to deny rights guaranteed by this nations civil 
rights laws 
lucas promise to fight misuse of court decisions came in answer 
to sen dennis deconcini dariz who is believed to be leaning in 
favor of confirmation the senator cited two recent civil rights 
decisions by the supreme court city of richmond vs ja croson 
and patterson vs mclean 
the first case overturned automatic municipal contract 
setasides for minorityowned firms without some finding of 
previous discrimination and the second forbade the use of an 1866 
civil rights law to sue over alleged racial harassment on the job 
i believe these cases have erred in upsetting the proper 
balance between private actions and government enforcement 
actions deconcini said in asking what lucas would do to enforce 
civil rights law 
the attorney general and i recognize that some people may in 
fact use the recent supreme court decisions in an attempt to 
discriminate or to challenge legitimate affirmative action and 
setaside programs lucas said 
it is my commitment to investigate and prosecute those 
individuals or entities and to prevent such efforts to roll back 
the hardearned gains of the civil rights movement he said 
lucas said he would lead the charge in obtaining appropriate 
relief for anyone who suffers discrimination as a result of the 
rulings 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio asked whether lucas believed 
affirmative action laws have aided blacks and whether he thought 
such policies could result in tokenism or reverse discrimination 
i feel a special obligation to enforce laws which have 
benefited me lucas said 
where you have a persistent pattern of discrimination i think 
that it is entirely appropriate to order that minorities be hired 
and promoted he said he added that he also approved of 
voluntary affirmative action efforts by employers to overcome a 
manifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category 
on the other hand i think there is a danger that some 
programs under the label of affirmative action can in certain 
cases be implemented in a way that amounts to improper quota 
hiring he said

chinas trade balance is good and it is able to 
pay its debts a trade official said wednesday but he acknowledged 
that crushing the prodemocracy movement may decrease foreign 
investment 
liu xiangdong told reporters said china had a trade surplus 
equivalent to 229 billion in the first half of 1989 customs 
figures issued earlier this month which cover a broader range of 
transactions showed a large deficit 
our statistics indicate that the balance of foreign trade is 
good the payment ability of chinas foreign trade is no problem 
said liu spokesman for the ministry of foreign economic relations 
and trade 
he granted that stagnant exports and rising imports could 
produce a deficit in the second half and said joint ventures for 
which contracts had not yet been signed could suffer many foreign 
businessmen fled china after the army put down the student 
demonstrations in june 
i think some foreign businessmen are worried about the 
situation so we will have to wait and see for some time liu 
said 
his comments conflicted with earlier government reports of a 
deficit trade balance and speculation about an impending shortage 
of foreign exchange that would cast doubt on chinas ability to pay 
the state statistical bureau issued customs figures earlier that 
showed a 579 billion trade deficit for the first six months up 
from 122 billion in the first half of 1988 
a report on the customs statistics by the official xinhua news 
agency quoted chinese analysts as saying the deficit could reach 
10 billion by years end 
lius statistics showed exports at 1976 billion in the first 
six month virtually unchanged from the same period last year and 
imports of 1747 billion an increase 118 percent 
unlike those from the ministry customs figures include imports 
of raw materials for processing and such some nontrade financial 
transfers 
china has borrowed 331 billion from abroad in the past 10 
years and another 121 billion has entered the country in direct 
foreign investment the government has sought in the past year to 
curb excessive borrowing 
one reason for confidence in chinas ability to repay is that 
more than 70 percent of the outstanding debt bears medium or low 
interest rates liu said he said the average annual debtservice 
rate the ratio of repayment to total export earnings remains 
below 10 percent compared with rates in other countries of 20 
percent to 25 percent the debt burden will rise substantially in 
the next few years however as loan principal comes due for 
repayment 
china has said it will apply for 500 million in new loans from 
the world bank by early next year but the climate does not seem 
receptive after the crackdown the bank postponed consideration of 
7802 million in loans for which the chinese already had applied 
the bank the main source of aid to developing countries is 
under pressure from the united states and other western nations to 
stop new loans because of chinas harsh action against dissent 
most lenders to china have frozen aid or postponed consideration 
of new loans and liu said his government was prepared to do 
without further assistance if necessary 
we would like to develop economic relations with all countries 
and utilize loans from those countries but we will not accept 
their using those loans as a condition to interfere in chinas 
internal affairs he said 
he said china is committed to an open policy on trade and the 
number of chinese companies authorized to conduct foreign trade 
will be reduced from the current 5000 to make the system more 
efficient 
businessmen in both foreign and chinese enterprises have 
complained a lot about confusion in management of foreign trade 
liu said in the future we will be very strict in approving 
those companies

governing party leaders set a midaugust deadline 
for swearing in a successor to resigning prime minister sousuke 
uno news reports said wednesday 
the deadline indicates they want to move quickly after recent 
party setbacks 
an opposition socialist official said however that his party 
will fight any attempts to convene parliament too soon to name a 
new prime minister 
the news reports based on comments by liberal democratic party 
elders and government officials said the party hopes to elect its 
next president aug 8 and have the parliament swear him in as prime 
minister before midaugust holidays 
uno who has been in office less than two months said monday he 
will resign to take responsibility for his partys heavy losses in 
sundays elections for half the seats in parliaments upper house 
unos party lost 33 seats mostly to the socialists the leading 
opposition party 
uno himself has been plagued by charges he paid geishas for sex 
it took more than a month after former prime minister noboru 
takeshita announced his resignation april 25 for the party to 
settle on uno as a replacement takeshita announced that uno would 
be his successor on may 27 and uno took office june 2 
at the time party leaders struggled to find someone untainted 
by the scandal that brought down takeshita he resigned to take 
responsibility in the face of reports the recruit co publishing 
conglomerate tried to buy influence with large political donations 
and cutrate stocks kyodo news service quoting an unidentified 
top government official said wednesday that unos successor will 
be sworn in aug 15 
however several other reports said the liberal democrats have 
decided to convene a special fiveday session of parliament on aug 
7 the masscirculation newspaper yomiuri shimbun said an election 
among party lawmakers will be held while parliament is in session 
and a new prime minister will be sworn in before the session ends 
a liberal democratic official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the partys lower house steering committee met for 
about an hour wednesday to set a date for the session but the 
official added that the matter was still being negotiated with 
opposition leaders 
a socialist party official who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said his party will fight proposals to hold the session 
soon he said it needs more time to work on a bill to abolish an 
unpopular new 3 percent sales tax he did not say exactly how long 
the tax forced through parliament last year by the liberal 
democrats was a key issue in sundays elections that deprived the 
governing party of a majority in the upper house for the first time 
in the partys 34year history by law parliament must convene 
within 30 days after an election and appoint the prime minister it 
is expected to approve the liberal democrats choice because of the 
governing partys large majority in the more powerful lower house 
the partys election management committee was to meet thursday 
to decide the method and timing of elections to name the next party 
president 
a party reform committee recommended wednesday that unos 
successor be picked by a ballot of party lawmakers instead of by 
backroom negotiations the party official said 
uno was virtually handpicked by takeshita and many people 
criticized the secretive process 
a top contender to replace uno governing party secretary 
general ryutaro hashimoto said wednesday that as the partys no 2 
executive he shares the blame for the election defeat 
we have experienced defeat for the first time and it was 
while i was in charge so i am responsible hashimoto said he 
made no reference to resigning however 
hashimoto 51 is the youngest secretary general in the partys 
history

high on a livingroom window sill in a 
secondfloor apartment sits a house plant with a mistaken identity 
a week ago anthony scilipoti 26 awoke to loud banging at his 
door about 620 am he opened the door and found three state 
police officers who asked if they could come in 
they sort of cleared their throats and said they were there 
because you have a marijuana plant growing in your window 
scilipoti recalled 
scilipoti was actually relieved at first because his wife was 
traveling and he thought when he first saw the officers that she 
had been in an accident 
at that point i started to laugh scilipoti said it was 
like a comic opera it was really silly 
i just laughed and said go in and look he said all 
three of them stood around the plant and stared at it 
as far as scilipoti can remember he bought his dwarf 
hawaiian plant in a garden or grocery store about a year ago it 
is about 18 inches tall he said and does not have serrated leaves 
like a marijuana plant 
trooper christopher reinfurt had spotted the plant as he was 
driving by one day and believed it was marijuana said sgt william 
h merritt 
chris is very experienced in this and has had a lot of prior 
experience in marijuana eradication merritt said from the 
view that they had of the plant i dont think anyone would be able 
to differentiate it 
after a threeday investigation police obtained a search 
warrant july 18 
any reasonable person would understand hopefully that we 
acted in good faith merritt said in this case it was purely 
a case of mistaken identity

hes happy young people are joining the 60s nostalgia crowd at the 
groups concerts but he finds the music must be tailored a bit to 
todays teens 
the songs have to be shorter to appeal to 1980s audiences lodge 
said as the band prepared for a weekend concert 
you have to have a lot more instat music today lodge said 
perhaps people dont want to find out for themselves what a song 
means 
of the babyboomers he said older audiences are nostalgic so 
you dont know if theyre listening and thinking of what the song 
means to them and their memories or if they are listening to

authorities have arrested two thai 
fishermen who confessed to robbing a group of vietnamese boat 
people and raping the women aboard a police officer said wednesday 
the vietnamese boat apparantly heading from vietnam to 
indonesia was attacked june 7 in the gulf of thailand said lt 
col prakob benjapong of the thai maritime police he said 32 of 35 
people aboard are still missing 
fishermen sompong nakmas 33 and thanom pathumsuwan 19 were 
arrested tuesday after confessing to the attack prakob said 
attacks on boat people who sometimes flee with gold or other 
valuables have become increasingly violent in the past year and 
have left scores if not hundreds dead 
western officials believe most attacks are carried out by 
pirates of opportunity fishermen who chance upon the 
vietnamese boats 
the two latest fishermen under arrest were identified by three 
vietnamese women who are the only known survivors of the attack 
prakob said the women came ashore in the southern thai province of 
pattani on june 25 he said 
they told authorities the two fishermen had threatened the men 
in the vietnamese boat with knives and iron bars before taking 11 
women aboard their own boat the women said the men raped them 
while keeping them prisoner prakob reported 
the fishermen later freed three women but the whereabouts of 
the eight others and the 24 vietnamese men are unknown he said 
prakob said the fishermen told him they allowed the men to go 
free with their boat and later let the eight other women swim 
ashore 
the police officer said authorities are seeking up to nine other 
fishermen in the attack 
it was the fifth time since june 22 that police have arrested 
thai fishermen for pirate attacks involving murder rape or robbery 
of vietnamese boat people he said 
last month police said four other thai fishermen were arrested 
and confessed to killing 130 vietnamese refugees april 16 off the

the foreign ministers of belgium and zaire 
signed an agreement wednesday to normalize relations and forget a 
bitter 18month dispute over the central african nations debt to 
its former colonizer 
as part of the agreement belgium canceled about 285 million in 
debts owed by zaire delegation sources said 
it also agreed to a 14year period during which interest 
payments on 370 million in outstanding zairean commercial debts 
will be made to a fund for development projects in zaire 
the agreement was reached late tuesday between prime minister 
wilfried martens of belgium and president mobutu sese seko of 
zaire who attended the signing ceremony at the royal palace 
they applauded as zairean foreign minister nguza karlibond and 
his belgian counterpart mark eyskens signed the accord 
the signing ceremony originally was scheduled for tuesday but 
was postponed following lastminute difficulties over details of 
the accord 
officials said the main obstacle was belgian insistence on 
mentioning the international monetary fund as the umbrella 
organization for carrying out the agreement 
the zaire delegation refused to accept reference to the fund on 
grounds the agreement was strictly a bilateral matter between 
zaire and belgium delegation sources reported 
the two delegations met tuesday night at a dinner put on by 
moroccos king hassan ii who helped resolve the dispute 
a communique issued after the signing ceremony said the two 
governments had put an end to the crisis in their relations 
and removed all obstacles to their continued good relations on the 
basis of legality 
the communique said both governments expressed their gratitude 
to the king for his invaluable aid 
belgium and zaire which used to be the belgian congo have been 
at odds since december 1987 when mobutu rejected brussels offers 
to ease the debt burden and denounced the treaty of friendship 
between the two countries

york county officials say they will provide 
security assistance for presidential visits to kennebunkport 
following the towns decision that police protection cost too much 
this commission was most concerned and distressed by the 
decision of kennebunkport municipal officials to discontinue 
providing security assistance for visits by george bush to his 
coastal vacation home the three county commissioners wrote 
the commissioners told secret service director john simpson that 
we have directed the york county sheriffs department to provide 
continuing security services as may be necessary and requested 
last week in the most difficult letter i have ever written 
kennebunkport town manager jane duncan informed the white house 
that town police would no longer be available for traffic control 
and similar duties assisting the secret service and state police 
this difficult decision was made solely on the basis of our 
budgetary limitations she said officials had said the special 
security details were costing about 1500 a day 
the county commissioners voted unanimously monday to pick up the 
local duties their letter to simpson was mailed tuesday said 
county administrator david adjutant 
while we too as elected and responsible officials have 
financial concerns we are committed that the security of the most 
powerful man in the world be given priority over monetary issues 
the commissioners wrote 
the commissioners also told simpson the county would be most 
appreciative of any reimbursement 
adjutant said the county had already spent 4800 as part of its 
participation in cooperative policing efforts for presidential 
visits he declined to project how much more the county might have 
to spend 
the president was last in kennebunkport for an extended fourth 
of july weekend he plans a threeweek visit next month

the european community said wednesday 
that president bushs decision to extend us steel import quotas 
was unnecessary because the american industry has made an 
impressive comeback 
bush said he took the measure announced tuesday to try to 
press negotiations to end other countries unfair trade practices 
and give the us industry more time to modernize 
but the european community west europes 12nation trading 
bloc complained about the decision 
after an uninterrupted period of protection a renewal of 
these accords in the steel sector is not necessary considering the 
remarkable progress registered by american steel it said 
the industry has improved both financially and competitively in 
recent years and the world outlook for steel has brightened it 
said 
in a response to the criticism thomas niles the us 
ambassador to the european community said the us action was 
designed to give more time to come up with a trading system based 
on freer markets 
we should try to turn steel trade into a marketdriven 
operation rather than one that is driven largely by government 
subsidies and interventions by governments in the market he said 
he predicted european officials will take a closer look at the 
program and will see it as in their interest to join with us in 
this effort to move toward a marketbased system 
the community also complained that the quotas have limited 
european steelmakers more than other foreign producers in gaining 
access to the us market 
the european blocs share of the american steel market tumbled 
from 8 percent before the quotas to 56 percent afterward 
according to its figures 
the trading bloc exported 59 million metric tons of steel 
products to the united states in 1988 a metric ton is equivalent 
to 2205 pounds or 11 short tons 
the quotas were first imposed by the reagan administration in 
1984 they were due to expire sept 30 
they set annual limits on the amount of steel that could be 
brought into the united states from 29 countries including those 
of the european community japan south korea and brazil 
the quotas were imposed at a time when the us industry was 
suffering heavy losses steel manufacturers complained foreign 
producers had an unfair advantage because of government subsidies 
and import restrictions 
american steelmakers acknowledge the us import quotas have 
helped their giant industry become profitable again but they argue 
they still need time to modernize their operations without 
competition from subsidized foreign products 
in his announcement bush said he had asked us trade 
representative carla hills to negotiate a 30month extension of 
voluntary restraint agreements that limit the 29 countries to 184 
percent of the us market the european communitys share of the 
total quota is 27 percent 
bushs quota extension will allow the overall foreign market 
share to rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are 
phased out entirely hills said that yearly increase would be 
allocated to countries that exhibit the most willingness to stop 
subsidizing their domestic industry 
bush said the restrictions will end on march 31 1992

behind the political trauma of this weeks cabinet 
shuffle by prime minister margaret thatcher lies a houseswapping 
drama on a grand scale 
bumped from his post as foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
lost both his magnificent london residence and his weekend retreat 
a 115room country mansion 
fit for a king indeed once owned by prince charles the 8 
million chevening house its gardens maze and 3500 acres now make 
up the country retreat of the new foreign secretary john major 
but howe a seasoned international negotiator bargained with 
mrs thatcher to soften the blow and came away with a consolation 
prize the country house allocated to the treasury chief 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
howe emerged from the sweeping shakeup of the 22member cabinet 
as deputy prime minister a post widely seen as a demotion and 
carrying no official accommodation 
lawson yielded the country home dorneywood apparently 
reluctantly after reportedly hearing of the decision when howe 
mentioned it on a morning radio program 
he is staying with this wife and two children for a summer 
holiday at the 65 million redbrick residence northwest of london 
where the amenities include a heated pool squash courts and 
billiard rooms 
opposition labor party lawmakers were also not amused calling 
the mansionswapping exercise an embarrassment 
with millions of homeless without money sleeping in cardboard 
boxes to witness cabinet ministers squabbling over the possession 
of luxury homes is disgraceful said max madden 
it was not clear as the dust settled where lawson would spend 
his weekends although he retains his no 11 downing street home 
next door to mrs thatcher at no 10 he also personally owns a 
400000 former vicarage in leicestershire central england 
howe who flew to france on vacation is houseless for the 
summer he has only a small apartment in a lessthantrendy area 
major who grew up in a tworoom apartment also receives howes 
london house on historic carlton house terrace 
sir roy strong a trustee of chevening and former director of 
the victoria and albert museum said both howe and his wife 
elspeth were sure to miss the mansion designed by the 17th 
century master architect inigo jones 
he described the house as a country house of the greatest 
comfort luxury and elegance 
flanked by two wings and fronted by a palladian facade the 
house in southeastern england was left to britain 20 years ago by a 
great landed family the stanhopes it was originally to have been 
prince charles but the heir to the throne gave it back to the 
state in 1980 
the howes used it a great deal strong told bbc radio 
they did a lot of entertaining at the weekend they held family 
christmases there im sure theyre absolutely desolated that 
theyre going 
strong said howe used a tapestry room filled with lacquer 
furniture as his study and his desk overlooked a lake

a leading black magazine says the former 
white rhodesian government secretly burned the bodies of black 
nationalist guerrillas in an incinerator that it likened to the 
ovens of nazi germany 
the august issue of the independent parade magazine said the 
incinerator is hidden in thickly wooded grounds at chikurubi 
maximumsecurity prison near harare where scores of guerrillas 
were executed 
it said the nowidle incinerator was used to dispose of bodies 
of an unspecified number of guerrillas executed during the 
sevenyear war that forced independence and brought the black 
majorityruled nation of zimbabwe into existence in april 1980 
former rhodesian prime minister ian smith the last white ruler 
of this exbritish colony denied there were covert executions and 
said his government burned only papers in incinerators 
the magazine which claims a readership of more than 1 million 
in this southern african nation of 9 million people said the 
incinerator was rhodesias equivalent to the ovens the nazis used 
in world war ii 
parade described the incinerator as the size of a small house 
with a 10yard chimney extending through the roof according to a 
stamp embossed into its heavy iron casing the incinerator was 
called macroburn by its makers in johannesburg the magazine 
said 
it must be one of the most efficient crematoriums in southern 
africa said political affairs minister eddison zvobgo who is 
campaigning for it to be declared a national memorial 
we think the incinerator should become a national monument 
like those in germany today he said 
the incinerator is equipped with fanassisted oilfired burners 
and at one end features a highwalled sluice yard where 
truckloads of corpses allegedly were dumped said zvobgo who was 
zimbabwes first justice minister 
he said that in 1980 president robert mugabes new government 
found no accurate records of guerrilla executions and believes most 
were destroyed by outgoing rhodesian authorities 
between 1976 and 1979 zvobgo said an unknown number of 
guerrillas were tried summarily by military courts and were 
executed with no legal recourse to appeal the death sentence 
the war had reached a stage when the level of killings made it 
impractical to bury or keep records of the dead zvogbo charged 
about 30000 zimbabweans mostly black civilians died in the 
war 
smith told a news conference that guerrillas were tried and 
executed under antiterrorism laws 
the retired politician who ruled from 1965 until independence 
said he believes the report was timed to distract attention from 
the governments political woes 
it is the latest in a series of attacks against the nations 
remaining 100000 whites he charged 
i do recall we had incinerators for burning papers and i 
believe we had a big clean up of a mountain of papers which 
required burning when the change of government took place said 
smith 
recently the government has been criticized for corruption and 
policies that have led to record unemployment commodity shortages 
and rising inflation

its like a world series of weeds a hula 
bowl of herbicides with agriculture students from us and 
canadian universities competing to identify problems in farm fields 
this year iowa state took top honors in the collegiate weed 
science contest which tests students ability to identify weeds 
and the right chemical to kill them and diagnose herbicide failure 
they need to be able to recognize weeds when they are tiny 
said james worthington of western kentucky university president of 
the north central weed science society when they get big enough 
that anybody can recognize them its too late to do anything about 
them 
the society sponsored its ninth annual competition for 64 
students tuesday at the fmc corp research farm in champaign county 
students twisted yellow nozzles onto a portable chemical rig 
calibrated an application rate and sprayed liquids into measuring 
beakers judges timed their work and evaluated their decisions 
students scattered into a field where 96 plastic rings circled 
patches of weeds some so tiny they were almost invisible brian 
otteson of north dakota state occasionally used a magnifying glass 
to detect tiny clues to their identity 
it is really good experience identifying all these weeds so 
you know what to expect across the country he said also you 
are able to recognize the chemicalinjury symptoms on the plants 
plots of crops and weeds were sprayed with various herbicides 
and contestants were asked to identify the chemicals based on the 
plants response 
finally students went into a small field and were confronted by 
a contest official playing the role of an upset farmer in one 
case a herbicide had allowed weeds to thrive in another a 
chemical had damaged the cash crop 
on the goof plot you have to be decisive and defend your 
diagnosis said nebraska coach dave mortensen who thought that 
might be the toughest task for students it can be very 
intimidating they need to learn to be confident and assertive 
a grumpy cigarchomping david lamore met kirk reese of ohio 
state in a sunflower field 
i used almost 35 pounds of the stuff and it should have 
controlled the crab grass said lamore 
reese taking the role of a chemical company representative 
said the herbicide killed most of the weeds it was designed for 
suggesting it be applied at a higher dosage in future 
joel rissman a university of illinois senior who plans to farm 
said the contest provided valuable experience 
i am worried about the overuse and the misuse of chemicals 
rissman said you have to learn to use the right chemical for the 
job and use it at the right rate

baron enrique crespo the new 
president of the european parliament called wednesday for more 
power for the 518seat assembly 
if we aspire toward a united europe someone must administer 
this union and someone must monitor those who administer the 
union he said 
he acknowledged that national governments of the 12 european 
economic community member states view the demands for greater power 
with suspicion and distrust but he said national parliaments 
of the eec nations must see us as partners in the democratic 
monitoring of institutions 
the european parliament the only one of the eecs institutions 
to be democratically elected is frequently dismissed as no more 
than a debating chamber 
specifically addressing this point the 45year old spanish 
lawyer said the parliament should make its debates more serious 
and to the point always and in all circumstances 
he was alluding to the bodys propensity to adopt resolutions 
and reports on human rights abuses or natural catastrophes on the 
other side of the globe 
crespo said the parliaments prime concern must be the 
immediate problems which directly affect european citizens 
for the time being it can amend or reject the eecs budget 
which only becomes operational once the parliaments president has 
signed it 
it also can dismiss all 17 members of the eecs executive 
commission which drafts community laws and can prevent or delay 
legislation from going into force by sending drafts back to the 
commission 
the parliament must also be consulted on certain measures aimed 
at creating a single market by the end of 1992 
it can veto or delay some eec treaties with other countries and 
new applications for common market membership must gain at least 
260 votes in the parliament to be accepted 
however the parliament cannot initiate legislation and in 
economic and monetary affairs its opinion does not have to be taken 
into account a situation crespon criticized 
we are entitled to demand parliaments full participation in 
the work of the intergovernmental conference on economic and 
monetary union he said referring to a plan to create full 
monetary union among the 12 member states 
parliament should also be involved in the drawing up of the 
new texts which are to regulate community economic and monetary 
union in the future he said 
also on wednesday british legislator john tomlinson accused the 
french government of bribery in giving each parliamentarian an 
expensive leatherbound personal organizer a color tv set a fax 
machine and a paging system 
france belgium and luxembourg have been fighting for years over 
where the parliament should be located 
it now holds its monthly weeklong plenary sessions in 
strasbourg has its committee meetings a fivehour train ride away 
in brussels belgium and has its administrative headquarters in 
luxembourg midway between the two 
in my vocabulary there is only one word for this bribery 
said tomlinson a socialist implying the gifts were an attempt to 
swing sentiment in favor of the strasbourg location 
he introduced a motion calling on the eec governments to fix a 
permanent brussels base for the assembly

ponies werent the only ones to get wet 
at the 64th annual wild pony swim wednesday 
some people in a crowd of about 30000 waited more than five 
hours in rain mud and swarms of mosquitoes to get the best view of 
the ponies being herded across the channel from assateague island 
to chincoteague on virginias eastern shore 
lonnie poling of san antonio texas got to the marshy shore 
about 5 am 
just in time for the thunder and lightning and rain he said 
as he pressed against a fence 
the polings and others stood through the brief downpour and 
stayed put as the mosquitoes came out and temperatures headed into 
the 80s 
finally low tide arrived and at about 1015 am the ponies 
made the 10minute swim tourists applauded and snapped pictures of 
the animals heads bobbing above the water 
the ponies seemed oblivious to the excitement as they calmly 
walked ashore and munched on marsh grass before they were herded 
through the streets to the towns carnival grounds to be auctioned 
off 
members of the chincoteague volunteer fire department hope to 
sell 30 to 50 of the ponies thursday to thin the herd and raise 
money for the animals upkeep during the winter 
the roundup made famous in misty of chincoteague and other 
childrens books by marguerite henry began in 1925 to finance the 
volunteer fire department 
firefighters now use the money to support the herd of ponies on 
assateague located just off the atlantic ocean side of the 
peninsula that forms chesapeake bay 
no one is sure how the ponies got to assateague the most 
commonly accepted theory is that they are descendants of horses 
hidden on the island by early settlers who wanted to avoid paying 
taxes on the animals 
a more romantic story holds that the ponies escaped from a 
spanish galleon that was wrecked off the coast more than 300 years 
ago 
the auction usually raises 12000 to 18000 said everett 
lewis who was president of the fire department last year 
they never do pay for themselves it costs us more to keep 
them he said 
he said the firefighters will make up the difference with money 
raised at their twoweek carnival that ends saturday 
barbara andrews of rochester nh won a raffle for the first 
young pony that emerged from the channel wednesday but she asked 
that the animal be returned to its island home 
he belongs here she said momentarily forgetting she had 
won a female pony we dont want him to be separated 
tim huddleston of cookeville tenn said he came to show the 
ponies to his horseloving children tiffany 9 and chad 6 
they read the books and came in town and saw the movie and 
been over here since 5 oclock this morning he said

a senate panel on wednesday approved 
legislation to limit civil contemptofcourt jailings in the 
district of columbia but one senator said he may try to make the 
bill apply only to the woman whose case prompted it 
the governmental affairs committee voted 130 to set a 12month 
cap on civil contemptofcourt jailings in child custody cases in 
the district 
however sen warren rudman rnh said he may introduce an 
amendment on the senate floor to limit the bill to the case of dr 
elizabeth morgan 
i dont want to limit the power of a judge and that is what 
this is all about rudman said this would never have come 
before the congress if dr morgan had not been in jail 
morgan a plastic surgeon was jailed in august 1987 by a local 
judge who said she would remain confined until she produced her 
daughter hilary for courtordered visits with dr eric foretich 
her exhusband and the girls father morgan has alleged that 
foretich has sexually abused the girl but he has denied it 
the child custody dispute has become a rallying point for 
womens rights groups and organizations concerned with child abuse 
who have come to morgans defense while foretich has won the 
support of various mens groups 
rudman said he was reluctant to interfere with the districts 
court system and expressed concern that capping all child custody 
contemptofcourt jailings could eventually allow persons guilty of 
child abuse to go free 
however rudman said he would drop his plans for the amendment 
if he felt it would prevent the bill from being passed before 
congress goes into recess on aug 5 
should the bill pass the senate it will have to go before a 
housesenate panel to work out differences between a version that 
passed the house last month and the more narrowly drawn senate 
measure 
the house bill would set a 12month cap on all civil contempt 
jailings but the senate version introduced by utah republican 
orrin hatch would establish the limit only for civil contempt 
child custody jailings

democrats on wednesday blocked a 
republicanproposed constitutional amendment to ban flag burning as 
they pursued passage of a regular statute they say can do the same 
thing without altering the bill of rights 
the chairman of the house judiciary committee jack brooks 
dtexas ruled out of order an attempt by rep james sensenbrenner 
rwis to bring before the committee the amendment backed by 
president bush 
supporters of the amendment contend that changing the 
constitution is the only way to overcome last months ruling by the 
supreme court that flagburning was a protected form of free 
expression 
democratic leaders including brooks and house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash are pursuing a regular statute designed to meet the 
courts objections 
their strategy is aimed at avoiding damage to constitutional 
rights and demonstrating that democrats abhor flag burning the 
symbolism of the flag was used by bush in last years presidential 
campaign against the democratic nominee massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis 
brooks scheduled another meeting of the panel for thursday to 
take action on his proposed bill to outlaw desecration of the flag 
including burning with penalties of up to a year in jail plus a 
fine the bill could come before the full house next week 
it is my firm believe that a statute punishing flag burning 
can be drafted in a way that is consistent with the supreme courts 
decision said brooks a statute could be approved much more 
quickly than an amendment which requires ratification by the 
states he said 
however sensenbrenner pointed out that even some opponents of 
amending the constitution dont believe a regular statute can undo 
what the court decided 
this is nonsense and a ridiculous way to solve the problem 
and a copout on our legislative responsibilities he said the 
issue wont go away he said and blocking the constitutitonal 
amendment is going to come back soon enough to haunt those who 
made the decision 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the committees 
constitutional rights subcommittee said he was convinced from mail 
he was receiving that the public was becoming less enthralled with 
the idea of a constitutional amendment 
i believe we must act in the way that causes least violence to 
the first amendment least damage to the bill of rights that for 
200 years has made us the envy of the world he said 
the assertion by democratic leaders that public support for an 
amendment was beginning to lag in recent days was challenged as 
selfdeception on wednesday in the senate by minority leader 
bob dole rkan 
the simple truth is that the vast majority of the american 
people want a constitutional amendment dole said citing 400 
letters and petition he has received on the issue 
the senate has scheduled action in october on both a statute and 
a constitutional amendment on flag burning

the plo is ready to accept israels plan for 
elections in the occupied lands if the government agrees to certain 
conditions including the principle of trading land for peace 
legislators said today 
the new plo position is a considerable softening of the 
organizations earlier policy of rejecting the peace plan unless 
israel first withdraws its forces from the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
lawmaker avraham burg of the leftleaning labor party said 
israel learned of the plos latest views from a us government 
document outlining the organizations reaction to prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs election plan 
the document was relayed to israel by soviet envoy gennady 
terrasov who met an aide to vice premier shimon peres this week in 
paris said an israeli official who insisted on anonymity 
in washington margaret tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman denied there is such a document but she said 
obviously we have been working with all sides to support the 
election concept and to initiate a dialogue between israelis and 
palestinians we are pressing for movement in this regard 
another labor legislator aryeh eliav said the plos positions 
were also relayed by two aides to plo chief yasser arafat during a 
conference in vienna this month 
at this conference i definitely heard from the plo 
representatives that they are ready for elections if israel will 
say in one way or the other that at the end of the process israel 
is ready to trade territories for peace eliav told the 
associated press they said this very clearly 
the plo demands also include allowing arab residents in 
israeliannexed east jerusalem to vote in the elections 
ms tutwiler said the plo has told us privately as it has 
said publicly that it supports the election concept as part of a 
comprehensive peace plan however the plo has put a number of 
conditions on its support for elections which would prejudge the 
outcome of a negotiated solution 
she said the conditions include an independent palestinian state 
as a guaranteed outcome and that such conditions are not 
acceptable to us this is a key issue which we continue to discuss 
in our dialogue with the plo 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes the landforpeace 
formula and allowing arabs in east jerusalem to vote the 
leftleaning labor party accepts those conditions 
israels peace initiative calls for electing palestinians in the 
occupied territories to negotiate with israel on an interim 
selfrule plan with talks to be held later on the final status of 
the territories 
on tuesday a proplo palestinian lawyer jamil tarifi said he 
had met with shamir to discuss the plan shamir has denied meeting 
with proplo palestinians 
leftist legislator yossi sarid said tarifi was a plo member 
tarifi refused to say if he was a plo member 
tarifi said he told shamir to deal with the plo 
the plo will accept it the plan or it will not be 
acceptable to the palestinian people he said he told shamir 
shamir maintains the government has no contacts with the plo 
but a leading labor party official said today israel already was 
negotiating indirectly with it 
the fact that there are negotiations on this subject with the 
plo is clear and it has one aim to get a green light from the plo 
for elections in the territories yossi beilin an aide to labor 
party leader shimon peres said on israel army radio 
he said the contacts were through the united states egypt and 
romania 
according to israeli sources the plo already has proposed 
forming a delegation of 10 residents from the territories and two 
palestinianamericans to meet with israeli officials to discuss the 
elections proposal 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the team 
would eventually emerge as candidates in the elections and be 
assured victory because of plo backing 
according to the sources and newspaper reports other conditions 
set by the plo included 
army withdrawal to predetermined positions on election day 
allowing international observers to watch the voting the 
jerusalem post said a new element was plo agreement to an 
egyptianamerican coordinating team fulfilling this role 
instead of un supervision 
israeli assurance that palestinian candidates would have 
freedom of speech and immunity from prosecution 
acceptance by israel of un security council resolutions 242 
and 338 which call on israel to give up occupied land and 
israels recognition of the political rights of the palestinian 
people

tired and buffeted by 
strong winds paraplegic mountain climber mark wellman was on the 
verge today of conquering el capitan 
wellman and his climbing partner mike corbett began their 
final ascent at 730 am after spending the night tied into 
sleeping bags on chickenhead ledge about 300 from the summit of the 
sheer granite mountain 
by 930 am the two had scaled 125 feet said park spokeswoman 
lisa dapprich wellman whose legs are paralyzed and his longtime 
friend corbett expected to pull themselves over the top by 
midafternoon today the eighth day of their climb said dapprich 
in radio conversation with the men this morning dapprich said 
wellman remarked were looking forward to getting on top and 
getting a hot meal 
dapprich said she asked the climbers tuesday how they were 
feeling and wellman said were feeling ok just tired and sore 
wellman who pulled himself up six inches at a time on ropes 
placed by corbett tried to become the first paraplegic to make the 
climb 
the biggest problem the climbers faced was the wind which they 
noted had been gusting from 11 am to 8 pm every day sometimes 
blowing them 10 feet out from the cliff face 
after five or six days you get summit fever all you can 
think of is the top said corbett in a radio conversation with a 
park ranger tuesday i think when we get to the top it will feel 
like i received a gold medal 
wellman said his powerful hands were swollen but that he was not 
injured during his quest he estimated it would take 7000 pullups 
to reach the summit 
wellman was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 
feet during a climb of the 13700foot gables peak south of 
yosemite in 1982 he was in the hospital for seven months but has 
since been active staying in shape with sports such as kayaking 
and directing the parks program for disabled visitors 
corbett had a record 41 ascents of el capitan before the climb 
with wellman a world record for climbing the 3200foot face of 
the rock outcropping 
he said he was unable to go to sleep monday night after hearing 
that members of his estranged family in houston would arrive in 
yosemite sometime this weekend 
the family heard about the climb and recognized corbett who 
last talked to them in 1981 his younger brother said in a 
television interview tuesday that he considers his brother a 
hero 
i named both of my sons after him that should give an idea 
of how i feel about him tony corbett of houston told nbc news 
corbett told his girlfriend that he left his family in houston 
after a really traumatic divorce by his parents

the military has sharply cut drug use in its 
own ranks and made significant progress in aiding drug interdiction 
efforts in the united states a pentagon official said wednesday 
assistant defense secretary stephen m duncan said drug use 
among us military personnel has dropped from 27 percent in 1980 
to 48 percent last year largely due to drug testing 
duncan the departments coordinator for drug enforcement policy 
and support also said the pentagon is helping national guard units 
across the country to detect and monitor drug activities and using 
its own resources for domestic interdiction efforts 
but duncan skirted questions at a news conference about the 
militarys possible future role in fighting cocaine at its south 
american origins 
weve had no guidance from the president yet duncan said 
when pressed he added were not going to do anything without 
the knowledge and support of the host government 
a national security council report on drugs reportedly 
recommends an increased role for the us armed forces in drug 
interdiction in south america 
president bush in preelection speeches pledged to fight 
domestic cocaine use by taking action in peru and bolivia where 
the majority of the worlds coca grows in the andes mountains 
but perus maoist guerrillas presented a security threat to 
american workers the state department said and the programs have 
been all but stopped since february the tough coca plants continue 
to produce four harvests a year most of which ends up as processed 
cocaine on us streets 
an administration source recently described direct us military 
involvement in drug interdiction in south america as effectively 
a dead issue because none of the drugproducing nations would 
invite american troops 
a comprehensive plan expected to include the militarys overall 
role in fighting drugs is due in september from the office of drug 
policy coordinator william bennett 
under a recent law the defense department is the lead agency 
for detecting and monitoring all air and sea drug activities the 
actual interdiction is done by other agencies primarily the 
customs service and the coast guard 
duncan noted the pentagons assistance to the national guard for 
drug interdiction saying 52 plans submitted by the governors of 
states and territories had received approval for part of a 40 
million parcel earmarked for such programs 
the guardsmen have been working mostly along the southern border 
with civilian law enforcement agencies to detect and monitor drug 
smugglers but states from maine to missouri as well as puerto rico 
and the virgin islands have set up acceptable drug programs 
this is the first time the guard has been used in this way 
duncan said 
duncan also said the armed forces supplied 28000 flight hours 
2000 ship days and 300 million in equipment loans for its new 
role in drug interdiction 
i believe weve made significant progress he said i 
think the american people need to understand while theres a lot 
we can do were not a law enforcement agency 
the general accounting office in june issued a report 
criticizing the pentagons air effort with its harshest comments 
about the aerostat ballons intended to detect incoming planes the 
report said the ballons have trouble distinguishing the low 
slowflying planes used by drug traffickers from surface 
clutter 
duncan said the pentagon would ask congress to increase its drug 
budget from 308 million to 3176 million for drug interdiction 
assistance and from 112 million to 1175 million for demand 
reduction

the house voted today to slow the costly 
stealth bomber program but refused to scrap the radarevading 
warplane altogether 
choosing between competing amendments lawmakers adopted 
257160 a measure by reps les aspin dwis and mike synar 
dokla that would limits the administration to fund production of 
only two bombers in 1990 and 1991 the pentagon had sought eight 
bombers 
the amendment to a defense authorization bill would meet the 
full request for research and development work over that period but 
imposes a coldturkey fence of the procurement money until 
congress acts again said aspin chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
essentially the amendment puts off for a full year a final 
decision on whether to fully fund the program until more evidence 
is in on the effectiveness and cost of the bomber 
the senate voted 981 tuesday to back the 530 million b2 
stealth bomber if it meets flight test and radarevasion standards 
and trimmed president bushs 21 billion stealth request by a 
relatively modest 300 million 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said bush was pleased with 
that action but would continue to push for full funding of the 
plane in the final version of the defense bill that congress 
produces 
present plans call for production of 132 stealth bombers the 
estimated 70 billion price tag of the program became the focal 
point of the debate 
theres no way no chance to go ahead with the program the way 
its laid out aspin told the house this amendment tells the 
air force go back restructure the program and come up with a 
cheaper program with less than 132 aircraft it gives us a chance 
to test this plane enough to know whether we want to go to full 
production 
a total of 208 democrats and 49 republicans voted for the 
amendment while 38 democrats and 122 republicans voted against it 
before that vote the house rejected amendments that would have 
the effect of either scrapping or backing the stealth program 
it defeated 244176 an amendment by rep ike skelton dmo 
which endorsed the program adopted an 800 million cut approved by 
the house armed services committee and imposed flighttesting and 
radarevasion standards and restrictions 
on a 279144 roll call it defeated an amendment sponsored by 
reps ron dellums dcalif and john kasich rohio which would 
complete research and development work on the stealth program but 
stop further production 
in debate foes of the radarevading plane attacked it as an 
overly expensive and unneeded weapon whose only purpose is to 
make the rubble bounce after a nuclear exchange 
but defenders of the project said the stealth is an essential 
component of the us drive to negotiate deep cuts in soviet and 
american missiles they said the weapon system will stabilize 
eastwest tensions because unlike a missile it can be recalled 
after it is launched 
as debate opened today aspin told the house weve hardly 
tested this plane what this amendment does is say slow down the 
program do the research and development and fence the program 
he said this approach would provide time to come up with a 
program that is politically acceptable and more affordable 
rep joseph brennan dmaine contended the stealth would be 
used only after an exchange of nucleararmed missiles resulting in 
devastation in both the united states and the soviet union 
by that time the war would be lost brennan said a 
mission to make the rubble bounce does not justify this spending 
brennan said 
but rep duncan hunter rcalif said the purpose of a 
secondstrike radarpenetrating secondstrike weapons such as 
stealth is to deter the soviets from launching a first strike 
the bomber gives you flexibility said rep norman dicks 
dwash you cant do it with cruise missiles because many of 
those soviet targets are mobile targets its the combination of 
a penetrating bomber and the standoff cruise missile carriers 
which makes obsolete the 400 billion soviet investment in air 
defense 
rep thomas foglietta dpa predicted cost overruns will push 
the price of the stealth from 500 million each to 1 billion each 
lets vote yes for sanity he said urging support for 
killing the program 
also pending were amendments to eliminate the mx mobile missile 
and the competing singlewarhead midgetman missile the 
administration has requested 11 billion to place mx missiles on 
railroad cars and 100 million to develop the midgetman both the 
senate and house armed services committees approved the 
administrations request 
the senate was to resume full debate on the defense bill

us economic sanctions against panama are so 
riddled with exceptions and loopholes that they have failed to put 
decisive pressure on the regime of manuel antonio noriega 
congressional critics of the policy said wednesday 
the administration opponents pointed to a study by the general 
accounting office congress investigating arm that found the 
sanctions policy poorly planned relatively unenforced and porous 
enough to let millions of dollars continue to flow to noriegas 
regime 
there can be no doubt that our policy has been 
counterproductive said rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman of 
the house foreign affairs economic policy subcommittee 
because of fear of harming us businesses still operating in 
panama the reagan and bush administrations have granted numerous 
exceptions to rules intended to bar payments to noriegas 
government he said the aim was to protect business while forcing 
the military strongman from power 
since the administration was not fully committed to either 
goal we have failed to accomplish either one gejdenson said 
we still have noriega and we have severely damaged both us and 
panamanian businesses and the economy of panama 
but republicans on the subcommittee objected saying any talk of 
ending the sanctions would only strengthen noreiga and they said 
the sanctions have had some effect denying the regime some 125 
million in revenues last year according to the gao report 
the purpose of the sanctions was never to punish us 
companies said rep robert lagomarsino rcalif exceptions 
were made to prevent undue hardship on americans living and working 
in panama 
rep dan burton rind dismissed the entire hearing as a 
bushbashing expedition by this committee 
the sanctions grew out of riots in the summer of 1987 when the 
us embassy was damaged and us military and economic aid to 
panama were suspended later panamas lucrative quota for selling 
sugar in the united states at subsidized prices was suspended and 
washington weighed in against new loans to panama by international 
development banks 
noreiga was indicted on drug charges in florida early in 1988 
and the united states recognized eric arturo delvalle as the 
countrys legitimate president and gave him control over frozen 
panamanian funds in us banks 
in june 1988 the administration sought to escalate the 
sanctions by barring payments by us firms to the noriega 
government tax and traderelated payments were to be diverted 
instead to a federal reserve bank escrow account 
but even before the regulations for the new rules were 
announced exceptions were being drafted eventually some 46 
exceptions were granted that had the effect of letting more than 
half the payments flow through to the noriega regime the gao said 
in a related matter the gao also found that a mysterious 1 
million payment was released to delvalle from a federal reserve 
bank account in new york after it was requested by elliott abrams 
then the assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
the treasurys office of foreign assets control which had 
control over the money had objected to abrams that the payment 
fell outside the scope of a budget permitting the account to be 
used to pay operating expenses for panamas us embassy and five 
consulates 
but the money was permitted to flow after abrams in effect took 
responsibility for the release of the funds assuring treasury 
cryptically that it was for appropriate official use by the 
recognized government of panama 
the gao was unable to get from abrams or the state department an 
explanation of the purpose of the money said frank c conahan 
assistant comptroller general for national security and 
international affairs

flour salt cheese and other staples are 
in such short supply that one newspaper printed a woeful shopping 
map of poland and another listed the difficulties under the 
headline city on vacation people remain 
lines are longer and supplies even shorter because of the stores 
closed for lack of staff due in part to long summer vacations 
many polish workers are entitled to six weeks and in part to 
employees simply giving up their jobs because the pay is so low 
residents of one warsaw neighborhood were told to pick up their 
own mail at the post office for several days because there werent 
enough mail carriers 
the shortages have grown worse this summer as polands economic 
turmoil continues inflation soars and a price freeze for some 
products empties the shelves in anticipation of more expensive 
goods while lowering production 
supplies of fruit and vegetables appear plentiful at warsaw 
stands but prices are high since most come from private farmers 
rather than stateregulated enterprises 
the deteriorating market situation comes as the common market 
prepares for an aug 1 meeting to coordinate emergency food 
shipments to poland intended to provide the government with 
breathing room to pursue economic and political reforms 
these including shifting poland toward a marketoriented 
economy reducing the government subsidies needed to bridge the 
gulf between prices of many basic products and the cost of making 
them 
some changes are supposed to begin aug 1 when a freeze on 
wages and prices is to be lifted as well as a possible 
elimination of meat rationing expected to lead to enormous demand 
and much higer prices 
under the headline where there is none an economic map of 
poland the opposition daily gazeta wyborcza plotted the course 
of shortages 
in industrial southwestern poland according to the map there 
is no meat sugar salt oil vinegar or cotton wool in the 
northeastern vacation area there is no sugar tea or cheese 
in the northwest there is sugar the map proclaims 
around the port city of gdansk nie ma nic theres 
nothing 
the official warsaw daily zycie warszawa offered wednesdays 
readers a frontpage litany of closed stores shortages and long 
lines waiting hours for possible meat deliveries 
in one neighborhood four out of five groceries were closed due 
to shortages lack of staff or water pipe repairs and the open 
one had little to sell 
there were 120 people on line for meat at one market 60 in the 
regular line and an equal number in the privileged queue for 
the elderly pregnant women and others with special needs 
we know about the difficulties with supply and we know about 
shortages although we dont understand them especially if they 
concern sugar flour not to mention salt the newspaper said 
but we also know that we feel the horrible lack of 
organization and imagination of the people who are responsible for 
trade starting with the minister 
all of this leads us to the edge of endurance the article

commerce secretary robert mosbacher on 
wednesday defended the bush administration against congressional 
criticism that consumers could be hurt by the administrations 
efforts to modify antitrust laws 
mosbacher said the administration would very soon present 
congress with its recommendations for ways to change the antitrust 
laws to allow american companies to compete globally in the field 
of hightechnology products 
the administration is considering a major relaxation of 
antitrust laws that would allow companies to jointly produce 
hightechnology products such as highdefinition television sets 
this would expand on an action taken by congress in 1984 when it 
changed the antitrust laws to allow companies to engage in joint 
research efforts 
house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas told 
mosbacher that he had reservations about the need to further weaken 
the antitrust statutes by allowing joint production as well as 
joint research 
brooks said this was a more difficult question because it 
raises issues about concerted behavior in the marketplace not the 
laboratory 
rep lawrence j smith dfla called the proposal for an 
antitrust exemption for manufacturing a much more radical 
approach than the research exemption and he predicted that it 
would encounter substantial congressional esistance 
smith said such an approach could allow american companies to 
form giant monopolies that would boost prices to the detriment of 
consumers 
but mosbacher said these arguments missed the point that 
american companies were being forced to compete globally in the 
development of new technology with foreign businesses that faced 
for fewer antitrust restrictions 
the entire industrial world is now in competition we will 
either adjust to that reality or we will not survive as a great 
power he told the committee 
mosbacher said that the administration was still considering 
exactly what types of antitrust changes to propose to congress 
i think we will be pulling our act together very soon he 
said 
in response to a question mosbacher said he did not think it 
was proper to exclude foreignowned companies from participating in 
joint ventures in the united states 
he said any antitrust exclusions should also be applied across 
the board rather than limited to just smaller firms as some in 
congress have proposed 
mosbacher said it was crucial to americas future prosperity to 
allow more joint ventures as a way of allowing companies to spread 
the risks and costs of developing complex new technologies 
legislation aimed at reducing antitrust uncertainty could 
allow american firms to move confidently into new technological 
fields thereby enhancing us competitiveness he said 
mosbacher said the administrations proposal would not be a 
backdoor attempt to undermine the antitrust laws and the 
competitive free enterprise economy they seek to protect

the dentist who designed an experimental 
artificial heart that was used in a human without federal approval 
says hes improved his airdriven phoenix heart but needs money for 
further development and testing 
kevin cheng believes his latest versions are superior to 
anything else in use 
but he is unable to finance costly animal testing to prove his 
devices work which could bring federal approval for experimental 
use in humans or to develop a fully implantable and internally 
driven heart 
cheng said he needs at least 300000 for animal testing and may 
have to try to find foreign backers for testing overseas 
mentioning japan and the republic of china 
cheng who has sought federal and private grants without 
success says his last best hope for testing in the united states 
rests with the university of arizona in tucson but while he has 
supporters there federal support is unlikely for another 
airdriven heart pump because it involves old technology 
such devices including current jarvik hearts are powered by 
external machines that pump air through tubes that pass through the 
patients chest wall the patient is tethered and susceptible to 
infections because of the tubes 
cheng 46 achieved notoriety in march 1985 when an earlier 
phoenix heart intended for calf testing was used at university 
medical center which is affiliated with the tucson school in an 
emergency without the federal food and drug administrations 
authorization 
the phoenix heart kept a patient whose body had rejected a donor 
heart alive for 11 hours before a second transplant the man died 
of complications unrelated to the device 
dr jack g copeland the umc surgeon who arranged its use 
afterward acquired fdaapproved jarvik7s and pioneered their use 
as bridges to keep patients alive until transplants are available 
jarvik hearts which were permanently implanted in five recipients 
in the united states and sweden have since been used as transplant 
bridges about 150 times in the united states 
between 1983 and 1987 cheng implanted his devices in 10 calves 
for as long as 10 days but expenses forced their shutoff each 
polyurethane heart costs 15000 
in the meantime cheng is at a standstill with virtually no 
testing accomplished on his new designs elliptical polyurethane 
phoenix7 and 8 models 
he insists his design is superior to the jarvik hearts with 
greater blood volume per stroke and slightly smaller size 
the phoenix hearts three pumping membranes versus the jarviks 
one will effectively remove all blood from the ventricle and no 
one else has done that yet said dr willem j kolff one of the 
nations most respected artificial heart researchers 
kolff developed the first successful kidney dialysis machine and 
is chief of the university of utahs division or artificial organs 
where the jarvik heart was developed 
chengs heart is novel its promising its unusual kolff 
said i see no reason why it should not work it should be 
tested 
if the phoenix heart were available and fully tested today 
id say we could put it in instead of the jarvik in bridge 
situations said richard smith chief biomedical engineer at umc 
but he said he thought it would be more useful for cheng to work 
toward a permanent totally implantable heart with an internal 
motor 
chengs ultimate goal is a completely implantable 
electrohydraulic artificial heart using currently available 
technology to provide patient mobility and a quality of life 
lacking when tethered to an airdriven pump 
cheng who worked at the texas heart institute while in dental 
school said he wants to complete his 12yearold project which 
has cost him 200000 to save some human life

irans main radical figures urged their 
countrymen wednesday to participate in this weeks presidential 
elections even though their main rival parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani is expected to win 
their declarations suggested they want to avoid a headon 
collision with rafsanjani who has emerged as the countrys most 
popular leader 
staterun tehran radio quoted ahmad khomeini the son of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini as saying that if his father were 
alive he would have been the first to cast a vote in fridays 
elections 
god willing on july 28 the dear people of iran will throng 
to the polls with steady stride the broadcast quoted khomeini as 
saying 
in doing so they will gladden the hearts of our friends and 
send our enemies to the dust of dismay he said 
khomeinis son is considered the leader of iranian radicals his 
group has been jockeying for power with pragmatists led by 
rafsanjani since the ayatollah died june 3 
there had been speculation khomeini would declare himself a 
candidate for president against rafsanjani leading to an open 
fight for power however radicals have shown more flexibility in 
recent weeks in an apparent effort to avoid a direct challenge of 
rafsanjani 
hardline prime minister hussein musavi interviewed separately 
by the radio called for a massive turnout 
the government of the islamic republic considers voting in the 
elections as a divine and national duty and will mobilize all its 
capabilities for better holding of them he said 
polls published by some newspapers predicted rafsanjani will 
take 86 percent of the votes 
the same polls gave his only challenger abbas sheibani 11 
percent while saying 3 percent of the iranians questioned intend 
not to vote 
irans electorate was estimated at 25 million at last years 
parliamentary elections 
sheibani 58 is a frenchtrained doctor and parliament deputy 
without a national political base 
the presidential elections were originally scheduled for aug 18 
but were advanced to accelerate the transition of power after 
khomeinis death 
a national referendum will be held with the presidential voting 
on proposed constitutional amendments the changes would increase 
the presidents powers making him head of government and scrapping 
the post of prime minister 
the proposals are expected to win approval

house republican whip newt gingrich already 
awaiting a possible ethics investigation into a book promotion 
deal is facing new questions about large temporary pay raises he 
gave to aides including some who briefly resigned to become 
campaign workers 
rep john t myers rind the ranking republican on the house 
ethics committee said wednesday the panel will look into 
anything we see including the possibility of payroll 
irregularities if it approves a formal investigation of gingrich 
gingrich said temporary yearend raises are commonly used by 
house members to reward hardworking staffers and he said his 
decision to award such raises is not influenced by whether an aide 
takes time off from the staff to work in his campaign 
a spot check of gingrichs house colleagues from georgia found 
that four of nine gave aides large temporary raises last year and 
one rep john lewis of atlanta gave an aide a 27 percent pay 
increase 15 days after he returned from a twomonth campaign leave 
the disclosure of gingrichs practice first made in an atlanta 
business publication comes at an awkward time for the combative 
house gop whip who submitted the ethics complaint that led to 
former speaker jim wrights resignation 
myers said the committee could meet as early as next week and 
may be ready to decide then whether to begin a formal investigation 
of gingrich sparked by a complaint about the book deal 
if we vote for a preliminary inquiry we would look at 
everything myers said when asked if the panel would investigate 
gingrichs payroll as in the jim wright case we would look into 
anything we see 
house payroll records show that gingrich gave temporary raises 
to 15 staffers last fall including two aides who took leaves for 
campaign work he gave similar raises to 13 aides in both 1987 and 
1986 including two in 1986 who took leaves to work in his 
reelection campaign 
myers said he did know whether it was a widespread practice for 
house members to give aides who worked on their campaigns a 
temporary raise after they returned 
if true it would be troubling he said it would violate 
the spirit of the house we do not want to use government funds to 
fund our campaigns 
house personnel rules state that yearend raises should be made 
only on a permanent basis and only when the services of the 
individual warrant federal law and house rules also prohibit 
members from rewarding staff members for campaign work 
the two gingrich aides who took leaves for the 1988 campaign 
were press secretary sheila ward and executive assistant sarah 
grewe during the onemonth leaves the campaign paid ward 1612 
and grewe 1262 at the pay rates in effect when they took the 
leaves ward would have earned 1606 and grewe 1500 if they had 
stayed on the congressional payroll 
after returning to the congressional payroll in midnovember a 
temporary raise gave ward 1979 more than she would have made the 
rest of the year at her old rate grewe earned an additional 1986 
in the final quarter of the year wards total salary from both 
the campaign and the congressional office was 6804 or 1984 
more than she would have made if her october pay rate had been in 
effect the rest of the year grewes total salary for the quarter 
of 6348 also was about 41 percent or 1848 more than she 
would have earned at the october rate 
the other 13 permanent members of gingrichs congressional staff 
also received large temporary raises during the final quarter of 
1988 boosting their overall pay by amounts ranging from 9 percent 
to 449 percent or from 400 to 3392 
the salaries of all 15 staffers were reduced on jan 1 1989 
though their new levels still ranged between 4 percent and 33 
percent higher than the salaries the previous october 
during the 1986 campaign the two aides who took leaves were 
catherine brock assistant state administrator and katherine 
watson a legislative assistant during the 10week leaves the 
campaign paid brock 3588 and watson 2141 had they stayed on 
the congressional payroll at their preleave pay rate brock would 
have earned 4140 during the 10 weeks and watson would have earned 
4600 
after returning to the congressional payroll in midnovember 
temporary raises gave brock 2820 more in salary for the remainder 
of the year than she would have earned at the preleave pay rate 
and watson 2520 more 
in 1986 gingrich began dispensing the temporary raises to his 
staff in august for the rest of the year the temporary raises 
boosted the total pay of the 11 other permanent staffers by amounts 
ranging from 1280 to 5000 or from 13 percent to 67 percent

only onethird of president bushs embassy 
appointments are political a white house official said wednesday 
in response to complaints that the administration is handing out 
plum ambassadorial assignments as political payoffs 
bushs list of nominees contains the names of several people who 
gave sixfigure contributions to republicans in the last election 
but white house spokesman b jay cooper said they were chosen on 
the basis of their qualifications 
cooper said secretary of state james a baker iii is using a 
formula to ensure that 67 percent of the appointments are career 
government officers and 33 percent are political appointees 
brought in by the president 
he said there is currently a greater percentage of political 
appointees because some now serving are carryovers from the reagan 
administration when the ratio was 60 percent career officers to 40 
percent political appointees 
some bush appointments have raised a firestorm of criticism in 
senate foreign relations committee hearings to confirm the 
ambassadors 
sens paul sarbanes dmd albert gore dtenn and other 
democrats have complained that the appointees lack sufficient 
qualifications beyond their financial and political connections 
at least six of the people bush appointed to ambassadorships 
gave 100000 or more to the republican national committee their 
names are listed in the rncs socalled soft money files which 
means their donations are not subject to the 1000 limit on 
contributions to individual federal campaigns 
those six include nicolas salgo the former ambassador to 
hungary whom bush named to the rank of ambassador to negotiate 
property issues in his job as director of the state departments 
moscow embassy building control office he gave the rnc just over 
500000 last year 
the others who gave 100000 are joy silverman who has no job 
history and was named as ambassador to barbados and four other 
caribbean island nations florida real estate magnate joseph 
zappala named as ambassador to spain louisiana oil company 
executive john giffen weinmann as ambassador to finland 
mississippi developer melvin sembler as ambassador to australia 
and washington attorney joseph b gildenhorn as ambassador to 
switzerland 
zappala narrowly won confirmation on tuesday in the senate 
foreign relations committee with sarbanes vowing to continue the 
fight against him and others on the senate floor zappala reported 
to the committee that he gave 126000 to republican political 
causes last year and 17900 in the two years before that 
many other appointees named to ambassadorships or other 
highlevel administration posts were members of bushs campaign 
finance committee or gave contributions of 10000 or more to the 
rnc soft money fund 
cooper said wednesday that all will make excellent 
ambassadors and that each one was chosen on the basis of specific 
qualifications they bring to their posts

an american rabbi who was beaten by polish 
workers while protesting the presence of a convent at auschwitz 
said wednesday he will press charges against the attackers and 
police who did nothing to stop them 
rabbi avraham weiss and six us jewish students were removed 
from the camp in poland and kicked and beaten by the construction 
workers during a july 14 demonstration to protest the presence of 
the carmelite convent on the camp grounds 
the international jewish community considers christian symbols 
on the perimeter of the camp a desecration of the memory of those 
who died at the nazi concentration camp an estimated 25 million 
jews were among the 4 million people killed at auschwitz 
the convent is offensive to the jewish people it is part of 
the larger vatican attempt to christianize the holocaust weiss 
of riverdale ny said at a news conference 
weiss dismissed claims the convent was meant as a memorial to 
christians who died in the camp 
jews were murdered because they were jews christians were 
murdered because they were polish political prisoners who happened 
to be christians he said 
jewish groups are demanding the carmelite nuns respect an 
agreement to move that agreement was reached by church officials 
and representatives of international jewish organizations in 1987 
and originally called on the nuns to leave by february 
they were to move to a convent that has yet to be built 
polish news reports have said work on the new convent will begin 
next year 
weiss said he arrived in israel after meeting new york cardinal 
john oconnor who promised to write an article supporting the 
jewish cause within the next 10 days 
weiss said he will be pressing charges through the polish 
representative in israel against the polish assailants and police 
who he claimed stood by and did not intervene during the beatings 
we have hired lawyers and we are going to be asking the 
polish representative to press charges against those citizens who 
beat us we know who they are their pictures were on front pages 
of newspapers throughout the world weiss said 
he added he wanted an investigation into what role the nuns 
played in the incident after all he said these 
construction workers came from the convent 
weiss also demanded that israel take charge of auschwitz as a 
symbol of the holocaust 
unless israel is going to administer and oversee auschwitz it 
would be impossible for auschwitz to retain its unique message of 
being that place where the nazis tried to exterminate jews

the march was short the apparel was shorter 
and tempers in neighboring virginia were shortest 
it seems some enterprising washington police officers tried 
something new early tuesday to rid the downtown area of prostitutes 
by herding 24 ladies of the night across the potomac river toward 
suburban arlington 
this army more of a platoon really marched not on its 
stomach but on spiked heels not to the beat of drums but to the 
muffled rustle of vinyl hot pants and leather miniskirts 
still it was like a shot heard round the commonwealth which 
notwithstanding the welcome to virginia sign on the far side of 
the river was mightily displeased by this latest export from the 
city bearing the name of the states favorite son 
this is the fourth commodity the district of columbia 
exports to virginia snapped rep stan parris we get all the 
sludge all the garbage most of the prisoners and now their 
prostitutes 
a fellow virginia republican sen john warner took to the 
senate floor to denounce the forced march of the prostitutes as 
an indignity to the commonwealth of virginia he demanded that 
mayor marion barry discipline those involved in this incredible 
almost unbelievable episode in law enforcement 
this isnt for real is it said arlington police chief 
william k stover ive been in this business for 33 years and i 
never heard of such a thing in my life i dont know how in the 
world you get the authority to parade a lot of prostitutes in front 
of a police car thats like herding cattle i feel now like i 
ought to shore up my boundaries 
barrys office declined comment and no official of the 
washington metropolitan police accepted responsibility for the 
bizarre roundup and 1mile march it began at about 130 am 
tuesday just seven blocks from the white house and ended less 
than an hour later on the 14th street bridge the main artery 
spanning the potomac between virginia and downtown washington 
the women were gathered from sidewalks near the intersection of 
14th and l streets the hub of the redlight district and ordered 
to hoof down the left lane of 14th to the virginia border a police 
scout car with red and blue lights flashing led the assemblage 
while another brought up the rear 
they said they were taking us to virginia that we could work 
over there said a woman who identified herself only as toni 
they said wed go to jail if we stopped none of the women was 
arrested 
it was like a perverted memorial day parade said a 
dumbfounded treasury department officer who witnessed the march 
from his post at the bureau of engraving and printing 
the marchers had just started up the approach to the bridge when 
a washington post reporter and photographer happened on the scene 
according to the post two officers grabbed the photographer when 
he starting taking pictures and ordered him to stop youre going 
to ruin what were trying to do the officer was quoted as saying 
when the photographer continued taking pictures the newspaper 
said the four officers involved in the procession piled into their 
cars made uturns and drove against oneway traffic back into 
town leaving the weary women sitting on the sidewalk rubbing 
their sore feet 
the officers had declined to identify themselves and one when 
asked who was in charge replied nobodys in charge the post 
said 
three police districts intersect at 14th and l and spokesmen 
for two of them denied any involvement the commander of the other 
one deputy chief edward j spurlock promised an investigation and 
said its definitely not something i would approve it sounds 
awful bizarre to me i assure you thats not the kind of thing we 
encourage 
i hope the police department doesnt take this as a joke 
said arthur b spitzer legal director of the local american civil 
liberties union theres no law that allows police officers to 
deport people 
others werent so critical wed be thrilled if theyd drive 
them to omaha and wed contribute for gas said barbara 
rothenberg vice chairman of the neighborhoods citizens advisory 
council 
the shorter excursion apparently had little effect when the 
march ended the women shared cabs back into town and most returned 
to the same sidewalks whence they began

a village in southern sudan where 8000 
people starved to death last summer could see a repeat of the 
disaster because of insufficient food stocks for its surging 
population a relief official said wednesday 
the western official said relief donors are studying 
possibilities for sending more food to abyei the village 500 miles 
southwest of the sudanese capital khartoum 
the official who spoke in a telephone interview from khartoum 
declined to be identified by name or organization because of the 
sensitivity of the relief issue with the sudanese government 
the united nations estimates that 250000 people died as a 
result of starvation and civil war in the southern sudan during 
1988 the world body says 100000 more could die this year unless 
its huge relief operation to send 105000 tons of food into the 
south succeeds 
about 70000 tons of supplies will have been moved by the end of 
july relief officials say 
the western official said abyei received 3000 tons of food 
enough to get 26000 inhabitants and refugees through the june to 
november rainy season during that time heavy rains isolate many 
areas 
however the official said in the past few weeks up to 20000 
more refugees have arrived in abyei and the food is no longer 
enough to last them through the rainy season 
the official also said many refugees were streaming in daily to 
nearby aweil where 4000 other people starved last year however 
he had no details on food supplies there 
sudans civil war started in 1983 christians and animists are 
fighting for more autonomy from the arab moslem majority government 
in the north the rebels claim to control up to 95 percent of the 
southern countryside 
the fighting has forced up to 2 million southerners to flee 
their homes and livelihoods making them dependent on relief food 
about 23 million people live in all of sudan

un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar expressed concern wednesday about the possibility of 
thousands of people being held in angola by the southwest africa 
peoples organization 
at a news conference on the last day of a summit by the 
organization of african unity perez de cuellar also said the un 
peacekeeping force is adequate to ensure free elections scheduled 
in the former south african colony this fall 
south africa occupied the territory during world war i and began 
to administer it in 1920 under a mandate from the league of 
nations the leagues successor the united nations revoked the 
mandate in 1966 called for an end to south african rule and 
declared swapo the legitimate representative of the namibian people 
swapo still has bases in angola which borders on namibia 
although its members are being repatriated to participate in the 
preindependence election campaign scheduled to lead to 
parliamentary balloting in early november 1989 
perez de cuellar said he discussed the matter of detainees with 
swapo leader sam nujoma in zambia last week 
i think it is not only a concern of the south african 
government but the population would like to know the whereabouts 
of 2000 men perez de cuellar said 
legwaila joseph legwaila botswanas united nations ambassador 
and the secretarygenerals special representative for namibia 
noted that swapo released 201 detainees a few weeks ago and claims 
those were all it held 
he emphasized that there was no hard evidence to support claims 
of thousands more in detention but rumors are rife in 
namibia that there are still 2000 to 2500 detainees in angola

the fbi appears to be engaged in an unusually 
public waiting game with felix s bloch the diplomat suspected of 
spying illustrating the nature of espionage cases that regularly 
produce long periods where agents sweat bullets 
for five days since the first news report on the case 
photographers and reporters have camped outside blochs washington 
apartment and his daughters chappaqua ny home a caravan of 
reporters and the fbi trailed bloch and his daughter on a drive 
into new york city on tuesday 
the state department has publicly acknowledged that bloch a 
senior us diplomat was put on paid leave and his diplomatic 
passport was lifted june 22 while the fbi investigated illegal 
activities involving agents of a foreign intelligence service 
shorthand for spying since then he attended a private think 
tanks european relations seminar in washington where colleagues 
assumed he was still at work in states european bureau 
the justice department has maintained its traditional stone wall 
of silence about pending investigations and is reported to be upset 
that state said so much 
a few details of the governments evidence have leaked from 
unidentified sources there is said to be a videotape of bloch 
passing a briefcase to a soviet agent in paris and the same agent 
is said to have been monitored later giving bloch what appeared to 
be a telephone warning that he was under suspicion 
given the governments knowledge questions arise as to why 
bloch has not been arrested 
actually its not uncommon at all for considerable time to 
pass between the first fbi interview with a spying suspect and an 
eventual arrest said james nolan in an interview wednesday 
blochs first fbi interview was said to have occurred june 22 
though he was questioned earlier by state department security 
officers 
nolan who retired in 1988 from his post as ambassador in charge 
of states office of foreign missions spent 20 years catching 
spies for the fbi rising to deputy chief of the bureaus 
intelligence division 
between david barnetts confession to us and his indictment 
it was over a month and he was walking around washington free 
nolan said willam bell of hughes aircraft was walking loose for 
a couple of weeks between the time he confessed and his arrest 
in both cases we had 24hour surveillance and we were 
sweating bullets for fear of an escape nolan said 
barnett a former cia agent pleaded guilty in 1980 to selling 
secrets to the soviet kgb on three continents for 92600 bell a 
radar engineer for hughes in southern california pleaded guilty in 
1981 to selling defense secrets to a polish spy for 110000 
government counterintelligence officials explain that covert 
surveillance such as telephone taps is designed to catch spies in 
errors like a telephone warning but they say deliberately visible 
surveillance like that on bloch is designed to discourage flight 
while other agents try to assemble enough evidence for an arrest 
warrant 
some observers have suggested the unusual publicity in blochs 
case is designed to apply psychological pressure to produce a 
confession but nolan said its a lot easier to make an arrest 
outside the glare of publicity 
why were barnett bell and other spies not arrested the moment 
they confessed because ultimately a suspects attorney may well 
try to have the confession thrown out so agents must prove it is 
credible and will stand up in court 
hes told you hes an agent and hes been paid nolan said 
you have to go find a specific classified document he turned over 
and someone in the government who will testify in court that it is 
classified 
nolan said us espionage law requires proof that national 
security information was given to a foreign power with intent to 
harm the national defense 
sources say the government does not know what was in the 
briefcase bloch is said to have handed over they say if the 
material was classified it would be easy to prove intent to harm 
because bloch like all diplomats has been trained that the 
classification system is designed to protect national security 
in the case of confessions nolan added you confirm every 
part of the statement you can youve got to look for the money if 
he says he met alone with the soviets on suchandsuch a night 
youll never prove that but if he says it was in vienna and he 
stayed at a particular hotel you get the airline ticket and the 
hotel receipt 
and when theres merely a suspicious contact with a foreign 
agent but no confession youve got an even longer case said 
nolan who emphasized that he had no information about the bloch 
case itself 
most spies get paid nolan said if they dont confess 
you go through their bank accounts 
that takes an awful long time he added 
theres contradictory word from unidentified government sources 
about whether bloch has made any kind of confession 
abc news has reported that during his initial questioning by 
us authorities bloch claimed at one point that he spied because 
he fell into a soviet sex trap but the network said authorities 
discounted that because the 54yearold diplomat had not behaved 
like a blackmail victim 
other government sources also demanding anonymity have played 
down suggestions that he confessed to anything they say that he 
has a lawyer now and is refusing to cooperate with the fbi 
nevertheless austrian officials in vienna where bloch served 
as the no 2 officer in the us embassy for five years said 
tuesday they want to question a viennese prostitute they say had a 
relationship with bloch 
it could not be learned whether this was an effort to check some 
statement he made or merely a hunt for anything useful to the 
investigation

an alarming number of peregrine falcon 
eggs failed to hatch this year in southern oregon and northern 
california say scientists who fear chemical contamination is to 
blame 
falcon eggs taken from the same area last year after they failed 
to hatch found deadly chemicals including dioxin said joel 
jeep pagel a us forest service falcon specialist 
tests on eggs laid this year are incomplete but pagel said 
tuesday that he fears the chemicals are killing the embryos before 
they mature enough to hatch 
at the beginning of the year i had 28 aeries falcon nests i 
monitored pagel said from his office in happy camp calif i 
had 22 of those 28 aeries fail this year which is astronomical 
its a little above 78 percent 
pagel normally finds and bands 25 or 30 young falcons a nesting 
season this year he found only 11 this years jump in nesting 
mortality was the biggest pagel has seen since he began watching 
the birds in 1983 
damage to falcon eggs by the nowbanned pesticide ddt reduced 
the population to just two pairs in california and none in oregon 
by 1975 but since then the population has recovered to the point 
california has 85 pairs and oregon has 13 pairs 
dioxin a deadly chemical found in the vietnamera herbicide 
agent orange and used in industry has been found in peregrine 
falcon eggs from the central coast of california the past couple of 
years but pagel thought northern california and southern oregon 
birds were isolated enough to escape contamination 
so much for our little haven he said 
pagel turned over seven of the eggs that failed to hatch this 
year to wally jarman a graduate student at the university of 
california santa cruz for testing results are due in september 
last year jarmans tests on failed eggs found dioxin and 
related chemicals as well as a compound related to cancercausing 
pcbs pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls come from a fire 
retardant that used to be added to the oil in electrical 
transformers 
jarman has found the same chemicals in failed peregrine falcon 
eggs laid between 1983 and 1988 in nests in the big sur area on 
californias central coast 
in the big sur eggs he also found dde which is formed in the 
tissues of animals exposed to ddt ddt hasnt been used in this 
country since 1972 but it is extremely slow to break down in the 
environment and it lingers in the animals who consume it 
the big question was why such a pristine area would have high 
levels of pesticides pcbs and dioxins jarman said 
jarman said the poisons dont seem to be coming from any one 
source since the falcons are predators they accumulate chemicals 
consumed by their varied prey which ranges from small birds like 
the titmouse to larger ones like ducks and gulls 
brian walton coordinator of the predatory bird research group 
at the university of california santa cruz theorized that the 
aging of the birds pagel has been watching may account for their 
newfound nesting failure 
it may be that after they are five or six years old they build 
up sufficient levels of toxic chemicals that they start 
failing walton said they can breed while theyre young but 
when they get old they fail

the four democratic candidates for mayor accused 
one another of incompetence and even outright lawbreaking monday 
during their first debate 
among the sharpest barbs at the 1hour affair 
mayor edward i koch flatly accused manhattan borough president 
david dinkins of tax evasion comptroller harrison j goldin 
suggested dinkins was unfit to be mayor because of his fouryear 
tax lapse in the early 1970s 
dinkins and goldin scored corruption in city agencies 
describing kochs administration as among the most corrupt new york 
has known 
koch described goldin as the mostinvestigated comptroller in 
the citys history and declared there have been no criminal 
charges filed against him so far 
former transit chief richard ravitch once a koch adviser 
portrayed the mayor as an egotistical bully who made his aides sit 
through videos about himself we werent asked for new ideas and 
new visions ravitch said we were asked how he was doing 
that remark prompted laughter but onlookers in the 
standingroom crowd of 500 more often drew their breaths at the 
sharpness of the onslaughts the four men are vying to face a 
republican nominee who is expected to be rudolph w giuliani the 
popular former federal prosecutor 
the debate in a midtown manhattan auditorium was sponsored by 
the new york post 
much of the criticism was leveled at koch whose third term has 
been scarred by corruption scandals dinkins charged him with 
heading perhaps the most corrupt administration since jimmy 
walker the flamboyant crooked mayor from 192532 
goldin was even harsher slowly pronouncing the names of seven 
koch commissioners who lost their jobs over charges of wrongdoing 
they haul em off in manacles they throw em in jail youve 
had to dismiss them in disgrace thats a record that you cant 
laugh away it is a record of the worst corruption in a 
municipal administration in this citys history and its your 
fault 
koch defended his stewardship of the city and counterattacked 
with gusto he said investigations of goldins office had found 
incompetence the appearance of impropriety and grave concern 
about his personal integrity 
the mayor who seeks a fourth fouryear term was equally direct 
with dinkins the leader in most polls on dinkins failure to file 
tax returns for four years koch said i believe that he 
committed tax evasion 
dinkins sought to defuse the issue noting that he paid his back 
taxes with penalties and was not charged criminally no one has 
ever accused me of tax evasion tax evasion is not something of 
which i am guilty he said 
ravitch took the least confrontational tone saying dinkins was 
an honorable man goldin was a good controller and koch 
was personally honest and an effective mayor in his earlier 
years 
but ravitch who never has held elective office painted his 
three opponents as the agents of a failed city government 
the public doesnt want to see the tires on the car rotated 
they want the engine changed ravitch said he added later if 
you want more of the same elect one of these three but if you 
want change elect me 
among his proposals he said he would add 6000 police officers 
to street patrols paying the 360 million bill by eliminating 
10000 workers in other city agencies in which the mayor controls 
hiring 
goldin stressed his plan to criminalize drug use in addition to 
the crimes of drug possession and sale he also urged mandatory 
drug treatment at bootcamp style jails for criminals found to have 
used drugs 
dinkins said he would improve a variety of programs including 
education health care and drug treatment he proposed seeking 
individual and corporate donations to fund drugeducation programs 
in the schools 
koch maintained that his record including efforts he said to 
root out corruption at city agencies established him as best 
qualified if youre a candidate you talk he said if 
youre the mayor you do

british media executive robert maxwell urged 
congress on wednesday not to go to war with the european 
community over a proposal to limit how much us programming may be 
shown on european tv 
maxwell appeared before a house subcommittee that is considering 
a possible us response if the european community limits american 
programming to about 50 percent of what is shown on european tv he 
said europe is determined to limit us imports one way or the 
other 
but hollywood representatives at wednesdays hearing of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and 
finance said they could not live with a quota system that threatens 
to erode the 25 billion balance of trade surplus the us film 
and television industry has overseas 
the european community proposal is part of a plan to lower trade 
barriers between the 12 european nations in 1992 the television 
without frontiers proposal calls for a majority proportion of 
transmission time where practical to be reserved for works of 
european origin with the 12 member nations 
it would replace a patchwork of existing restrictions that range 
from tough mandatory quotas in france to none at all in denmark 
and greece 
maxwell who has extensive publishing and cable tv holdings in 
britain france and elsewhere told the subcommittee that rather 
than making saberrattling threats of trade retaliation the 
bush administration and hollywood producers should try to negotiate 
a more favorable quota system with the 12nation european community 
otherwise hollywood will face even harsher restrictions if the 
european countries are left to impose quotas individually he said 
he said the european proposal because it wasnt mandatory was 
a compromise soft quota system that was considerably less 
stringent than that being sought by france belgium and the 
netherlands britain germany italy and spain will not accept 
mandatory quotas he said 
he said he was here to open a dialogue with hollywood 
executives to try to reach an accord but but that dialogue 
cannot be no quotas 
he urged the subcommittee not to blindly support this us 
filmtv industry if it leads to war with europe 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america said he welcomed negotiations but if talks fail the 
hollywood community will ask congress to help protect a national 
asset 
when quotas come in the front door consumer choice goes out 
the back valenti said 
american shows such as dallas are very popular overseas and 
they are relatively inexpensive to buy but maxwell said just 5000 
hours out of 105000 hours of movies and tapes shown on european tv 
are produced in europe with the rest mainly coming from the united 
states 
that makes it an issue of money and jobs and preserving 
europes cultural diversity maxwell said european citizens 
will not sit in their parlors watching their culture replaced by 
images made in hollywood mexico city or tokyo 
but subcommittee chairman rep edward j markey dmass told 
maxwell there was strong bipartisan feeling in congress that the 
united states would do what it had to keep markets open overseas 
he said the proposed quoto was strongly opposed by the 
adminstration which has criticized it as violative of 
international trade agreements and aimed at reducing a 25 billion 
trade surplus in one of the very few remaining sectors where the 
united states enjoys a trade surplus

william lucas won over a key undecided 
lawmaker tuesday in his drive to become the nations chief civil 
rights enforcer putting him a step closer to gaining the blessing 
of the senate judiciary committee 
its more important to have someone who understands supreme 
court decisions from personal experience knows it so to speak in 
his gut as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the 
commas and semicolons said sen arlen specter rpa in 
endorsing lucas 
his endorsement of the embattled nominee came the day before a 
scheduled committee vote on whether to recommend the nomination 
specter said support and opposition for lucas were nearly equal 
at this precise moment 
civil rights groups contend lucas 61 a former wayne county 
mich sheriff and county executive who is black lacks the 
experience to serve as assistant attorney general for civil rights 
the nomination is on the judiciary committee agenda for 
thursday although any member of the panel could force a 
postponement and specter said a quick vote following last weeks 
hearings would be unusual 
specter had been considered the one committee republican who 
might oppose lucas his decision put the spotlight on sen howell 
heflin dala as a possible swing vote with power to send the 
nomination to the senate floor with the panels blessing 
eight votes are needed for a favorable recommendation it 
appeared that lucas could rely on all six of the committees 
republicans plus sen dennis deconcini although the arizona 
democrat has never quite finalized his support 
a number of lawmakers remained undeclared but the nominee 
appeared likely to face opposition from six other democrats on the 
committee with heflin a lingering question mark 
even if heflin voted against lucas the nomination could still 
go to the floor without a recommendation or even with an 
unfavorable one although that could make it even harder for lucas 
to win confirmation in the democraticcontrolled senate 
president bush in an interview with knightridder on tuesday 
that was released wednesday dismissed most of the arguments 
against lucas as motivated by pure politics 
i am convinced that a lot of the opposition came because he 
made the mistake of changing to the republican party bush said 
referring to lucas switch before a 1986 run for michigan governor 
i strongly support him 
the position lucas is seeking entails supervising 151 attorneys 
and a much larger support staff that is charged with enforcing the 
nations civil rights laws through the courts he would succeed 
william bradford reynolds who was at odds with civil rights groups 
throughout much of the reagan administration 
the lawyers committee for civil rights under law whose past 
presidents include attorneys general law school deans and leading 
lawyers recommended wednesday that the judiciary committee reject 
the lucas nomination 
on the basis of mr lucas lack of substantive legal 
experience and his lack of understanding of both basic civil rights 
law and civil rights decisions of the united states supreme court 
we cannot support mr lucas the group said in a letter to 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil right said his group was disappointed by specters decision 
but we remain confident that the senate will not confirm mr 
lucas 
david runkel an assistant to attorney general dick thornburgh 
said he was confident and even more confident with senator 
specters announced support that lucas will win a favorable 
recommendation were hopeful there will be a vote tomorrow 
following the appearance of lucas before the judiciary committee 
last week both biden and sen paul simon dill said they were 
disturbed by the nominees answers to questions about civil rights 
issues 
he repeatedly sidestepped invitations from the lawmakers to be 
critical of recent supreme court decisions that are under fire from 
civil rights groups 
specter scoffed at this criticism however telling reporters 
that lucas was politically bound to agree with the positions 
already expressed by bush and thornburgh 
had he deviated from what either of his bosses had said he 
could have been in a lot of hot water specter said he said 
lucas experiences as he rose from dishwasher to major public 
official would help him do the civil rights job

the food and drug administration on wednesday 
authorized wider use of an experimental drug to treat and prevent a 
respiratory disorder that is the leading cause of death and 
disability among premature infants 
respiratory distress syndrome also called hyaline membrane 
disorder afflicts as many as 50000 of the 250000 infants born 
prematurely each year in the united states 
about 5000 of them die from the condition which occurs when 
immature lungs are not yet producing an inside coating that keeps 
them from collapsing when the infant exhales the fda said a son 
born to thenpresident and mrs john f kennedy in 1963 died of the 
disorder the agency said 
the drug a synthetic surfactant is licensed by burroughs 
wellcome co of research triangle park nc 
it will be made available under an fda category used for drugs 
shown to be safe and effective for a serious or lifethreatening 
disease but not yet approved for commercial marketing 
the fda said the drug can be administered as a single dose 
immediately after birth to help prevent death in highrisk 
premature infants of 15 to 25 pounds or as two doses to treat 
infants of more than 15 pounds who have the syndrome 
the drug has been associated with an increase in episodes of 
apnea a temporary cessation of breathing that is not fatal and is 
correctable the fda said 
the agency said burroughs wellcome will make the drug available 
at no cost to us hospitals and other healthcare facilities that 
can provide stateoftheart care to highrisk mothers and infants

christian and syrian gunners unleashed 
barrages of artillery and rockets on beiruts residential districts 
wednesday killing five people and shattering a twoday lull in 
their 19weekold confrontation 
police said 20 people were also wounded in the attacks which 
began shortly after nightfall 
the thuds of exploding shells shook the city and orange flashes 
of exploding rockets illuminated the skies over beirut which was 
in total darkness because of fuel oil shortages at power plants 
ambulances their sirens wailing raced through the city streets 
and radio stations blared appeals to residents of the divided 
capital to hurry to basements and bomb shelters 
the radio stations later reported several fires burning out of 
control in beirut 
longrange artillery guns in the christian heartland blasted 
east lebanons bekaa valley targetting the syrian armys supply 
routes from damascus they also hit west beirut and hills to the 
southeast with 155mm howitzers and 130mm mortars 
the syrians blasted east beirut and dozens of villages and towns 
to the north and northeast using mortar guns and sovietdesigned 
bm21 multibarreled rocket launchers which spit out 40 projectiles 
per minute 
the sudden nighttime escalation capped daylong skirmishes with 
automatic rifles across beiruts dividing green line in which nine 
other people were wounded it shattered hopes of a temporary truce 
until a political settlement could be worked out 
the new casualties raised the toll to 458 killed and 1889 
wounded since the current round of fighting in the 14year civil 
war broke out march 8 
earlier wednesday five cargo ships carrying food supplies 
docked at ports in the besieged christian enclave north of the 
capital and reports said an undeclared truce was in force 
a police spokesman said syrian batteries fired only six 
howitzers at daybreak as two vessels sailed slowly into beirut port 
and three into jounieh 12 miles to the north 
previously hundreds of shells and rockets would rain on the 
coast when a vessel was seen syrian gunners have hit at least six 
ships since march 
the police spokesman said lebanese army gen michel aouns 
gunners retaliated with four artillery rounds at syrian batteries 
on west beirut beaches he refused to disclose the ships names 
flags or owners 
they carried canned food supplies including meat and 
vegetables the spokesman said 
he said it was very unusual of the syrians not to fire 
heavily at the ships 
aouns 20000 mainly christian soldiers and a 6000strong 
coalition of rightwing christian militias control a 28mile 
stretch of lebanons 130mile mediterranean coast 
syrian and allied moslem forces have trapped 1 million 
christians in the enclave for four months they enforced the siege 
in retaliation for a blockade aoun ordered on illegal ports run by 
moslem militias 
the prestigious daily newspaper annahar earlier reported an 
undeclared truce it said an arab league peace committee 
mediated the ceasefire after discreet contacts with aoun and 
the syrian leadership 
the combatants agreed to give the tripartite committee another 
chance to bring about a peaceful end to the conflict annahar 
said but added it is not known how long the ceasefire would 
last without an official declaration 
the committee comprising algerian president chadli bendjedid 
king fahd of saudi arabia and king hassan ii of morocco has been 
criticized severely for failing to make progress a month after it 
was formed 
kuwaits alqabas daily in a frontpage report said the 
committee has decided to freeze its activities for a short period 
of time while it considers syrias refusal to negotiate with aoun 
the key hurdle blocking the work of the threemember 
committee is the recognition of aoun as a negotiating partner 
the newspaper said 
it quoted syrian president hafez assad as saying if our 
lebanese allies accept aoun as a negotiator on behalf of the other 
party we will not accept him this is a final and irreversible 
decision 
aoun has declared a war of liberation to drive syrias 
40000 troops out of lebanon for violating their arab league 
peacekeeping mandate by siding with the moslems

the last buick shimmering in a fresh 
coat of white paint rolled out of the 41yearold general motors 
corp plant here wednesday marking the end of the line for 1300 
workers 
some workers are turning down a company buyout holding out hope 
that the plant might open again some day but most were resigned to 
the idea there would be no reprieve for the plant 
weve done a lot of deep thinking about what were going to do 
with our lives said supervisor robert biscotti there has been 
a grieving period but after a while you realize what can you 
do 
gm is closing the plant because demand for the buick century and 
oldsmobile cutlass ciera it produces isnt keeping up with the 
companys capacity to build them 
dee allen a detroitbased spokesman for the automaker said 
there is little chance the plant would be reopened 
we havent precluded the option of opening again but we have 
more than enough facilities without framingham he said 
the plant has had two other layoffs including about 1200 this 
spring and some temporary closings during the last several years 
about 500 workers are staying on temporarily to help put the plant 
in mothballs 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who worked to keep the plant 
open concedes there is little that can be done if people arent 
buying cars 
the plants manager j russell mccarthy drove the last car off 
the line and into the loading yard 
weve had good years where weve worked six days a week and 
then days where we dont work at all said roland cole a 20year 
plant veteran and united auto workers member 
its been a home to a lot of us weve been like brothers 
says joao decruz a native of portugal who plans to go on 
unemployment 
dominic miele a 28year plant veteran was less philosophical 
weve got a president who wants to give poland 100 million when 
we cant take care of our own at home 
many of the senior employees have opted for early retirement 
some have taken advantage of gm state and federally funded 
retraining programs or relocation 
others have accepted a company buyout that union officials say 
they cant discourage because the prospects for getting rehired are 
nil gm offered onetime payments of 40000 to workers with 10 or 
more years service and 65000 to those with 25 years on the job 
dukakis recalled wednesday how he met with gm president roger 
smith and other top company officials about sparing the plant after 
the company announced the closing plans in february 
all i can tell you is what he smith said to me and that was 
that they didnt invest a quarter of a billion dollars to modernize 
the plant so gm could walk away from it dukakis said 
the company plans to bring down costs by building acars like 
the cutlass ciera and century only at its plants in oklahoma city 
st therese quebec and ramos aripze mexico 
the plant framinghams largest employer last year paid 
830000 in local taxes spent 19 million on local suppliers and 
had a payroll of 59 million 
the city of 65000 is likely to suffer the blow better than many 
factory towns because of its diverse economic base which includes 
computer manufacturing stationery production and a 375room hotel

congress was told wednesday that internal 
revenue service inspectors in charge of keeping employees honest 
should be separated from the rest of the agency so they arent 
compromised by personal relationships 
while nominally independent today inspection is dependent on 
other irs functions to operate on a daily basis said frank 
rippetoe former inspector in los angeles 
this sometimes leads to attempts by irs managers to influence 
internal security activities he told the house government 
operations subcommittee on on commerce consumer and monetary 
affairs 
irs officials were to testify thursday at the hearings into 
accusations involving the agency but in testimony released in 
advance commissioner fred goldberg said steps are being taken to 
minimize employee misconduct 
irs officials have said they would not comment on specific cases 
because of privacy laws concerning tax returns 
initial witnesses on the second day of hearings were formerly 
employed at the tax agencys los angeles office where the 
subcommittees probe began 
they told of an internal investigation of the former head of the 
criminal investigative division in los angeles which they believed 
was compromised by personal relationships 
the chief of cid was ron saranow and he did not encourage 
cooperation by his agents unless it was to resolve a problem for 
him said rippetoe mr saranow and several of his managers 
cultivated a friendship with one of the inspection managers in 
la debbie jones and led his agents to believe that she could be 
approached to assist them if they had a problem with inspection 
witnesses said that in the los angeles office saranow had 
considerable control over what was said about him 
former inspector russ davis said saranow and jones were commonly 
believed to have a close personal relationship 
as a result when saranow became the subject of an internal 
probe agents were reluctant to talk because they felt everything 
they said would get back to saranow said davis 
the office in general was divided into the front office 
favorites and the lunatic fringe said chuck mccalmont 
former group manager for the cid in los angeles 
agents were reluctant to report employee conduct violations to 
the inspection service if it involved a manager or one of the front 
office favorites said mccalmont the agents also felt if the 
allegation involved a socalled lunatic fringe agent inspection 
with the backing of our front office went all out to prove the 
allegation 
though saranow who retired from the irs without being charged 
with misconduct was interviewed by subcommittee investigators he 
was not scheduled to testify at the hearings which continue 
thursday 
the investigators said tuesday that saranow would have exercised 
his rights under the fifth amendment against selfincrimination if 
he were called to the hearings 
ms jones remains in her position with internal security at the 
los angeles office she was not scheduled to testify when the 
associated press attempted to reach her by telephone at her office 
a public affairs spokeswoman for the irs said she would call back 
later 
also testifying wednesday were three irs auditors who said they 
reported suspected misconduct by an inspection manager in chicago 
and found it detrimental to their careers 
we were threatened harassed and retaliated against by top 
inspection executives said george ecola 
the witnesses said the manager they blew the whistle on was 
eventually suspended for 12 days for accepting illegal gratuities

for his lost salary he has since resigned from the irs

a former beechnut nutrition corp president 
whose conviction for intentionally distributing phony apple juice 
for babies was dismissed will be tried again in federal court a 
judge said wednesday 
the executive 55yearold niels l hoyvald was convicted in 
february 1988 in us district court in brooklyn on some 350 counts 
of willfully violating the federal food drug and cosmetic act 
he was accused of marketing as pure apple juice what was really 
sugar water containing little if any apple 
in march a threejudge panel in the 2nd us circuit of appeals 
threw out the conviction ruling that technically those violations 
were tried in the wrong jurisdiction 
the judges in a 21 decision said the prosecution failed to 
prove the case should have been heard in the district where the 
trial was held 
on wednesday us district judge thomas j platt ruled that a 
retrial on the charges that were overturned would open aug 21 
during the original trial the jury was unable to reach a 
verdict on a conspiracy charge and 18 counts of mail fraud against 
hoyvald and prosecutors said they would retry him on those charges 
in brooklyn 
the government is determined to see this case through to the 
finish said thomas h roche the lead government prosecutor 
the conduct that he engaged in is not something you just wink at 
and say goodbye 
a second beechnut official john f lavery 57 a former vice 
president for manufacturing at the beechnut plant in canajoharie 
ny was convicted with hoyvald of knowingly marketing the phony 
juice 
the appeals court also reversed some 400 counts against lavery 
but allowed conspiracy and mailfraud convictions to stand lavery 
said he would take his case to the us supreme court both men 
sentenced to a year and a day in jail are free pending appeal 
beechnut pleaded guilty in 1987 to 215 counts of shipping 
mislabeled products and paid a 2 million fine 
the fort washington pa company is the nations secondlargest 
babyfood maker after the gerber products co 
leonard borrino a beechnut spokesman said nestle stopped 
paying hoyvalds legal expenses in october and fired him in 
december 
in a similar case three men were charged tuesday in chicago 
with conspiracy for selling millions of cases of orange juice that 
allegedly were diluted with beet sugar waste water and other 
products the federal charges accuse two former owners and a top 
executive of the nowdefunct bodines inc of mislabeling juice sold 
from 1978 to 1985

two heart drugs that were dropped from a 
federal study earlier this year are still important in the 
treatment of patients with lifethreatening irregular heartbeats a 
food and drug administration expert said wednesday 
dr robert temple director of one of two fda offices of drug 
evaluation said that although the drugs encainide and flecainide 
are no longer recommended for use with patients with mild heartbeat 
problems the drugs give doctors another way to possibly control 
very serious cardiac irregularities 
the drugs are useful for those people who are in a fairly 
desperate situation he said in an interview there are a lot 
of drugs to treat heart disease and none of them work all the 
time you need a full complement of drugs in that situation 
encainide is marketed by bristolmyers under the brand name 
enkaid and flecainide is sold by 3m riker under the name tambocor 
the two drugs were used in a national institutes of 
healthdirected study called the cardiac arrhythmia suppression 
trials or cast 
in this study encainide and flecainide were given to patients 
who had suffered heart attacks and then experienced mild or 
asymptomatic extra heartbeats 
the drugs were dropped from the trials last april after the nih 
found that more of the cast patients taking the medication were 
dying suddenly than were patients in the study who were taking only 
sugar pills 
a board monitoring cast found that among 730 patients receiving 
encainide or flecainide there were 57 cardiac arrests while among 
725 patients in the study taking only placebos 22 died of cardiac 
arrest 
the study was designed to see if reducing those extra beats 
that are known to be associated with excess risk would improve 
survival said temple obviously it didnt 
cast continues however using a third drug moricizine which 
was not associated with increased numbers of premature deaths this 
drug is not now on the market 
temple said the medical logic of cast combatting the disease 
by controlling the symptoms has been applied successfully in many 
medical studies for instance he said it been shown that 
controlling high blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart attack 
the fda doctor said encainide and flecainide remain in wide use 
because they work well with some patients he said no patient 
taking the drugs should change medication without physician 
approval 
a philadelphia physician dr joel morganroth of graduate 
hospital said that a survey he took of cardiologists before cast 
was modified showed that about half of the 250 doctors who 
responded were prescribing the drugs to control heartbeat 
irregularities in patients like those in the nih study 
he said in an interview that based on data from this survey and 
from other statistical studies there may have been up to 3000 
persons who died prematurely while taking these drugs 
for a brief period on tuesday the associated press reported 
erroneously that these deaths were connected to the cast studies 
morganroth said he surveyed only doctors who were not in the drug 
trials he said also that his estimate of the number who may have 
died while taking these drugs was only a rough number based on 
statistical assumptions

housing secretary jack kemp on wednesday 
promised to revive an improved version of a retirement center 
program he suspended saying the needs of the poor and elderly 
would not be slighted as he cleans house at his department 
kemp whose department of housing and urban development has been 
tainted by allegations of fraud and influencepeddling under his 
predecessor said he is engaged in a herculean task of cleaning 
out the augean stables 
we are going to both clean up hud and make it work while 
moving forward on goals that congress and president bush have laid 
out kemp told the house select committee on aging 
in a lighthearted reference to the problems dogging hud kemp 
said it was appropriate that he appear before the aging committee 
because there is no secretary in the cabinet who is aging 
faster 
kemp who has suspended restricted or revised several federal 
housing programs because of alleged abuse and mismanagement 
promised the retirement service center program would be reopened 
retargeted tightened up 
the program was designed to provide housing to elderly people 
who can live on their own and pay market rates for special services 
such as central dining and recreation however because the centers 
often were too expensive buildings were slow to fill and defaults 
mounted 
we are currently evaluating this program to determine if it 
can be redesigned so that it produces housing for those who need 
it rather than producing empty buildings and losses as experienced 
in the past kemp told the committee 
kemp also said he was shocked that because of policies of the 
previous hud administration 30000 or more proposed rental housing 
units for the elderly and handicapped never left the drawing 
board even though federal financing had been approved 
i have ordered a speedy review of the policies that caused the 
delays and after review with my appointees we will take immediate 
actions to get this clog out of our pipeline he said 
kemp who spoke at a hearing on the housing needs of the frail 
elderly voiced support for proposals to help people stay out of 
nursing homes by linking government housing aid with programs that 
offer homecare services 
without extra help some elderly folks facing needs with daily 
living could be forced to leave their homes and become prematurely 
institutionalized in our hospitals and nursing homes he said

asianamerican leaders appealed to president 
bush for help wednesday for a variety of causes from speeding 
reparations for japaneseamericans interned in world war ii to 
guarding against discrimination in admission to elite universities 
they also lauded bushs measured response to the chinese 
governments brutal crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
many of the 17 asianamericans who met privately with bush were 
republican party activists including anna chenault head of the 
national republican asian assembly and cindy shinga daub who was 
national director of asianamericans for bushquayle 
bush said he intends to nominate ms daub as the new chairman of 
the copyright royalty tribunal effective sept 27 he also told the 
group that john b tsu will head the secretary of educations 
regional office in san francisco 
cressey nakagawa national president of the japanese american 
citizens league appealed for bushs help to speed reparation 
payments to the world war ii internees 
former president ronald reagan signed legislation last aug 10 
authorizing payments of 20000 each to the 60000 survivors of the 
120000 japanseamericans interned during the war but congress and 
the administration have been slow to come up with the funds to 
actually make the payments 
tsu who teaches at john f kennedy university in orienda 
calif said he raised the issue of discrimination in admissions 
and the president was very much concerned 
bush noted how many high school valedictorians are 
asianamericans and said admissions should be equal and fair 
according to tsu 
asianamericans have charged some elite universities limit 
admissions of their children and hold them to higher entry 
standards than other students 
tsu said the office for civil rights at the department of 
education is currently conducting compliance surveys at the 
university of california los angeles and harvard university 
on the china situation mrs chennault said i have suggested 
to our president we should be firm and yet be positive toward the 
government in beijing 
i think the president looking in the long term is taking a 
very reasonable realistic position said mrs chennault who 
said top leaders in china have invited her to visit 
frank yining liu president of the organization of chinese 
americans and law professor at duquesne university in pittsburgh 
said they also urged bush to preserve the principle of family 
unification in us immigration policies 
john k lim president of the federation of korean american 
associations of america said bush had a chance to open the door 
to north korea as former president nixon did with china 
heng cheng a former president of cambodia now living in 
houston said he asked for bushs support to get a chance to 
participate in talks in paris on settling the strife in cambodia 
krishna srinivasa cochairman of indianamericans for 
bushquayle 88 said we are very delighted it is the first 
time in the history of the united states where a president has 
taken special interest to call such a meeting of asianamerican 
leaders 
the koreanborn ms daub is a former official of the department 
of health and human services her husband hal daub is the former 
republican congressman defeated last year in a senate race in 
nebraska

scattered rain and cooler temperatures 
helped bring some fires under control in central canada on 
wednesday but 27000 people were kept from their homes in three 
provinces 
the rain also brought more lightning strikes and new blazes in 
far northwestern regions 
the fires the regions worst in memory have driven people from 
remote communities in northern manitoba saskatchewan and ontario 
and destroyed 37 million acres of forest no injuries or deaths 
have been reported 
cooler weather and light rain wednesday followed temperatures in 
the 90s providing relief for crews and clearing the air of choking 
smoke 
the cooler temperatures seem to hold the fires closer to the 
ground said bob johnston of the manitoba natural resources 
department if we had another three or four days like this wed 
be looking pretty good i think the panic would be over but the 
forecast is not for that 
instead warmer dry weather was expected to return to the 
province 
the fires began several weeks ago and became a serious problem 
last week at last count about 225 fires were burning in manitoba 
150 in northern ontario and about 165 in saskatchewan most have 
been caused by lightning 
in all three provinces about 42 million acres of forest have 
been destroyed this year and 3 million acres in manitoba alone 
manitoba premier gary filmon has said the firefighting and 
evacuation will cost the local government 30 million 
the provincial government has declared a state of emergency 
in ottawa on tuesday prime minister brian mulroney promised 
every conceivable support from the federal government 
on wednesday stranded vacationers and businessmen were driven 
south accompanied by royal canadian mounted police escorts but 
local residents were forced to wait out the blazes in makeshift 
dormitories 
we want to be sure that when it is time to go home it is time 
to go home to stay said mark tessier an official of the 
emergency measures organization in thompson 
the population of the northern mining city has jumped from 
15000 to about 20000 in the past week as evacuees streamed in 
from outlying communities 
rainfall in the provinces varied one region received up to 16 
inches while in others it merely drizzled or didnt rain at all 
in many cases a north wind helping to blow fires back over 
burned out ground instead of pushing them over fresh timber 
but the bad weather which in some cases included lightning 
grounded exhausted pilots who had been flying 12 water bombers 
over affected areas on an almost nonstop basis a few of the more 
than 50 helicopters remained in the air

saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggis 
efforts to get out of jail and back to the style to which he is 
accustomed were halted wednesday when a federal appeals judge put a 
stay on his release 
a lower court had granted khashoggi a 10 million bail package 
tuesday his 54th birthday but prosecutors appealed before he 
could post bond 
khashoggi who had been a fugitive until his arrest in 
switzerland on april 18 is charged with helping ferdinand and 
imelda marcos in the alleged plunder of the philippines government 
treasury he has been in jail in new york since his july 19 
extradition 
judge lawrence w pierce of the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals granted the stay pending a ruling on a prosecution appeal 
of the bail package he did not indicate when the ruling might be 
made 
the governments appeal cited khashoggis unverifiable 
wealth as a reason not to grant bail assistant us attorney 
charles labella attached to the appeal a 19page summary of 
khashoggis assets that khashoggi presented to the court last week 
khashoggi once one of the worlds wealthiest men valued his 
assets at 1418 million but said he had 88 million in 
liabilities bringing his estimated net worth to 5385 million 
he is said to have been the main financier and middleman of the 
irancontra affair in which proceeds of illegal us arms sales to 
iran went to rebels fighting the nicaraguan government 
calls to khashoggis lawyer robert morvillo were not returned 
morvillo said tuesday evening he had raised enough money to meet 
the bail 
khashoggi had been expected to move to an apartment he owns in 
the luxury olympic tower building on fifth avenue 
labella said khashoggi should be required to give a detailed 
financial disclosure under oath before bail is even considered 
no one can say with certainty what khashoggis net worth is 
something that khashoggi continues to conceal he said 
khashoggis financial summary named 73 companies based in a host 
of countries including panama lebanon saudi arabia 
lichtenstein switzerland the cayman islands hong kong and the 
netherlands but it said only 12 were active the others were 
described as dormant in liquidation or bankruptcy 
in addition to the new york apartment it listed a home in saudi 
arabia and an estate at malaga spain 
his personal and business debts included an 81000 credit card 
bill and 378033 in lawyers fees 
khashoggi said he had 643746 in bank accounts in switzerland 
france monte carlo singapore and canada but said the balance in 
the monte carlo account was only 47 cents 
a federal grand jury in new york indicted khashoggi the 
marcoses five other people and the california overseas bank in los 
angeles last october the ousted president and his wife were 
charged with stealing more than 100 million from the philippine 
treasury to buy real estate and art in new york 
khashoggi who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the 
assets as a cover was indicted on charges of racketeering 
conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of justice however the

a mystery fungus perhaps from japan has 
riddled gypsy moths in the northeast this summer and may turn into 
a new weapon against the destructive pests the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
this is the first time a fungus has been known to cause a 
massive dieoff of gypsy moth caterpillars in north america said 
entomologist ann hajek of the departments agricultural research 
service i saw single trees with thousands of caterpillar 
corpses 
hajek who is based at the agencys laboratory in ithaca ny 
has been working to identify the fungus which was found in the 
western connecticut towns of wilton and hamden she said the same 
fungus probably killed the pests in areas of massachusetts new 
york new jersey pennsylvania and new hamphshire 
whatever the fungus is its definitely an addition to our 
arsenal of weapons against gypsy moths she said it could 
provide a new method for biological control for these pests 
hajek said its possible that the fungus is entomophaga 
maimaiga a fungus imported from its native japan for testing 
against gypsy moth caterpillars but she said no releases of the 
japanese fungus were made in the areas where the mystery fungus 
has been found

administration inspector

an fda request to recall its generic versions of orphengesic a 
muscle relaxant and orphengesic forte the same drug in an 
extrastrength formulation said barbara manners a par vice 
president and general counsel 
on monday par said it was voluntarily recalling its generic 
version of the highbloodpressure drug maxzide the company said 
an internal investigation found that product samples given to an 
fda inspector were intentionally drawn from a production batch 
other than that represented to the inspector 
in the case of generic orphengesic and orphengesic forte the 
company may have misrepresented to the inspector the size of 
the production batch from which the sample was taken manners said 
given the fact that its not clear whether the batch was 
misrepresented it has to be recalled manners said 
she said the company sees no immeditate health or safety 
problems with either the generic orphengesic drugs and the 
generic maxzide 
par pleaded guilty last week in us district court in baltimore 
to paying illegal gratuities to fda employees the charges were 
unrelated to the circumstances that led to the product recalls 
manners said 
generic drugs are lower cost but chemically equivalent versions 
of brandname drugs whose patents have expired

the quebec provincial appeals court wednesday 
upheld an injunction that prevents a 21yearold woman from having 
an abortion and her attorney said she would appeal to the supreme 
court 
the ruling was the latest in a series of legal decisions that 
has riveted attention on the issue and increased pressure on the 
government for an abortion law 
the canadian broadcasting corp interrupted its programming with 
the announcement that the quebec court of appeals voted 32 to 
uphold the injunction barring chantal daigle from having an 
abortion 
a former boyfriend jeanguy tremblay had sought the 
injunction weve won tremblay told reporters at the montreal 
courthouse where the decision was announced 
the lawyer for ms daigle a secretary who is in her 21st week 
of pregnancy said she would appeal to the federal supreme court 
our client doesnt have seven months to wait lawyer daniel 
bedard said 
defying the quebec appeals court by seeking an abortion in the 
united states could bring a twoyear prison sentence and a 42000 
fine 
canada has been without an abortion law since january 1988 when 
the nations supreme court said the cumbersome procedure required 
for approval infringed on womens rights that ruling and a 
decision in a second case last january decriminalized abortion and 
said the issue was for a woman and her doctor to decide 
prime minister brian mulroney has said legislation will be 
introduced this fall when parliament returns from summer recess 
the government will be responding in what i hope will be an 
appropriate way he said recently there are events that have 
brought it to the front burner more than has been the case but i 
think nobody would want us to be stampeded by this 
three provincial court decisions issued this month have resulted 
in public pressure for a law 
an ontario supreme court decision threw out an injunction 
preventing barbara dodd 22 from having an abortion and she went 
ahead with the procedure immediately 
but last week ms dodd appeared publicly with greg murphy 23 
who had sought the injunction claiming a fathers right and 
criticized abortion rights groups for encouraging her 
prochoice activists who helped advise ms dodd before her 
abortion deny that she was encouraged to go ahead against her will 
in manitoba a woman went ahead with an abortion after her 
former boyfriend failed to obtain an injunction 
the quebec decision involving ms daigle was based on the 
provinces charter of rights 
the child that has been conceived but not born is a reality 
that must be taken into account he is not an inanimate object nor 
the property of anyone but a living human entity distinct from the 
mother and has the right to life and protection from those who 
conceived him wrote justice yves bernier one of the three who 
voted to reject ms daigles appeal 
pregnancy is not in itself an attack on a womans physical 
wellbeing or an interference in her body but a function which is a 
fundamental part of her nature the rule of nature is that 
pregnancy must lead to birth bernier wrote 
in one of the two dissenting opinions justice christine 
tourigny the only woman on the panel said the quebec superior 
court erred in upholding the injunction because the general 
provisions of quebec law cannot be interpreted as restricting or 
forbidding rights guaranteed by the canadian constitution

property tax bills 50 to 200 percent higher than 
last years have provoked an angry outcry that on wednesday sparked 
a petition drive to overhaul the cook county tax system 
the petition launched by patrick quinn of the coalition for 
political honesty seeks a property tax reduction and a limit on the 
amount taxes can be increased 
i think people have had it up to here with a system that needs 
reform said quinn its a soaktheaverageperson system and 
its not fair 
if the group collects 155000 signatures a nonbinding 
referendum will be placed on chicagos march 20 primary election 
ballot an additional 130000 signatures would place it on the cook 
county ballot 
if they raise it any more i dont know what im gonna do 
said michael galgano a 74yearold former construction worker who 
owns his northwest side home i dont have much left in my 
savings 
galgano one of the first to sign the petition said his bill 
was less than 1000 three years ago 1300 two years ago and is 
about 2000 this year 
on monday 350 angry protesters stormed one aldermans office 
demanding propertytax relief 
were the ones who are most in danger of losing our homes 
said protester frank greco 72 who lives on a fixed income in a 
hardhit ward we want to send the message that unless they roll 
back taxes people are going to fight forever 
the county must share property tax revenues with the school 
board city colleges streets and sanitation etc but it has 
demanded an increased share for this year and county board 
president george dunne has said he needs another increase to expand 
crowded jails and hospitals next year 
the petition calls for a reduction of at least 5 percent in the 
1990 property tax levy a 1000 homestead exemption and a ceiling 
on taxes of no more than 2 percent of the homes market value 
quinn said some are now paying up to almost 3 percent of their 
homes assessed value 
that percentage of assessed value varies among the countys 108 
taxing districts officials said the countys share of that is 
1128 per cent of assessed value up from 0913 in 1987 
the plan is based on measures approved by voters in california 
massachusetts missouri and michigan quinn said 
benjamin franklin said death and taxes are inevitable but he 
didnt say its inevitable to be taxed to death said quinn a 
former member of the county board of tax appeals 
quinn contends county tax collecting is based on a 19th century 
system that is unfair confusing and not based on ability to pay 
he blamed dunne saying the county government is inefficient and 
padded with patronage jobs 
dunne said his hands are tied by an antiquated system he would 
like to see reformed he said he spends 76 cents of every dollar 
for a criminaljustice system that demands more every year 
i wont make a promise of reducing something unless i can see 
where that can be done and i dont see it right now dunne said 
jean lee said her taxes had doubled since the last time she was 
billed 
i worked really hard to get the home we have and now ive got 
to give it up if rates keep rising said ms lee 58 who lives 
with her retired husband on the south side and was among the first 
to sign the petition 
in 1988 illinoisans paid 74 billion in property taxes equal 
to the amounts generated by state income and sales taxes said 
douglas whitley president of the taxpayers federation of illinois 
the problem is the system itself whitley said

the department of housing and urban 
development has been reimbursed 72970 owed by the widow and 
estate of a onetime broker for the agencys buffalo ny office 
officials said wednesday 
the department last week collected a check for 24831 from the 
estate of bernard s brady and another for 48139 from 
manufacturers and traders trust where brady had maintained a hud 
escrow account the buffalo hud office said in a release 
case closed said joseph lynch manager of the buffalo 
office thanks to the cooperation of mrs brady harold fein her 
lawyer and robert wilmers at mampt we have recouped hud monies and 
restored bernie bradys reputation 
the reimbursements came less than a month after the associated 
press obtained an internal hud audit which showed brady had 
withheld payments overbilled hud and paid himself advances while a 
real estate broker and appraiser for the department 
when brady died of cancer in 1987 his widow maureen wrote 
20100 worth of checks on the account which was in her husbands 
name according to the audit obtained under the freedom of 
information act 
from 1983 until his death brady had been under contract to act 
as management broker and closing agent when hud sold foreclosed 
singlefamily houses 70 to 80 a year in erie county according to 
the buffalo office brady was supposed to forward money and 
documents to hud within 48 hours but his reports were frequently 
delinquent according to the release 
discrepancies in the escrow account were reported to hud in 
october 1987 by fein attorney for the estate and lynch 
immediately requested an investigation but the audit was not 
completed until jan 19 1989 which hud attributed to delays 
encountered by the competing priorities 
when contacted by the ap last month lynch and a paul kane 
huds regional inspector general for audit said hud was still 
having trouble collecting the money 
brady was one of many closing agents who apparently took 
advantage of lax controls at hud under secretary samuel pierce the 
new secretary jack kemp has been tightening controls in the wake 
of reports that some agents took millions of dollars for their own 
use 
but lynch said he did not believe brady had any criminal intent 
he may have kept lousy records but i am convinced brady was an 
honest man lynch said

top secret information and gave the goahead for drug testing of 
nine motor vehicle operators as well as a guard for the secretary

countless indignities by those who just cant leave well enough 
alone 
designated hitters plastic grass uniforms that look like 
pajamas chicken clowns dancing on the baselines and of course the 
most heinous sacrilege lights in wrigley field he said 
durbin concluded that if we forsake the great americana of

a plane crash that killed 42 people in 
angola should not stop the peace process there even though the 
government blamed the crash on a rebel missile the angolan 
ambassador was quoted as saying wednesday 
earlier the portuguese news agency lusa quoted an 
unidentified military source in luanda as saying the plane attack 
and a recent increase in rebel activity might force the government 
to postpone peace talks scheduled to resume monday in zaire 
rui mingas recently appointed ambassador to lisbon said in an 
interview that the crash should not hinder the continuation of 
negotiations with the rebels 
an excerpt from his tuesday interview with state television was 
published wednesday in the stateowned daily diario de noticias 
a military official in luanda the angolan capital said the 
sovietbuilt plane a twinpropeller antonov 26 was forced to 
crashland in angola on sunday after being hit by a missile 
he said the missile was fired by the rebel national union for 
the total independence of angola or unita 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said rebels 
were surrounding the crash site wednesday and were shelling 
government troops to prevent them collecting what he called 
irrefutable evidence that the plane was shot down by rebels 
with a stinger missile 
in washington unita issued a statement denying its forces shot 
down the plane the group said it suspects a government faction 
mounted the attack to undermine the peace talks by throwing the 
blame on rebels 
the statement said the rebels were still committed to reaching a 
permanent settlement to the countrys 14year war 
at a jun 22 african summit in zaire angolan president jose 
eduardo dos santos and rebel leader jonas savimbi sealed a truce in 
angolas 14year civil war with a historic handshake 
both sides have accused the other of violating the ensuing 
ceasefire which lasted only a week according to a lusa dispatch 
wednesday unita attacks in the past week have left 115 soldiers 
and civilians dead 218 injured and 31 missing 
but both went back to the negotiating table anyway the last 
round of talks ended saturday under the mediation of zairean 
president mobutu sese seko 
unita with western support has been fighting to force the 
cubanbacked angolan government to share power since shortly after 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
the rebels still receive between 15 million and 18 million in 
us military assistance a year the aid is said to include stinger 
missiles

believe could set a legal precedent in vermont by defining the 
rights of two people of the same sex who raise children together 
judge l john cain of chittenden probate court ruled the will 
was executed in accordance with legal requirements 
susan bellemare was examined and is found to be mentally 
competent and physically able to be collins guardian he also

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
said wednesday that warring cambodian factions will meet again to 
try to resolve differences over how they should be represented an 
an international conference 
sihanouk said the leaders of the four factions would meet 
thursday at the chateau in suburban la cellesaintcloud where 
talks broke down tuesday 
however a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said no meeting 
would take place there it was not immediately clear whether the 
factions could meet at another location 
the conference begins sunday two months before vietnam is to 
complete its troop withdrawal from cambodia where fighting 
continues 
along the thaicambodian border wednesday cambodian government 
forces shelled at least four thai villages as part of an 
intensified campaign against cambodian guerrillas in the area thai 
military officers said 
buddhist monks ran into bunkers around a monastery in ban noan 
sao aee as shells fell on the area other villages shelled were 
klong nam saay ban nung and ban tote charoen there were no 
reports of deaths 
france the former colonial ruler of cambodia and indonesia are 
cochairing the conference in paris which will involve nearly 20 
nations 
negotiations between leaders of the warring cambodian factions 
sihanouks threeparty guerrilla resistance and prime minister hun 
sen broke down tuesday in a dispute over the composition and 
seating of the cambodian delegation 
hun sen is demanding that cambodia be represented by two 
delegations his vietnameseinstalled government and the guerrilla 
coalition that would deny the communist khmer rouge the strongest 
guerrilla faction an independent voice 
the other two guerrilla factions are the noncommunist forces of 
sihanouk and the khmer peoples national liberation front 
sihanouk wants cambodia to be represented as a single unit 
we definitely refuse to let the world see that we are two 
cambodias sihanouk told reporters at a news conference 
wednesday we let france know that in such a case we will not 
attend the conference and the results of the conference will 
not be valid 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to topple the khmer 
rouge which was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of people in a more than threeyear reign of terror 
sihanouk insists the khmer rouge be included in the peace 
process saying such a move will contain them and ensure security 
he maintains the real danger is vietnamese colonization of 
cambodia 
the khmer rouge are monsters this is understood he said 
but that is no reason for us to become a protectorate of 
vietnam 
sihanouk claimed that hun sen wants two separate cambodian 
delegations to give his own government legitimacy 
the majority of nations recognize the coalition government of 
democratic kampuchea of which sihanouk is president it holds 
cambodias seat at the united nations 
the disagreement over representation at the conference also 
includes how cambodias leaders should be seated at the huge 
rectangular table at which the foreign ministers of the 
participating nations will gather 
sihanouk said he will propose that the four parties be seated as 
separate units in alphabetical order under the banner of cambodia 
barring an accord sihanouk and hun sen have indicated the 
conference could proceed without a cambodian delegation dealing 
with international aspects of the cambodian conflict in such a 
case i will go but as an observer sihanouk said

the democraticcontrolled house voted 
wednesday to sharply limit production money for president bushs 
costly stealth bomber pressing the pentagon to come up with a 
program cheaper than the current 70 billion 
the b2 bomber is in serious trouble said rep mike synar 
dokla prior to house approval of the measure which put off a 
decision on the final fate of the radarevading bomber until next 
year 
the crucial vote wednesday was 257160 with 49 republicans 
joining 208 democrats to limit production of the 
halfbilliondollar plane 
the house action part of its work on the 295 billion military 
budget was a setback for bush who personally lobbied lawmakers 
for the aircraft 
the administration suffered another budget cut later in the day 
when the house approved an amendment to reduce by 502 million the 
11 billion in spare missiles and for a rail basing system bush 
requested for the mx missile the vote which was 224197 does not 
affect the nearly 800 million earmarked for the missiles 
defense secretary dick cheney on capitol hill to meet with 
lawmakers said house passage of the b2 amendment creates 
problems for the program 
but at least it lets us get through the house with the program 
having been approved and now well go to conference hopefully with 
a stronger position from the senate said cheney a former 
congressman from wyoming 
anything thats done by way of delay or stretchout is simply 
going to raise the cost of the program he added 
the productionlimiting amendment sponsored by rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee and synar 
allows the administration production funds for only two new bombers 
in 1990 and 1991 the pentagon had sought eight bombers 
the action sets up a confrontation with the senate which voted 
981 tuesday to back the bomber if it meets flight test and 
radarevasion standards 
the senate trimmed bushs 47 billion b2 request for the next 
fiscal year by a relatively modest 300 million 
once the house and senate complete their versions of the defense 
bill the two chambers will meet in conference to work out a final 
measure the administration expressed the hope that a b2 program 
resembling the white house request will still prevail 
the aspin amendment regrettably delays the program it weakens 
our negotiating position in armsreduction talks since it shows 
less than a full commitment to the manned bomber leg of our 
triad said white house spokesman roman popadiuk we hope to 
restore the program in conference 
the house amendment on the bomber would meet the 
administrations full request for research and development work 
over the next two years but would limit procurement money and then 
cut it off unless congress acts again 
aspin argued wednesday that the air force which wants 132 
aircraft has hardly tested this plane 
what this amendment does is say slow down the program do the 
research and development and fence the program said the 
wisconsin democrat who described his approach as one that would 
provide time to come up with a program that is politically 
acceptable and more affordable 
following the vote synar said the message today is that 
northrop the air force the administration have got to get this 
program in order 
rep john rowland rconn said bluntly of the b2 we didnt 
ground it but we sure clipped its wings 
aspin said that in the next year the administration must make 
the argument about where the soviets are going with their air 
defenses convince us that its worth spending some money on 
this program 
the manned batwinged bomber which costs 530 million a copy 
is built to penetrate soviet air defenses 
earlier in the day the house rejected an even harsher amendment 
sponsored by the odd coalition of liberal democrat ron dellums of 
california and republicans john kasich of ohio and rowland it 
would have stopped production after the 13 planes now in the 
pipeline are completed with no new ones started in 1990 or 1991 
rowland reminded members that the pentagon is seeking more than 
24 billion over a threeyear peak spending period in the 1990s for 
the bomber does anyone in this chamber believe well spend 8 
billion in one year he asked 
but the house rejected that argument by a vote of 279144 
the house also rejected an amendment that would have effectively 
endorsed the administrations overall 70 billion program though 
cutting 800 million from bushs request of 47 billion for the 
program in fiscal 1990 the vote was 244176 
the house approved an amendment extending the current law 
limiting deployment of the mx missile to 50 to all deployed mx 
missiles 
but the house turned down an amendment to cancel the mx mobile 
missile and singlewarhead midgetman missile rejected a measure to 
cancel the midgetman only and turned back a provision that would 
have prohibited the air force from using research and development 
money on moving the existing 50 mx missiles from fixed silos to 
railroad cars 
the house armed services committee had endorsed the 
administrations request of 11 billion for the mx missile and 
100 million for the midgetman

a nuclear regulatory commission task force 
said wednesday the nations nuclear power plants have enough 
storage space for highly radioactive spent fuel until 2025 even if 
the proposed yucca mountain repository in nevada is rejected 
in a report to commissioners the commissions waste confidence 
review group said a new site could be selected and put into 
operation by then if necessary 
a deadline of 2025 would push back the previous deadline of 
20072009 for an offsite storage solution that the commission 
gave in its previous waste confidence decision a 
courtrequired assurance that spent fuel will find a permanent 
storage place 
the review group told the commission that the original dates 
were set to meet the requirements of the original court case and 
are not a requirement for protection of safety or the 
environment 
group leader robert bernero director of nuclear materials 
safety and safeguards for the commission said new safer storage 
technology for spent fuel and the trend toward longer use of 
nuclear reactors will help relieve some pressure to find a central 
storage site 
spent fuel can be safely stored on site at least 30 years after 
a plant is mothballed bernero said a plant could be licensed for 
40 years of operation and then extended for 30 years with fuel 
being stored for 30 years on top of that allowing storage up to 
100 years before the spent fuel would have to be stored permanently 
yucca mountain the site mandated in the nuclear waste policy 
act amendment of 1987 could prove unsuitable the task force said 
it noted that congress has banned detailed studies of any other 
site 
the other two possible sites being considered were the hanford 
nuclear reservation near richland wash and a site in deaf smith 
county texas 
initial construction work on shafts aimed at detailed 
investigation of the nevada site is supposed to begin in november 
under the present timetable spent fuel would start moving into the 
site in the year 2003 the site is limited by law to 70000 metric 
tons 
figures supplied wednesday project 100000 metric tons of spent 
fuel by the year 2025 
the nevada governor opposes the project questions have arisen 
about geological faults and potential volcanic activity at the 
site and the nrc staff is concerned that environmental protection 
agency standards may be unusable or untimely 
should the yucca mountain project have to be scrapped at the 
turn of the century that would give 25 years for a new site to be 
screened and put into operation the group said citing energy 
department projections 
insisting that he was describing a very pessimistic 
assumption and not making a prediction bernero said the group 
decided let us postulate the maximum sort of delay one can 
envision 
the commission must reaffirm its waste confidence decision 
every five years the commission will ask for public comment on the 
present report

the grand jury was convened in may a month after the justice 
department expanded an investigation to examine all of fauntroys 
hiring practices over the past five years 
justice department david runkel said he could not comment on the 
case 
the younger savage who now works as an affirmative action 
officer for the chicago metropolitan sanitary district was not in 
his office wednesday and could not be reached for comment

illinois legislature and also was on leave from fauntroys payroll 
fauntroy says savage took an unpaid leave from his job for 10 
weeks between jan 1 and march 15 1988 to wage the campaign

to gain statehood for the district of columbia the younger savage 
has said publicly that he did not regularly report to fauntroys 
office and did little more than stuff envelopes when he was there

sudans new military leader indicated 
wednesday that the 6yearold civil war in the south would be 
brought to an end soon 
some bright news will be heared in the upcoming few days lt 
gen omar hassan elbashir told reporters at khartoum airport 
according to the official sudan news agency he returned from a 
summit meeting of the organization of african unity in the 
ethiopian capital of addis ababa 
the civil war has partly been blamed for starvation in the 
south and a relief worker said that a village where 8000 people 
starved to death last summer faces a similar crisis this year 
because of insufficient food stocks 
elbashir said president hosni mubarak of egypt had conferred at 
the summit with john garang leader of the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army and explained the orientations of elbashirs 
regime 
he said mubarak asked garang to cooperate with elbashirs 
government to put an end to the civil war which began in 1983 when 
the rebels took up arms to demand greater regional autonomy and 
economic and administrative reforms 
mubarak and elbashir also met in khartoum on sunday when the 
egyptian leader was on his way to the african organizations annual 
meeting mubarak and other african leaders tried to arrange a 
meeting between elbashir and garang but sources at the conference 
said the rebel leader declined 
egypt has a historical interest in sudan because the nile river 
runs through both countries on its way to the mediterranean sea 
elbashir said putting an end to the civil war was among his top 
motives in launching his june 30 military coup that toppled the 
civilian regime of prime minister sadek elmahdi 
a western relief worker said donors were studying possibilities 
for sending more food to abyei a village 500 miles southwest of 
khartoum 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united nations estimates that 250000 people died as a result of 
starvation and civil war in southern sudan in 1988 the world body 
says 100000 more could die this year unless its huge relief 
operation to send 105000 tons of food into the south succeeds 
about 70000 tons of supplies will have been moved by the end of 
july relief officials say 
the western official said abyei received 3000 tons of food 
normally enough to get 26000 inhabitants and refugees through the 
rainy season from june to november during that time heavy rains 
isolate many areas 
however the official said in the past few weeks up to 20000 
more refugees have arrived in abyei and the food is no longer 
enough to last them through the rainy season 
the official also said many refugees were streaming in daily to 
nearby aweil where 4000 other people starved last year however 
he had no details on food supplies there 
sudans civil war started in 1983 christians and animists are 
fighting for more autonomy from the arab moslem majority government 
in the north the rebels claim to control up to 95 percent of the 
southern countryside 
the fighting has forced up to 2 million southerners to flee 
their homes and livelihoods making them dependent on relief food 
about 23 million people live in all of sudan

president fidel castro said wednesday that 
the united states sensing the demise of socialism is dreaming of 
establishing a 1000year empire as adolf hitler did a half 
century ago 
castro said that although the socialist world particularly 
soviet bloc nations faces serious difficulties the united states 
will be no more successful in creating a global empire than was 
hitler 
imperialist circles are dreaming about an empire of 1000 
years as in his times adolf hitler dreamed castro said 
addressing a crowd of tens of thousands of rainsoaked listeners 
the cuban people have overcome difficulties before and can 
survive any challenge the united states might pose be it a war of 
attrition an occupation an invasion or a total blockade castro 
said 
the occasion for castros speech was the 36th anniversary of his 
debut as a guerrilla fighter cubans packed camaguey plaza to hear 
their revolutionary leader 
rain fell during much of his speech which lasted one hour and 
50 minutes and was one of the briefest he has delivered at such a 
ceremony 
castro was not protected against the rain and his green 
military uniform was soaked through by the time he finished 
castro was sharply critical of president bush ridiculing his 
triumphant attitude concerning difficulties the socialist cause 
is now experiencing 
castro warned of an american effort to recolonialize the 
world in the event of the complete demise of socialism 
during bushs visit to poland placards appeared in crowds that 
greeted bush saying the best communist is a dead communist 
castro said 
he described this sentiment as fascist and said that 
socialisms enemies should know that we communists wont let 
ourselves be killed easily the remark was received with long 
applause 
castro raised the possibility that his countrymen might someday 
wake up and learn that a civil war has broken out in the soviet 
union or that the country has disintegrated altogether 
in this event cuba will continue fighting and will continue 
struggling he said 
he recounted the drift toward capitalism in poland reflected in 
recent electoral setbacks for communist party candidates 
he suggested that perhaps it would be a good thing for polish 
youth to know how egotistical brutal and inhuman capitalistic 
societies are 
it was castros first public speech since the execution two 
weeks ago of an honored comrade and three other military officers 
on corruption charges but he made no reference to the scandal 
the speech marked july 26 1953 when the young castro led an 
attack on a military barracks that launched his long campaign 
against dictator fulgencio batista who fled the island on jan 1 
1959 
president castro uses each anniversary for a major address 
interest was heightened this year by the trials of the four 
highranking officers 
they were convicted of drug smuggling and other offenses in the 
biggest corruption scandal of castros time in power 
among them was gen arnaldo ochoa who was with castro from the 
beginning and was made a hero of the revolution for his performance 
as a commander of cuban expeditionary forces in africa lesser 
sentences were given to several other officials 
except for a speech to the council of state last month excerpts 
of which have been made public castro generally has been silent on 
the subject 
lowerranking officials who met with reporters tuesday however 
made a favorable comparison between cubas record in combatting 
drug smugglers with that of the united states 
castro who will be 63 next month toured the area around 
camaguey on tuesday visiting projects built since this 
agricultural center 300 miles west of havana was chosen for this 
years july 26 festivities

an inmate at a mental health center who allegedly 
wrote threatening letters to olivia newtonjohn and dozens of other 
celebrities could be ordered released at a court hearing next 
month his attorney said 
the possible release of ralph nau was enough to prompt a 
prosecutor who handled his murder trial to write warning letters to 
40 prominent women with whom nau has allegedly had imagined 
relationships 
prominent among naus infatuations is actresssinger olivia 
newtonjohn said randall stewart an assistant lake county states 
attorney the prosecutor said nau twice traveled to australia in 
pursuit of miss newtonjohn 
attorneys at a hearing wednesday worked out details on what 
evidence can be presented in kane county circuit court in august on 
naus petition for release from elgin mental health center 
lake county public defender david brodsky who represented nau 
at his murder trial said the hearing could determine whether nau 
is released from the mental health center 
nau was acquitted in may of murdering his 8yearold stepbrother 
after the judge refused to allow a purported confession into 
evidence nau lived in antioch where the boys body was found 
stewart said nau confessed to killing his stepbrother in 1984 
and that he wrote hundreds of letters many of which are clearly 
threatening 
stewart said nau believes that miss newtonjohn was killed by an 
evil double and he has threatened to avenge this imagined crime by 
killing the supposed impersonator 
the prosecutor refused to release the names of other celebrities 
he had warned saying they had requested anonymity 
stewart said he wrote in his 40 warning letters that we 
strongly feel he could be a potential threat to you and your 
familys safety upon his release 
celebrities have been occasionally threatened by infatuated 
fans last week actress rebecca schaeffer was shot dead at the 
door to her los angeles apartment building allegedly by a man said 
to be obsessed with her 
brodsky said that although nau is mentally disturbed he never 
admitted killing anybody and never threatened the life of any stars 
hes written love letters and fan letters maybe some people 
think excessively said brodsky who represented nau in the 
murder trial 
he had delusions of grandeur and believed he was famous but 
never threatened anybody brodsky said 
the purported confession he said was put in his mouth by 
police officers during 12 hours of questioning 
prosecutors had nau committed involuntarily to the elgin mental 
health center for a psychiatric evaluation after his murder trial 
the center is located in kane county where his petition for 
release is being heard 
brodsky declined to speculate on whether nau would be a threat 
to anyone if he is released 
thats impossible to say he said but added ralph 
deserves to have his rights adjudicated in as fair a manner as 
anybody

convicted murderers sentenced to life 
imprisonment in new south wales will stay in jail until they die 
the state government decided wednesday 
the community has become cynical about life sentences said 
state premier nick greiner the public and relatives of victims 
in particular are entitled to know that when people are sentenced 
to life for murder they will spend the rest of their natural life 
in prison 
greiner said the new law will not be retroactive and those 
currently serving life terms will still be eligible for parole 
which is usually granted after 12 years 
the legislation drew criticism from the council for civil 
liberties which accused the state government of pandering to 
vindictive elements 
civil liberties president ken horler said the new law offered 
little chance of rehabilitation of inmates

residents of a trailer park that the 
environmental protection agency says is contaminated with toxic 
chemicals expressed outrage wednesday at talk of a temporary 
relocation program 
theyre not relocating me said john morreale one of the 
150 residents of the forest glen mobile home park theyve got to 
buy me out give me a reasonable price for my property 
more than 90 residents showed up at a meeting with federal 
officials at a fire station wednesday night to voice similar 
sentiments 
why cant you declare an emergency like they did in love canal 
and move us out immediately robert barclay asked at the meeting 
barclay and others said the amount of monetary assistance the 
government was offering was not enough 
my wife and i cant afford it were on social security 
barclay said 
robert salkie an epa official said the government would rush 
the site onto a superfund priority list and that the families would 
be permanently relocated perhaps in as few as two months 
but residents said that was too long terry friermuth said 
its too long to wait its too much of a disruption for the 
family you dont realize what youre putting us through 
the federal emergency management agency began contacting forest 
glen residents tuesday to advise them of the findings and canvass 
them about whether they wish to stay or relocate 
residents choosing to move temporarily will be provided with 
three months rent by the agency gerald connolly a senior 
emergency management representative said before the meeting 
the agency will also provide food and utility stipends for 
relocating residents and in some cases pay for rental insurance and 
the cost of kenneling pets connolly said paying mortgages on 
homes in the forest glen neighborhood will remain the 
responsibility of the owners he said 
the epa said tuesday that the discovery of five industrial 
chemicals in the soil and groundwater beneath the trailer parks 11 
acres posed a significant risk to the health of the 51 families 
that live in the neighborhood 
authorities think the ground on which the mobile home park was 
built may have been used as a chemical dumping ground the site is 
near a hazardous waste landfill and a few miles from love canal 
which was declared a national environmental disaster a decade ago 
because of extensive chemical contamination 
a spot check of the residents showed that most were opposed to 
temporary removal but would accept permanent relocation if the 
government would help pay for it 
officials said it is too early to discuss plans for a buyout 
however they have recommended that the evacuation remain in effect 
until the health risk is eliminated or substantially mitigated 
the contamination may be bad enough to force the eventual 
abandonment of the entire neighborhood said the epas richard 
salkie 
we are talking about temporary relocation but it seems to me 
that the longrange answer is permanent relocation he said 
salkie said the federal agency for toxic substances and disease 
registry has agreed to issue a public health advisory which is a 
first step toward placing the community on the national superfund 
priorities list for cleanup and permanently relocating residents 
the epas enforcement division meanwhile is investigating who 
may have dumped the chemicals in the area he said 
among the chemicals identified so far are aniline 
phenothiazine benzothiazole and polyaromatic hydrocarbons 
substances officials said are byproducts of industrial processes 
including chemical making 
despite health risk from exposure to the chemicals which are 
believed carcinogenic no illnesses in the mobile home park have 
been traced to contamination officials said

mail piled up and teachers blocked the 
streets of the capital on wednesday and president vinicio cerezo 
said he was losing patience with a weeksold strike by an estimated 
50000 public employees 
cerezo reiterated his opposition to giving the strikers most of 
them teachers and postal workers a raise this year he told a news 
conference the government does not have the money 
he also said strikers would not get their july paychecks 
the walkout has been marked by a series of marches and other 
demonstrations including almost daily traffic blockages 
on wednesday strikers blocked most of the main roads into 
guatemala city and authorities also reported blockages in the 
north at border crossings into mexico 
meanwhile emergency workers sorted air mail and domestic mail 
piled up in warehouses 
the strike has hurt many guatemalans who rely on money sent by 
relatives working in the united states and other countries 
the us postal service this week declared an embargo on mail to 
guatemala because of the strike officials in washington said 
tuesday that the guatemala postal administration requested the 
embargo 
the strike began may 31 with a slowdown by teachers by early 
june the nations 36000 teachers had walked out and by midjune 
the 5000 postal workers had joined in 
several smaller groups of government employees have joined the 
walkout which now involves an estimated 50000 of the governments 
200000 employees 
telegraph workers who struck with postal workers went back to 
work earlier this week after the communications ministry agreed to 
negotiate a raise next year 
cerezo has maintained from the outset that the government cannot 
afford a raise and urged workers to wait until next year he met 
personally with the teachers for the first time on tuesday 
the strikers want a monthly raise of 80 teachers and postal 
workers now earn from about 125 to 250 per month 
in a nationwide television address july 19 cerezo told the 
strikers they were being manipulated by the extreme right and the 
extreme left and said their demands were unjust as the speech 
began the transmitting tower of one television station was knocked 
off the air by a bomb

many puzzling cancers and inherited 
diseases might be explained by a radical new finding that not all 
genes are created equal genes passed on by fathers may be 
different from those passed on by mothers 
researchers are beginning to accept evidence that began to 
appear in the early 1980s suggesting that mothers and fathers each 
imprint genes with different signals before passing them on to 
their children 
the findings contradict one of the principles of genetics 
established in the last century by gregor mendel that it made no 
difference to a child whether it inherited a genetic trait from its 
mother or its father 
that now seems wrong genetic imprinting by mothers and fathers 
may be responsible for many kinds of cancer and inherited diseases

in the cramped and cluttered back office 
of his wifes video rental store bill anderson surrounds himself 
with howto books on farming during the turnofthecentury and 
produces the magazine of his dreams 
a lot of people out there like to read about oldtime 
methods he said as he showed off his 1885 edition of the 
american standard poultry book 
this is the book that turned me on 
andersons wistful longing for the days when a man could grow 
his own food and raise a family with 40 acres and a mule is the 
heart of living among nature daringly magazine which he edits and 
publishes in this small farming town on the northern end of 
oregons verdant willamette valley 
printed on newsprint at the local newspaper land is filled with 
tips on tanning hides trapping muskrat building log cabins 
brewing herbal teas and getting rid of ear mites on rabbits 
its a personal project for the 36yearold anderson who shares 
with readers his latest battles with his personal computer and 
advice from some of his 3000 us department of agriculture 
pamphlets he dedicates each issue to people he admires such as 
wild west showman buffalo bill cody hes a shirtsleeve 
relative actor tom laughlin billy jack and john 
shuttleworth who founded mother earth news 
anderson is trying to recreate the magic he found in those 
early issues of mother earth news which became a handbook for the 
backtotheland movement 
i and other readers of the mother earth news felt abandoned 
when they started publishing it for yuppies he said it seemed 
the slicker it became the more disgruntled the early subscribers 
became 
there was nothing for me to read in it anymore and i took a 
gamble that others would feel the same way 
he launched his venture in 1986 from the kitchen of his mobile 
home while living in oakland typing and photocopying the first few 
issues and gluing color photographs to the pages when it turned 
out they wouldnt reproduce clearly on the photocopier 
they cost 5 an issue to make he said but i only had a 
few subscribers so it didnt break me 
he kept it going even when he moved to cairo egypt on a 
construction job and continued it when he returned to oregon 
last year he only had 22 paid subscribers when library journal 
chose it as one of the best new magazines in the country using the 
membership list from the american rabbit breeders association and 
the addresses of people writing letters to such magazines as 
trapper and furfishgame he increased subscriptions to 220 
the last issue the 10th so far was a run of 5000 copies 
which anderson had stuffed in the local newspaper and mailed to 
libraries and names he has picked up along the way 
advertising is still meager but increasing issue no 10 
contained display ads for wildlife videos knives books and water 
street books and videos his wife tesis store it also had 
classified ads for such things as armadillo repellent an 
escargotraising kit catfish traps fox pups and a newsletter to 
find caretaker positions 
i want the magazine to be a conduit for eyeopening and 
heartopening communication anderson said we purposely set 
the price for the magazine 2 an issue 9 a year to meet the 
low to middleincome group my personal conviction is the low to 
middleincome group of society is the bedrock of society any 
grassroots change of life is there the environment the future of 
the earth depends on them 
in choosing topics he asks himself is it interesting then 
is it useful then is it wholesome thats about what i look for 
anderson first came to oregon from southern california in 1974 
looking for the kind of life his father had in lynwood calif 
before it was absorbed by the urban sprawl around los angeles 
he grew up in the ideal we are tring to achieve the people 
who keep their own cow raise a pig or two and harvest their own 
eggs from their own chickens said anderson 
my goal was always to to have 40 acres i always wanted to 
homestead by the time i got out of high school they had closed 
the homesteading in alaska so i joined the navy 
like many others who have come to oregon chasing similar dreams 
anderson has had a hard time finding it after trying to raise 
holstein heifers hogs and rabbits he is trying to start a small

paul linke sits for an hour and 18 minutes 
and talks about his wifes losing battle with cancer in the hbo 
special time flies when youre alive 
it is a mesmerizing mindblowing experience linke talks of 
hope and despair and love and it is the latter that binds the 
special together and makes the painful moments bearable 
francesca draper linke the mother of three children died in 
1986 at the age of 37 the oneman piece which linke first 
presented on the stage will be shown on home box office on sunday 
as he sat down in a restaurant to discuss the special linke was 
affected by a rush of emotion 
we had a tradition of prechristmas lunches for the whole 
family he said the last lunch we had when chex was still 
alive in 1985 was in this restaurant and at this same table 
linke who had not selected the site paused then added i 
had an inkling it would be her last christmas being here brings it 
full circle thats what i was going to call the show at first 
full circle of love 
once she had breast cancer and had the mastectomy and started 
alternative healing i told her i thought there was a book in our 
experiences he said his wife refused all conventional means of 
treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy 
it took some time and some persuasion before linke who has 
appeared in movies and in the television series chips was 
ready to go onto a stage with the story 
i wrote an outline he said as i did i realized i had not 
completed her dying she wanted her ashes scattered on mount 
shasta i rented a van and we all went up and scattered her ashes 
after that i decided i should really go forward with the show 
first he did a short version at a fundraiser a man in the 
audience said later a friend had died of cancer 13 years earlier 
and he had never come to grips with it as i performed i saw 
that i was tapping into peoples hearts and there was a real need 
for it it brings dying out of the closet 
linke is probably best known for his comic relief role of artie 
grossman on chips 
the character linke said was like a baseball relief pitcher 
hes called in late in the game delivers a few lines and goes 
my part grew 
the series casting director had seen linke in the movie moving 
violations he has another comic role in the movie 
parenthood but plays a slumlord in the movie pilot for the 
upcoming abc series capital news 
a chips reunion movie is also being planned larry wilcox 
who played one of the officers purchased the rights to the series 
in all my years in chips i got maybe a hundred fan 
letters linke said i wasnt the pubescent girls fantasy but 
this oneman show on life cancer and death generates so much fan 
mail i cant tell you

abcs new prime time live promises no 
gimmicks no recreations no sensational stories but it will have 
distinct differences from other primetime news programs diane 
sawyer sam donaldson and a studio audience 
its been a struggle for tv critics meeting here to get any kind 
of handle on the three networks new newsmagazines cbs didnt 
bring anyone in to discuss the revamping of west 57th and the 
three stars and producer of nbcs yesterday today and tomorrow 
spent most of their time fending off questions about their intended 
use of recreations 
and with all the competition the news divisions dont want to 
reveal formats or planned stories for fear of someone stealing 
their brilliant ideas 
abc news prime time live will premiere aug 3 in the 
meantime cohosts sawyer and donaldson described what sounds like 
part nightline part 60 minutes and part donahue 
were not going to do just another program in which we have 
pieces that have been prepared for months weeks longform 
perfectly shot perfectly scripted put together right said 
donaldson trying to explain what the show isnt we hope that 
youll see some pieces like that on our broadcast but in addition 
to that youre going to see us do a live broadcast on the topic 
and on the subject so that we are not just putting on another 
magazine show 
and its a little bit looser format said sawyer trying to 
explain what it is i mean apart from the technologies we all 
know that in the end after the cameras have gone on and the 
satellites work and dont work and the people show up or dont 
show up it has to rest on what you say and what kind of 
information youre bringing 
sawyer said that test runs of the show included some onlocation 
reporting but also interviews in the studio and some of it did 
have some of the components that ted koppel on nightline uses 
done in a slightly different way on our broadcast 
or that david brinkley uses said donaldson 
or that brinkley uses agreed sawyer 
or that 60 minutes uses said donaldon 
thats right confirmed sawyer 
or that 2020 uses donaldson added 
this is not just another newsmagazine 
no it isnt 
one reason is the studio audience other news shows have had 
audiences notably koppels ontheroad nightline but this is 
the first time in recent memory theres been one for a primetime 
news program 
donaldson promised he would not become sam donahue im not 
going to run up and down the aisle of the studio audience asking 
sex in the morning do you like it yes oh how about you 
donaldson said the audience that witnessed the runthroughs 
added energy by its presence 
the real heart of the show however is the pairing of sawyer 
and donaldson though donaldson argued that is not the case if 
we dont have the interesting topics and if we dont have the wit 
to do them in a way that will interest you were not going to make 
the program 
true donaldson was hired for the new broadcast before he left 
the white house beat earlier this year and no cohost had been 
selected but when sawyer was hired away from cbs 60 minutes 
the new abc newsmagazine became instantly known in the tv community 
as the sam and diane show 
despite what donaldson says the programs success will rest on 
the chemistry between its two stars they will engage in live 
banter on the subject of the evening with sawyer once an aide to 
president richard nixon on one side and donaldson thorn in the 
side of the reagan white house for eight years on the other 
sawyer hinted however that those who ascribe assumed political 
posiions to the two would be surprised to learn their true 
leanings if youre expecting us to square off in some 
colorcoded political corners its really not going to happen that 
way 
donaldson has been a fixture in roundtable discussions on 
this week with david brinkley for years usually squaring off 
with conservative columnist george will 
george will and i do disagree at least half the time and 
thats fine two aging white males slapping each other around 
verbally said donaldson but i thought to myself how will 
the audience react if i turn to diane someday were talking about 
something and i say diane thats nonsense i mean thats 
ridiculous here is this guy beating up on a very elegant very 
classy woman well i got into these tests with her and im going 
to tell you something im going to get the sympathy vote 
but after 45 minutes of donaldsons exchanges with the tv 
critics sawyer got the sympathy i just want you all to remember 
that you get to go home after this she said i go back with 
him i mean i get a little sympathy for this

that durable old american evangelist billy graham after 
packing stadiums of great britain for a month flew into hungary 
this week proclaiming its religious life at a great historical 
turning point 
he said changes taking place there are good for the hungarian 
people and also good for our world 
after his lengthy stay in britain preaching to royalty in 
windsor castle and to multitudes in londons tough east end he 
moved into communist territory praising its new openness and 
spirit of creativity 
i believe our present visit is another sign of this new spirit 
of openness and change he said noting that for the first time 
in eastern europe he would be preaching in an openair arena 
budapests peoples stadium 
his meeting there this saturday night is being sponsored by the 
ecumenical council of churches in hungary and council of free 
churches in hungary in cooperation with hungarys roman catholic 
bishops conference 
also for the first time in eastern europe he said an organized 
system was being set up for followup church nurturing of those who 
make decisions to accept christ 
graham 70 who for 40 years has been setting new evangelistic 
records in his worldwide crusades set another new one in britain 
from which his services were carried by national television 
networks in 30 african countries 
this added a tv audience estimated at 22 million to 30 million 
including 85 million at 15000 meetings organized by african 
churches it was termed the largest single outreach and biggest 
simnultaneous audience in grahams career 
in his 13 meetings in britain the last one in a raindrenched 
wembley stadium attendance totaled 12 million of which about 
80500 made commitments to christ 
on his arrival at budapest airport graham in a statement 
received in new york applauded removal of trade barriers opening 
to individually owned enterprises alternate political parties and 
other efforts at democratization but he added 
the issues which face our world are fundamentally moral and 
spiritual and they cannot be satisfied by economic or political 
solutions alone 
how tragic it would be if hungary fell into the same trap as 
many in my own country and gained the whole world but lost its 
soul material progress is important but it can make us forget god 
and his will for our lives 
all too often economic progress and expanded freedom have been 
accompanied by moral and spiritual decay leading to a host of 
social ills such as alcoholism drug abuse disintegration of 
families loneliness crime and lack of compassion for others 
graham who has preached directly to more than 100 million 
people more than anyone in history has several times filled 
churches and cathedrals in the soviet orbit but not before in his 
familiar stadium setting 
making his fourth visit to hungary he said indications abounded 
of revitalized church life new buildings expanded publications 
youth rallies frequent religious conferences churchoperated 
schools 
all these give evidence of a new period of freedom and 
opportunity for all the churches of hungary he said adding that 
churches now are able to elect their own leaders and to 
evangelize both within the church and outside the church walls 
citing his meetings over the last 18 months in china the soviet 
union the united states and england he said 
wherever we have gone we have found that people are seeking 
answers to the deepest spiritual questions of the human heart 
questions like who are we where did we come from why are we here 
and where will we go when we die 
i believe that same spiritual hunger is true of many people 
here in hungary also 
he noted that the tombstone of communisms founding philosopher 
karl marx in highgate cementery in london says the philosophers 
have only interpreted the world in vartious ways the point 
however is to change it 
graham added jesus christ did not come just to interpret the 
world but to change it for he alone can change our hearts and 
bring us true peace peace with god and peace with each 
other 
in britain where he had often preached before graham said he 
detected a greater hunger for the simple gospel of christ than 
previously encountered 
while the church of england reports that it has closed 926 
churches in the past 20 years and demolished 289 more because of 
declining congregations graham said 
but wherever the evangelical gospel is being proclaimed the 
church is packed out people want to hear the bible 
in budapest too he said hungarian society needs spiritual 
and moral renewal political changes can give the churches new 
opportunities but only the holy spirit can renew them 
spiritually

six hours after ronald reagan left the 
presidency he arrived home for an airport ceremony welcoming him 
back to california for the first time in eight years he was made 
to look ridiculous before cameras 
reagans left finger was in a bulky bandage having been 
operated upon a few days earlier someone handed him an oversized 
replica of the california license plate carrying the words the 
prez he shoved it under his arm while trying to adjust atop his 
head an enormous feathery headdress like those worn by the spartans 
of ancient greece 
the expresident was on his own none of his handlers was with 
him no one had put down strips of tape to show him exactly where 
to stand he looked awkward and silly 
now six months after he left the presidency a smattering of 
historians and political scientists was asked how reagan will look 
in history whether he will be remembered as a majestic president 
who put his ideology into effect and reversed the new deal or as an 
amiable but ineffective chairman of the board with only a vague 
notion of what the government was up to 
some of the answers are surprising and often contradictory 
what he did was to save the presidency offers philip rulon 
a historian at the northern arizona university who describes 
himself as a liberal democrat and faults reagan for sweeping 
problems under the rug 
but reagan took office after a succession of failed 
presidencies rulon says and if reagan had also failed we would 
have had a crisis in government a crisis in confidence 
whatever his policy shortcomings rulon adds he made people 
respect the president again he was a great irish wit he had grace 
and style he is a communicator and a man of integrity and he 
preserved the office 
frank freidel history professor emeritus at harvard and the 
university of washington compares reagan to dwight d eisenhower 
complimentarily 
both were total charmers freidel says both clung to the 
smalltown middle america verities both were men of principle 
both were to some extent handsoff presidents 
and if the era of warmth with the russians persists were 
going to hail him as a man who grasped the opportunity when it was 
there freidel says 
princetons fred greenstein whose research caused other 
historians to raise their ranking of eisenhower sees history 
treating reagan the way it treats the scandaltarred administration 
of ulysses s grant someone who had substantial public support 
but left a rather messy legacy 
greenstein developed the theory of a hidden hand eisenhower 
presidency he believes ike purposely made himself appear 
outoftouch while manipulating events backstage 
will there be a hidden hand reagan greenstein asks i 
dont think so with ike we didnt get a dozen kissandtell books 
and we had nothing like irancontra 
donald mccoy of the university of kansas a biographer of calvin 
coolidge says reagan is to be compared to no other president 
because he tried to lead a peaceful counterrevolution and we have 
not had that before 
mccoy says reagan is probably getting higher rating than i 
think he will when things settle down 
what shall we ultimately say soso average fair 
lewis gould a university of texas historian compares reagan to 
coolidge and to franklin d roosevelt coolidge was strong for 
keeping things from being done he says and so was reagan 
at the same time he says reagan had the roosevelt touch when 
it came to communicating with the people 
rulon draws an fdr parallel as well he thinks reagan modeled 
his presidency after roosevelt he compares reagans saturday radio 
talks to fdrs fireside chats and says he loved to joke and tell 
stories as roosevelt did 
gould winds up assigning reagan to the middle or lowermiddle 
ranks of presidents in company with william howard taft 
coolidge gerald r ford and john f kennedy who is sinking 
among historians with almost every passing year 
political scientist charles dunn of clemson university says 
school is still out on the reagan verdict much depends upon 
how detente and the deficit play out reagans reputation 
historically will fly upon the wings of mikhail gorbachev and 
george bush he says 
columbia university historian henry graff pessimistic about the 
countrys future thinks reagan was the last of a kind 
as the new century commences were going to remember that 
reagan gave us an indian summer he says we glimpse a cold 
hard winter coming reagan will be remembered when all that 
stuff comes as the fellow who said hey lets play a little while 
longer

one of the most common criticisms of american 
business may also be made of the american family both seem to 
think shortterm even at the expense of the future 
this of course is a generality with many exceptions lots of 
companies foresake instant profits in order to fund research that 
wont pay off for years many families forego todays pleasures for 
tomorrows security 
still a study by a financial planning group reveals a strong 
tendency among americans to dismiss potential problems from their 
minds often because they are forced to by more immediate pressing 
challenges 
according to a report of the findings 
despite listing saving for retirement as their most important 
longterm financial goal most people do little about it while 
concern is high shortterm worries about the mortgage and paying 
for college have taken precedence 
the number two financial goal for most americans is putting 
children through college but most have no idea what it will 
cost and harbor unrealistic expectations about how they will pay 
for it 
more than onethird of americans say someone in the family will 
need longterm medical care but virtually none have any plans to 
pay for it nor do they seem disposed to plan 
fairly or unfairly a rap against surveys is that they tend to 
generate more suspicion than conviction especially when results 
uncannily coincide with goals of those who conduct or contract for 
them this one may be no exception 
conducted by the gallup organization for the international 
association for financial planning in atlanta it suggests strongly 
that americans need professional financial advice 
one of the findings as reported by the iafp adds to that 
feeling informing recipients that financial planners are also 
rated far ahead of other professionals in job performance and 
qualifications 
still it has a convincing ring to it one that conceivably 
might be verified in a survey of ones own neighbors or coworkers 
all of whom have been observed to worry about these three areas of 
life 
the three areas retirement education and health share other 
traits too 
all are categories of accelerating costs all have become huge 
burdens to business and government as well as to families and all 
three are costs that repeatedly seem to defy solution little 
wonder that people hide from them 
the categories along with housing costs in one form or another 
are among the social challenges for which individuals most often 
seek assistance from government or business from the latter in the 
form of employee benefits 
the responses to coping with longterm medical payments for a 
family member seemed especially significant 
respondents thought the possibility was quite high it rated 
34 on a scale of 5 and said they hoped to pay the bills from the 
patients savings or retirement funds from insurance and from 
social security or medicare 
only 11 percent of 1000 respondents said they would use their 
own savings or wages to cover the cost 
when those who cited insurance coverage were asked if the policy 
would specifically provide for longterm care only 15 said yes 
another 27 said they didnt know 
according to robert j oberst the associations treasurer 
people are confused about what their policies will cover unless 
specifically bought for longterm care most policies will not 
cover it he said

when randee and mark goldsmith decided to move 
to florida from suburban detroit they considered listing their home 
with a local broker but paying thousands of dollars in commissions 
didnt appeal to them 
doing the work themselves though proved too overwhelming the 
couple compromised theyd show their fourbedroom contemporary 
colonial while professionals screened potential buyers and handled 
advertising for a flat fee we saved about 8000 said mrs 
goldsmith 34 whose home sold five weeks after the couple listed 
it last spring not much below the 164900 asking price we used 
the money to buy furniture for our new house 
an increasing number of homeowners frustrated by escalating 
moving expenses and the soft housing market in many parts of the 
country have been turning to alternate methods of selling their 
property 
some people like the goldsmiths opt for a discount broker or 
real estate counselor while others handle everything themselves 
with different degrees of success either way if you want to save 
a buck be prepared to work for it 
you can see this trend on the rise more and more each year i 
expect this is a sign of things to come said jr paine author 
of the 30 day way to sell your home one of several books on 
the subject paine founded hms franchises inc a southfield 
mich noncommission service that helped the goldsmiths sell their 
home 
most people dont want to throw out about 6 percent to 8 
percent in commission who can afford that today she asked 
it goes even deeper than people just wanting to save said 
jack andrews president of helpusell inc a salt lake city 
discount broker people are getting more involved in what happens 
in their lives you see more selfservice gas stations and 
automatic teller machines 
the trouble with the traditional homeselling system critics 
argue is that its usually unfair to most of the participants 
a seller has to pay a hefty commission 6 percent on average 
for a home selling for 200000 that could mean 12000 in reduced 
profits on what often is a persons single biggest investment 
but the agent who sells the home wont keep all that money the 
pot usually is split several ways depending on how many agents 
helped peddle the property since most work on commission their 
cut sometimes barely covers expenses 
discount brokers and counseling services which comprise between 
5 percent and 10 percent of all real estate firms according to the 
national association of realtors claim theyve been able to lower 
the expense of homeselling 
for instance helpusell a subsidiary of mutual benefit life 
insurance co and one of the nations largest discount brokers with 
more than 500 franchises nationwide says it offers almost the same 
service as a traditional broker at a fraction of the cost 
for a flat fee payable at the closing that usually averages 25 
percent of a homes selling price around 5000 for a 200000 
home helpusell promises to handle all advertising and marketing 
and help buyers obtain financing among other things 
sellers are required to show their own home although the 
company will handle that task too for a fee of around 500 
however if a seller decides to list in the multiple listing 
service they may have to pay a higher commission to the broker who 
finds a buyer for them 
discount brokers and doityourselfers argue that homeowners are 
by far the most qualified to show their home and they reason that 
by saving money on commissions they can be more flexible in the 
asking price 
but norman d flynn who runs flynnbaker inc a fullservice 
realtor based in madison wis said doityourself selling methods 
dont always work well in a soft market 
it seems that this is a phemomenon that comes in cycle when 
you have a sellers market when theres a very limited supply of a 
quality product said flynn who is also presidentelect of the 
national association of realtors most sellers want the most 
aggressive marketing approach 
flynn said traditional brokers are best equipped to bring in 
qualified buyers largely because they have the most resources 
you cant just pluck a sign in your yard and hope someone out 
there will buy your home

contributions to religion which far exceed any 
other kind of philanthropy in america rose to 4821 billion in 
1988 up 824 percent but the money doesnt go just for religion 
itself 
other causes such as health education and the poor come in for 
a big share of it for which religion usually isnt credited but 
which it sees as part of serving gods world 
nearly all the religious receipts came from individual 
donations the increase in the total was almost double the years 
inflation rate of 478 percent 
while these figures compiled by the american association of 
fundraising counsel show a steady climb of religious giving in the 
country they dont show an intriguing aspect of it 
this is that the religious recipients themselves give away 
nearly half of whats given to them theyre a conduit to various 
other causes such as schools community projects and caring for the 
needy 
the new figures show total american philanthropy last year 
passed the 100billion mark reaching 10437 billion up 67 
percent from the 9782 billion the year before 
that for comparative purposes is considerably more than the 
826 billion the federal government spent in 1988 for nondefense 
goods and services 
aside from the sheer bulk of giving however the figures dont 
show that much of the more than 40 percent slice received by 
religion also is passed on to other causes 
consequently while the report shows 978 billion going to 
education 95 billion going to health and hospitals and 1049 
going to human services thats not all that these and other social 
causes received 
they also are beneficiaries of religious giving although this 
indirect funding often is disregarded in classifying charities 
the broader impact was brought out in an extensive study last 
year by the independent sector of washington dc and the gallup 
organization of princeton n j in cooperation with 100 religious 
organizations 
it found that 54 percent of what religion receives goes to 
maintain its own worship and educational institutions but that the 
other 46 percent goes to social programs beyond the church sphere 
these include soup kitchens hospitals colleges halfway 
houses facilities for the aged and homeless daycare centers and 
a host of voluntary services for communities 
based on the ratio determined by the study religion in 1988 
would have put more than 22 billion into various social 
improvement causes 
thats far more than 11 billion combined given in 1988 by 
foundations 63 billion and corporations 47 billion for such 
public purposes 
on a national and international level substantial religiously 
given funds also are channelled into overseas agriculture 
improvement and health projects and also to serving refugees and 
promoting peace and racial justice 
brian oconnell president of the independent sector a 
nonprofit organization of corporate foundations and voluntary 
organizations said the study findings showed religious 
congregations practice what they preach 
however he said many people downplay the significance of it 
in the report of 1988 giving the fundraising counsel said 
individuals contributed four out of every five donated dollars a 
total of 867 billion while the rest came from foundations 
corporations and bequests 
besides amounts that went to religion education and health 
human services received 1049 billion the arts and culture 682 
billion socialbenefit causes 302 billion and overseas 
services and recreational associations 1653 billion 
although the amounts generally were up charitable giving was 
seen as curbed by the 1986 tax reform act which eliminated 
charitable deductions for taxpayers who do not itemize deductions

opium is the new king of 
guatemalas rugged western mountains 
the crimson poppy began infecting the area about two years ago 
accompanied by highpowered guns and huge wads of cash it has 
spread like blood down guerrillainfested slopes and through hidden 
valleys stirring visions of another colombia 
us officials say one harvest of 16 metric tons and the 
fertile region can produce three or four harvests a year now 
yields enough heroin to supply the needs of us addicts for a year 
the fight to dethrone the opium poppy from which heroin is 
derived has become a top us priority here and worried 
guatemalan officials have agreed to aerial spraying despite the 
controversy over the threat to legitimate crops 
ive detected a real sense of panic in some people a us 
official said in a small country like this it wouldnt take the 
dopers long to take over 
they almost have in the nomans land where more than 4000 
acres of opium poppies now flourish 
the us spraying operation was halted in november after only 
two months because the lowflying planes were taking so much ground 
fire 
the flights are resuming but this time with air cover from a 
pair of helicopter gunships supplied by the us government and 
flown by us pilots under contract according to us and 
guatemalan officials 
these people live by the poppy they arent afraid to kill 
anyone said lt col eduardo santis a treasury police spokesman 
in january armed growers in the cuilco valley region killed six 
members of a treasury police patrol 
the 2100man treasury police force is responsible for drug 
enforcement but santis said it is undermanned poorly equipped and 
outgunned 
us officials say the military which governed guatemala until 
1986 when a shaky civilian government under president vinicio 
cerezo took over is staying out of the opium war 
officials say the only hope is to make the cost of doing 
business too high for the traffickers 
the united states has doubled its budget for the drug war in 
guatemala this year to 900000 the spraying program is a key part 
of the battle 
officials say each of the two planes can spray about 100 acres a 
day under ideal conditions the poppy has a 90day growing cycle 
and officials say only continuous spraying can discourage the 
growers 
smallscale opium cultivation has always existed in the area 
but officials blame the boom on an influx of mexican traffickers 
and the persuasive power of hard cash in a primitive isolated area 
beyond the reach of central authority 
us officials say they have detected some signs of 
moneylaundering but the drug trade does not appear to have 
affected the national economy yet 
us officials also believe that a few of the traffickers have 
employed leftist rebels eager to raise cash for arms 
the guatemalan national revolutionary movement a marxist 
coalition of rebel bands believed to number fewer than 2000 
controls a small zone in northwestern guatemala but has lost ground 
in recent years 
us officials said some captured guerrillas have admitted 
working with the traffickers chiefly as providers of muscle for 
strongarm tactics 
there is no stong evidence however any extensive involvement 
by the guerrillas in the opium trade 
the mexican traffickers take the opium gum north to their 
refining laboratories in mexico they also arm the growers and 
teach them how to avoid detection 
some growers have begun using raised earthern walls and rolls of 
canvas or plastic that can be unfurled to protect the brilliant 
opium blossoms from herbicides others are growing opium poppies 
with in crops like corn 
guatemala also has also been invaded from the east by marijuana 
growers driven from neighboring belize and from the south by south 
american cocaine traffickers who have begun to find usual caribbean 
smuggling routes too dangerous for them nowadays officials say 
officials estimate the amount of marijuana cultivation in 
guatemalas peten province has doubled in a year to about 1500 
acres 
as for cocaine guatemala which is halfway between the south 
american producers and north american consumers is a golden 
bridge said santis of the treasury police 
it is full of remote private airstrips and it lacks radar 
equipment to detect suspicious traffic santis said traffickers 
planes can fly into guatemala virtually undetected 
radar is high on the list of things the treasury police needs to 
fight drug trafficking but the list is long and basic water 
canteens machetes shoes weapons to replace world war iivintage 
m1 carbines and communications equipment

max wright is an actor whod much rather talk 
about the thrills and perils of gardening than his starring role in 
nbcs alf 
im passionate about gardening said wright a favorite 
target of the illtempered alien in the hit comedy i didnt know 
how therapeutic it was until i started its everchanging because 
of the seasons 
he talked about attacking snails of keeping insects at bay of 
the dangers of the hot california sun i have to defend my 
delphiniums he said you have to pack lilac roots with ice to 
give it the cold it needs 
after a while after talking about his garden tour of england 
wright can be persuaded to talk about other things 
alf tells the story of the cantankerous intergalactic alien 
who lands in the tanners garage and stays for dinner despite his 
behavior and freeloading he endears himself to the tanners the 
show also stars anne schedeen as kate tanner and andrea elson and 
benji gregory as the children 
wright had worked mostly in the theater and films before he got 
into television he was in such movies as all that jazz 
reds the sting ii and in the tv movie playing for 
time he played the infamous joseph mengele who performed 
experiments on humans at auschwitz his last show on broadway was 
lunch hour with gilda radner 
i came out from new york to do a pilot that wasnt picked 
up he said i stayed and made some guest appearances on shows 
then was cast in my first series buffalo bill i was the station 
manager who was intimidated by bill id played that kind of role 
before the guy between a rock and a hard place whos frazzled and 
modest and vulnerable 
his character in alf has some of those qualities he has 
to defend the undefendable he has to smooth over alfs gaffes he 
gets hauled up in a cage and alf hits him with a stick that makes 
me laugh i come prepared with my stock character ready to forgive 
his appalling behavior 
the premise of the show calls for willie to be at once horrified 
by alfs manners and values and attracted to him as a friend 
hes my pal wright said i care about him no matter how 
outrageous he is i can keep the bond its much easier with alf 
than with buffalo bill you can forgive alf it was hard to forgive 
buffalo bill 
wright grew up in detroit where he became a music student at 
age 4 by the time he was 5 he was playing the piano on television 
and at church meetings 
i also began reciting at an early age he said i have a 
good memory i could recite pages and pages of poetry i did a play 
in the third grade i got the part because i was the only one in 
class who would kiss the girl in the play on the lips 
his grandfather was orval wright but hes no kin to orville or 
wilbur wright the inventors of the airplane his father was george 
herman wright named after babe ruth 
i went to medical school on a musical scholarship he said 
i was planning to become a doctor my first semester i came under 
the influence of a drama teacher and began doing play after play i 
liked it i really liked it i then switched to wayne state 
university to study drama next i went to the national theatre 
school in montreal 
after that i launched my career i did a season in michigan 
then went to the arena stage in washington i never worked as a 
waiter i never drove a taxi i always worked as an actor i worked 
in repertory theater television doesnt compare to that the 
theater was tremendously satisfying it was magic for me i worked 
with people like meryl streep she was brilliant on the stage but 
she couldnt wait to get into movies 
i did seven broadway shows in five years i worked hard and 
fast it took me a long time to get out of the habit of rehearsing 
days and working nights

two decades after the sharon tatelabianca 
murders the screams of a summer night haunt the memories of 60s 
survivors and echo through the legends passed to new generations 
theres no question it is the most famous mass murder in 
american history said deputy district attorney stephen kay who 
assisted in prosecuting charles manson and three women followers 
my kids learn about it in school 
there have been lots worse murders over the years but nobody 
remembers them said maxwell keith the defense lawyer who 
represented leslie van houten and finds himself remembered for the 
case 
it was a mass media event said irving kanarek mansons 
attorney manson was on the cover of life magazine and it just 
took off 
i think its indelibly etched said attorney paul 
fitzgerald who represented patricia krenwinkel its like loeb 
and leopold sam shepard people cant remember jim jones name or 
charles whitman theyre even starting to forget patty hearst but 
theyll never forget this one 
why after 20 years do people still care why do they sign 
petitions to keep the tate murderers behind bars why do they tune 
in when manson occasionally gives tv interviews 
the answer apparently lies in public fascination with hollywood 
stars cults drugs and the power of a charismatic leader to turn 
cleancut allamerican kids into murderers 
the crime also was a coda for the 60s the deadend stop sign 
for an era of dropouts hippies druggies and flower children 
it was some sort of metaphor for the times fitzgerald says 
of the collision of mansons world and the protected beverly hills 
sphere of movie stars 
in the beginning the notoriety of the victims was the fuel 
that jettisoned this into outer space he said 
that fatal night of aug 9 1969 black clad intruders crept 
into prestigious benedict canyon and in an explosion of violence 
diverted world attention from killing in vietnam to the senseless 
butchering of a beautiful pregnant actress sharon tate 
the murder scene was one of ghoulish horror miss tate the 
26yearold wife of movie director roman polanski was found 
slaughtered along with three friends and a caretakers guest in a 
house where her blood was used to scrawl the word pig on the 
front door she had been hanged before she was stabbed to death 
and her fullterm fetus a boy died with her 
one of the murdered was jay sebring then hollywoods premier 
hair stylist another was abigail folger heiress to the coffee 
fortune voityck frykowski a jetsetting polish film director was 
a friend of polanskis steven parent the 18yearold friend of 
the caretaker died with them 
as los angeles reeled in shock the killers struck again a day 
later wealthy market owners leno and rosemary labianca were found 
gruesomely slain across town in their los feliz home a carving 
fork was left in labiancas stomach and bloody scrawlings marked 
the scene 
people locked their doors and bolted windows while the killers 
remained at large three months later the suspects were caught and 
their leaders name became a synonym for evil charles manson 
the discovery of the shaggy haired wildeyed manson and his 
tribe of slavishly devoted mostly young women followers living in 
a desert commune added a new dimension 
the rich and famous it turned out had been murdered by 
children of privilege who left their middle class american homes 
took drugs and came under mansons spell 
these children who come at you with knives theyre your 
children manson would tell society at large i didnt teach 
them you did i just tried to help them stand up 
their parents bewilderment was mirrored across the land as 
teenagers became runaways into a world of drug experimentation and 
violence 
freshfaced homecoming princess leslie van houten and rugged 
onetime high school athlete charles tex watson became 
murderers for manson so did susan atkins a troubled girl who 
found a home with mansons family and patricia krenwinkel a 
homely secretary who said manson made her feel beautiful 
it was a feeling all my life id been looking for miss 
krenwinkel said of life with manson 
the manson family trials began a public journey into the world 
of cults drugs and murder presaging an era in which such matters 
would become commonplace 
the trial of manson and the three women lasted 10 months and 
was perhaps the most chaotic in los angeles court history 
it was an experience of enormous importance and fatigue 
said fitzgerald who headed the defense team god it was an 
ordeal the defendants carving xs on their foreheads charlie 
jumping at the judge the girls being dragged out of court 
attorney ronald hughes disappearing it was a 24houraday 
ordeal 
hughes miss van houtens lawyer vanished just before closing 
arguments his body was found later in a remote mountain area where 
he had gone camping and was drowned in a flash flood keith was 
appointed to finish the case 
a band of mansons ragtag followers camped outside the 
courthouse daily and shaved their heads to protest the trial 
after months of claiming innocence the manson women abruptly 
took the stand during the penalty phase of their trial and 
confessed in repulsive detail that they and watson had killed the 
victims miss van houten was not at the tate house but admitted 
stabbing mrs labianca probably after she was dead 
the women tried to absolve manson of guilt but the jury decreed 
he was as guilty as they were for ordering the killings even if he 
was not present 
manson and the three women were sentenced to death watson who 
was tried separately also received a death sentence but a us 
supreme court ruling outlawing the death penalty in 1972 commuted 
their sentences to life in prison and in 1978 they began a 
seemingly endless string of parole hearings seeking freedom none 
of them has been given a parole date and kay who represents the 
district attorneys office at the hearings says he sees no 
imminent chance of that

i have always been of the opinion that manson watson atkins 
and krenwinkel should never get out he said i was always of 
the hope that van houten would one day be suitable for parole 
maybe when she was in her 40s 
but now that miss van houten is about to turn 40 kay has 
retreated on that position he says her brief marriage to an 
exconvict in 1982 showed she was still susceptible to influence by 
unstable males i think there is a chance for van houten but not 
immediately he said recently 
fitzgerald who corresponds with miss van houten contends she 
is completely rehabilitated and criticizes the district attorneys 
office for dancing to the tune of public opinion 
kays chief ally is sharon tates mother doris who has 
gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures on petitions to keep 
the tatelabianca killers behind bars 
mrs tate formed parents of murdered children a group that 
comforts its members and seeks justice for victims recently she 
has been lecturing at prisons telling inmates the unfathomable 
sorrow of victims families 
i am the victims voice said mrs tate who is frequently 
asked by friends why she does not put it behind her 
how can you go on with your life when youre totally consumed 
with this she asks how can your life be the same as it was 
before never 
like others associated with the case mrs tate still puzzles 
over why it happened 
something deep down inside of me keeps saying why do human 
beings react so violently with no reason especially in cases like 
mine why kill people they dont even know 
amazingly that question remains unanswered 
vincent bugliosi who prosecuted the killers and wrote a book on 
the case propounded an elaborate theory called helter skelter 
which held that mansons motive was to foment a race war and that 
he was inspired by a beatles song to begin the siege of killings 
kay who took over the case when bugliosi left the prosecutors 
office accepts that theory but recently began to see the killings 
as a satanic ritual mrs tate also ascribes to the satanism theory 
they recall testimony that watson upon entering the tate home 
declared i am the devil and im here to do the devils work 
daye shinn miss atkins attorney is convinced that drugs 
particularly lsd triggered the killings 
how else could anyone believe that charlie had that much power 
to get people to kill he asks it was the mindexpanding drugs 
they took the lsd drugs screwed up their minds 
the women testified they were under the influence of lsd and 
other hallucinogens when they killed 
fitzgerald while citing the influence of drugs believes the 
motive was never known to the killers and was a product of mansons 
own slide into paranoia in the summer of 1969 
for reasons known only to him he became very irrational and 
antisocial says fitzgerald 
and for reasons known only to the manic mind of manson he 
decided to send his followers into the night on a mission of murder

it has been years since doris tate and roman 
polanski saw each other 
for awhile i couldnt bear to see him because in my state of 
denial i would always expect to see sharon with him says mrs 
tate 
twenty years after the nations most notorious mass murder the 
mother and husband of slain actress sharon tate are the most 
visible survivors of the gruesome tragedy 
mrs tate 64 who says her grief kept her immobilized for 10 
years has emerged as an articulate spokeswoman for victims rights 
and a source of comfort to the grieving 
if they look at me and see that i have gone on for 20 years 
then they feel there is hope she says her group parents of 
murdered children has helped hundreds cope with a childs loss 
her husband paul a retired army colonel has avoided the 
limelight 
polanski 55 a film director and actor is a fugitive from 
justice having fled to france in 1978 rather than appear for 
sentencing after he was convicted of having unlawful intercourse 
with a 13yearold girl 
nine years earlier on aug 9 1969 his 26yearold wife 8 
months pregnant was found murdered along with three friends and a 
caretakers guest the following night market owners leno and 
rosemary labianca were slain in another gruesome killing 
charles manson and a group of his young disciples were convicted 
of the murders 
polanski was abroad when his wife and friends were slain 
devastated by the tragedy he returned to the horror of suspicions 
surrounding him because he had directed rosemarys baby a film 
about devil worship 
the arrests of the manson family ended that part of his 
nightmare he went on to direct the academy awardwinning film 
chinatown in 1974 
living in paris after the scandal surrounding his trial he 
directed the stunningly beautiful tess which won critical 
acclaim 
but his fugitive status makes negotiations with hollywood 
studios difficult his two most recent films pirates in 1985 
and frantic in 1987 did not do well 
polanski won plaudits in france for his interpretation of a man 
turned into an insect in the 1988 stage version of kafkas 
metamorphosis at a paris theater 
he is occasionally seen at theater openings or taking 
refreshments in a cafe like the chic fouquets on the 
champselysees friends talk of negotiating his return to the 
united states but so far it is only talk 
mrs tates odyssey from grieving mother to outspoken advocate 
is a lesson in survival she credits her roman catholic faith with 
sustaining her and sees herself as a soldier of the lord 
since the victims dont have a voice we that are left behind 
that represent our loved ones must be counted mrs tate says 
she recently formed an umbrella organization cover to 
coordinate some 400 victims rights groups around california she 
serves on a department of corrections advisory board and visits 
prisons to tell inmates serving time for lesser crimes the 
devastation suffered by survivors of the murdered 
if i can change two of those people before they go on to 
murder then i have saved two victims says mrs tate 
she also campaigns to keep the tatelabianca murderers in 
prison she attends parole hearings for charles manson susan 
atkins patricia krenwinkel and charles tex watson and for 
leslie van houten who was not involved in the tate murder but 
admitted being at the labianca slayings 
when miss van houtens friends gathered 900 signatures urging 
her release mrs tate gathered 352000 urging her continued 
imprisonment 
she is adamant that the killers of her daughter remain behind 
bars 
when a person has murdered eight people i always include the 
baby then theyre untrustworthy to be released into society 
she says they have proven they cannot live in a normal society 
two decades later she realizes the murder case will be famous 
forever 
it wont go away and thats the reason i feel ive got to do 
whatever i can do she says that it wont go away is fine with 
me it affords me an opportunity to do something in my daughters 
name if theres such a thing as destiny then this is my plight

nissan did about everything right on its new fourthgeneration 
z car except for the name 
something more reflective of the car being a real magnet for 
young men might be appropriate and im only counting the youthful 
males who turned all the way around in their car seats or pulled 
alongside my test car and spent minutes taking in every inch of 
this auto 
there also was the fellow who evidently buoyed by the sheer 
sight of the 300zx cheered and raised a clenched fist in 
admiration believe me none of these guys was looking at me 
ask nissan if young males are the buyers of the 1990 300zx and 
theyll talk about psychographics the mental makeup of buyers 
not just demographics such as age sex and household income and 
theyll say women are likely buyers too 
the buyers are auto enthusiasts who want to be noticed said 
nissan spokesman ec mueller they have upper education and 
income theyre professionals wanting to make a statement 
judging from the reaction the bright red test car got there are 
plenty of people who want to make a statement on todays roads the 
question for them is do you have the 27000plus for the 300zx 
make no mistake the car is well done its lower and wider than 
its predecessor but has a longer wheelbase its 3liter v6 
produces 222 horsepower and is smooth and powerful getting the car 
up to 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds theres an even 
faster model a twinturbo 300zx due out this fall that brings 
even more horsepower 300 
the tbar roof is there offering the easy option of hardtop or 
open roof 
the optional nissan bose sound system was exceptional 
and the real beauty of the 300zx was the suspension it retains 
the roadhugging characteristics of a fine sports coupe yet it 
doesnt jostle riders harshly as many other sports cars do its a 
fine blend a good compromise between comfort and performance 
as nissan spokesman mueller put it on a six or sevenhour 
drive you dont regret being in the 300zx 
still making statements on the road isnt cheap like all 
upscale sports cars the 300zx is pricey and insurance costs will 
be pricey too 
this is the fourth major design of the nissan z car its also 
the companys response to critics who in recent years said nissan 
had lost sight of the original z car image that of a fine sports 
coupe in fact the first z the 1970 240z that was priced at 
3526 was motor trend magazines car of the year 
over the years nearly 1 million z cars have been sold as the 
car evolved and its name changed as larger engines were added in 
1974 it was renamed the 260z because of the addition of the 
26liter engine then 280z in 1975 280zx in 1979 and 300zx in 
the 1984 model year 
sales of the z car peaked at 73101 in calendar 1984 the year 
the third generation z car debuted then declined each year to just 
19357 in 1988 nissan attributes some of the decrease to people 
waiting until this year for the newly designed z 
it comes in two body styles a twoseater that was the test car 
and a twoplustwo version both have rakish sleek exteriors and 
firm formfitting front seats 
drivers must be ready to drive with their side mirrors as the 
rear hatch lid is so sloping that the rear window is somewhat 
small the lines from the rear window defroster add some 
distortion also the side window pillars are thick and large and 
make it difficult to see to the right and back 
inside the twoseater was a small indented shelf area in the 
midsection behind the seats for storage tall items fit well there 
but also obstructed the rear view 
smaller items fit all the way back where clearance was least 
the back also had cloth cases for storage of the two troof window 
parts and straps to buckle them in so they dont slide around 
the instrument panel had large easytoread numbers and letters 
no digital gadgets here but beware of that speedometer that goes 
to 160 mph nissan decided it could be dangerous to have a car that 
might surpass a drivers ability so theres a fuel cutoff at 148 
mph no burying the speedometer on this car 
a nice touch was having all the adjustment buttons for the 
cruise control embedded in the steering wheel the cruise couldnt 
be activated however until a main switch on the dashboard to the 
left of the steering wheel was turned on 
nissan said competitors include the toyota supra which starts 
at more than 22000 and the chevrolet corvette which starts at 
more than 31000 over the years fewer z car owners are reporting 
trouble according to consumer reports magazine the periodical 
ranked the 1984 and 1985 300zx cars as average followed by better 
than average for the 1986 model and much better than average for 
the 1987 model

sitting at the end of the runway the aircraft 
seems almost to paw the concrete with impatience more than 18000 
horsepower cranking four big propellers 
indeed it seems too much power just to get a dozen or so people 
and some electronic gear aloft but this is no ordinary plane 
the lockheed p3 orion has scored 37 victories over the most 
fearsome storms known to man flying into the teeth of hurricanes 
to fathom their secrets 
the hail and rain dousing the outside of the plane on a recent 
stop in washington are nothing compared to what this craft has seen 
in the flights signified by 37 red symbols on its fuselage the 
marks are in the shape that meteorlogists use to record a hurricane 
on a weather map 
a victory for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration research plane is recorded by flying directly into 
the storm to record its strength and then returning home safely 
gilbert the recordbreaking hurricane devastated jamaica and 
parts of mexico last summer yanked the craft up and down and side 
to side but couldnt prevent it from completing the mission 
i was waiting for the one that would pull the wings off 
recalled navigator tom gerish the plane survived a halfdozen hard 
jerks in various directions when it flew from the eye of gilbert 
into the heavy winds of the eye wall it survived them all 
the calm eye at the center of gilbert was only seven miles 
across compared to 30 miles for an average hurricane gerish added 
hurricane allen a year earlier buffeted the plane with the 
strongest wind it has faced a 203knot blast which translates to 
about 240 miles per hour 
knowing the plane is strong enough to survive such forces 
inspires confidence when facing a summer rainstorm over the 
chesapeake bay riding along to watch an noaa research plane in 
action 
the two noaa orions are based in miami remaining there in the 
warm hurricaneprone months to be on call when needed and 
traveling to other areas for various sorts of research in other 
seasons 
they get lots of riders scientists professors reporters 
early in the summer capt lj genzlinger said but by the end of 
the year it gets lonely on the 4 am flights looking for storms 
he said 
the 37 hurricane badges on the plane include a few with their 
stylized cloud track backward those gerish explained represent 
visits to australia where hurricane winds careen in the other 
direction 
on this side of the equator hurricane winds whip 
counterclockwise around the center of the storm south of the 
equator they churn the other way 
in addition the markings include a couple dozen flag symbols 
representing countries from denmark to india egypt to japan where 
the craft has conducted research the orion even has been been 
permitted to fly through normally closed cuban air space 
regardless of the season theres always weather out there to 
be investigated said flight engineer james dugranrut 
the craft has investigated hailstorms in south dakota 
atmospheric chemistry in new guinea monsoons in india and malaysia 
and fishery stocks off the coast of alaska among other missions 
on its flight over the chesapeake bay the plane was equipped for 
studying cloud physics electronic display screens allowed the 
scientists to measure and record temperature wind water content 
of clouds cloud droplet size chemical components of the air and 
so forth 
new doppler radar allows the plane to measure the movement of 
wind and water inside a cloud from a distance something dugranrut 
appreciates 
before we had that we had to fly through the cloud wed get 
a pretty rough ride sometimes remote sensing instruments are 
great he said 
hurricanes thunderstorms and many other clouds still must be 
attacked directly though 
on a recent mission to the midwest the plane had to fly into 
clouds to determine their suitability for rainmaking experiments 
gerish explained 
rainmakers disperse chemicals into clouds in the hope that the 
chemical molecules will serve as nuclei for water to condense on 
forming a cloud and leading to rain 
that will work only if lack of nuclei is the reason it isnt 
raining if there already is plenty of smoke salt or dust for 
water to condense on adding more chemicals wont help gerish 
said so the orion flew into clouds to sample the potential nuclei 
there

in a mission designed to enhance superpower 
cooperation two soviet mig fighter jets will be escorted over us 
airspace next month on their way to a north american air show 
as far as we know it will be the first time its happened 
said a state department official familiar with preparations for the 
event 
the plan is for us f15 fighter jets from elmendorf air force 
base in alaska to escort their soviet counterparts over us 
territory and then hand them over to escorts from the canadian air 
force 
the soviets are scheduled to attend airshow canada a trade show 
in abbotsford british columbia near vancouver as part of a 
contingent that will also include an an225 the transport plane 
that carries the soviet space shuttle on its back 
final details have yet to be worked out including the exact 
date of the flight and the specific route to be flown but 
officials involved in the planning say they expect it to occur 
around aug 4 
the soviets must file a flight plan three days in advance said 
the state department official a specialist in soviet affairs who 
asked not to be identified by name 
the official said that given recent improvement in ussoviet 
relations there is little question the plan will go forward 
everybody feels good about this one the official said 
its just part of the loosening the improvement of relations 
lt col mike conley spokesman for the alaska air command said 
pilots there are used to intercepting soviet aircraft but only to 
point them in the other direction away from us airspace 
usually they see reconnaisance aircraft or soviet bear bombers 
but not the mig fighters conley said 
this would be a different experience he said 
ron price the president of airshow canada said the soviet 
visit is the first such opportunity to view the mig29 in north 
america 
theyve only been seen on a couple of occasions in the western 
world price said 
price who traveled to the soviet union to help arrange the 
visit said the soviets are interested in exchanging rides with 
us and canadian fighter pilots but he wasnt sure that could 
take place 
id love to do it myself said price a real estate 
developer who is also a private pilot 
he pointed out that it is not just the spirit of gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness that is making the event possible 
they are coming to do business price said of the soviets 
the mig fulcrum that will be shown at the trade event is an 
advanced fighter that is thought to be comparable to the f16 
fighting falcon 
airshow canada backed by the canadian government is being held 
at a town that for nearly three decades has hosted an airshow 
emphasizing aerobatics the canadians are hoping their expanded 
aerospace show will become a premier trade event 
the fighter jet handoff is being planned amid increasing 
cooperation between the us and soviet military 
the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff adm william j 
crowe recently returned from a precedentsetting tour of 
oncesecret soviet military installations 
it was the first formal visit of a us chairman to the soviet 
union and the latest in a series of highlevel visits designed to 
dispel distrust between the superpowers last july crowe hosted 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev then the soviet chief of staff on a 
us visit

smacking on a wad of bubblegum 
12yearold kiva henderson chats excitedly about the boys and girls 
club of annapolis bywater which operates practically at the front 
door of her home they help you with your homework here it 
helped to bring up my grades she says 
elevenyearold keith collins chimes in i like it because 
its a good way to stay off the streets we cant get into trouble 
here 
while the nonprofit boys clubs of america has some 1100 
affiliates nationwide the annapolis club is one of 76 now located 
in public housing projects in an effort to keep disadvantaged kids 
from using drugs or dropping out 
the organization hopes to expand that effort over the next five 
years to reach an additional 700000 disadvantaged children through 
300 more such strategically located clubs 
the clubs organize sports trips and other activities to build 
youngsters confidence and teach good work habits teamwork 
honesty and selfreliance 
robbie callaway the organizations government liaison says the 
first boys club at a public housing project was established in east 
st louis ill in 1953 but he said the national office 
reenergized its efforts 3 years ago because of concerns about 
increasing drug abuse and crime by youngsters 
public housing was identified as the greatest need because no 
one else was doing anything there he says 
samuel r pierce jr housing and urban development secretary 
under president reagan lent his name and influence to the effort 
but no government money was forthcoming from hud which is now 
under investigation for doling out millions of dollars to projects 
backed by prominent republicans during pierces tenure 
still callaway said pierces public statements of support 
caused the organization to be swamped with requests that led to 
the opening of 23 public housing clubs in 1987 and 1988 
now boys club officials are looking to new hud secretary jack 
kemp to make a financial commitment 
speaking at an april 10 press briefing at the white house kemp 
a former boys club member and later pro football player said 
i dont know if there are subsidies for football fields but if 
i can find public monies in hud to support the boys clubs and girls 
clubs of america going into these public housing projects and 
setting up athletic teams im convinced that that would have a 
significant impact upon putting an end to this scourge of drug 
trafficking 
to bolster claims of decreased crime with boys clubs programs 
officials point to preliminary findings of a threeyear study of 
clubs in albany and binghamton ny jacksonville fla peoria 
and rockford ill meridian miss houston and brownsville 
texas and martinez upland and san jose calif 
the reports evaluators from columbia university and the 
american health foundation said substance abuse problems and 
juvenile delinquency have decreased in frequency and in severity 
within housing projects served by a boys and girls club 
other evidence is anecdotal 
ken darden director of the annapolis club says about six club 
members who recently graduated from high school had previously been 
borderline students 
boys clubs officials boast that a tough public housing project 
in houston the oxford place housing development already has 
experienced a decrease in crime particularly vandalism 
at wilkinson terrace in shreveport la 10 weeks after opening 
a club officials reported little vandalism at the project as well 
as at the nearby mall the louisiana results were cited in last 
years report of the white house conference for a drug free america 
perfecto villarreal head of the housing authority of contra 
costa county calif says a fieldhouse adjacent to one local 
housing unit is no longer the target of vandals since a club was 
established there 
the fieldhouse itself used to be vandalized he says now 
it is respected 
callaway adds we find that school attendance increases 
also it increases the level of participation of parents and tenant 
association in the local school activity which is a side benefit 
we could not have planned for 
a key problem is finding startup money 
some people dont want to gamble on putting a program in 
public housing callaway says thats what were finding with 
local businesses and local citizens 
once were started though once we give initial seed money 
its like giving them a good housekeeping seal of approval and then 
the local sector is willing to keep the club going he says 
funding from hud would be a big boost callaway says noting 
that the total cost of operating the national organization and its 
affiliated clubs exceeded 219 million last year 
so far he says the justice department has contributed 
350000 action agencies have given 362000 and the department 
of health and human servicess substance abuse prevention office 
has donated 450000 
the average cost to operate a local club on public housing 
property is about 55000 callaway says 
the national office works with clubs to find local support to 
ensure the programs viability after the seed money dries up 
we do not want nor do we expect nor will we allow a boys and 
girls club to operate solely on government money callaway says 
boys club members pay yearly dues from 1 to 5 youths unable 
to pay usually can work off the fee with chores around the 
clubhouse 
the annapolis club celebrates its first anniversary in september 
the kids dont like to call this a project says darden who 
was a boys club member in bronx ny they call it a coop but 
the kids here span the whole spectrum of society including coming 
from lowincome or singleparent families and environments of drug 
abuse 
last september 50 kids joined and now the club has a membership 
of 200 
robert randall 14 breaks away from an intense pool game to 
offer his endorsement 
there nothing i dont like about it we get to play games go 
on trips and it keeps you out of trouble

charles manson the most famous inmate in the 
california prison system lives in solitary confinement subject to 
threats by prisoners who want the glory of killing him 
at 54 the onetime wildeyed guru of a murderous communal 
family still gets stacks of mail and requests for interviews 
lately hes been declining because he says he doesnt want to 
give away anything for free says evelyn mazon spokeswoman for 
the high security state prison at corcoran where manson was moved 
early this year 
the three giggly longhaired young women who once followed 
mansons commands to murder have drifted into middle age behind 
bars patricia krenwinkel 42 susan atkins 41 and leslie van 
houten who turns 40 this summer appear regularly at parole 
hearings seeking freedom that seems more elusive each year 
mansons chief lieutenant charles tex watson is a 
christian minister and father of three children through conjugal 
visits with his wife at the california mens colony at san luis 
obispo miss atkins also is married 
twenty years after the sharon tatelabianca murders the manson 
family killers have settled into prison life most are model 
prisoners but only one leslie van houten seems a possible 
candidate for parole 
miss van houten who was not at the tate home but admitted 
stabbing rosemary labianca perhaps after she was dead was the 
youngest of those convicted her first conviction was reversed her 
second trial ended with a hung jury her third resulted in another 
conviction 
will any of them ever be released 
manson will never get out says paul fitzgerald the lead 
defense attorney who represented miss krenwinkel he doesnt want 
to get out hes perfectly adjusted to where he is 
the girls i think will be released eventually he says 
i think leslie will get out first patricia second then probably 
susan 
they have been rehabilitated he says i dont think the 
public safety argument is a good argument anymore now its simply 
vengeance 
daye shinn who defended miss atkins has a different view 
people may say im crazy but i believe the first one to get 
out will be charlie manson because he didnt do any of the 
killings 
according to testimony manson sent his followers to miss tates 
home on aug 9 1969 and the next night accompanied them to the 
labianca house but left before the killing began 
deputy district attorney stephen kay is committed to keeping 
manson locked up for the rest of his life except for miss van 
houten he says the killers have little hope of parole miss tates 
mother doris has gathered thousands of signatures on petitions 
urging that the killers never be released 
other members of the communal manson family have scattered 
somewhere in america michael manson the cult leaders son has 
turned 21 in new england linda kasabian the star witness of the 
manson trial has raised her children to adulthood susan atkins 
son grew up with an adoptive family 
bruce davis and robert beausoleil convicted with manson in the 
murder of malibu musician gary hinman are imprisoned at san luis 
obispo 
lynette squeaky fromme who aimed a gun at president ford in 
sacramento calif is serving a life term at a federal prison in 
florida where she was moved after a brief escape from her quarters 
at alderson wva 
sandra good who was in federal prison for writing threatening 
letters to business executives is free on parole as is steve 
grogan convicted in the mansonordered murder of stuntman donald 
shorty shea 
the manson trial defense attorneys continue to practice law in 
los angeles 
mansons lawyer irving kanarek contends the cult leader was a 
victim of bad publicity 
shinn regrets miss atkins wouldnt plead diminished capacity 
manson ordered his followers to present no defense and they obeyed 
the defendants were naive kids products of the times said 
fitzgerald most of them had no arrest records yet the public 
loathes and detests them and sees them as some symbol of evil 
they were the perfect symbols of innocence young girls 
in 20 years he said he has heard no public expressions of 
sympathy for these daughters of middle class american families 
people dont say there but for the grace of god goes my 
daughter he said i havent heard that once

the boeing co says it secondquarter profit 
increased 22 percent primarily because of higher sales and lower 
research and development costs 
the aerospace manufacturer said tuesday it earned 195 million 
or 85 cents per share on sales of 507 billion in the period 
ending june 30 that compares to secondquarter 1988 earnings of 
160 million or 70 cents per share on sales of 473 billion 
for the first half of 1989 earnings were 356 million or 155 
per share on sales of 907 billion compared with 296 million 
or 129 per share on sales of 837 billion in the same period 
last year 
boeing attributed the increase to the 72 percent quarterly 
sales rise research and development cost cuts and other new 
business expenditures related to commercial aircraft and computing 
commercial aircraft orders set a quarterly record with 22 
customers announcing orders for 502 jets and 8 de havilland dash 8 
commuter aircraft valued at 25 billion the comparable figure in 
second quarter 1988 was 133 billion 
the gains were offset somewhat by performance problems on us 
government developmental and production programs increased 
research and development and other new business expenditures 
related to electronics defense and space programs and higher 
federal taxes 
boeing chairman frank shrontz said the company still is 
experiencing serious work force skill dilution problems because 
of production rate increases on the firms 737 747 757 and 767 
production lines 
although a revised 747400 delivery schedule was met through 
june the company faces substantial risk in being able to 
produce and deliver on time all the airplanes were committed to 
boeing spokesman paul binder said 
the new schedule calls for more than 60 percent of the remaining 
44 747400 aircraft in 1989 scheduled for delivery in the last 
quarter 
boeing is not revising the new 747400 schedule now binder said 
the company delivered 174 airplanes in the first six months of 
1989 compared to 169 airplanes in the first half of 1988 current 
schedules call for the delivery of 220 airplanes the rest of the 
year

exxon corp says it will return to the site of 
the nations worst oil spill next year but stopped short of making 
a commitment to further cleanup 
a july 19 internal memo to exxon oil spill managers which was 
quoted in media reports monday suggested that the oil companys 
cleanup crews would leave alaska for good after shutting down for 
the winter 
but at a hastily called news conference tuesday in valdez 
alaska otto harrison general manager for exxon valdez operations 
in alaska said that the memo was not intended to extend to any 
other phase of our cleanup operations 
the news conference was relayed by satellite to new york 
the memo said that the company would demobilize cleanup 
operations for the winter for safety and operational reasons 
but it went on to say that all equipment will be fully 
demobilized and that our only commitment for the spring of 1990 
is to survey the shorelines 
exxon made the document public tuesday 
during the winter the company plans to conduct scientific 
studies in prince william sound and the gulf of alaska he said a 
survey team consisting of about 20 people will return to alaska in 
the spring he added but declined to say whether the company would 
mobilize another massive effort to resume the cleanup 
well be here to determine what the condition is and well 
make our decision at that time in consultation with the federal 
government harrison said i cant speculate on cleanup in the 
spring until we make that determination he said 
the coast guard has said that the cleanup is only onethird 
complete and state officials and environmentalists have criticized 
exxon for suggesting that it could finish the work by its 
selfimposed sept 15 deadline 
nevertheless harrison insisted that the cleanup operation would 
be completed by the deadline 
by the end of this cleanup season we will have the shorelines 
environmentally stable harrison said 
asked if that meant clean harrison said what im talking 
about is having shoreline conditions so that it does not harm 
otters seals birds and the normal flora and fauna that inhabit 
the area 
harrison suggested that exxon might remain beyond the september 
deadline 
well work until wintertime weather shuts us in harrison 
said we think thats about sept 15 
he said studies under way are analyzing weather conditions into 
the fall and that the company may change the september date based 
on the findings 
exxon spokesman jim morakis in new york said the company had 
rented warehouse space in alaska to store cleanup machinery and 
equipment over the winter 
exxon said monday that it charged 880 million against 
firsthalf earnings for outofpocket costs associated with the 
spill the company also said 400 million from insurance policies 
will help with the cleanup and other spillrelated claims bringing 
the total spill costs to more than 125 billion excluding 
lawsuits 
meanwhile tuesday in washington transportation secretary samuel 
skinner defended exxons plans to stop the cleanup sept 15 saying 
the company is living up to its obligations 
the secretary who oversees the coast guard and was put in 
charge of the cleanup by president bush also said it doesnt

but a spokesman for interior secretary manuel lujan said exxons

the agriculture department has announced the 
operating details of a 15 million bailout to help apple growers 
recover from the alar scare 
officials announced the program on july 7 to help move some of 
the huge apple supply from the market into donation channels 
usda is not purchasing apples for distribution but is 
reimbursing the industry up to 15 million once they remove 
supplies from normal channels of trade said kenneth c clayton 
acting administrator of the departments agricultural marketing 
service 
clayton added tuesday in a statement payments will be made 
for 1988crop apples donated to organizations that request them or 
for apples used in the manufacture of ethanol fuelgrade alcohol 
and livestock feed or dispersed through other usdaapproved 
nontraditional outlets 
he said the apple industry will be responsible for distribution 
to organizations that request the surplus apples 
in washington state spokesman chuck st john of the washington 
apple commission said organizations interested in receiving apples 
should contact the wenatchee washbased commission 
rep sid morrison rwash whose district includes the nations 
leading appleproducing region said the plan was welcome but late 
weve lost vital time waiting for the plan to be worked out 
morrison said its far from perfect but im pleased we now have 
a mechanism that will help clear the pipeline of 1988 apples before 
the 1989 crop is ready to harvest 
apple prices fell sharply after the alar controversy began in 
late february when a private environmental advocacy group said 
eating apples treated with the chemical alar substantially 
increases the risk of cancer 
the environmental protection agency and the food and drug 
administration disputed the groups report as a major exaggeration 
of the risk but sales dropped alar is used to enhance apple 
color make harvesting easier and to extend storage life 
apples for donation will be allowed to contain traces of alar 
which currently is permitted on crops at the rate of 20 parts per 
million the epa plans to ban the use of alar next spring and in 
the interim has proposed reducing the allowable limit to one part 
per million 
clayton said an inspector authorized or licensed by usda must 
inspect and certify the quality size condition and amount or 
weight of the apples to removed from the marketplace 
the assistance program will be available in any state where 
apples are available from the 1988 crop he said the agency will 
accept applications until aug 2 and will decide by aug 8 who can 
participate in the program 
im concerned with the amount of time before apples will 
actually be distributed morrison said the apple industry is 
now forced to react quickly and creatively to make this program 
work

a highlevel commerce department official has 
given lukewarm approval to a plan by sen ernest f hollings to 
pump hundreds of millions of dollars into developing new american 
technologies such as highdefinition television 
deputy secretary of commerce thomas j murrin said tuesday that 
while he supported the principle of encouraging us industry to 
rapidly commercialize new technologies he wasnt sure hollings 
dsc was adopting the right approach with a plan to spend 305 
million on the departments new technology administration 
the hollings proposal essentially would double the 159 million 
appropriated in fiscal 1989 for the commerce departments national 
institute of standards and technology and it includes 50 million 
in loan guarantees to spur private research and development in such 
areas as advanced television 
we do have several concerns about particular provisions in 
this proposal including the loan guarantee plan murrin told the 
senate commerce science and transportation committee 
we have progressed to the point where we agree with the 
purposes behind these programs but there may be more 
costeffective alternatives by which we could achieve the same 
objectives murrin said we have to make choices about which 
programs would be most important and what level of support would 
provide us with a critical mass to ensure success 
murrin is a longtime executive at westinghouse who assumed his 
commerce post only a month ago he said commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher had asked him to head the departments role in addressing 
technology competitiveness issues such as highdefinition 
television 
he said he considered it crucial that the united states 
develop hdtv which would use semiconductors and other advanced 
technology to generate highquality images proponents say hdtv 
could revitalize a sagging us consumer electronics industry and 
have important military medical educational applications 
sen john mccain rariz suggested that if hdtv is so 
important maybe we need to put our money where our mouth is 
and that perhaps it needs presidential attention just not the 
secretary of commerce 
congress is considering ways to help a fledgling us hdtv 
industry overtake the big lead that japan and europe already have 
in this area congress asked mosbacher earlier this year to 
recommend quickly ways the government might build a us industrial 
policy on advanced electronics 
but murrin said it would be some weeks before a report was 
forthcoming because expert consultants could not agree on what time 
frame to establish for development complicated new technologies 
murrin noted that president bush has proposed that new 
technology be spurred by a reduction in the capital gains tax a 
permanent research and development tax credit and changes in 
antitrust laws to encourage joint rampd and production ventures 
the hollings bill the technology administration authorization 
act of 1989 would authorize fiscal 1990 appropriations for the 
technology administration which includes the national institute of 
standards and technology 
among other things the bill authorizes funds for nists 
inhouse laboratory programs its technology extension activities 
and loan guarantees to raise 50 million in seed money for 
industryled projects in areas such as advanced electronics and 
television superconductivity manufacturing and xray lithography 
a new method of making semiconductor chips 
the 305 million for the technology administration would be 
combined with 155 million already authorized in the 1988 omnibus 
trade act 
the bill would exclude foreign companies which murrin said may 
not be in americas best interests he said he favored considering 
foreign companies requests to join rampd consortia on a casebycase 
basis

jc penney co inc is planning the 
biggestever promotion of philippine merchandise outside that 
nation hoping that apparel in brightcolored batiks and tropical 
prints plus other items will not only be eyecatching but 
customercatching 
the twoweek festival of the philippines in may might even 
feature an instore appearance by philippine president corazon 
aquino 
the promotion being produced in cooperation with the philippine 
ministries of trade and tourism could help give the pacific island 
nation a higher profile in the united states that would benefit its 
tourism and manufacturing industries 
david f miller vice chairman and chief operating officer of 
jc penney stores and its catalogue said the promotion at the 
1400 penney department stores nationwide would be the largest ever 
featuring philippine merchandise outside that country 
penney plans to present details of its plans which will include 
philippines cultural exhibits and other special events at a news 
conference today in dallas 
the philippines has been a source of goods for penneys for some 
time accounting for more than 50 million a year of its 15 
billion in overall retail sales with the promotion penneys could 
sell an additional 50 million to 70 million of philippinesmade 
merchandise 
the company said its consumer research shows americans are very 
receptive to the philippine culture 
penney which will support the may 1326 promotion with 
television and print advertising will launch the festivities at 
its dallas corporate headquarters and at five stores in cities 
chosen for their large philippine populations 
miller said in a telephone interview that the festival of the 
philippines the fourth countryoriented sales campaign penney has 
run will give penney a merchandising focus and some pizazz to 
catch customers attention 
stores can get to be so humdrum if they offer the same 
assortment the same merchandise miller said stores tend to 
look alike and their assortments tend to look alike 
we expect doubledigit sales gains during the weeks of those 
promotions he said 
many retailers including bloomingdales and neimanmarcus have 
built selling strategies around countries or regions but penney is 
believed to be making the most ambitious attempt to capitalize on 
the approach 
the tactic usually has been used by upscale department stores 
catering to the tastes of cosmopolitan consumers 
in using the technique to appeal to its more middleincome 
customers penney has an opportunity to present itself in a 
slightly different light and stand out from the pack of competing 
department store chains 
if you walked into bloomingdales and saw this you wouldnt 
get all that excited about it for penneys its different said 
norman mcmillan of the retail consulting firm mcmillan doolittle 
its unexpected for them to do something international penney 
has a thoroughly american reputation 
penneys three past country promotions featured merchandise from 
italy britain and india 
penney managed something of a publicity coup with its british 
promotion the prince and princess of wales visited its 
springfield va store to help launch the best of britain 
promotion in october 1985 
despite the royal seal of approval the best of britain wasnt a 
kingsize success at every penney store the somber british tones 
and heavy woolens didnt play well in parts of the south for 
instance 
the indian promotion held in 1988 was considered highly 
successful by the retailer with sales from it approaching 100 
million it was featured in virtually every penney store whereas 
the earlier british and italian ones werent in all the smaller 
stores and the catalogue 
penney wouldnt disclose how much it will spend to pitch the 
philippines but miller said the promotional budget alone topped 10 
million

continued strong truck sales in midjuly offset 
sluggish car sales during the period as the us industry posted a 
24 percent increase in vehicle sales over the same period last 
year 
the eight major companies making cars and trucks in the united 
states reported tuesday they sold vehicles at a daily rate of 
39726 during the july 1120 period this year compared with a rate 
of 38807 during the same time last year 
light truck sales rose 38 percent during the period while car 
sales went up a modest 15 percent among the big three automakers 
car sales dropped 42 percent while light truck sales rose 37 
percent 
but analysts wondered how long and how strong the truck market 
actually was 
so far this year car and truck sales among all the companies 
were running 4 percent below last years levels with car sales 
slipping 53 percent and truck sales dropping by 18 percent 
the truck market has held up better than the car market 
said analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co of new york if 
you go back five or six months i dont think there is any question 
that the market has slowed down from a momentum point of view 
kirnan and tom webb senior economist with the national 
automobile dealers association in mclean va agreed that the 
truck market as a whole probably will shrink in the near future 
but the minivan segment of it likely will grow and the 
sportutility segment will stay about the same 
that spells trouble for pickups which have been the 
bestselling vehicles in the past several years in the united 
states 
pickups will continue to slow down where the economy is 
slowing down kirnan said thats going to reduce the 
commercial demand for those types of vehicles 
over the past several years the truck market has shown solid 
growth mostly because of minivans which are considered trucks but 
blur the distinction between cars and fullsize vans and 
sportutility vehicles including chrysler corps jeep line 
on tuesday chrysler again reported that its trucks outsold its 
cars so far this year chrysler has sold 550745 trucks and 
530607 cars the ratios at general motors corp and ford motor co 
favor cars way over trucks 
chryslers car sales came in 185 percent lower in midjuly 
compared with a year ago while its truck sales rose 41 percent 
ford suffered a 24 percent decline in midjuly car sales and 
posted a 42 percent gain in truck sales gm said its car sales 
during the period fell 14 percent and truck sales rose 31 percent 
the industry has settled in at a lower level here than 88 on 
average said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co inc 
of new york its stopped falling off the cliff its stopped its 
freefall 
through the first 20 days of the month cars and trucks sold at 
a rate 5 percent above last years 
sales typically flatten in the third quarter as manufacturers 
shut plants to retool for the coming model year which begins every 
oct 1 and as they sell the last of the current model years cars 
this year automakers have offered incentives and there has been 
widespread speculation of price increases for 1990 models both of 
which can fuel sales late in the model year 
kirnan wondered whether some of the sales reported this month 
are being borrowed from later on in the year as consumers take 
advantage of incentives now and avoid price increases later 
im more convinced that the sales numbers that we are seeing 
in the last 20 days in july are probably coming at the expense of 
the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1990 he said

selling days last year 
for the first two sales periods of the month there were 16 
selling days this year and 16 selling days last year and for the 
year so far 169 selling days this year and 170 selling days last 
year

big steel and its allies were disappointed 
that president bush extended steel import quotas for only 2 years 
and some small steelmakers and steel users were disappointed he 
didnt end them sooner 
the american iron and steel institute the leading voice of the 
major producers expressed great concern and disappointment tuesday 
at the length of the extension 
the trade group nonetheless welcomed the administrations 
decision to free no country and exempt no product category covered 
by the 5yearold voluntary rrstraint agreements or quotas 
instituted by president reagan 
the bottom line for the washingtonbased group is that 2 years 
is too little time to achieve bushs goal of an international 
consensus on ending government subsidization of steel production 
the big producers say subsidies lead to unfair pricing that 
violates us trade law and victimizes domestic companies 
one of the most successful small producers or minimills nucor 
corp said the giants of steel are addicted to government 
assistance 
its like dope said f kenneth iverson nucors founder and 
chairman these guys have had protection for 25 years its part 
of their way of life to ask the government to continually protect 
them 
iverson said the quotas cost taxpayers and customers a lot of 
money 
if anything they have delayed the modernization of our 
industry and in the long run they could do harm to the economy by 
having cheaper steel in the international market to produce steel 
parts that are imported in competition with american 
manufacturers 
the steel manufacturers association representing 46 minimills 
and their 36000 employees thanked bush for extending the quotas 
for 30 months and for seeking an international consensus 
the 300 steelusing companies represented by the precision 
metalforming association applauded bushs decision and were 
encouraged that quotas would be increased 1 percent per year from 
the 184 percent rate under the original program 
but the associations president jon jenson said the 
organization would have preferred that the restraints expire this 
year 
the united steelworkers however joined in the criticism 
the termination of the vra program is assured by the bush 
administration despite the fact that there will be no assurance 
that the foreign government subsidizing measures will be 
terminated usw president lynn williams said 
the limited duration of the extension will remove any further 
pressure to end unfair trade practices because the american market 
will soon be open without any rules he said 
added us sen jay rockefeller dwva the presidents 
decision indicates he still does not fully understand the needs of 
americas steel industry 
us sen john heinz rpa joined the criticism the chances 
are slim to none that even the most determined us negotiators can 
end a generation of foreign government subsidizing and unfair 
practices in a mere 2 years he said 
the general accounting office recently declared that the 
nations steel industry has returned to normal levels of 
profitability reagan imposed the quota program at the peak of a 
slump that bled the industry of 12 billion over five years and 
eliminated thousands of jobs 
national steel chairman howard m love said as late as tuesday 
morning that a fiveyear extension of the vras was essential to 
allow us steel producers to finish modernizing their plants 
were very disappointed love said late tuesday pledging 
support for negotiating an international consensus but saying time 
is short 
bethlehem steel corp expressed regret over the length of the 
extension 
the basic conditions that dictated the need for vras in 1984 
excessive global steelmaking capacity and unfair trade are still 
in existence today said chairman walter f williams 
japan said today it would cooperate with the decision to extend 
steel import quotas 
seiroku kajiyama head of the ministry of international trade 
and industry said japanese steel companies have worked for many 
years with the american steel industry to assist in its 
restructuring through technology transfers and joint ventures 
in upcoming negotiations with us trade officials kajiyama 
said japan will specifically take up some vital issues such as 
the development of free market conditions in world steel trade the 
continuing modernization of the us steel industry and the sound 
development of steel industries in both countries

lin broadcasting corps president imposed a 
monday deadline for the conclusion of buyout talks with its 
unsolicited suitor mccaw cellular communications inc 
lin president donald a pels told mccaw officials monday in a 
letter that despite some misgivings he was willing to support a 
buyout at no less than 12750 a share if a definitive agreement is 
reached by 9 am edt july 31 
a buyout at that price would value the new yorkbased cellular 
telephone television broadcasting and publishing company at nearly 
69 billion although mccaws cost would be lower because it 
already owns 98 percent of lins stock 
pels said that if there was no agreement by the deadline we 
intend to take such other actions and to pursue such other 
available alternatives as our board of directors determines to be 
in the longterm interests of lins stockholders 
a spokesman for kirkland washbased mccaw steven bruce said 
mccaw had received the letter and its lawyers and investment 
bankers planned to respond although he could not say when 
in national overthecounter trading lin rose 237 a share 
tuesday to 11187 while mccaw rose 175 a share to 37 
mccaw the nations biggest cellular telephone company said 
last week it was suspending negotiations with lin on the 
possibility of a buyout at 12750 a share and was extending its 
tender offer of 110 a share for lins stock until aug 11 
lin released a copy of a letter in which its president told 
mccaw chairman craig o mccaw that the suspension of talks 
disturbed lins negotiators because the only apparent obstacle was 
how soon the deal could be completed 
we seriously doubt that you are willing to negotiate a real 
deal to acquire lin at a fair price to its stockholders pels 
wrote 
he said mccaw appeared to be trying to get an option on lin or 
through your tender offer to steal the company at the lowest 
price and said lin had doubts about mccaws ability to obtain 
financing 
nonetheless pels wrote he still was prepared to recommend that 
the lin board approve a definitive agreement for mccaw to pay no 
less than 12750 a share for lin stock provided the agreement is 
reached by monday 
the continued uncertainty about your interest in acquiring lin 
at a fair price is harmful to our stockholders and extremely 
disruptive to lins ongoing operations and our ability to implement 
lins longterm strategic plans pels said 
mccaw started bidding for lin in early june with an unsolicited 
offer of 120 a share 
lin rejected that offer as inadequate and mccaw subsequently 
reduced it to 110 a share citing an unfavorable court ruling 
relating to lins interest in some cellular telephone operations it 
jointly owns with metromedia inc 
on july 13 lin and mccaw said they were in talks on a possible 
buyout at 12750 a share in cash and stock 
but mccaw said friday it was suspending those negotiations and 
extended its previous tender offer of 110 a share

shortfall in may the department of trade and industry said

from 22 billion the current account includes invisible trade 
such as services overseas investment earnings and official

current account gap of 26 billion 
the pound rose strongly on the news jumping to 16435 after 
the report was released at 1130 am local time from 16380

exports and to a lesser extent imports the department said 
exports rose 33 percent to 128 billion from 124 billion 
the department said 
exports were at record levels but continued to be affected by 
production problems as well as by a routine maintenance program 
carried out by oil operators in the north sea the department said 
imports rose 45 percent to 159 billion from 153 billion 
since the beginning of 1989 britains merchandise trade deficit

a federal judge has cleared the way for 
the 365 billion sale of northwest airlines to a los angeles 
investment group likening north dakotas attempt to impede the 
transaction to david vs goliath 
in a fivepage decision issued tuesday us district judge 
patrick conmy refused north dakotas request for a court order 
blocking the sale 
conmy said the potential harm to northwest and its suitor wings 
holdings inc that would result from blocking the sale outweighed 
the speculative harm to the state 
david duffy a spokesman for wings an investment company headed 
by alfred checchi a former treasurer of marriott corp said the 
oneday uncertainty of whether a judge might block the proposed 
sale has not jeopardized the deal 
our view was the suit was utterly without merit duffy said 
we will have an announcement today as to the status of the 
offer 
state officials filed a lawsuit monday contending the northwest 
buyout would lead to higher fares and violate an agreement 
northwest made with north dakota in 1986 
north dakotas lawsuit claimed the acquisition of northwest by 
wings would require the airline to restructure to finance its debt 
leaving the state vulnerable to higher fares and radical cuts in 
service 
conmy said north dakota attorney general nicholas spaeth should 
be commended for his efforts david vs goliath as they may be 
to attempt to force some degree of regulation upon the airline 
industry 
but in this case the judge added david is weaponless the 
attorney general has simply not satisfied his burden of 
establishing that the acquistion under the present arrangement 
would have the claimed effect on air travel in north dakota 
checchi said tuesday he had the financing in place to close the 
deal but he was awaiting a federal trade commission ruling to 
clear the way wings had asked the ftc to shorten the waiting 
period requirement that was scheduled to expire today 
more than 99 percent of the shares of nwa inc northwests 
parent have been tendered to wings which has offered 121 a share 
spaeth on tuesday acknowledged he had only a reasonable 
chance of convincing a judge to block the sale 
i would have felt bad if i hadnt tried to do something when 
i knew this thing was going to be a disaster for the state 
spaeth said at a news conference 
if wings acquires the airlines changes in northwests north 
dakota operations will be seen within months spaeth predicted 
northwest will not be able to repay its debts without some pretty 
drastic steps he said 
spaeths 15page lawsuit also seeks 50 million in damages from 
northwest for breach of contract between north dakota and the 
airline meaning the litigation will continue spaeth said 
a court order delaying the sale would have given north dakota 
some leverage to negotiate protections for the state similar to 
those obtained in 1986 when northwest acquired republic airlines 
the attorney general said

exxon shipping co has agreed to post 20 
million and meet other requirements to get its crippled tanker 
valdez into dry dock for repairs 
the oil company signed an agreement tuesday to comply with state 
restrictions as the damaged tanker underwent continued emergency 
repair work on the high seas about 56 miles offshore 
also tuesday exxon corp said it will return to the site of the 
nations worst oil spill next year but stopped short of making a 
commitment to further cleanup 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled into alaskas 
prince william sound march 24 when the exxon tanker hit a submerged 
reef 
a july 19 internal memo to exxon oil spill managers which was 
quoted in news reports monday suggested that the oil companys 
cleanup crews would leave alaska for good after shutting down for 
the winter 
but at a hastily called news conference tuesday in valdez 
alaska otto harrison general manager for exxon valdez operations 
in alaska said the memo did not rule out a resumption of cleanup 
operations 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said tuesday that 
exxons plan to halt cleanup efforts sept 15 was justified because 
little can be accomplished once cold weather arrives 
skinner previously a critic of exxons cleanup effort said in 
remarks at republican fundraising dinner in chicago he now is 
satisfied with it 
he said more than 10000 exxon employees are working 16 hours 
a day to make sure that everything that can be done will be done 
in alaska before the weather sets in this fall 
during the winter the company plans to conduct scientific 
studies in prince william sound and the gulf of alaska harrison 
said a survey team will return to alaska in the spring he added 
but he would not say whether the company would mobilize another big 
cleanup effort then 
well be here to determine what the condition is and well 
make our decision at that time in consultation with the federal 
government harrison said i cant speculate on cleanup in the 
spring until we make that determination 
in san diego the california assemblys select committee on oil 
spill prevention and response preparedness heard testimony tuesday 
on the status of the tanker valdez and exxons efforts to bring it 
into dry dock 
the state of california is in the same position as the state 
of alaska when they had the valdez accident and it must be 
corrected said assemblyman gerald felando who visited alaska in 
june 
the coast guard denied the ship entry to san diego bay on july 
10 because of an 18mile slick and other discharges the ship faced 
navigational problems as well when steel plates separated from the 
hull during the 2500mile trip from alaska 
the plates cut loose monday were dangling too deep to negotiate 
the bay 
samples from two slicks that coincided with the valdezs arrival 
in southern california waters showed traces of alaskan north slope 
crude mixed with heavy concentrations of marine life now living in 
the ships shredded cargo tanks 
but coast guard cmdr don montoro said other preliminary test 
results showed no toxicity and barely detectable hydrocarbon levels 
as far as the coast guard is concerned as long as everything 
else has been put in place i see no reason why the vessel cant 
come into port he said 
montoro has the final say on when the valdez can enter san diego 
bay en route to national steel and shipbuilding co for a 25 
million repair he said the entry would likely take place between 
friday and sunday

family 
the family was insured under a group policy that originally 
covered about 30 employees of mercedes restaurants inc which owns

including those for the quintuplets said provident spokeswoman 
jane overbeck 
the group didnt have enough members and the groups claim 
losses were taken into consideration ms overbeck said 
mrs helms said shes worried her family may have to sell their 
house and cars and take pay cuts to qualify for public assistance 
its crazy that theyd drop us now when were basically 
healthy she said the worst is over its behind us 
the babies were born prematurely on march 2 1987 and suffered 
a variety of medical problems that kept them in the hospital for 
long periods of time samantha the smallest and most frequently 
ill lived most of her first year in a hospital bed 
mrs helms said provident canceled its coverage effective aug 
1 although its contract requires it to continue paying for 
existing medical conditions for a year until a new insurer can be 
found for the children shannon meredith bevin samantha and 
benjamin 
those payments include 3000 per month for oxygen medicine and 
a home nurse for samantha and the 50 per week spent on physical

the european community today criticized 
president bushs decision to extend steel import quotas saying the 
american industry has made an impressive comeback in recent years 
bush said he took the measure in an effort to press negotiations 
to end other countries unfair trade practices and give the us 
industry more time to modernize its operations 
but the european community the 12nation trading bloc 
protested 
after an uninterrupted period of protection a renewal of 
these accords in the steel sector is not necessary considering the 
remarkable progress registered by american steel it said in a 
statement 
the industry has improved both financially and competitively 
and the world outlook for steel has brightened it said 
the community also complained the quotas have limited european 
steelmakers access to the american market but other foreign 
producers have not been restricted 
it said it wanted more information from the united states about 
bushs decision 
thomas niles the new american ambassador to the ec said we 
look forward to discussing this program with them 
in an interview he said the us action was designed to give 
more time to come up with a marketbased system for trading in 
steel 
we should try to turn steel trade into a marketdriven 
operation rather than one that is driven largely by government 
subsidies and interventions by governments in the market he said 
he suggested ec officials when they take a closer look at the 
program will see it as in their interest to join with us in this 
effort to move toward a marketbased system 
the communitys share of the american steel market tumbled from 
8 percent before the quotas to 56 percent afterward according to 
ec figures the trading bloc exported 59 million metric tons of 
steel products to the united states in 1988 
the quotas were first imposed by the reagan administration in 
1984 they were due to expire on sept 30 
they set annual limits on the amount of steel that could be 
brought into the united states from 29 countries including those 
of the european community japan south korea and brazil 
the quotas were imposed at a time the american industry was 
suffering heavy losses steel manufacturers complained foreign 
producers had an unfair advantage because of hefty government 
subsidies and import restrictions 
they now say the us import quotas have helped the giant 
industry become profitable again but they argue they still need 
time to bring their operations uptodate without competition from 
subsidized foreign products 
in his announcement tuesday bush said he had asked us trade 
representative carla hills to negotiate a 30month extension of the 
voluntary restraint agreements that limit the 29 countries to 184 
percent of the us market the european communitys share of the 
total quota is 27 percent 
bush said the restrictions will end on march 31 1992

internal revenue service inspectors allowed 
front office favorites in the agencys los angeles office to 
get away with misconduct witnesses told a house subcommittee today 
the inspection service should be separated from other functions 
of the irs to protect it from conflict of interest problems the 
witnesses told the house government operations subcommittee on 
commerce consumer and monetary affairs 
agents were reluctant to report employee conduct violations to 
the inspection service if it involved a manager or one of the front 
office favorites said chuck mccalmont a former group manager 
for the irs criminal investigative division 
the office in general was divided into the front office 
favorites and the lunatic fringe mccalmont said those who 
disagreed with the managers of the cid were labeled the lunatic 
fringe he said 
the agents also felt if the allegation involved a socalled 
lunatic fringe agent inspection with the backing of our front 
office went all out to prove the allegation mccalmont said 
frank rippetoe former inspector in the los angeles office said 
one of the managers of the inspection division had a special 
relationship with ron saranow head of the cid 
as a result when saranow became the subject of an internal 
probe because of his dealings with guess jeans makers agents were 
reluctant to talk to inspectors because they felt everything they 
said would get back to saranow said another former inspector russ 
davis 
saranow was not scheduled to testify before the subcommittee 
the former inspectors testimony came on the second day of 
hearings by the subcommittee into problems within the cid 
including allegations about saranows involvement in a dispute 
between the makers of guess and jordache jeans those allegations 
led to an expanded probe in which subcommittee investigators said 
they found the irs sometimes seeks to protect its image at the 
expense of uncovering wrongdoing by its employees 
there appears to be a longstanding institutional mindset which 
says protect the image and integrity of the irs at all cost because 
the image is vital to a voluntary compliance system which relies on 
taxpayer integrity said investigators leonard bernard and 
richard stana said tuesday 
our investigation revealed for example that on a number of 
occasions irs national office officials at the highest levels 
ignored instances of wrongdoing by senior managers in washington 
dc and elsewhere stana told the committee 
irs commissioner fred goldberg who is to testify thursday said 
in prepared testimony he disagrees with the investigators 
characterization of the agency as being more concerned about image 
than possible internal wrongdoing 
the public knows that we are a large agency and that we will 
make mistakes he said i believe our image is enhanced not 
tarnished when the public knows that we aggressively investigate 
and punish wrongdoing by irs employees 
saranow was approached in 1985 by the halfowners of guess with 
information about alleged tax fraud by their business partners who 
were the owners of jordache enterprises said bernard and stana 
the subcommittee investigators said the guess owners 
information was of dubious value and questionable quality but 
saranow pursued an aggressive twoyear investigation of jordache 
without turning up any criminal violation 
the investigators said the guess owners exercised unusual 
influence over ronald saranow by cultivating a strong personal and 
social relationship with him and by offering him a sixfigure 
salary 
the guess owners paul george armand and maurice marciano of 
los angeles denied offering a job to saranow who has retired 
from the irs and was never disciplined or prosecuted 
another case involved anthony langone the southeast assistant 
regional commissioner for criminal investigation based in 
washington who the investigators said improperly used government 
travel funds to maintain a relationship with a woman in atlanta 
bernard and stana said langones case was not aggressively 
pursued by the irs until two years after it had been reported 
several times by different individuals the case now has been 
turned over to the justice department 
ellen murphy director of public affairs for the irs said the 
agency would have no comment about specific cases because of 
privacy laws covering taxes

hooker corp owner of retail and real 
estate holdings in australia and the united states wednesday 
applied for a provisional liquidator after failure of a financial 
rescue 
the sydneybased holding company owes the equivalent of more 
than 12 billion to 42 banks which on tuesday refused to grant 
the company any more credit forcing hooker to seek a liquidator to 
take charge of the company 
a collapse of hooker which owns b altman amp co bonwit teller 
plus other us department stores and shopping malls would be one 
of australias biggest corporate crashes 
the company said it asked the supreme court of new south wales 
to appoint john harkness of the accounting firm peat marwick 
hungerfords as the provisional liquidator 
hooker said its directors believe their action in standing 
aside will resolve the impasse with the banks and is therefore in 
the best interests of employees creditors and shareholders 
the provisional liquidator will have wide powers over all 
aspects of the business hooker said including the sale or 
retention of assets raising additional funds if required and 
employment 
directors will fully assist in facilitating the changeover of 
the companys affairs into the hands of the provisional liquidator 
hooker said 
hookers assets totaled about 18 billion and its liabilities 
were 14 billion as of march 31 
in the united states besides b altman amp co and bonwit teller 
hooker controls sakowitz inc parisian inc and merksamer jewelers 
inc it has interests in shopping malls commercial real estate and 
house building 
people familiar with hookers us operations said that the 
first national bank of chicago has started foreclosure proceedings 
on hookers richland fashion mall in columbia sc the wall 
street journal reported thursday 
j frank haasbeek president of lj hooker corp the us 
subsidiary of hooker was unavailable for comment on the report 
the company in may announced plans to sell assets to reduce 
debt that followed cashflow problems in the united states that 
caused hooker to fall behind in payments to several apparel and 
other suppliers 
in june hookers financial difficulties appeared to become more 
serious and the company hired richard grellman of peat marwick as a 
financial adviser the company conceded it had a liquidity problem 
and said some banks had cut credit lines directors blamed rising 
interest rates an economic slowdown a weaker australian dollar 
and adverse publicity for the problems 
hookers 42 australian and foreign lenders had agreed until 
tuesdays announcement to forgo loan repayments and to keep credit 
lines open while the company worked out a plan to sell more assets 
under controlled conditions rather than in a firesale 
george herscu who owns about 50 percent of hooker resigned as 
chief executive on july 11 but has stayed on as chairman

a cornell university graduate student was 
indicted today on charges stemming from creation of a computer 
virus that infected as many as 6000 computers in a nationwide 
network used by universities and the military 
robert tappan morris was indicted by a federal grand jury in 
syracuse ny on one count of accessing without authorization at 
least six computers in which the federal government has an interest 
morris who has been criticized by a cornell university 
commission that investigated last novembers computer virus 
incident is the first person to be charged under the computer 
fraud and abuse act of 1986 the justice department said in a 
statement released here 
morris who is on leave from cornell could face a possible 
fiveyear sentence and a 250000 fine if convicted of the charge 
he could also be required to pay restitution to universities and 
military bases where computers were paralyzed by the virus 
thomas a guidoboni morris attorney said his client accepts 
this event as a step toward the final resolution of this matter

15 billion 
excluding onetime events and the net effect of bottling 
acquisitions operating profits still rose 32 percent and sales 
rose 9 percent

president bush declaring the the best way to 
deal with energy problems is to let our market economy work 
today signed legislation ending the last vestiges of price controls 
on natural gas 
the president used the white house signing ceremony to reiterate 
his call for increased domestic oil exploration and drilling to 
curb the countrys reliance on oil imports 
the bottom line is a strong domestic drilling and producing 
business is essential for the national security of the united 
states of america bush said 
he said energy secretary james watkins will develop a detailed 
national energy strategy in the coming months to deal with future 
energy requirements 
watkins was to present a general outline of the administrations 
energy policy at a congressional hearing it is expected to include 
emphasis on expanded reliance on nuclear power and a call for more 
oil exploration along coastal areas 
in signing the natural gas decontrol bill which was passed by 
congress earlier this year the president signaled the end to 35 
years of price control on the fuel 
full natural gas decontrol is not expected to affect retail 
prices significantly because most gas already is selling below the 
official ceilings however critics maintain that full decontrol 
will set the stage for price increases in the 1990s 
the administrations energy strategy was expected to include 
renewed efforts to win public acceptance for an expanded nuclear 
power industry and a call for more oil exploration including along 
coastal areas 
offshore oil drilling has raised widespread concerns because of 
the devastating damage and pollution caused by the massive oil 
spill from the exxon valdez tanker in alaskas prince william sound 
in march 
legislation is advancing in congress that would extend a 
moratorium on such drilling to vast offshore stretches from new 
england to alaska the bush administration has opposed any such 
moratorium extension 
shortly after he became energy secretary watkins ordered the 
department to develop an action plan for dealing with expected 
energy needs including more accurate estimates on future energy 
requirements 
calls for a revised national energy policy have intensified amid 
falling us petroleum production and increasing demand at the 
same time there has been increasing pressure from 
environmentalists to curb the use of fossil fuels because they are 
a chief contributor to global warming 
deputy energy secretary henson moore has said the department had 
no preconceived notions about the focus of a national energy 
policy but he suggested an effort would be made to revive the 
nuclear industry by making nuclear power more acceptable and that 
oil companies could be given more latitude to explore for oil on 
federal lands or in promising offshore areas 
moore acknowledged the department must assemble more indepth 
information on energy needs that is viewed as credible by producers 
and consumers alike

wheat futures prices rose while corn and soybean 
futures closed narrowly mixed wednesday in quiet trading on the 
chicago board of trade 
analysts attributed most of the buying in all the markets to 
perceptions that prices were exaggeratedly low after recent 
declines 
selling in the corn and soybean pits was based largely on ideas 
that recent rains in the midwest had improved crop conditions 
gerald zusel manager of exchange floor operations with balfour 
maclaine corp a futures brokerage firm said that with more than 
half the corn crop now past the sensitive pollination phase 
traders had begun to shift their focus to the soybean crop which 
is nearing its critical flowering and podsetting stage 
itll be pretty difficult to damage the corn crop from here on 
in but weather can still be an important factor for the beans 
zusel said if we get normaltype temperatures and fair coverage 
by showers on a weekly basis over the next four to five weeks the 
bean crop will be made too 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 388 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 229 a bushel 
oats were cent lower to 1 cents higher with september at 142 
a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with august 
at 662 a bushel

the city gave final approval today for ibm 
corp to build a 26story office building on the desirable inner 
harbor section where buildings were limited to 17 stories in 
exchange for a payment of 700000 
ibm also agreed to maintain public spaces at the twoacre site 
a commitment valued at 300000 a year and donate 45000 to a 
fund to maintain public art 
the final approval came from the city board of estimates which 
had to approve any change in the restrictions 
the city council passed a bill last month that would lift the 
current 175foot height limit in the area that was part of the 
standards established under a urban renewal plan in the late 1960s 
said albert m copp president of center cityinner harbor 
development inc the nonprofit company handles development 
management for the city of baltimore 
the 50 million office tower would house the expanded 
headquarters of t rowe price associates as well as ibms baltimore 
offices and other office space 
city officials said negotiations began recently between ibm and 
the city because the price of the tract 142 million when the 
city sold it to ibm in 1970 reflected restrictions placed on the 
site if the restrictions are lifted the value of the land 
increases and the city deserves more for it city officials said 
lessening zoning restrictions in exchange for cash or public 
amenities is an arrangement used in many major cities it has come 
under fire particularly in new york where critics say the benefits 
do not compensate for the problems caused by overbuilding

lee iacocca the driver behind the 
restoration of chrysler corp and statue of liberty the irreverent 
executive whos done his own ads and gueststarred on primetime 
tv is content these days to sit back a little and take it easy 
letting others run the business 
but when it comes to key decisions at chrysler the 64yearold 
chairman is ready to assert himself over subordinates with 
undisputed authority 
i try not to get in their hair but i do iacocca said in an 
interview im trying to stay out the best i can but right now 
weve got a lot of tough tough decisions to make how do you 
prioritize 
company executives are confronting several problems a declining 
market share a slowing economy the relentless competition from 
japan and now korea improving the mix of vehicle models and 
allaying investor concerns 
chryslers secondquarter earnings are due monday analysts 
expect a slight increase over the 3204 million the nations no 3 
automaker made during the same period last year but they hedge the 
prediction because chrysler has spent so much on incentives to sell 
its cars and trucks 
through july 20 chryslers car and truck sales were running 8 
percent behind the pace of last year a worse showing than its big 
three rivals general motors corp and ford motor co 
theres little doubt the total market demand this year will fall 
well below the 158 million vehicles sold last year one of the 
best in industry history 
iacocca estimates sales between 135 million and 14 million 
vehicles this year the lowest estimate of the big three chairmen 
gms roger smith predicts about 15 million and fords donald 
petersen reckons about 147 million 
ive been saying this for a lot of years and its the old 
story ill have to be right one year were going to have to have 
a pause a recession iacocca said i thought it would be 
mid88 to mid89 i think i was off by a good solid year 
he predicted a tough time for the next 12 to 18 months but said 
chrysler the auto industry and the us economy are in better 
shape now than they were before the last big industry slump in the 
early 1980s 
we were worst of the three at that time but they gm and 
ford werent very far behind if this would have kept up he said 
in a move thats been written into the business history books a 
sickly chrysler beseeched the federal government for help in the 
late 1970s and eventually secured 15 billion in loan guarantees 
to survive 
under iacoccas guidance chrysler repaid the loans seven years 
early and he frequently talks about that with a mix of humor and 
bluntness 
when he first disclosed chryslers earlyrepayment plan at the 
national press club in washington in july 1983 iacocca told 
reporters we at chrysler borrow money the old fashioned way we 
pay it back 
nonetheless the company is still a bit wobbly and faces 
significant questions about its longterm direction 
measured by sales chrysler is becoming a truck company through 
the first six months of the year it sold more trucks than cars 
partly because of the trendsetting minivans the dodge caravan 
and the plymouth voyager and jeeps which chrysler got buy 
purchasing american motors corp in august 1987 
chrysler commands more than 55 percent of the minivan market 
which iacocca says will be impossible to hold because of 
competition from imports and a new line of gm minivans 
iacocca recalled when he introduced minivans in 1983 i 
remember some wiseass at ford said they are on dope over there 
they said it was a little nothing it was sort of a fad who would 
want a little van when they could get a big van 
what they forgot is that you werent going after the van or 
wagon owner you were going after the fourdoor sedan owner and 
theres 5 million of those a year 
whether theyre minivan buyers or not iacocca goes after them 
all many times personally 
since nov 1 1978 when he was fired as president of ford and 
went to chrysler with the same title hes become synonymous with 
chrysler 
iacoccas contract with chrysler runs through 1991 and he isnt 
saying whether hell stick around thereafter or want to 
ive got to do a lot in the next 2 years he said i 
always thought that compared with the japanese we put the good 
guys out 65 and over thats when theyre just coming into their 
own in japan i thing it is stupid the way we take assets and throw 
them out 
besides salary bonuses and stockoption rights iacocca will 
receive 225000 shares of chrysler common stock in 1990 and 1991 
worth at todays prices about 6 million 
he has withstood the wrath of the united auto workers union and 
others in the past for multimilliondollar annual earnings that 
critics have called obscene and unjustified the chairman not only 
hasnt apologized hes called his compensation the prize that 
comes with the task of saving a big company 
there is little iacocca wont do to create a friendly image for 
himself and chrysler 
hes appeared in television ads did a guest spot on miami 
vice and said in newspaper ads did we screw up you bet we 
did when the federal government nailed the company for odometer 
fraud 
his personal life has snared attention too he was involved in a 
wellpublicized divorce from his second wife peggy whom he 
married after the death of his first wife mary he nearly was 
drafted for president in 1988 and in perhaps one of the proudest 
efforts by the son of italian immigrants iacocca spearheaded the 
restoration of the statue of liberty 
like many of his other projects controversy swirled around the 
multimillion dollar rejuvenation of americas freedom symbol in new 
york harbor 
like other ventures iacocca said he learned from it in four 
years of the project iacocca became fed up with the infighting and 
red tape obstacles lobbed at him by washington bureaucrats 
i decided how would you like to go down there and do that 
for a living on everything so maybe its the best lesson i ever 
got he said if it hadnt maybe id have been stupid enough 
to run for president

of continued sluggish economic growth 
the dollar lost about 1 japanese yen and 1 west german 
pfennigs while the cost of a british pound in dollars rose 2 cents 
the federal reserve failed for a second day to drain reserves 
from the banking system an indication it was seeking to lower 
interest rates and stimulate the economy 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks fell sharply to 8 percent from 9116 percent on tuesday 
however dealers said the sharp drop was mainly the result of 
windowdressing by major banks at the end of the twoweek 
settlement period when they report their balance sheets to the fed 
there was also speculation that thursdays report on 
secondquarter gross national product and subsequent reports 
would confirm evidence of slow growth said john lynam a vice 
president in the new york office of security pacific national bank 
britains pound sterling was boosted by a report that the 
nations trade gap grew less than expected in june

crude oil futures prices slipped to a 5month low on the new 
york mercantile exchange wednesday the fourth straight day of 
declining prices in a market weakened by slack demand for gasoline 
and a dearth of bullish factors 
on other markets precious metals advanced grains and soybeans 
were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents lower to 3 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in september at 1830 
a barrel the lowest nearmonth settlement since march 7 heating 
oil futures finished 07 cent to 17 cent higher with august at 
4949 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 43 cent to 84 cent 
lower with august at 5134 cents a gallon 
tuesdays weekly american petroleum institute report which 
showed a 14millionbarrel drawdown in us supplies of crude was 
initially perceived as slightly supportive 
but analysts said closer examination of the report showed an 
increase of more than 3 million barrels in the gulf coast region 
an indication that demand for gasoline is not keeping pace with 
crudeoil production 
the report also showed overall gasoline production running at a 
rate of 73 million barrels a day 
thats a lot especially given that demand seems to be 
slacking off a bit said jerry samuels an analyst in new york 
with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the factors that contributed to a sharp rise in oil prices 
earlier this year opec production cutbacks tightening supplies 
and labor tensions in the north sea oilfields have faded or been 
overshadowed by the downturn in gasoline demand and traders are 
increasingly prone to selling as the market moves lower 
crude oil for september delivery traded as low as 1827 on 
tuesday analysts said a drop below 1825 would likely spark a new 
round of heavy selling 
gold and silver futures advanced slightly on new yorks 
commodity exchange in reaction to a weaker dollar gold settled 90 
cents to 120 higher with august at 375 a troy ounce silver was 
15 cents to 16 cents higher with september at 5275 a troy ounce 
wheat futures prices rose while corn and soybean futures 
finished narrowly mixed in quiet trading on the chicago board of 
trade 
analysts attributed much of the buying to perceptions that 
prices were exaggeratedly low after recent declines 
selling in the corn and soybean pits was based largely on ideas 
that recent rains in the midwest had improved crop conditions 
gerald zusel manager of exchange floor operations with balfour 
maclaine corp a futures brokerage firm said that with more than 
half the corn crop now past the sensitive pollination phase 
traders had begun to shift their focus to the soybean crop which 
is nearing its critical flowering and podsetting stage 
itll be pretty difficult to damage the corn crop from here on 
in but weather can still be an important factor for the beans 
zusel said 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with september at 388 
a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to cent higher with september at 
229 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent lower with september 
at 142 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to cent higher 
with august at 661 a bushel 
pork belly futures made new lifeofcontract lows across the 
board on the chicago mercantile exchange reflecting lower prices 
for fresh bellies deteriorating demand and increased production 
live cattle settled 15 cent lower to 40 cent higher with 
august at 7277 cents a pound feeder cattle were 07 cent lower to 
30 cent higher with august at 8352 cents a pound live hogs were 
18 cent lower to 15 cent higher with august at 4592 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 33 cent to 85 cent lower with 
august at 2710 cents a pound

chrysler corp executives and 
engineers are wondering if there is a viper in the companys 
future an executive said wednesday 
a key element in whether the viper a muscular twoseater 
sports car ever sees the showroom floor could be a new 
computeraided design system which chrysler says slashes the time 
between design and assembly 
the nations no 3 automaker plans to announce within six months 
if it will produce the viper which snared a lot of attention on 
this winters carshow circuit 
the car a low sleek sports car billed as having a big v10 
engine could come to production in as little as a year and a half 
said thomas gale chryslers vice president for product design 
the viper introduced at the winter auto shows was a devoid of 
the pricey electronics loaded into other twoseaters such as the 
nissan 300zx mazda recently used a similar concept for its 
lowpriced limited production miata convertible which has been 
met with torrid demand 
gale supports the viper chrysler motors corp president robert 
lutz wants to build it and chairman lee iacocca said in a recent 
interview that he leaned toward producing the car 
even the beancounters here are saying weve got to find a way 
to build it iacocca said 
but theres a roadblock to the viper timing 
chrysler is developing an array of engines and a new car 
platform for the 1990s but before then chrysler officials are 
predicting a softening of the auto market 
that could force chrysler and other automakers to look more 
toward their breadandbutter cars and away from anything exotic 
like the viper 
one way to pare costs of developing a new vehicle like the viper 
and to make it more attractive to executives is to cut the time 
between the drawing board and assembly line 
gale said wednesday a newly installed computerdriven design 
tool could slice design time from about a year to eight months 
while it was impossible to tell now it could cut as much as 25 
percent off the time to bring a totally new car to market dropping 
the period to three years he said 
the tool called the conceptual design and rendering system 
began work at chryslers studios late last month its first project 
was the viper 
like other computers the system gives a designer a computer 
generated threedimensional depiction of a car the roof line or 
the shape of windows and doors can be changed on the screen saving 
modeling time 
the difference with the new system gale said is that it also 
includes specific mathematical measurements that can be translated 
by a machine used to cut a fullsize clay model 
the mathematical information also can be sent to other computers 
in engineering and manufacturing divisions where feasibility 
studies can be performed quickly and changes can be recommended 
for example if an engineer looks at a design and determines 
that it wont work because of aerodynamics the computer model can 
be returned to the design studio for alterations 
the system was developed by evans amp sutherland of salt lake 
city the company has talked about the system to other companies 
including ford motor co and general motors corp said eamps 
chairman david c evans 
in the past its been a little like a relay race gale said 
of the process in which the designer gave plans to an engineer who 
altered them and sent them to a manufacturer to determine if 
tooling could be made to assemble the vehicle 
were changing the way the race is run gale said

the next time the office copier breaks 
jams or refuses to cooperate pause a moment before delivering that 
swift kick to the machines side 
you may want to aim your frustration at the paper the more 
likely cause of your grief 
the paper that goes into the copier and some times doesnt come 
out probably is responsible for more repair visits by copier 
technicians than anything else 
its the biggest problem because its the one thing no one has 
control over said robert sostilio a copier industry analyst at 
dataquest inc a san jose califbased market research company 
he said virtually every copier manufacturer sells its own brand 
of paper to ensure smooth copier performance dozens of other 
companies also peddle copier paper 
the problem is whats good in miami may not be good in 
minnesota and whats good on a machine that makes eight copies a 
minute may be miserable on a machine that makes 100 copies a 
minute sostilio said 
enter xerox corp the leading seller of copiers and its paper 
technology division where paper scientists work at engineering 
what the company claims is the finest copier paper in the world 
they expose paper to oppressive humidity milehigh altitudes 
and meticulous examination they say things like theres a whole 
anatomy to a piece of paper 
xerox is the leading distributor of cutsheet copy paper and the 
only company that sells copy paper worldwide last year the 
company sold more than 600000 tons 
however the companys stronghold is under attack partly 
because of new technology that xerox actually invented in 1977 
its called the laser printer a machine that in many ways is 
similar to a copier 
a laser printer uses a concentrated beam of light to convert 
electronic data into a printed document a copier uses a flash of 
light mirrors and lenses to reproduce an existing document 
many paper suppliers and copier makers have started selling 
paper at a slightly higher price thats designed specifically for 
use in laser printers and xerox has taken exception 
you dont need special paper for a laser printer thats not 
how people should be making their decisions about what paper to 
use said stephen galloway business planning manager for xeroxs 
paper operation 
the company recently redesigned storage cartons package 
wrappers and reamend labels to emphasize their multipurpose 
applications the package now says the most versatile paper you 
can use from copying to electronic printing 
you can use any one of our papers in any machine thats what 
we want people to know galloway said so if youre sending out 
an interoffice memo and printing it on a laser prnter theres no 
reason to use more expensive paper use basic copy paper 
xerox says it goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure paper 
quality 
papercheckers riffle through sample reams of shipments from 
paper plants around the world scrutinizing possible defects dirt 
and dust 
xerox uses all kinds of paper manufacturers from a small mill 
in portugal to some of the largest mills in japan and the united 
states and every supplier must meet the same specifications 
probably the most elegant paper is made in switzerland egypt 
probably produces the poorest locally produced paper said 
dominic sherony manager of paper and special products 
the company has about 50 major suppliers and hundreds of minor 
suppliers who must undergo an approval process that can take up to 
three years 
paper scientists like gary chapin and john viavattine use all 
kinds of measuring devices to determine how smooth it is 
unless you analytically examine a piece of our paper you 
probably wouldnt know why its the optimal paper for copiers 
said viavattine as he turned on a machine he designed that 
collects dust from cartons of paper 
paper dust in copiers is the latest paper problem viavattine 
and chapin have been trying to solve 
because todays copiers can spit out 135 copies a minute and in 
many places theyre running around the clock xerox has found that 
the accumulation of dust has become a major problem 
xerox spends more money on service calls just going out and 
vacuuming out machines all because of dust said viavattine 
the company is examining ways of improving the way its suppliers 
cut the sheets of paper at the mill as one way of trimming dust 
from a ream of paper 
the paper laboratory also includes devices that can peel four 
very thin layers from a single sheet of paper measure the 
roughness of a piece of paper or what kind of wood its made from 
you probably didnt know that paper has a top and a bottom 
viavattine said but it does and thats important thats why we 
put arrows on the package to make sure people load the paper 
correctly

domestic heating oil for august delivery meanwhile rose 07 
cent to 4949 cents a gallon and other contracts also gained 
gasoline prices began deteriorating last week after an american 
petroleum institute report that showed inventories were building 
reflecting a softening in demand according to analysts 
although this weeks lower api statistics were perceived by many 
traders as bullish for the market selling of gasoline futures 
remained strong 
the market didnt like gasoline even with with lower stocks 
said bob baker analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
even though they were down they were still well above a year ago 
although last year they were at an alltime low the perception in 
the market is that they still might be too high 
gasoline supplies fell by 15 million barrels to 2213 million 
barrels in the week ending july 21 according to the api report 
inventories remained 134 million barrels ahead of last year 
however 
the api report also showed crude oil stocks fell 14 million 
barrels to 3305 million in the week and were down by 192 million 
barrels over last year 
heating oil inventories were down by 800000 barrels to 1094 
million for the week and by 78 million from last year 
andrew lebow senior broker and analyst with edampf man 
international futures inc said falling gasoline prices continued 
to put pressure on the crude market the api report he said was 
considered neutral for the market 
in addition he said reports that some members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries are still producing 
above expectations are keeping crude prices soft

it took the california raisins less than three 
years to go from classic motown to michael 
thats michael as in michael jackson who helped create and 
choreograph an ensemble of hip animated clay raisins including 
one modeled on himself for the latest california raisin 
commercial 
in the new ad michael raisin and six backups perform a 
jacksonesque version of the motown classic i heard it through 
the grapevine the 1960sera tune has been played in styles 
ranging from the original version to rock and gospel in raisin ads 
for the past three years 
the raisins including a rapper called brad and a punker called 
flash appear before a screaming audience of animated 
strawberries bananas and other pieces of fruit 
all of the characters are products of the patented claymation 
process from will vinton productions of portland ore 
the new ad also features some jacksonlike pyrotechnics and a 
surprising twist at the close 
the 67second commercial starts running on friday in 5700 movie 
houses across the country sixty and 30second versions of the ad 
are to start running on network television in midseptember 
will vinton the chairman of the production house that bears his 
name said jackson had expressed admiration for the raisin 
characters while he and jackson worked on a segment for jacksons 
recent moonwalker home video 
during a telephone conversation in march vinton said they 
discussed the possibility of creating some fresh raisin characters 
for a new ad 
bob phinney director of advertising for the raisin board in 
fresno calif said he wasnt at all interested in going out and 
getting a celebrity endorsement from anybody but was intrigued by 
jacksons ideas for the raisin campaign 
vinton said he taped jackson in los angeles doing a dance 
routine for his raisin character and took the tape back to oregon 
where the clay models were built and manipulated for the ad 
vinton has helped create a half dozen commercials for the raisin 
advisory board the first debuted in october 1986 with raisins 
singing a reworded version of the soulful grapevine song while 
dancing in a congaline across a tabletop 
the research firm video storyboard tests inc said its surveys 
over the past two years have found the raisin ads the most popular 
campaign on television 
phinney declined to say what jackson was paid for his 
participation in the project saying only that money was never a 
consideration jackson reportedly made 5 million two years ago 
for a fourpart ad campaign for pepsi 
the raisin board will spend about 11 million on this years 
campaign including production and media costs he said that is up 
from about 9 million last year 
in addition he said the raisin board has received about 6 
million in royalties from sales of about 500 million in licensed 
products based on the raisin characters which will soon be joined 
by michael raisin and other characters from the new commerecials

autoworkers voting wednesday in tennessee were 
deciding not only whether or not the united auto workers union 
would represent them but also the course of the unions broader 
future according to labor experts 
the vote at nissan motor corps car and truck assembly plant in 
smyrna tenn was viewed as critical for the union which was 
attempting to organize a plant in a righttowork state 
it also may foreshadow the results of the drive by the uaw 
which has seen membership shrink by 33 percent in the last 10 years 
to organize the widespread mostly unorganized automobile 
supplier industry 
whats at stake isnt 2400 nissan workers but rather all the 
parts that are coming into that plant which also go to ford gm 
and chrysler plants said harley shaiken of the university of 
california in san diego a loss here is going to make it very 
difficult 
if they win they are well positioned to take on the other 
transplants and to take on the nonunion auto suppliers 
particularly the japanese suppliers said shaiken who has 
watched the uaw for years 
dan cornfield a vanderbilt university professor of sociology 
who focuses on labor relations also said the broader effect of the 
vote could be among the supplier industries 
a uaw victory cornfield said could possibly lead to further 
unionization of other workers especially the supplier plants and 
in other industries 
its not the first time that the uaw has tried to organize a 
japanese transplant a us assembly plant operated by a 
subsidiary of a japanese automaker 
in march 1986 on the eve of a federal hearing to set a date for 
a representation election at honda motor corps marysville ohio 
plant the uaw withdrew its election petition 
they pulled it prior to it coming to a vote because they 
didnt want an embarrassing vote shaiken said the honda 
campaign had some problems 
here with smyrna theyve apparently run an effective 
campaign 
in addition to the honda plant in marysville the uaw still has 
not organized toyota motor corps assembly plant in georgetown ky 
the union represents workers at mazda motor corps plant in 
flat rock mich south of detroit the new united motor 
manufacturing inc plant in fremont calif a joint venture 
between toyota and general motors corp and the diamondstar 
motors corp plant in normal ill a joint venture between 
chrysler corp and mitsubishi motor corp 
each of the big three automakers has been organized for years 
intensifying the importance of the transplants is their growth 
in the us auto industry 
nissan has announced an expansion of its smyrna facility that 
will put production at about 400000 vehicles a year by 1992 honda 
is opening a new assembly plant in east liberty ohio later this 
year which will add capacity for about 150000 more cars it can 
make about 365000 vehicles a year at marysville 
in 1991 ford motor co and nissan expect to begin producing a 
minivan at a joint venture in avon lake ohio 
if honda sells its entire capacity in the united states and 
chryslers sales continue to fall shaiken said honda may tend 
to displace chrysler in the early 1990s as the no 3 automaker 
imagine a nonunion chrysler he said

walt disney co stock rose sharply 
wednesday amid speculation that the entertainment kingdom might be 
the next takeover target of paramount communications inc 
disney would not comment other than to say it had no information 
to explain the rise 
the stock up more than 7 at one point from tuesdays close 
finished up 475 at 10912 a share in new york stock exchange 
trading 
a group led by sid bass one of the fort worth texas family of 
investors owns about 16 percent of disneys shares but that 
holding has been described as longterm and amicable there was no 
comment from the bass group wednesday 
the bass family in 1984 spent 333 million and took a 25 percent 
share of disney stock to help the company ward off hostile takeover 
attempts by financiers saul steinberg of new york and irwin jacobs 
of minneapolis 
however there has been market speculation that the bass group 
might sell its holdings to paramount which on monday dropped its 
122 billion hostile bid for time inc 
new yorkbased paramount which built itself into a media and 
entertainment conglomerate largely through acquisitions indicated 
monday that it would pursue other acquisitions or ventures after 
losing a delaware court battle seeking to block times acquisition 
of warner communications inc 
but some analysts consider disney which in may reported its 
profit for the first half of the fiscal year was up 35 percent at 
2973 million an unlikely target for a takeover bid 
considered by some to be a more likely trigger for the 
speculation was anticipation of a third quarter report that 
analysts estimate would show earnings of 140 a share compared 
with 120 a share for the same period last year

eastern airlines withdrew efforts to terminate its 
pilots contract wednesday saying it has already lowered pilot 
costs and saw its request as a possible barrier to settlement with 
the pilots 
the union on strike since march 4 called easterns decision an 
admission by eastern it couldnt gain us bankruptcy court 
approval of proposed cost cuts 
they realized they couldnt win said pilots union spokesman 
hank weber they were trying to use the bankruptcy court as a 
vehicle to change the contract and impose new work rules 
eastern answered that its recruiting program has enabled the 
company to achieve the necessary cuts in pilot costs even though 
eastern is offering new pilots 28000 a year very high within the 
airline industry for new hires company spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
said eastern is saving money compared with the salaries of veteran 
pilots now on strike the company says they were earning 75000 to 
100000 
eastern had proposed a 10 percent salary reduction for six 
months and another 5 percent salary cut for another six months as 
well as delays in vacation the company said filing for a contract 
change through the court was seen as a way of finding a settlement 
to prolonged labor differences with its pilots 
however since the filing last month eastern and its pilots 
have held intensive negotiations under the auspices of bankruptcy 
examiner david shapiro 
the pilots union earlier this month asked that the yearold 
talks be declared at an impasse and the national mediation board 
take over easterns announcement wednesday apparently means the 
talks could be referred to the mediation board 
the eastern announcement underlines the unusual situation its 
pilots contract is in the pilots officially are not striking but 
honoring the picket lines of easterns machinists union which 
struck march 4 after 18 months of federal mediation failed 
the pilots are still governed by the railway labor act which 
requires them to go through federal mediation before striking 
further complicating the contract is easterns march 9 filing for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization which gives that court 
jurisdiction 
eastern meanwhile is pushing ahead with hiring of new pilots 
and under current us supreme court precedent doesnt have to give 
veteran pilots jobs already filled by new hires even if the strike 
were settled 
six years ago texas air was able to jettison contractual 
obligations to pilots as continental airlines emerged from 
bankruptcy proceedings but bankruptcy laws were changed after that 
to require more careful review before contractual promises could be 
left behind 
eastern announced tuesday that it is continuing to boost its 
daily schedule adding 59 percent more flights aug 1 with help 
from sister carrier continental 
eastern which struggled to fly 100 flights daily in the first 
weeks after its unions struck said it will increase its july 
schedule of 225 daily flights to 350 on aug 1 and to 390 flights 
on aug 15 
the miamibased carrier on tuesday announced leasing of five 
planes and crews from continental also owned by texas air corp 
to help with the august schedule 
eastern has said it can rebuild without the unions and plans to 
build up by years end to 800 flights compared to nearly 1100 
daily before the strike 
most of easterns creditors in us bankruptcy court have 
expressed approval of the companys rebuilding plans while the 
unions are backing a buyout bid by chicago options trader joseph 
ritchie 
frank causey eastern vice president for flight operations said 
325 veteran eastern pilots have crossed union picket lines 260 
pilot recruits have completed training and 680 recruits are still 
in training eastern said 107 of the recruits enrolled this week 
and that there were 25 pilot crossovers monday and tuesday the 
most in such a short time since the strikes beginning 
only about 200 of the 3600 air line pilots association members 
crossed picket lines at the strikes beginning 
we consider this as only a dribble alpa spokesman ron cole 
eastern gave it its best shot last week given the huge media 
blitz the picket line is still solid

federal officials are investigating the 
theft of thousands of microfilm copies of us patents from at 
least a dozen research universities officials said wednesday 
librarians at the university of massachusetts virginia 
commonwealth university and the university of maryland first 
discovered parts of their files missing in late june university 
officials said 
about a dozen fbi offices across the united states are looking 
into the thefts said paul cavanagh a spokesman for the fbis 
boston office 
one of the things we are still considering is whether a 
violation of federal statutes is involved he said 
the missing files fall between the years 1968 through 1988 said 
prudence adler a spokeswoman for the washingtonbased association 
for research libraries 
theres a very deliberate pattern they are not going in and 
repeating what has been stolen previously she said each 
institution is losing different files 
ms adler said the files which are open to the public are 
designed to help individual inventors and corporations check 
whether they are duplicating previous lines of research 
the question we all have is why someone would steal this 
material said prudence adler a spokeswoman for the 
washingtonbased association for research libraries 
through last week at least 2000 reels of microfilm have been 
reported missing from the dozen universities she said a 20year 
collection of patent records from 1968 through 1988 consists of 
3126 reels of microfilm and costs about 100000 she said 
other schools missing patent microfilms include rice university 
the university of new mexico the university of utah georgia tech 
texas aampm the university of texas the university of idaho ohio 
state university and the university of michigan she said

texaco inc reported a 21 percent drop in its secondquarter 
earnings wednesday due partly to lower production and refinery 
slowdowns while shell oil co and occidental petroleum corp said 
their profits rose during the period 
higher crude oil prices benefited all three companies as did a 
steep rise in gasoline and other oil product sales prices but 
those gains were partially offset by dwindling production 
texacos net income fell to 366 million or 139 a share from 
464 million or 191 a share in the comparable 1988 period 
secondquarter 1988 results included a restructuring gain of 225 
million or 92 cents a share from the sale of its west german 
subsidiary 
quarterly revenue declined 10 percent to 84 billion from 93 
billion a year ago 
occidental petroleums earnings rose about 4 percent to 80 
million or 29 cents a share from 77 million or 34 cents a share 
a year earlier the decline in pershare earnings reflected an 
increase in the average number of common shares outstanding the 
company said 
occidental said quarterly earnings reflected extraordinary 
losses of 4 million in 1989 and 10 million in 1988 from the early 
payment of debt 
revenue rose 7 percent to 51 billion from 47 billion in the 
yearearlier quarter 
shell said second quarter earnings soared 61 percent to 440 
million from 274 million a year ago revenue totaled 59 billion 
vs 54 billion a 9 percent gain the company does not release 
pershare figures because it is a subsidiary of royal dutch shell 
based in the netherlands which reports its consolidated earnings 
separately 
higher crude prices benefited texacos exploration and 
production business while a steep rise in gasoline prices early in 
the quarter helped refining and marketing businesses 
but those gains were offset partly by declines in foreign 
exploration and production earnings stemming from last years 
platform explosion in the north sea and the sale of texaco 
subsidiaries in canada and west germany 
occidentals piper alpha oil platform off aberdeen scotland 
exploded and burned july 6 1988 in the north seas worst oil 
disaster the platform was destroyed and 167 men were killed 
texaco and occidental were two of four companies operating the 
field where production has been delayed since the accident 
texaco also said its refining margins were reduced by a 
softening of gasoline prices toward the close of the quarter and 
scheduled maintenance at three refineries 
for the first six months of the year texacos net income more 
than doubled to 1821 billion or 719 a share from 734 
million or 302 a share a year earlier firsthalf results 
included a gain of 119 billion from the sale of its texaco canada 
inc subsidiary 
revenue in the six months rose to 181 billion from 1798 
billion a year ago 
texaco based in white plains ny is the nations third 
largest oil concern behind exxon corp and mobil corp 
occidental based in los angeles said the north sea accident 
reduced its exploration and production earnings but that was 
partially offset by higher crude oil prices 
occidental said coal division earnings tumbled to 1 million 
from 3 million due to strikes by miners in kentucky and tennessee 
who joined a wildcat sympathy strike in sympathy with a walkout 
against pittston coal groups operations in virginia and west 
virginia 
net income in the first half declined 23 percent to 147 
million or 53 cents a share from 190 million or 85 cents a 
share a year ago 
revenue rose 11 percent to 102 billion from 92 billion in 
the 1988 period 
houstonbased shell the nations sixthlargest oil company 
said firsthalf earnings totaled 801 million up 21 percent from 
663 million a year ago revenue rose to 11 billion 5 percent 
higher than 105 billion in the 1988 period 
strong demand and higher sales prices for chemical products 
produced record earnings in the chemicals division while an 
increase in foreign crude oil production helped offset declines in 
domestic production shell said 
maxus energy corp reported net income of 36 million in the 
second quarter compared with a loss of 96 million a year earlier 
earnings per share for the second quarter amounted to less than one 
cent due to an 117 million preferred stock dividend revenue 
slipped to 1499 million from 1516 million 
dallasbased maxus formerly diamond shamrock corp posted a 
loss of 7 million the first six months of 1989 compared with a 
loss of 899 million a year earlier revenue fell 6 percent to 
2957 million from 3143 million in the same period last year

the federal reserve board on wednesday gave 
the goahead for three more new york banking companies to 
underwrite and deal in corporate debt moving further to break down 
a 56year barrier between traditional banking activities and the 
securities industry 
the feds latest actions involve requests from citicorp the 
nations largest banking concern chase manhattan corp and bankers 
trust new york corp 
the fed said that the three large banks can establish 
subsidiaries to raise money for corporations in the bond market 
traditionally an activity reserved to securities firms 
a month ago the fed had given similar approval to jp morgan 
the first bank to win such approval 
the fed which regulates bank holding companies had signaled 
its intention to allow banks to move into the area of dealing in 
corporate securities in january in that decision the fed 
governors said they would decide in a year whether to allow banks 
to sell new issues of corporate stock 
in 1987 the fed had given approval for banks to underwrite 
municipal revenue bonds commercial paper mortgagebacked 
securities and securities backed by consumer loans 
the securities subsidiary set up to handle the underwriting 
activities may earn no more than 5 percent of its revenue from all 
these activities according to the fed order 
the strict limits set on the amount of corporate bond business 
that banks can do will prevent banks from quickly challenging the 
dominance of the largest securities firms in this area officials 
believe 
the feds actions have still raised protests from lawmakers who 
have complained that the central bank should wait until congress 
addresses the issue of revamping the nations financial industry 
the banking industry has been trying for years to get congress 
to overhaul the 1933 glasssteagall act which separated the 
banking and securities industries in response to abuses which were 
uncovered in the wake of the 1929 stock market collapse but so far 
those efforts have not succeeded

relations between the united states and 
the european community have broadened in recent years as the 
trading bloc moves closer to creating a single market in 1992 a 
us official said wednesday 
were no longer talking only about trade issues said thomas 
niles the new us ambassador to the 12nation european community 
also known as the common market 
instead the bloc has moved increasingly into politics he said 
for example president george bush and other key western leaders 
asked the community a few weeks ago to take charge of putting 
together an economic assistance program for poland and hungary he 
said 
niles who previously served as us ambassador to canada 
attributed part of the change to the communitys campaign to form a 
single market in late 1992 by that date the nations want to 
remove trade barriers that prevent free movement of people goods 
services and money 
inevitably the 1992 program is going to result in a 
substantial accretion of power and authority and responsibility in 
brussels niles said in an interview 
the communitys executive body the european commission has its 
headquarters in brussels 
niles said there has been a quickening and deepening of 
highlevel contacts between the united states and the european 
commission he noted the commissions president jacques delors 
has met three times with bush in recent months 
we also see a strong will and readiness on the part of both 
partners when we have disputes or problems to find solutions he 
said 
some worry that the european community will set up barriers 
denying access to its 320 million consumers to outsiders but niles 
said the community should be beneficial to us companies 
but he said the united states is keeping a close eye on 
proposals to shape the new market 
when we see things that either we dont understand or we 
see as harmful to us interests we feel we have a right to raise 
it with our friends he said 
the united states has strong misgivings about quotas that 
have been recommended for television programming in 1992 he said 
the proposal would require that most entertainment programs 
shown on european tv be made in europe us officials say the 
american industrys earnings in europe would be hurt badly 
on other issues niles said both sides continue to discuss 
possible solutions to a stubborn dispute over a european ban on the 
import of beef from us cattle treated with growth hormones the 
united states has refused to comply with the prohibition and has 
slapped retaliatory duties on imports of certain goods from the 
common market

assemblyline workers who once embraced 
japanesestyle team management voted wednesday on whether to make 
nissan the first wholly japaneseowned auto plant in the united 
states to be unionized 
antiunion workers predicted a decisive victory for nissan motor 
manufacturing usa the united auto workers seeking to organize 
2400 hourly employees also forecast success although more 
cautiously 
the vote represents a stern test of uaw muscle and a challenge 
to automakers strategy of locating plants in the antiunion south 
the union campaign at the 6yearold plant has also called into 
question japanese industrys reputation for enlightened management 
workers who once sang the praises of nissan management in which 
the shop is organized into teams whose members rotate tasks have 
charged that the plant is run at a breakneck speed that has 
resulted in a high rate of injury 
nissan has warned that a union could jeopardize benefits and 
plant unity and that the automaker will be a tough bargainer if the 
union wins 
balloting at the 760 million plant was expected to end early 
thursday an announcement of the outcome was expected before dawn 
the union needs a majority of the votes cast 
chris shelton a quality inspector who has been at the plant 
since it opened said he voted against the union and expected the 
uaw to lose badly 
if therere so many people happy with the plant why should 
they get any votes or at least as many as they need shelton 
said 
i think its going to go fairly heavily for the workers 
against the union said ken roden an antiunion employee just 
from talking to workers around the plant somewhere around 75 
percent 
maxey irwin a union spokesman said the uaw was confident of 
a victory but i am not predicting percentages 
the uaw represents workers at japanese plants jointly owned by 
the big three us automakers but has no foothold in the nations 
wholly japanese owned plants nissan toyota in georgetown ky 
and honda in marysville ohio 
the union tried to organize workers at marysville but backed out 
without an election in what a regional uaw official called a 
humiliating defeat 
the uaw represents workers at a flat rock mich plant owned by 
mazda motor manufacturing usa corp a wholly owned subsidiary of 
mazda motor corp of japan but ford motor co owns 25 percent of 
the parent company 
nissan has produced more than 1 million pickup trucks and sentra 
cars since the plant began operation in june 1983 about 15 miles 
south of nashville more than 3100 people work at the plant which 
plans to add a third model in 1992 
labor observers have characterized the vote as crucial for the 
uaw which has seen membership drop by 33 percent in the past 10 
years 
whether the union wins or not the votes important because 
the uaw remains one of the strongest if not the strongest labor 
unions in the united states because it has complete coverage of gm 
ford and chrysler and these new japanese transplants the 
unorganized ones represent a threat to that power base said 
harry katz a labor relations professor at cornell university 
katz said he does not understand why nissan so strongly opposes 
the union 
regardless of whether the union wins or loses theres going 
to be a lot of workers really mad he said and thats going to 
cost the company in lost productivity 
roden wearing a bright red tshirt that read vote no was 
one of three employees who spoke at a companysponsored news 
conference hours before the voting 
we can lose things if the uaw wins some of our fringe 
benefits such as our leasecar program the 401k benefits said 
roden those are the tangible things the intangible stuff is 
what im most concerned about the team concept that they have here 
between labor and management we work together 
the uaw has estimated that the pace of the production has 
injured 18 percent of the workers nissan claims its health and 
safety record is better than most us automakers 
the uaw forced the vote held under the auspices of the national 
labor relations board by getting signatures from 33 percent of the 
workers in a drive kicked off in january 1988 with an appearance by 
uaw president owen bieber

bethlehem steel corp on wednesday 
reported a 45 percent drop in secondquarter profits it attributed 
in part to a 50 million charge associated with the restructuring 
of its bethforge division

declared common stock dividends for the first time since the third 
quarter of 1985 
the company said it will pay 10 cents per share reflecting its 
recovery from an intense steel industry slump company officials

the steelmaker said it is paying more for alloys and other raw 
materials while selling less of its highvalue products and more 
lowvalue semifinished steel 
order entry declined in the second quarter from strong 
firstquarter levels as a result of customer inventory adjustments 
seasonal factors and an easing of demand from the automotive 
industry bethlehem chairman walter f williams said

the ah robins co whose chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization survived a federal appeals court 
challenge last month said wednesday its sales and profit declined 
in the second quarter 
net earnings for the three months ended june 30 were 28 
million or 11 cents a share down 68 percent from 87 million or 
36 cents a share in the corresponding period last year 
sales for the quarter totaled 1872 million down 2 percent 
from 1915 million in the second quarter of 1988 
the sales decline resulted from the impact of converting foreign 
currencies into us dollars the company said the profit drop was 
caused primarily by a higher effective income tax rate it said 
robins a richmondbased pharmaceutical manufacturer that sold 
the illfated dalkon shield birth control device in the early 
1970s is to be acquired by the new yorkbased american home 
products corp under its reorganization plan which also includes a

a cornell university graduate student was 
indicted wednesday on a felony charge stemming from the creation of 
a rogue computer virus that paralyzed as many as 6000 
computers last fall 
robert tappan morris 24 who has been suspended from the 
university for one year was indicted by a federal grand jury in 
syracuse ny on a single count of accessing without 
authorization at least four university and military computers 
the computercrime indictment charged that the virus which 
spread across a nationwide network of computers prevented the 
authorized use of those computers by universities and military 
bases 
the justice department said in a statement released here that 
morris was the first person to be charged under a provision of the 
computer fraud and abuse act of 1986 that outlaws unauthorized 
accesss to computers by hackers the provision also makes it 
illegal to gain entry to a computer to damage or destroy files 
the indictment comes after months of deliberations within the 
justice department over whether to charge morris with a felony or a 
misdemeanor 
morris of arnold md could face a possible fiveyear sentence 
and a 250000 fine if convicted of the charge 
the law also provides for restitution of victims of a computer 
crime but prosecutors did not specify how much damage was caused 
by the nov 2 1988 incident that virtually shut down a 
militaryuniversity computer network used to transmit 
nonclassified data 
an industry group estimated that as much as 96 million worth of 
damage was caused by the virus to 6200 computers 
but a cornell university commission which criticized morris 
actions as reckless and impetuous called this estimate 
grossly exaggerated and selfserving 
defense attorney thomas a guidoboni said morris accepts this 
event as a step toward the final resolution of this matter 
an indictment is simply a formal accusation guidoboni said 
mr morris will enter a plea of not guity and contest the charge 
against him morris looks forward to his eventual vindication 
and his return to a normal life the defense lawyer said 
as many as 6000 university and military computers on the 
nationwide arpanet network were infected by the virus or computer 
worm that the cornell university commission concluded was 
created by morris 
the panel called the incident a juvenile act that ignored the 
clear potential consequences and showed a reckless disregard of 
those probable consequences 
but the commission noted that it appears to have been an 
uncharacteristic act for morris who had graduated from harvard 
university last year before beginning a graduate program in 
computer science at cornell 
guidoboni said morris who has been on leave from the university 
since the incident was placed on a oneyears suspension that 
begins in september 
the defendants father is chief computer scientist for the 
national computer security center near baltimore 
the indictment charged that the younger morris intentionally 
and without authorization accessed computers located at the 
university of california at berkeley the national aeronautics and 
space administration in moffett field calif purdue university in 
west lafayette ind the us air force logistics command at 
wright patterson air force base in dayton ohio and others not 
specified 
the spread of the virus prevented the authorized use of one or 
more of these federal interest computers and thereby caused a loss 
to one or more others of more than 1000 the indictment charged 
although the virus disrupted the operations of thousands of 
computers cornell university spokesman dennis meredith said it did 
not erase any files of electronically stored data 
but he said there is absolutely no doubt that the computer 
worm did serious damage to computer systems around the country

york overnight down from tuesdays close of 14160 yen 
dealers said the initial trading in tokyo followed its overnight

us federal reserve was loosening credit and over speculation 
about the countrys sluggish economic growth

the senate approved legislation on wednesday 
that would boost federal timber sales impose new restrictions on 
lobbyists and take a slap at federal financing of controversial art 
the measure provides 109 billion for various federal land 
indian energy natural resource and cultural programs for the 1990 
fiscal year which begins oct 1 under the interior department and 
related agencies final passage came on a voice vote 
with the house having passed an 111 billion version of the 
bill on july 12 the legislation was the first of the 13 annual 
appropriations bills financing the government to clear both 
chambers of congress this year the senate and house will have to 
hammer out identical texts before president bush can sign it into 
law 
the senate legislation contains bonuses for energy and timber 
interests and setbacks for environmentalists 
with a bow to the public concern about oil spills raised by a 
series of tanker accidents in recent months the bill accepts a 
moratorium that the house placed on the leasing of 84 million acres 
of federal offshore waters for oil and gas drilling a larger area 
by far than the redlined zones imposed by congress in previous 
years 
but it eliminates house language blocking the government from 
taking preliminary steps to lease several tracts off the coasts of 
california and the northeast 
the senate voted 7227 to strip a clause sponsored by sen 
james mcclure ridaho banning oil tankers from waters where 
leasing moratoria are in force the prohibition would increase 
pressure to ease leasing restrictions 
mcclure argued that tanker accidents are far more likely than 
spills from offshore drilling which he said doesnt have a 
safety problem it has a public relations problem 
but opponents complained that the provision would drive up the 
costs of petroleum products for residents of the large portions of 
the country whose offshore waters have drilling restrictions 
its designed to make them sorry they have championed 
moratoria and deferrals and not drilling off their banks said 
sen dale bumpers dark 
the senate also expressed opposition to house provisions 
requiring federal consideration of repurchasing leases of tracts 
off the alaskan coast in reaction to the recent prince william 
sound oil spill instead the senate directed the fish and wildlife 
service to study the effects of the spill on nearby fisheries 
the legislation would lift court restrictions obtained by 
environmental groups on the cutting of hundreds of thousands of 
acres of timber on federal lands in california oregon and 
washington if the environmentalists and the governments 
timberselling agencies cannot agree by oct 1 on terms that would 
make 125 billion board feet available the provision sponsored by 
sens mark hatfield of oregon ranking republican on the 
appropriations committee and brock adams dwash would protect 
some trees that are the habitat of the rare spotted owl 
the chairman of the appropriations panel sen robert byrd 
dwva included new constraints on lobbyists a reaction to the 
recent scandals involving the department of housing and urban 
development and other agencies 
recipients of federal grants contracts and loans would be 
barred from using government funds to pay lobbyists who helped them 
obtain the money all lobbyists who help people pursuing federal 
contracts would have to report their activities to the government 
including their earnings 
every senator in this body ought to be repulsed by the 
perception that we will dole out the bucks if stroked by the right 
consultant byrd said 
the bill would provide 1702 million to the national endowment 
for the arts which provides grants to artists and art 
organizations 
but it sliced 45000 from the endowments budget the amount it 
had spent this year on a pair of shows that several lawmakers have 
said they found offensive one was an exhibit of photographs by the 
late robert mapplethorpe depicting homosexual and sadomasochistic 
acts 
the measure would apportion 13 billion to the bureau of indian 
affairs 231 million more than bush sought 408 million for 
energy conservation programs for which bush wanted only 96 
million and 228 million to continue filling the strategic 
petroleum reserve the administration sought 35 million for the 
emergency reserve because it wanted to continue filling the storage 
caves on the gulf coast at a slower rate
