a rapist who has attacked two university of 
southern california students the last month has caused widespread 
fear on campus tempering the thrill of an undefeated football team 
and a heisman trophycontending quarterback 
its something were all thinking about student body 
president phil clement said this week for many people its 
paranoia students cant sleep theyre sick to their stomach 
a third sex attack occurred at 310 pm friday on the usc 
campus but police lt pete durham said the rape was unrelated to 
two other rapes reported this month the attacker didnt resemble 
the man in the other rapes he said 
the tension comes at a time when there should be joy at usc 
the football team has earned a rose bowl berth and is undefeated 
going into saturdays showdown with undefeated notre dame 
quarterback rodney peete who led the team to victory last week over 
rival ucla despite a campus outbreak of measles that had put him in 
the hospital is a contender for college footballs biggest prize 
the heisman trophy 
sgt john lewis of campus security said there have been four 
campusrelated rapes this year compared to one in 1987 the most 
recent attacks oct 29 and nov 5 are causing the fear 
the rapist approached the female victims with a gun as they were 
getting out of their cars at campus parking structures then drove 
them off campus and sexually assaulted them before driving them back 
to the school 
police believe the same man was responsible for both attacks 
said los angeles detective dave grabelski 
theres a whole lot of fear over there its not being blown 
out of proportion grabelski said tuesday the department 
thought it important enough to take me and my partner off homicide 
usc has 30000 graduate and undergraduate students who pay 
12000 a year to attend classes on a 150acre innercity campus 
students traditionally have included the scions of many of southern 
californias oldest and wealthiest families 
the private institution is also on the fringes of southcentral 
los angeles home to a high crime rate and the citys most notorious 
street gangs 
that has led to the impression even among students that crime 
is rampant on campus when actually usc had fewer rapes assaults 
and burglaries last year than larger ucla which is bordered by 
upscale westwood and beverly hills said clement 
still as many as 5000 whistles have been distributed to women 
students and some men in case they spot anything unusual and campus 
security has posted 24hour guards at parking structures 
a rape awareness seminar was held nov 7 and bulletins have been 
posted urging caution students have been told to walk in pairs or 
call the campus escort service 
there is an increased fear definitely said student gwen 
gallagher 17 last weekend was an increased risk time with the 
ucla game and all the parties 
i heard of cases where women were walking and if someone was 
just walking behind them they would scream said student kimberly 
falk 19 were using the buddy system for the most part though 
its not panic 
there was more of a panic with the measles she said 
some students are unhappy that at a time when they should be 
enjoying football games and victory parties they have to worry 
about being attacked 
i dont like feeling that i need to be watching everywhere i 
go said student susan han 18

human rights activist andrei sakharov urged 
the soviet government friday to use military force to quell unrest 
in the republic of azerbaijan where he said more than 130 ethnic 
armenians have died in rioting 
the soviet authorities must take the necessary measures to 
insure the safety of the armenian population including their 
introduction of sufficient troops in azerbaijan for this purpose 
sakharov said in a statement read by his soninlaw efrem 
yankelevich 
soviet helicopters and trucks have been used in recent days to 
aid hundreds of ethnic armenians as they fled to their adjacent 
homeland following the worst outbreak of violence since the first 
days of ethnic disturbance in the soviet south in february 
sakharov who has been undergoing medical tests and visiting 
relatives in the united states since nov 6 also charged the 
official news media of incomplete and biased coverage to events in 
the troubled region 
with the authorities connivance the murders rapes and 
arsons are continuing now for a fifth day and are spreading to other 
cities and towns of azerbaijan sakharov said 
a curfew has been imposed and soviet tanks and troops sent in 
recent days to curb unrest in kirovabad baku and nakhivechan 
sakharov said he had had reports azeri rioters enflamed by 
nationalist sentiment had killed more than 130 armenians and 
wounded more than 200 in recent outbreaks of violence 
the two ethnic groups divided by religion language and national 
heritage have a long history of ethnic rivalry armenians are 
predominantly christian and azerbaijanis are predominantly moslem 
sakharov urged nations to intervene and demand complete and 
objective information about the situation including free access to 
both armenia and azerbaijan for soviet and foreign journalists 
tensions have been running high in the caucasus since february 
when armenians began agitating for the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave in azerbaijan 
azerbaijani officials and soviet leaders have rejected the demand 
in his statement sakharov urged officials to allow armenians in 
nagornikarabakh to organize selfdefense units but also recomended 
control of the disputed territory be placed temporarily under a 
central allunion administration 
i appeal for support to political and public leaders to my 
scientific colleagues to all people of goodwill sakharov said 
i appeal to people of all nationalities

a woman who was misdiagnosed and kept in a state 
mental hospital for 17 years has returned in triumph to the 
institution as a fulltime administrator after earning a masters 
degree from harvard 
marie balter was 17 and clinically depressed when she was labeled 
schizophrenic and sent to danvers state hospital after gaining her 
release in 1964 she went back to school and has since worked with 
psychiatric patients lectured nationwide and written an 
autobiography her story was the basis of a 1986 tv movie starring 
marlo thomas 
now balter 58 is devoting her efforts to helping improve the 
hospital she began work as community affairs director earlier this 
month 
i wouldnt have grown one bit if i didnt learn to forgive 
she said in a recent interview if you dont forgive your parents 
or your children or yourself you dont get beyond that anger 
forgiving is a way of reaching out from a bad past and heading 
out to a more positive future 
marvin m mcnally hired balter three months into his tenure as 
danvers chief operating officer 
she is a model for many people he said i think she serves 
in that way for many people not just expatients she has faced 
adversity has overcome it and has succeeded 
balter was born in boston the illegitimate daughter of an 
alcoholic mother who put her in a foster home at age 5 she was 
adopted by a couple in gloucester who disciplined her harshly 
sometimes locking her in the cellar 
increasingly depressed she was institutionalized in 1947 her 
symptoms included muscle spasms choking hyperventilation and 
hallucinations she later learned she suffered from a form of 
depression and panic disorder not schizophrenia 
it wasnt deliberate on the part of the doctors and the 
hospital she said not much was known about panic disorders 
back then a person who had panic disorders was identified as a 
little bit crazy 
her recovery was painful and gradual as balter overcame a 
despair that often left her unable to eat or move she contemplated 
suicide more than once 
with the help of friends mental health workers and her own 
strength and catholic faith balter gained release in 1964 she 
moved into an apartment married and earned a psychology degree from 
salem state college and a masters from harvard in administration 
planning and public policy 
in her new job which pays between 35000 and 47000 balter 
will serve as chief hospital spokeswoman help train health workers 
recruit volunteers find grants and assist in fundraising 
things that will help the hospital turn around she said 
above all balter hopes to improve patient conditions from 
adding curtains to reducing overcrowding danvers has about 260 
patients twice its recommended capacity 
this isnt balters first return to the hospital in danvers a 
suburb north of boston from 1976 to 1979 she was a social worker on 
community outreach cases and has run a mental health program linked 
with danvers 
balter has lectured nationwide since nobodys child aired on 
network television two years ago her book sing no sad songs 
was finished last year and she has marketed it herself to raise 
money for the balter institute a nonprofit community mental health 
training center 
she plans to continue taking her message of hope selfreliance 
and caring to high schools community groups and mental health 
organizations 
i dont believe on focusing on all the bad stuff that might 
have happened balter said everybody has problems life is not 
troublefree i try to make people see that 
to prove her point balter mentions tragedies from her own life 
a 10year battle with cancer and the deaths of her husband brother 
and biological mother who died in a fire two years after balter met 
her 
i always believe that suffering pain is not a negative force in 
our lives she said we take our pain and tragedy and use them 
to serve others and then they become positive tools to achieve our 
goals

despite moves elsewhere to restrict 
smoking the tobacco industry holds a powerful hometurf advantage 
in kentucky where efforts to spell out nonsmokers rights have 
taken a pounding 
the latest target for the industry and its allies in the 
legislature is a proposed smoking policy at the university of 
louisville some key lawmakers have hinted the school may be hit in 
the pocketbook if it grants certain rights to nonsmokers 
in june the owensboro city commission rescinded a newly enacted 
ban on smoking in municipal buildings after a tobacco company 
threatened to reconsider plans to expand a plant there 
last year the heat was on officials of the greater cincinnati 
international airport in northern kentucky some lawmakers 
threatened to revoke the airports sunday liquor license if a 
smoking ban was fully implemented there 
tobacco is such an ingrained part of the social economic and 
political structure of this entire state its hard for people from 
nontobacco states to understand said mike staufacker health 
education director for the american lung association of kentucky 
im a little bit embarrassed by what the state legislators are 
trying to do he said it really sheds a poor light on the 
state 
in north carolina the nations leading tobacco grower there 
have been few moves to legislate restrictions on smoking although 
some bus companies and restaurants have instituted nosmoking 
sections in september the research triangle institute won a 4 
million national cancer institute contract for a study in raleigh 
and greensboro that will use advertising and community support to 
get smokers to quit 
kentucky the nations top burley tobacco producer had the 
countrys highest smokingrelated death rate in 1985 the us 
centers for disease control reported last week staufacker said 
another recent study showed 32 percent of all kentuckians smoke the 
highest rate among 30 states surveyed 
the chairman of the legislatures tobacco task force rep donnie 
gedling said that total income from tobacco in kentucky was 23 
billion in 1984 and that the crop is a mainstay for many of the 
states 120000 small farmers 
were talking about a 2 billion industry out here said 
state rep clay crupper an opponent of smoking regulations and 
chairman of the house agriculture committee we ought not to be 
out stopping smoking here and stopping smoking there 
crupper is among several lawmakers angry about the university of 
louisvilles proposed smoking regulations especially a portion that 
says in the case of an impasse between smokers and nonsmokers 
nonsmokers rights prevail 
the rules would prohibit smoking in hallways and common areas 
divide eating areas into smoking and nonsmoking sections and 
regulate smoking in offices on the urban campus where 22000 
students are enrolled 
crupper said last week the legislature might have to cut 
something out of the schools budget if no compromise is reached 
another alternative would be to enact legislation barring 
universities from regulating smoking in stateowned buildings 
crupper said 
donald hall a university spokesman told a meeting of the 
tobacco task force on nov 20 that he understood the legislators 
loud and clear hall said later that donald swain the 
university president was considering changes in the proposed 
smoking policy 
there is a sense that the present draft may be skewed a little 
more toward the nonsmoker than the smoker hall said so we 
are trying to develop some language that is a little more 
evenhanded 
hall said he doubted the university would back down completely 
but probably would amend the provisions governing deadlocks in 
disputes over smoking zones he said he did not believe the schools 
budget had been seriously threatened 
i guess the intensity of the reaction from some quarters was a 
little surprising hall said but we know how important the 
tobacco industry is to the state and we certainly do not want to 
get into a conflict with the general assembly 
many louisville students said they resented the threats to the 
budget 
the tobacco industry is pulling the strings and the university 
of louisville is dancing said gregory hall a nonsmoking 
political science major 
john jaynes a graduate student who smokes said he thought the 
proposed policy would be overly restrictive but that legislators 
threats were petty and vindictive 
brett edwards whose relatives raise tobacco near bloomfield 
southeast of louisville said he opposed the policy and supported 
whatever steps were necessary to block the measure 
you have to protect your business interests any way you can 
edwards said taking quick puffs from a cigarette

us marines shot at an armed intruder on the 
outskirts of howard air base near the panama canal but the man got 
away apparently unhurt a us military spokesman said 
southern command spokesman bill orsmbee said marines guarding 
base fuel tanks wednesday morning fired twice after the man failed 
to obey orders to halt 
orsmbee who spoke thursday said he had no other information on 
the incident 
it was the sixth time marines have fired at intruders none of 
whom have been wounded captured or identified the marines shot and 
killed one of their own men in an april incident 
marines have been stationed in panama since april shortly after 
gen manuel antonio noriega forced out president eric artuo 
delvalle noriega chief of the defense forces and panamas de facto 
ruler has been indicted in the united states on charges of drug 
trafficking he denies the charges 
noriega said in a speech thursday at the rio hato military base 
90 miles from the capital of panama city that the military supports 
a move toward greater democracy but that the country does not need 
the us embassys help 
we are committed to holding elections in may 1989 he said 
there are no changes in the election calendar nor in the 
panamanian democratic process holding elections is 1989 is a 
panamanian decision it is not based on a foreign order 
noriega said every time panamanians have proposed initiatives to 
solve the countrys crisis a gringo comes along to torpedo 
impede block terminate or liquidate the initiatives 
it is time for panamanians to sit down to dialogue without the 
eraser of the us embassys political attache john maisto and for 
them to realize that the defense forces would be part of the total 
picture but not the complete dialogue he said 
noriega has resisted us economic and political pressure to 
resign and leave the country he also has resisted internal 
opposition pressure to step down as military commander 
noriega said panama should strengthen its political neutrality 
and relations with all countries of the world and continue a 
permanent effort to find a peaceful solution to conflicts 
he said panamanians have learned that the economic system cant 
continue depending on the political whims tied to international 
interests 
noriega said political forces should propose a new plan to 
include economic pluralism in which the state along with private 
enterprise cooperatives and other economic organizations would take 
responsibility for guaranteeing various forms of initiatives to 
contribute to development

the historic steamer ss clipper is taking 
chicagoans on a trip down memory lane while floating peacefully at 
its new mooring in the heart of downtown 
its beautiful said one nostalgic passerby robert love of 
chicago as he admired the ship in its new setting on the chicago 
river 
i remember when you had boats like this parked up and down the 
river all the time bring back the good old days love said 
the 83yearold vessel sidled up to the chicago suntimes 
building wednesday with the help of a couple of tugboats it was 
evicted from its eightyear spot at navy pier because of a rent 
dispute with the city 
isnt she a sight sitting there asked james gillan 
president of the illinois steamship co which owns the recently 
designated national historic landmark and hopes to restore it to its 
former splendor 
the clipper will spend the winter moored by the suntimes 
building 
in the last year the outlook for the clipper at navy pier just 
got worse gillan said our best time in the city was when the 
late harold washington was mayor he really loved this boat 
one of washingtons last staff parties was held on the clipper 
whose restored art deco restaurant lounges and ballroom have been 
the site of numerous social events in recent years gillan said 
though it wont be open to the public in coming months gillan 
said he hopes the clipper will again be the setting for social 
events next fall 
the 361foot ship was once one of the proud steamships of the 
great lakes originally christened the ss juniata it carried up to 
900 passengers in elegant style on nineday cruises from buffalo 
ny to duluth minn 
in 1941 the ship was rechristened the milwaukee clipper and 
began ferrying passengers and autos from milwaukee to muskegon 
mich a sixhour trip taken by as many as 150000 people each 
season 
it was taken out of service in 1970 and moved to chicago in 1980 
longrange plans for the ship according to gillan are to make 
it seaworthy again and start cruises on lake michigan 
there is no reason it could not set sail again he said but 
an estimated 3 million to 5 million would be required 
in the meantime gillan said he hoped the vessel would be a 
pretty addition to the riverfront especially at the mooring next to 
the suntimes building itself designed to look like an abstract 
river barge 
well try to make her attrative to have around gillan said 
wait till you see her at night with all her lights on that will 
be a sight to see

laboratory experiments announced today show 
that a plant toxin combined with a synthetic protein is able to 
attack and kill cells infected with the aids virus while leaving 
healthy cells untouched 
in a study published today in the journal science a group of 
researchers report that a manmade molecule called recombinant cd4 
can be used to deliver a killer toxin to cells infected with aids in 
testtube experiments 
however they cautioned that the new laboratory development 
like other incremental advances in aids research was far from 
being ready for clinical application and at best might offer a 
potential new treatment approach rather than a cure 
dr jonathan w uhr chairman of the department of microbiology 
at the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas 
said the cd4 molecule naturally binds to a gycoprotein called 
gp120 that forms on the surface of cells infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids cd4 he said 
will not attach itself to cells not infected with hiv 
in the laboratory uhr said his research group combined a 
synthetic cd4 molecule with a toxin called ricin that is extracted 
from plants 
when exposed in a test tube to hivinfected cells he said the 
cd4ricin combination binds to the cell surfaces and the ricin then 
kills the cell thus eliminating a source of hiv virus 
early in the course of hiv infection tcells and macrophages 
two types of immunity cells are thought to be the major cellular 
reservoirs for the virus both of those bear the cd4 molecule that 
permits the virus to enter said uhr 
by combining a toxin with the cd4 molecule the researchers are 
in effect creating a guided missile that attacks only those cells 
that are infected healthy cells are not touched by the toxin said 
uhr 
the scientist said toxic effects of the cd4ricin combination 
will have to be studied in the laboratory before the technique could 
be used in clinical experiments ricin has been used in cancer drugs 
and has been found to be well tolerated by patients if managed 
carefully he said 
uhr said it will be at least a year before the drug could be 
tested on patients and though this technique shows promise he 
said he is not suggesting that it would cure aids 
we would not expect it to kill a latentlyinfected cell and 
this represents a significant obstacle in terms of curing this 
disease said uhr i think that one might expect at best to 
slow it down 
he said the aids virus is known to invade cells and stay there 
quietly not making the gp120 protein that would be targeted by the 
cd4 molecule 
one would have to consider the problem of these latent infected 
cells as a major one in terms of ridding the body of all the 
infected cells said uhr 
dr flossie wongstaal a national institutes of health aids 
researcher said the finding was important but added we could 
never eliminate the virus infection by this means because of the 
latently infected cells 
it still very early to say if this would be an important 
therapy but it should be tried clinically i think said 
wongstaal 
other scientists involved in the study were mark a till victor 
ghetie and ellen s vitetta of the university of texas and timothy 
gregory eric j patzer james p porter and daniel j capon of 
genentech a south san francisco calif firm that developed the 
synthetic cd4 molecule 
a report on the study was published today in science the journal 
of the american association for the advancement of science

presidentelects 11acre compound at walkers point bush has made 
it plain that he opposes any such restrictions 
other unsubstantiated rumors tell of property sold or leased at 
exorbitant prices to news organizations seeking an operational base 
near the bush estate 
making their way through the grapevine are rumors that a 
halfdozen helicopter pads will be built at various points in town 
to speed bushs trips to and from his estate known as walkers 
point after his grandfather who built it 
some of the speculation is just plain fun 
the last rumor i heard is that theyre going to land the 
aircraft carrier nimitz out there to bring him in said bushs 
closest neighbor robert dennis pointing to the ocean beyond 
walkers point 
the secret service in accordance with longestablished policy 
would not comment on any rumors or offer any details about security 
arrangements for the kennebunkport compound 
the more we say about it the more we legitimize what the 
rumors are and we hate to do that said special agent bill 
corbett a spokesman at secret service headquarters in washington 
emphasizing that no decisions have been made corbett said 
right now were just monitoring what the presidentelects 
schedule might be for the foreseeable future 
the kennebunkport compound is more accessible to the public than 
other presidential retreats such as president reagans mountaintop 
ranch near santa barbara calif but corbett indicated the location 
should not pose insurmountable security problems 
key biscayne was on the ocean he said referring to richard 
nixons florida hideaway so its not something thats totally new 
to us 
the secret service has been protecting bush for eight years as 
vice president and is familiar with the kennebunkport area the 
agent added 
bushs ninebedroom home situated on an 113acre site that juts 
into the ocean is clearly visible from both ocean avenue and the 
sea despite the colder weather there has been a steady flow of 
cars whose drivers slow down as they pass dennis house to catch a 
glimpse of the bush compound 
townspeople seem to be responding to the rumor mill with a 
healthy skepticism said dennis right now nobody knows 
anything

one year after he was found 
wandering the streets of ciudad juarez partially deaf and unable to 
speak 9yearold jose de jesus garcia aguilera is attending school 
for the first time 
joses identity remained a mystery for months but now 
authorities say special education classes are unlocking a very sharp 
mind 
in one day i swear he learned the whole alphabet in sign 
language said gloria ferrel a staff psychologist at the casa 
hogar del nino a governmentrun childrens home where jose now 
lives 
sometime in october jose a spunky streetwise kid fled the 
crowded tworoom hut and meager meals he had shared with his mother 
grandmother and four siblings in tampico a port city on the gulf of 
mexico 
he was found nov 7 1987 wandering the streets of ciudad 
juarez across the border from el paso texas 700 miles from home 
social workers spent eight months trying to learn his identity but 
jose could communicate only through gestures pictures and his 
crookedtoothed grin 
hes very sharp hes always been able to communicate in one 
way or another cecilia villarreal casa hogar director said in 
an interview this week at the home 
the mystery was solved in june when his mother micaela aguilera 
learned where he was aguilera a poor barmaid with an estranged 
common law husband turned her son over to the casa hogar in ciudad 
victoria capital of the state of tamaulipas about 130 miles from 
tampico 
jose now lives with 120 other children ranging in age from 
newborn to 15 and his mother has visited several times officials 
said 
the small campus with spotlessly clean dormitories a dining 
hall classrooms and a large garden is one of four homes in the 
state and dozens around the country for abandoned mistreated and 
needy children 
jose started classes at a special education school in september 
although he has a lot of catching up to do he seems unfazed by the 
burden of learning to spell count and communicate through sign 
language at the same time 
hes learning very fast said patricia franco a staff 
teacher who helps jose practice his sign language 
jose wearing new corduroy pants a sports shirt and tennis shoes 
and carting a big blue book bag charged into the office to greet a 
visitor and show off his new knowledge 
he spelled his name in sign language then flashed the signs for 
desk glass and book as franco pointed to the objects 
that accomplished he grinned at his instructor for approval 
numbers still confound him though when franco pointed to three 
cups on the table jose wrote the number eight in a notebook 
jose drew many pictures of an airplane in flames during his stay 
in ciudad juarez leading authorities to speculate that he had 
survived a plane crash 
specialists now say those pictures reveal a very active 
imagination fueled by television and the fact that his home in 
tampico is next to an airport 
but jose is sticking to his story using new skills to tell of 
his odyssey 
when franco used sign language to ask where he comes from jose 
attempted to sign a lavish story about how hed crossed the 
mountains and flown in an airplane 
its crude she said but hes telling us hes been 
traveling that hes been on an airplane 
villarreal said jose is still being tested his deafness is 
considered quite severe a hearing aid didnt help and authorities 
are awaiting another 
plans call for jose to see a specialist in los angeles for more 
tests and to determine if an operation could correct his hearing 
loss 
jose still is difficult to discipline because he has always 
fended for himself villarreal said 
he could easily have escaped and hes had a lot of 
opportunities said villarreal but he seems happy here

in the event of a nuclear war the interior 
department would try to keep the nations mines open and the 
education department would seek out teachers to reopen schools 
according to a new order signed by president reagan 
not surprisingly the lions share of the responsibility for 
responding to nuclear attack is assigned to the pentagon according 
to the recently released directive 
the order overhauls a 19yearold executive directive that was 
first approved by president nixon said russell clanahan a 
spokesman for the federal emergency management agency 
the new 27page document brings up to date the 1969 order by 
taking into account a number of changes in the structure of the 
federal bureaucracy since then 
for example the old department of health education and welfare 
has been split into two cabinet agencies the department of health 
and human services and the department of education 
the 1969 order had been updated periodically but never totally 
rewritten until now clanahan said the job took several years 
it had to go around the government several times for 
coordination he said it did take quite awhile youd be amazed 
at the amount of nitpicking the bureaucracy can do 
the order covers 26 federal agencies including fema the office 
charged with coordinating the governments response to a wide 
variety of disasters including atomic war 
the new document does not propose spending any more money for 
civil defense nor does it propose changing any policies 
when he took office in 1981 reagan began a large buildup of 
military forces including a variety of nuclear arms and 
administration officials also proposed increasing the nations civil 
defense effort they said the soviets have a much larger civil 
defense system 
critics charged that the administration was pursuing a policy 
based on the belief that a nuclear war could be fought and won the 
administration denied this 
the latest executive order sidesteps that controversy noting 
only that the policy of the united states is to have sufficient 
capabilities at all levels of government to meet essential defense 
and civilian needs during any national security emergency 
most of the emergency tasks assigned in the reagan order are 
meant to fit the federal agencies areas of expertise the labor 
department for example is to ensure effective use of civilian 
work forces resources in national security emergencies 
the pentagon was given several tasks in addition to its role of 
maintaining the necessary military forces for example it is 
expected to ensure an adequate supply of drinking water keep 
waterways and harbors open help the justice department enforce 
civilian laws and coordinate the efforts of the government and 
private industry

with thousands of stick children starving 
in civil wartorn sudan the united states should be speaking out 
against the atrocities rather than preserving its ties to the 
sudanese government congressional and relief officials say 
the state department contends it is doing the best it can in 
dealing with an ineffectual and stubborn government and the 
complexities of a cruel civil war pitting the moslem rulers in the 
north against the christian and pagan minority in the south 
both the state department and relief officials agree that the 
government and the rebels are using available supplies of donated 
food as a weapon against millions of innocent civilians but 
opinions differ on how best to handle the crisis 
the administration is suffering from a severe case of 
clientelism said stephen morrison one of four congressional 
staffers just back from a bipartisan factfinding mission to sudan 
in the southern town of abiye where the united states was able 
to arrange a food airlift a few weeks ago after months of pressure 
on the khartoum government there are no children under three years 
old the staffers and relief officials said 
theyve all died of hunger or been sold for food said 
jeffrey clark who coordinated the trip on behalf of rep mickey 
leland dtex chairman of the house select committee on hunger 
we saw stick children their arms barely two inches in diameter 
he added 
roger winter director of the privately funded us committee for 
refugees said he had been urging the state department to take a 
stronger stand with the khartoum government 
a high profile us leadership role is critical at this 
point he said to get a massive relief effort under way 
in response the state department issued a statement saying a 
major human catastrophe continues to unfold in the sudan the world 
is witnessing famine that is the result not of nature but of endemic 
civil war 
the department also said its main objective is to get a massive 
relief effort under way but added that were dealing with a very 
complex political situation and a government that has serious 
problems coordinating its activities and exerting authority beyond 
khartoum 
the congressional staffers who were in sudan said the us 
government does have leverage it could apply if it chose to do so 
they noted that washington grants 70 million a year in direct food 
and other humanitarian aid they said a grain pricing agreement up 
for review between the two countries could also be used to exert 
pressure 
in addition the united states has a controlling interest in the 
world bank and international monetary fund on which sudan relies 
for substantial loans 
and while some may not think we have much leverage we do have 
a megaphone said david lonie a staffer on the house human rights 
and international organizations subcommittee we cannot morally 
condone this horror by our silence 
at a briefing for fellow staffers and nongovernmental relief 
agency heads the four who went to sudan described what they said 
was a deliberate sudanese government plan to depopulate the 
south where the rebel sudans peoples liberation army has been 
seeking social and religious reform since 1983 
in recent years some two million southerners have been driven 
from their homes about 350000 have trekked across the border to 
marxist ethiopia the rest have gone north in search of food 
sometimes walking for three months sustained only by roots and 
insects until they reach camps around khartoum the capital 
world vision a californiabased christian relief agency which 
operated in sudan for 16 years until its expulsion last february 
estimates that 300000 children perished this year from hunger and 
war in africas largest country 
relief convoys and airlifts supplied by international donors and 
neighboring kenya and uganda have been attacked by both sides or 
prevented by government bureaucracy or harassment from reaching 
their destination 
on their way north refugees are attacked by governmentarmed 
moslem tribal groups who rape and kill the staffers said those who 
remain in the south are in danger of bombardment by sovietmade

the middle east remained the no 1 market for 
american arms manufacturers last year although total us arms 
exports fell sharply according to a new study 
the report also said mcdonnell douglas corp was one of the few 
major defense contractors to post a sales increase for the year the 
st louisbased company assumed the top industry position with sales 
of 657 million 
the value of contracts awarded to us defense contractors for 
military equipment and services earmarked for export abroad fell to 
49 billion off 22 percent from the 1986 level and 44 percent 
below 1985s total the report said 
the study examined sales in the 12month period ended sept 30 
the overall decline in foreign military sale awards led to a 
drop in the level of arms export business for 17 of the top 25 us 
arms exporting companies in 1987 the report said 
the study was conducted by the investor responsibility research 
center which bills itself as a nonpartisan research organization 
dedicated to conducting impartial studies on public policy issues 
involving corporate america 
the group has been analyzing foreign arms sales for several 
years focusing on the official foreign military sale or fms 
transactions that are arranged and overseen by the us government 
fms sales account for about 84 percent of all us arms exports the 
remainder normally involved companytocountry agreements 
the research center waits until complete government tabulations 
are available for each fiscal year meaning there normally is a lag 
of more than a year the latest report was mailed out this week 
center officials attributed the steep decline in us overseas 
sales to a small drop in overall demand coupled with an increase in 
competition 
the biggest reason for the dropoff has to do with 
competition said paul ferrari a center spokesman its a 
tighter market out there 
its still a good business but a lot of the oilrich countries 
and developing nations either dont have the funds anymore or they 
have stocked their arsenals to the brim for the time being 
and the demand is slackening off a little bit at the same time 
there are more suppliers in the market including countries like 
brazil and south korea 
ferrari said the fiscal 1987 totals would not have dropped nearly 
as much if congress had not blocked reagan administration proposals 
to sell new jet aircraft to such middle east countries as saudi 
arabia 
pentagon figures show that based on deliveries of equipment in 
fiscal 1987 the middle east continued to be the largest 
recipients of us military exports in 1987 ferrari said 
saudi arabia israel and egypt led the way in that region he 
added 
the six largest us arms contractors account for 55 percent of 
the total fms awards in fiscal 1987 the study said 
besides mcdonnell douglas they are general dynamics corp which 
had 6069 million in foreign sales grumman corp with 5037 
million general electric co 3415 million raytheon co 3262 
million and united technologies corp 223 million 
general dynamics had held the top spot two years ago with sales 
of 14 billion 
rounding out the top 10 arms exporters were lockheed corp 
1971 million general motors corp 194 million unisys 1731 
million and westinghouse electric corp 1227 million 
the center said the export contracts for fiscal 1987 benefited 
the states of new york california massachusetts texas and 
missouri the most 
the awards to contractors in new york totaled 706 million 
compared to 6867 million for california 5416 million for 
massachusetts 5229 million for texas and 4995 million for 
missouri

firefighters refused to respond to medical 
emergencies at the monastery garbagemen wouldnt pick up its trash 
and a county health worker described its tiny patients as little 
rattlesnakes 
the reason starcross monastic community a roman catholic 
monastery run by lay workers wanted to provide a home for infants 
with aids 
yet through it all much of the bad was offset said tolbert 
mccarroll 
for every problem we encountered there was some surprising 
force that came along to balance it said mccarroll author of 
morning glory babies 
mccarroll known as brother toby said the book is an 
unconcealed plea to readers to adopt infants infected with the 
aids virus who otherwise will spend their days in walkers tethered 
to doorknobs in hospital corridors 
there are a lot of misconceptions about how ill these babies 
are he said in an interview people think they are nothing but 
trouble always sick 
nothing could be further from the truth as we hope our story 
shows 
mccarroll describes a social worker yanking starcross monastic 
communitys 12yearold foster care license because it would not 
abandon plans to care for the infants a neighbor telling reporters 
the nearby town of annapolis didnt consider starcross part of the 
community anymore and a poster being defaced with graffiti 
reading catch exotic diseases kiss aids infected kids 
we never carried the babies near the public road because of 
some threats shouted from cars mccarroll writes in the 160page 
book published last month by st martins press 
even now that two years have passed mccarroll said good will 
toward us will continue to be a local sin for some time to come 
the monastery about 120 miles north of san francisco cares for 
three or four infants with aids 
although the internationally known monasterys conflicts have 
been reported before the book which details the first two years of 
starcrosss efforts to help the babies offers the most complete 
picture so far of its struggles since november 1986 
aside from neighbors fears the most antagonistic reaction 
came from the government mccarroll said 
at one point a social worker ordered mccarrolls 82yearold 
bedridden mother who lived in a separate house on the remote 
property in sonoma county to be fingerprinted for a criminal check 
mccarroll says after an argument over the matter he said the 
monasterys license was temporarily revoked 
despite the problems unsolicited helpers began showing up 
offering physical labor supplies and friendship 
a banker with aids who has two children started showing up early 
in the morning to do whatever was needed an elderly woman would 
drop off a newly made quilt and baby kimonos every few months a 
public health worker brought diapers on his day off and a retired 
new york subway worker tackled the mysteries of farm chores 
since 1981 about 1020 cases of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome have struck children younger than 5 according to the 
centers for disease control in atlanta aids can be passed from 
mother to child at or before birth 
mccarroll and health officials warn that by the mid1990s 
thousands of infants will be infected with the virus up to half 
will need foster homes 
although organized religions response to the epidemic has been 
slow mccarroll said aids gradually is teaching many people what it 
means to be christian

nearly 5000 people who took the aidsfighting 
drug once known as azt survived at a much greater rate than those 
without it say researchers for the medicines maker 
the finding confirms the lifesaving potential of zidovudine 
which is sold under the brand name retrovir said a duke university 
physician independent of the study group 
researchers enrolled 4805 patients who had suffered from 
pneumonia common in people with aids and treated them with 
zidovudine the only aidsfighting medication approved by the 
federal government 
seventythree percent of the subjects were still alive about 10 
months after treatment started the researchers reported in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
no direct comparison figures are available for people who didnt 
take the drug since withholding it for study purposes is unethical 
said terri creaghkirk an epidemiologist at burroughswellcome co 
the north carolina company that makes zidovudine 
but records of people who were diagnosed with aids before 
zidovudine became available show only 50 percent survived past 11 
months she said 
zidovudine taken in capsule form inhibits growth of the virus 
that causes aids ms creaghkirk said 
it is considered the mainstay of treatment for adults with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome but does not cure the disease 
the study was designed by the national cancer institute the food 
and drug administration and the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases ms creaghkirk said 
the study provides important confirmatory evidence supporting 
the zidovudines effectiveness in patients with aids and a milder 
form of the disease called aidsrelated complex dr john a 
bartlett of duke said in an editorial accompanying the study 
contrary to earlier predictions of the limited lifetime of 
zidovudine its future appears bright because of the scarcity of 
other medications that can fight the aids virus bartlett wrote 
subjects had to take the drug every four hours in doses starting 
at 200 milligrams doses were reduced for those reporting side 
effects including anemia 
the study started in october 1986 included about 1000 members 
of racial minorities close to 150 women and 300 intravenous drug 
users as well as homosexual and bisexual men ms creaghkirk said 
previous studies had focused mostly on homosexual and bisexual 
men because they represent the largest proportion of aids 
sufferers she said 
subjects were recommended by their physicians who recorded data 
on their conditions during the study period and reported it to a 
coordinating center in beltsville md 
enrollment of new patients continued until march 1987 when the 
drug received fda approval 
of the 4805 subjects 2838 were reported still alive during the 
last 10 weeks of checkups through sept 15 1987 the researchers 
said 
it is likely that many other patients were still alive on sept 
15 1987 although no information concerning them has been received 
since june 30 1987 they wrote 
during the study 847 patients were reported to have died but 
ms creaghkirk said some doctors failed to provide regular updates 
on their patients and more deaths may have occurred without the 
researchers knowledge 
their calculation of a 73 percent survival rate takes into 
account such limitations she said 
other limitations noted by bartlett included lack of confirmation 
of physicians observations possible bias in the way doctors 
selected patients and absence of supervision in reporting of data

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 
revolutionary patriarch reiterated his support for prime minister 
hussein musavi two months after musavi tried to resign 
in a lengthy statement broadcast thursday on tehran television 
the 87yearold khomeini said he had to confirm his support of 
musavi because some people might want to harm your relentless and 
tireless efforts especially on the issue of the war 
as before i regard you as a qualified and sympathetic 
individual for the islamic revolution khomeini said he also 
asked musavi to form an organization to care for disabled war 
veterens 
musavi thanked khomeini for his support calling it an 
encouragement the official islamic republic news agency reported 
in september musavi submitted his letter of resignation 
khomeini rejected it and rebuked him for attempting to resign 
longsimmering differences within the leadership are believed to 
have prompted musavis attempt 
he is regarded as one of the more conservative leaders in the 
split between the conservative and pragmatic camps he advocated 
continuing the eightyear war with iraq which pragmatics headed by 
parliamentary speaker hashemi rafsanjani opposed 
musavi also advocates a more centralized economy and tight 
controls on foreign imports which iran has to finance with scarce 
hard currency rafsanjani opposes musavi on both issues 
the prime minister has had to defer to the will of the pragmatic 
leaders on the war and his views on the economy also are unlikely 
to be implemented as iran moves toward a more laissezfaire economy 
relations with the west and the persian gulf states strained 
during the war are being improved a move which rafsanjani favored 
but musavi opposed

the dollar closed unchanged against the japanese yen 
friday and share prices gained ground on the tokyo stock exchange 
reversing thursdays decline 
the dollar closed at 12115 yen unchanged from thursdays close 
of 12115 yen after opening at 12088 yen the currency moved in a 
range of 12067 yen to 12120 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 9009point 
loser thursday gained 6662 or 023 percent to close at 2940665 
the dollar opened lower after declining in london overnight 
exchange dealers said intervention by the bank of japan and 
bullish comments by finance minister kiichi miyazawa had slowed but 
not stopped the dollars decline 
miyazawa told reporters friday that japan is ready to intervene 
in the currency market to stem volatility in exchange rates 
he also said he sees no need for a meeting of the group of seven 
g7 monetary nations based on fluctuations in the currency market 
his comments followed calls from finance ministers gerhard 
stoltenberg west germany and pierre beregovoy of france for a g7 
meeting after presidentelect george bushs inauguration 
exchange dealers said market sentiment toward the dollar remains 
bearish 
the best explanation about the dollars bearishness is that the 
market cannot find reasons to buy the dollar said a dealer at a 
major us bank speaking on condition of anonymity 
it was the first time since jan 4 that the dollar opened at the 
120yen level 
prices meanwhile remained firm in the stock market securities 
dealers said most shares are rising including exportoriented 
shares despite the strong yen 
the general sentiment of the market is still bullish said

retirement may not bring couples closer 
together and could damage a shaky marriage a study says 
retirement has no beneficial effects on the quality of marriages 
among older people said gary lee a university of florida 
gerontologist and sociology professor 
that does not mean retirement is bad he said but it indicates 
that retirement may not add anything to a marriage and certainly 
will not improve a bad one 
for an event that is supposed to be a real change retirement 
has surprisingly few and surprisingly weak effects lee said 
the negative effects are few but retirement is not going to save 
a failing marriage 
basically people are the same folks they were before they 
retired theyre just not working he said 
one circumstance where retirement may hurt a marriage is when the 
husband retires but the wife continues to work 
lee came to these conclusions after he and an associate 
constance shehan studied the results of marital satisfaction 
questionnaires from 2176 washington state households with at least 
one resident older than 55 
respondents were asked to identify their own and their spouses 
employment status their length of retirement and marital 
satisfaction 
one of the surprises lee found was that even after a husband 
retires he usually does not assist in the domestic chores around 
the house 
lee said this may be a reason women report less marital 
satisfaction after their husbands retire if they are still working 
whether inside or outside of the home 
there is also a minority of couples who have problems because the 
husband retires and then wants to help out more around the house 
lee said that can make wives annoyed and dissatisfied with their 
marriages 
lee said while he found that retirement does not add anything to 
a marriage there are some steps that couples can take to strengthen 
their relationship 
planning may be one thing that will help couples enjoy their 
marriages more and make a smoother transition to retirement lee 
said 
one easy thing to suggest from these results is there is a 
reasonable argument that couples who are both working who retire at 
the same time may find that more beneficial he said

a collision between a pickup truck and

when will a llama become a mama 
it isnt always easy for llama ranchers to tell when one of their 
fat wooly animals is pregnant but a human hospital is cashing in 
on finding out 
were the llama pregnancy factory of the world said glenn 
lee head of outpatient laboratory services for queen of the valley 
hospital 
ups federal express every delivery system in the us pulls 
into the labs driveway at least once a day he said 
the hospital performs up to 600 llama pregnancy tests a month for 
breeders as far away as louisiana texas and canada lee said the 
hospital estimates that it now performs five times as many tests for 
llamas as it does for humans 
llamas prettyeyed longnecked members of the camel family are 
popular as pets and pack animals with baby llamas selling for 
10000 or more people who raise the creatures like to know as soon 
as possible when their animals are expecting 
it can cost you a great deal of time and effort if you think a 
llama is pregnant and she isnt said don judah head of the 
hospitals radiology services and owner of five of the animals if 
she is you can make some money 
queen of the valley hospital began doing the tests in 1982 when 
a local physician who raises llamas asked if the lab could run a 
test on one of his animals word of the labs services spread among 
breeders and what began as a favor soon became a business that 
offers llama breeders the sameday testing and notification it gives 
to its human patients

the government said it will not 
send black leader nelson mandela back to prison when he completes 
his hospital stay but will keep him under guard at an unspecified 
location 
a brief statement on thursday by justice minister kobie coetsee 
did not give any details on when mandela would leave the hospital 
where he would be taken or what restrictions he would face 
the 70yearold mandela head of the african national congress 
guerrilla movement has been recovering from tuberculosis since 
august at the constantiaberg clinic in cape town 
dirk de villiers a spokesman for coetsee said today that 
mandela is still at the clinic 
mandelas health has improved to such an extent that should the 
improvement continue it will eventually no longer be necessary to 
care for him in a clinic coetsee said 
when the time arrives he will be transferred to suitable 
comfortable and secure living accommodations where he will be able 
to receive members of his family more freely and on a continual 
basis coetsee said 
his family will be informed of the locality in due course 
the statement concluded 
the citizen a progovernment englishlanguage newspaper 
reported today that coetsees reference to secure living 
accomodations may mean that mandela would be accomodated in a 
house built for prison officials on a prison farm 
these homes are within the enclosed prison compound and 
therefore mandelas security would not pose an insurmountable 
problem the citizen said 
it also referred to speculation that mandela might be allowed to 
receive visitors outside his immediate family and lawyer including 
the press and that it may become possible to quote him it is now 
illegal to quote him or print his picture 
mandelas wife winnie said in a statement issued by family 
attorney ismail ayob that she attaches no significance to the 
government statement 
mr mandela still remains a prisoner of the south african 
government and there is no indication of any imminent release the 
statement said 
the government statement suggests authorities are attempting to 
release mandela in stages in an effort to temper the publics 
reaction to the countrys best known black leader 
the government has expressed concern that mandelas release could 
reignite black political demonstrations that have largely been 
quieted under the 29monthold state of emergency 
earlier thursday pat robertson a television preacher and former 
us presidential candidate told reporters he had discussed mandela 
during an hourlong meeting with president pw botha at government 
headquarters in pretoria 
robertson said the president told him that mandela will not be 
returned to prison but would be placed in custody to protect him 
from assassination 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life prison 
sentence for conspiring with other leaders of the african national 
congress to wage an antigovernment sabotage campaign 
a prolonged international campaign has sought his release 
mandela was transferred from cape towns pollsmoor prison to the 
staterun tygerberg hospital in early august for treatment of 
tuberculosis he was moved aug 31 to the constantiaberg clinic a 
private hospital in a cape town suburb 
since 1985 botha has offered to release mandela if he would 
renounce violence mandela has refused saying he will do so only if 
the african national congress is unbanned and apartheid is 
dismantled 
botha recently has hinted that mandela could be released without 
renouncing violence but there has been no definitive government 
statement on the matter 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

rival shiite moslem militias backed by 
syria and iran battled with tanks rockets and mortars in the slums 
of south beirut today 
police said seven people were killed and 20 wounded before a 
ceasefire ended the worst fighting in six months 
a police spokesman said most casualties were residents caught in 
crossfire after skirmishes broke out thursday night between the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and the prosyrian amal 
amal is arabic for hope 
both sides accused each other of provoking the clash the 
fiercest since syrian troops were deployed in south beirut in may to 
end two weeks of amalhezbollah fighting 
the spokesman said stray shells hit several apartments in the 
densely populated slum area driving panicstricken residents to 
spend the night in basements and bomb shelters 
the exchanges died down at 330 am after a ceasefire was 
called by a syrian army contingent in charge of security in west and 
south beirut the spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
exploding shells and bursts of machinegun fire echoed around the 
city during the night as the two factions fired mortar rounds and 
rocketpropelled grenades 
i was preparing dinner when the clashes broke out said umm 
mohammed a housewife in south beiruts haret hreik district my 
daughter three grandchildren and i rushed to the basement for 
cover we didnt have dinner she said that during a lull in the 
fighting when i tried to fetch some food from the apartment i saw 
amal tanks rumbling across the narrow alley and the hezbollahis 
started shooting at them 
she said she ventured out this morning to buy food i dont 
trust the ceasefire they will fight again she said 
shortly after midnight fighting spread to the west beirut 
districts of basta nouwairi and zokat blatt when a rocketpropelled 
grenade slammed into the apartment of ayoub homayed a ranking amal 
leader 
the police spokesman said homayed and his family were unhurt 
amal and hezbollah are longtime rivals for dominance of the 1 
million shiites the largest single sect in lebanon 
the fundamentalist hezbollah blamed amal for a failed carbomb 
assassination attempt against four senior hezbollah leaders monday 
in east lebanon 
amal had accused hezbollah of assassinating the militias three 
top commanders for south lebanon in a sept 22 ambush in south 
beirut 
the police spokesman said amal fighters backed by six 
sovietmade t54 tanks advanced about 500 yards across the northern 
flank of hezbollahcontrolled territory in south beiruts mouawad 
district 
he said the two sides were observing a ceasefireinplace 
with amal militiamen refusing to withdraw from the area they gained 
the gunmen are still there god knows when they will start 
shooting again the spokesman said 
schools banks shops restaurants and other businesses stayed 
closed for the day in south beirut and traffic was sparse on the 
usually crowded streets 
schools in west beirut also stayed closed and only a few 
employees turned up for work at banks restaurants and government 
offices 
we do not want to be responsible for the students if 
largescale hostilities break out said khalaf wihbeh a 
schoolteacher in west beirut

when the high school students in this small 
town in the ozarks hold their firstever school dance outsiders 
wont be welcome and neither will reporters 
a ban on school dances at purdy high school was struck down by a 
judge last summer and the first dance is scheduled for dec 10 
although administrators are still fighting it 
im looking forward to it im excited said nancy fox who 
is in charge of choosing a dance theme music and colors for the 
paper streamers 
a group of 21 purdy students including miss fox and their 
parents filed a lawsuit challenging the dance ban in 1986 with the 
help of the american civil liberties union in the past students 
had only small dances at the community center in this small 
southwest missouri town 
the case drew nationwide attention in part because of its 
similarities to the plot of the movie footloose about a 
fictional town where dancing was banned 
us district judge russell clark ruled in august that the ban in 
the rural town of 900 unconstitutionally promoted the values of 
residents who opposed dancing for religious reasons 
the school board has appealed but the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals in st louis has allowed plans for a dance to proceed 
pending its review the court has scheduled arguments in the case at 
the end of the year 
school superintendent sheldon buxton and principal ron richardson 
devised dance guidelines admittedly more restrictive than those at 
other schools 
i dont know of any other schools that are having a dance that 
is this important buxton said this is not an ordinary dance 
buxton and miss fox said the most controversial of the rules is 
one barring from the dance all but the 160 purdy high school 
students 
miss fox said classmates who date students from other schools 
would like to invite them but buxton said he feared outsiders bent 
on disruption would be attracted by the dances notoriety 
i think itll still be fun miss fox said i think that a 
majority of the students will show it will be a fun activity i 
like to dance 
another guideline barring reporters from the gymnasium where 
the dance is scheduled was inspired by the students they want a 
homecoming dance not a forum for the media buxton said 
the administration also vetoed the student councils decision to 
accept a springfield radio stations offer of a disc jockey and 
music for free 
buxton said the station had made derogatory comments about the 
board i am trying to neutralize what i consider to be an 
emotional thing the purdy dance case had been the subject of 
humorous skits and comment on the station 
miss fox said other disc jockeys and stations also have offered 
free music and student leaders are making a second choice i 
dont really think itll matter too much who it is as long as 
theres music miss fox said

gunmen apparently targeting a 
sinn fein councilman shot and killed his brother instead police 
said 
phelim mcnally 28 was slain thursday night while he was playing 
an accordion in the kitchen of the home of his brother local sein 
fein councilman francis mcnally police said sinn fein is the legal 
political wing of the outlawed irish republican army 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack which 
the british domestic news agency press association said occurred 
near coagh 30 miles west of belfast 
an officer at belfast police headquarters confirmed a man was 
killed but refused to elaborate a press officer in belfast later 
said the gunmen may have been seeking to kill the councilman not 
his brother 
the press officer said the gunmen believed to number three 
fired through the kitchen window from outside the house the 
brothers were the only ones at home at the time police and news 
reports said 
the news agency said the victim had been to the hospital to visit 
his wife who is expecting their sixth child and then visited his 
brothers house the news agency also said it appeared he may have 
been mistaken for his brother 
earlier thursday night a british soldier suffered leg injuries 
in a bomb attack on an army patrol in the roman catholic area of 
west belfast 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the bomb attack 
but suspicion fell on the ira which is fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland the mainly catholic ira wants to unite the 
predominantly protestant province with the 95 percent catholic 
republic of ireland under socialist rule 
on wednesday night an ira bomb attack on an unmanned parttime 
police station at benburb 35 miles west of belfast killed a 
67yearold catholic and his 13yearold granddaughter eight 
civilians were wounded 
the ira claiming responsibility called the deaths of barney 
lavery and emma donnelly tragic their deaths bring the total of 
innocent civilians killed in bungled ira attacks the last 12 months 
to at least 19 
in london on thursday the british government proposed 
legislation that among other things requires northern ireland 
election candidates to sign a declaration disavowing terrorism 
northern ireland has been plagued by political and sectarian 
violence since august 1969 and more than 2700 people have been 
killed the ira is outlawed in both britain and ireland 
the antiviolence oath applies to all candidates in the province 
but is believed aimed mainly at sinn fein the law is likely to take 
effect before the municipal elections in may 
sinn fein commands about onethird of the roman catholic vote in 
the troubled province and won about 10 percent of the seats on 17 of 
the provinces 26 local authorities in may 1985 elections 
under its terms elected candidates must sign the declaration 
before they can take their seats if they then voice support for 
violence they can be disqualified from office for five years if 
successfully prosecuted by fellow council members or members of the 
public 
in other proposed measures a law on prison sentences would 
require a prisoner to serve twothirds of his time instead of being 
eligible for parole at midpoint in his term as under current law 
the northern ireland office says onefifth of offenders released in 
1984 committed offenses within two years 
another measure limits banking secrecy and empower courts to 
seize funds believed to be earned from racketeering related to 
terrorism 
last month britain banned broadcast interviews with members of 
the ira and 10 other militant northern ireland groups catholic and 
protestant the government also plans to end the right of suspects 
to remain silent under police interrogation 
the laws are virtually certain to pass in the house of commons 
where prime minister margaret thatcher has a huge majority

radical students and buddhist monks 
demanding the arrest of former president chun doohwan hurled 
hundreds of firebombs today at riot police in street clashes after 
authorities blocked a protest march 
radicals battled police in streets and alleyways around dongguk 
university in eastern seoul about some 2000 students from 10 seoul 
colleges tried to march out despite freezing temperatures about 
1000 protesters stormed out of the college to bombard troopers with 
rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing gasoline 
arrest chun doohwan protesters shouted yankee go home 
several thousand riot police in green combat fatigues and black 
visored helmets ringed the campus to stop students breaking through 
troopers fired volleys of choking tear gas and hurled back rocks and 
other missiles 
police had no immediate word on casualties or arrests 
student leaders at an earlier campus rally denounced chuns 
apology on wednesday for corruption and human rights abuses leaders 
demanded the former president be arrested and prosecuted for 
numerous alleged crimes 
protesters also denounced president roh taewoo and demanded he 
also be punished speakers told the cheering crowd that roh was 
guilty of corruption and was trying to protect chun 
protesters burned an effigy of roh before marching out with 
banners and flags to try and parade through the city punish roh 
taewoo protesters chanted 
buddhisht monks armed with firebombs joined the students in the 
fighting chun has taken refuge in a remote buddhist monastery on 
the east coast and the monks claimed his presence there was a 
desecration of a holy place 
drive out chun from our sacred temple the monks chanted 
chun in a nationally televised speech wednesday apologized for 
abuses under his sevenyear authoritarian rule chun said he was 
surrendering his personal property and going into internal exile 
chun has denied any personal corrutpion but some of his 
relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged with 
embezzlement and other offenses 
dissident groups refused to accept the apology as sufficent and 
said chun must be prosecuted the main opposition parties have also 
said further explanation is necessary 
roh a former close associate of chun is scheduled to make a 
statement saturday in which he may pardon the former president or at 
least ask for public mercy the announcement probably would trigger 
further outbursts from radicals and other opposition groups 
earlier the presidential office said roh would appear on 
national television tonight to make the statement but it changed 
the day 
enough has been done roh told governing party officials on 
thursday as a long friend i felt deep sorrow for the former 
president who had to leave in such a way 
roh is trying to defuse public anger against chun without 
damaging himself and his government many koreans see the roh 
administration as a continuation of the chun government 
roh a former general who took power in february after winning 
elections in december has introduced broad democratic reforms he 
has dismantled many of the authoritarian controls imposed by chun 
who took power with military backing in 1980 
north korea today called chuns apology an offspring of 
conspiracy and compromise between chun and the south korean 
government 
the official north korean central news agency quoted a 
spokesman of the committee for the peaceful reunification of the 
fatherland as saying chun tried to gloss over his shocking 
murderous atrocities including the kwangju bloodbath and all kinds 
of irregularities with the monosyllable word i apologize 
a 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of kwangju was 
violently quashed by the military resulting in the deaths of about 
200 people 
it is preposterous indeed to try to dispose of chuns crimes 
with something like an apology the unidentified spokesman was 
quoted as saying 
the two koreas have remained bitter rivals since the korean 
peninsula was divided into the communist north and prowestern south 
at the end of world war ii both sides fought the bloody korean war 
in 195053

an expected bumper crop of poppies in the golden 
triangle of southeast asia probably will lead to a huge shipment of 
heroin into the united states a top us drug enforcement official 
said today 
thomas c kelly deputy administrator of the drug enforcement 
agency also said shipment of heroin from the golden triangle 
through china has become a serious problem that beijing authorities 
are working to control 
much of the heroin smuggled into the united states where about 
500000 people are believed addicted to the drug comes from the 
remote territory where burma laos and thailand meet 
the past couple of years weve had bumper crops coming out of 
the golden triangle kelly told reporters in hong kong this 
year appears to be no exception to the bumper crop of the poppy 
and we are projecting there is going to be a tremendous shipment of 
heroin into the us he said 
chinese officials are still learning how to fight the smuggling 
and have talked to us drug enforcement agents about the 
possibility of additional training he said 
kelly who is visiting hong kong after attending an interpol 
meeting in thailand said the role of this british colony in 
international heroin trafficking has increased because it is a major 
transportation hub near the golden triangle 
the amount of heroin coming through hong kong is likely to rise 
with the continued good harvests he added 
kelly said there were no reliable estimates of the amount of 
heroin shipped from hong kong to the united states or what 
percentage of the drug reaching america is shipped through this 
british colony 
but he said ethnic chinese have captured much of the us market 
because of their business acumen their contacts in asia and 
crackdowns on the traditional mafia 
us and hong kong drug enforcement agencies have cooperated in a 
number of major heroin busts in the past year 
hong kong police announced thursday they have seized 596 pounds 
of no 4 grade heroin so far this year more than double the 1987 
total of 286 pounds no 4 heroin is the grade used in the united 
states

charles vest said he had just about given up 
hope on finding a way to bring his sister home from alaska so she 
could be with their dying father then from a hospital pay phone 
he called the white house 
vests 71yearold father lester a farmer from trimble county 
was dying of lung and bone cancer and the family couldnt scrape 
together enough money for the elder daughter teresa vest to fly in 
from anchorage alaska 
it had been 14 years since teresa had seen her family 
by the time i called the white house i was to the point that i 
didnt think there was a person in the world that cared that 
unless you were a really big shot it didnt matter vest said 
i called her teresa the night that i took daddy to the 
hospital and it was hard on her said the 28yearold vest who 
quit his job at a small plant in madison ind a month ago to care 
for his father and 65yearold mother who is recuperating from 
openheart surgery 
the next day vest began calling charitable organizations and 
churches for help to bring his sister home to this northern kentucky 
town but without success 
finally through gov wallace wilkinsons office vest was put in 
touch with a socialservices worker who persuaded an airline to 
reduce its alaskatokentucky roundtrip fare by about half but 
that was still too expensive 
it was late in the day and vest and another sister velvet sat 
quietly discussing what to do next 
i said well it probably wont do a bit of good but im 
going to call the white house maybe the president could do 
something if he would vest said 
a long distance operator helped vest reach the white house where 
his call was finally transferred to charlene cozart one of several 
special liasons to the president 
she called me back the next morning and said the tickets at 
the airport all you have to do is pick it up 
ms cozart said the white house gets several thousand similar 
requests each year and they are evaluated on a casebycase basis 
teresa vest arrived from alaska on nov 4 one week before her 
father died 
when i told him she was on her way he said ill have to see 
her walk through that door before i believe it vest remembers 
his father saying it was a real happy moment right in the middle 
of a really sad moment

for the first time since the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini took power in iran a french foreign minister will meet 
with officials in tehran next year the government announced today 
foreign minister roland dumas will travel to tehran at an 
unspecified date in 1989 a foreign ministry spokesman said 
confirming a report carried thursday by the official iranian news 
agency irna 
in november dumas told reporters this voyage to iran will 
take place i cannot say when but i am completely ready to 
undertake it 
the foreign minister has a trip to iraq planned for middecember 
although an exact date has not yet been announced france has been a 
major supplier of arms to iraq throughout the iraniraq war 
the visit to iran the first since the 1979 overthrow of shah 
muhammad reza pahlavi comes at the end of a turbulant period in 
frenchiranian relations 
in june 1987 french investigators sought to question iranian 
embassy translator wahid gordji about possible links to people 
accused in the september 1986 bombings in paris that left 11 people

by the newspaper steinberg also talked about his love for his 
longtime companion hedda nussbaum who is expected to testify 
against him in his murder trial when it resumes next week

almost inexpressible

smile in one of those photographs and you will understand my 
feelings my sadness and sense of loss are more than i can bear at 
times

over the objections of his defense lawyers newsday said 
steinberg indicated that he believes nussbaum whom the 
prosecution says he allegedly abused physically and mentally during 
their 12 years together has changed 
regarding hedda i must tell you that i loved her very much 
all that has occurred since has not changed the feeling i held for 
her steinberg wrote 
i can only hope that she is capable of the truth in relating

yugoslavias parliament today adopted 
amendments to the federal constitution designed to pave the way for 
radical economic changes and streamline the countrys communist 
political system 
the 34 amendments changed 135 articles or about onethird of the 
current yugoslav constitution passed in 1974 during the rule of the 
countrys communist founder josip broz tito 
the 1974 constitution believed to be the longest and most 
complicated in the world granted wide autonomy to the countrys six 
republics and two semiautonomous provinces 
it is generally blamed for the countrys current political and 
economic crisis because it created eight virtually selfruling 
states that must reach consensus when passing any important new laws 
as a result key decisions often are watered down to muddled 
compromises that keep the federal government weak and do nothing to 
control spiraling inflation and foreign debt 
the amendments adopted today were proposed by yugoslavias 
presidency and accepted unanimously by the republics and provinces 
after 21 months of strained negotiations 
they reveal an emerging consensus that yugoslavia should gear its 
economy to an open market to overcome a 21 billion foreign debt 
inflation hovering at over 240 percent and a 15 percent unemployment 
rate 
one of the amendments opens up a possibility of full foreign 
ownership of yugoslav companies and banks operating in the countrys 
several freetrade zones 
previous constitutional provisions allowed only a 49percent 
ownership share by foreign capital which in practice meant 
foreigners could not run joint venture firms or transfer profits out 
of the country 
foreigners will now be allowed to manage control and even lay 
off workers from joint venture companies in which they have a 
majority share 
the amendments also increase maximum private ownership of land 
from 25 to 74 acres and abolish several limits on private business 
and real estate ownership 
the constitutional changes are scheduled to be codified into 
economic laws by the end of this year so the country can introduce 
marketoriented economy at the start of 1989 
a draft of the new economic system approved by parliament 
envisages closing down all lossmaking enterprises introducing 
private domestic and foreign capital investments and the floating of 
stocks and bonds 
in line with other communist countries yugoslavia previously has 
shunned an open marketoriented economy and several attempted 
reforms have foundered due to bureaucratic resistance 
the reform drive comes as the country faces unprecedented ethnic 
and labor unrest with workers protesting low salaries and living 
standards which have dropped to the level of mid1960s according to 
official statistics 
the constitutional amendments however propose no fundamental 
changes in yugoslavias communist political system 
the amendments envisage more direct elections among several 
communist candidates for political posts but no other radical 
changes

the venerable pioneer 6 solar orbiter saturday 
will make its closest pass of earth since its launch 23 years ago 
continuing on a voyage that has exceeded all expectations 
scientists say 
the 35inch tall craft will change course and come to within 116 
million miles of earth about five times the distance of the moon 
because of the earths gravitational pull 
the tug from earth will add 6 million miles to the satellites 
orbit around the sun 
pioneer 6 built in redondo beach by trw space amp technology 
group has gone long past its life expectancy sending back enough 
information about the sun to force scientists to change many of 
their earlier conclusions 
for instance the satellite showed that solar wind does not flow 
steadily and gently as once thought but boils off the suns surface 
with such fury that it influences events in the outer reaches of the 
solar system 
solar wind consisting mainly of subatomic particule traveling 
about 1 million mph is what causes comets to have tails that can be 
seen from earth

eight victims in a 1987 shooting spree 
have agreed to seek no more than 100000 each from allstate 
insurance co which issued a homeowner policy to the accused gunman 
the cases had been scheduled to go to trial monday in front of 
circuit judge john antoon however allstate contends in a pending 
federal suit that the policy doesnt cover william cruses actions 
on april 23 1987 
cruse 61 a retired librarian still faces a criminal trial in 
march on six counts of murder 28 charges of attempted murder and 
two charges of kidnapping more than 100 witnesses are preparing to 
identify cruse as the gunman who strode resolutely through two 
supermarket parking lots shooting an automatic rifle 
indiscriminately 
the central question in the civil case is much the same as a key 
question in the criminal case was cruse insane on the day of the 
shootings 
allstate maintains in its suit that cruse was sane and that he 
knowingly shot at neighbors in his palm bay neighborhood and at 
people in the shopping centers as a result the company said the 
victims pressing the suit should not be able to collect from the 
insurance policy 
cruses attorneys hope to prove to jurors that he was insane on 
the day of the shootings and therefore have him cleared of the 36 
felony charges 
in the compensation case the amount each victim will receive is 
open to further negotiations with a cap set at 100000 said jim 
nance attorney for the victims

eastwest trade picked up markedly this year thanks 
to the improved political climate and to economic reform in most 
east european countries a un report said thursday 
but the report projects that the soviet union and its six east 
european allies will register a slight overall deficit in 1988 after 
a combined 2 billion surplus last year while the volume of exports 
increased faster than that of imports the value of imports rose 
more quickly it said 
the report was compiled by experts of the un economic 
commission for europe overall figures for the value of the 
eastwest trade were not given 
the better atmosphere and the economic reforms have been the 
catalyst for a flurry of contacts negotiations and agreements 
the document said it specifically named large credit facilities 
designed to support western exports to the soviet union 
it said eastwest economic cooperation also gained momentum with 
a june accord between the soviet blocs council for mutual economic 
assistance known as comecon and the european economic community 
or eec this accord sets the stage for more intense economic 
interchange it said 
in volume soviet exports to the west rose 12 percent during the 
first half of 1988 while imports rose 10 percent but a 23 percent 
increase in the value of imports accounted for what the report 
called an unusually large trade deficit with the west projected 
to total 24 billion by dec 31 last year the soviets ran up a 
800 million surplus 
in contrast moscows six allies bulgaria czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary poland and romania were forecast to keep a 
combined 2 billion trade surplus with the west compared with 12 
billion in 1987 
in volume exports of the six to the west increased 6 percent 
while imports stagnated in value exports rose 14 percent while 
imports were up 11 percent 
bulgaria was the most significant exception according to the 
report stagnating sales and a continued import boom led to a 
bulgarian trade deficit with the west of 900 million in the first 
six months

moodaltering drugs given to many nursing home 
patients can cause confusion uncontrolled shaking and other effects 
that make the residents appear sicker than they actually are 
researchers say 
little has changed since research a decade ago found that 
dangerous drugs were being overused in nursing homes and that 
doctors often overlooked better medications with fewer side effects 
said dr mark beers chief author of the study in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
moodaltering medications are still being used in enormous 
quantity in the nursing homes with a likelihood of deleterious 
effect beers said in a telephone interview from los angeles on 
tuesday 
the drugs may be used because of inadequate staffing or lack of 
knowledge by doctors prescribing them the report says 
some commonly prescribed sedatives can last several days in old 
people and leave them tired sleepy and potentially confused during 
the day beers said 
what can happen with inappropriate use of psychoactive drugs is 
people might be considered less functional than they actually 
are or more demented than they actually are he said 
the dangers extend even to death he said if disoriented people 
fall or if too many drugs cause adverse reactions or aggravate other 
conditions 
beers and colleagues at harvard medical school in boston studied 
drugs given over a onemonth period to 850 residents at 12 
intermediatecare nursing homes in and around boston 
the residents average age was 85 and 84 percent were women 
according to the study 
beers said the nursing homes were considered representative of 
the boston area and massachusetts an area of the country in which 
medical care is supposed to be very good 
sixtyfive percent of the residents had orders written for 
psychoactive drugs and 53 percent actually took such drugs on five 
or more days during the month under scrutiny the study found 
researchers said the drugs included sedatives and sleeping pills 
antipsychotics medications to prevent loss of touch with reality 
and drugs that fight depression 
about onefifth of the patients had orders written for two such 
drugs in the same month and 7 percent had orders for three or more 
though actual use was somewhat less they said 
statistics for the twofifths of residents receiving sedatives 
and sleeping pills showed 82 percent were getting the drugs on a 
regularly scheduled basis instead of only when there was a specific 
need beers said 
reliance on scheduled regimens of psychoactive medicine 
indicates that these drugs are not used transiently for periods of 
special need the researchers wrote 
instead this pattern of use is compatible with the concept of 
sedation as chemical restraint 
fortythree percent of the drug orders called for use on an 
asneeded basis meaning nurses could decide whether to administer 
the drugs 
thats a doctor shirking his duty said beers who was a 
fellow at harvard but is now an assistant professor of geriatric 
medicine at the university of california at los angeles 
he said doctors might be trying to avoid getting called at odd 
hours to be asked about medication for patients 
some of the drugs involved can cause confusion make it difficult 
to urinate cause constipation and lower blood pressure beers said 
some antipsychotic drugs a class administered to 26 percent of 
patients can also cause parkinsons syndrome a druginduced 
shaking similar to parkinsons disease and other ailments he said 
in a 1976 study by the office of longterm care of the former 
us department of health education and welfare a review of 
records of 3548 nursing home patients found 50 percent on 
tranquilizers and in general serious overuse and misuse of 
drugs among elderly nursing home residents beers study noted 
things are really no better he said tuesday 
researchers began intensive education programs at the nursing 
homes and a followup study will determine if changes were made he 
said

the palestine liberation organization 
applied to the us consulate in tunis today for a visa that would 
allow yasser arafat into the united states to address the un 
general assembly 
we referred the request to washington which is standard 
procedure for a visa of this sort said richard undeland us 
public affairs officer 
zouhdi labib terzi a plo observer at the united nations 
presented the visa application to consul john noyes according to 
jamal sourani a member of the plos executive committee who 
accompanied terzi 
the united states has not said whether it will grant the visa to 
arafat leading to confusion over whether the plo chief will address 
the united nations he hopes to be present for the general assembly 
debate on the palestinian question dec 12 
arafats aides have been referring to the upcoming address as a 
matter of fact earlier this week a plo spokesman said arafat would 
use the speech to ask the general assembly to grant the new 
palestinian state un membership 
the plo was granted un observer status in 1974 following 
arafats last address before the assembly in august the reagan 
administration lost a legal battle to close the plos un mission 
on grounds the plo endorses terrorism 
a us district court judge supported state department objections 
that closing the office would violate the un headquarters 
agreement the united nations also objected but the plo office in 
washington which is not covered by the un agreement was closed 
on thursday arafat told the qatar news agency that the next 
stage of the palestinian fight will be one of a comprehensive and 
effective arab campaign on the regional and international level for 
the victory of the palestinian case and the legitimate and firm 
rights of the palestinian people 
arafat holds an algerian diplomatic passport issued november 1988 
at algiers where the plos parliamentinexile met earlier this 
month to declare an independent palestinian state 
the nov 15 declaration of independence follows a nearly yearlong 
uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip at least 
55 arab and nonaligned countries have recognized the palestinian 
state 
the declaration of independence and political program established 
during the meeting indirectly recognizes israel by accepting all 
un resolutions including one that calls for all states in the 
region to live in peace 
if arafat makes the trip to new york sourani said he would be 
accompanied by about 20 people a plo source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the entourage will include the widow of abu 
jihad arafats top military chief who was assassinated at his tunis 
home in april by a commando unit the plo said the unit came from 
israel but jerusalem denied the charge

a congressional investigator says damage at 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant from radioactive materials and 
toxic chemicals may be irreversible and even the plants defenders 
admit a cleanup would be costly 
the rocky flats plant which makes weapons components from 
plutonium has become the target of safety and environmental 
concerns over the years there have been fires lawsuit settlements 
and studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium contamination 
i dont believe that its possible to reverse the harm that has 
been done at rocky flats said bob alvarez who works for the us 
senates governmental affairs committee which monitors nuclear 
weapons complexes 
i dont think you can retrieve the stuff solvents mixed with 
plutonium thats migrating down to the groundwater at rocky 
flats said alvarez 
the 385acre plant site 16 miles northwest of denver is 
surrounded by a 6550acre federally owned buffer zone 
fred dowsett head of the colorado health departments waste 
management division said concentrations of hazardous compounds in 
some groundwater on the plant site are 20000 times above the 
drinking water standard 
but dowsett said that in itself poses no threat to local 
residents 
the nature of the plant with a large security zone around it 
means groundwater contamination is confined to the area of the 
plant he said theres a large uninhabitated buffer zone before 
it can get off site 
officials say all 107 waste sites at rocky flats are closely 
monitored the monitoring also has intensified in recent years they 
said 
but they acknowledge it might cost hundreds of millions if not 
billions of dollars to undertake an effective cleanup 
william fenzel a general accounting office investigator who 
headed a recent safety study of rocky flats likened predicting 
groundwater flow to forecasting colorado weather 
the department of energy and its contractor rockwell 
international have conceded they lack sufficient information about 
groundwater migration fenzel said because they have decided to 
drill 200 additional test wells around the plant during the next few 
years 
he said that raises questions about just how polluted the site 
actually is 
i think the severity of the problem is such that even if they 
spend an enourmous amount of money on cleanup areas of the site 
still may be restricted for decades and even possibly centuries 
he said 
since rocky flats opened in 1952 large quantities of toxic 
carcinogenic chemicals and radioactive materials have been handled 
at the plant during the plants first 25 years of operation many 
of those materials were dumped at the site 
some of the deadliest substances plutonium uranium americium 
and chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene or tce 
tetrachloroethylene pce and carbon tetrachloride will remain in 
the plants groundwater and soil for decades if not longer 
energy department and epa officials acknowledge that errors in 
waste disposal were made in the plants early years but they 
contend that past and present efforts to clean up some of the waste 
sites have been successful and that levels of contaminants are too 
low to pose severe health threats 
my professional opinion is that a lot of the contamination can 
and will be remediated said nat miullo who oversees the plant 
for the epa

armenian legislators today rejected political 
changes sought by president mikhail s gorbachev and demanded 
annexation of a part of neighboring azerbaijan residents said 
the legislative session came as more than 2000 ethnic armenians 
streamed into armenia from azerbaijan panicked by ethnic rioting 
there that killed three soldiers and left more than 126 people 
injured earlier this week 
it was the worst outbreak of violence since february in the 
caucasus where tensions have run high because of a bitter 
territorial dispute over nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian 
enclave inside azerbaijan 
the legal status of the decisions made by about 200 of armenias 
340 supreme soviet members was uncertain but armenian activists 
called the session a victory for democracy residents said the 
legislators met in their capitals opera theater until 2 am today 
in azerbaijan the chief of information for the azerbaijan 
foreign ministry said the situation in the republics capital baku 
remained tense and that industries in the caspian sea port city 
were closed by strikes 
the official musa mamedov speaking by telephone from baku said 
soldiers had cordoned off the citys armenian districts but that for 
safetys sake nobody is going there 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
in moscow on thursday that tanks and troops were sent to restore 
order in baku and the two azerbaijan cities where rioting flared 
tuesday kirovabad and nakhichevan 
ruben karagosyan chief editor of armenias official armenpress 
news agency said by telephone from yerevan the republics capital 
that a curfew was imposed there thursday night 
karagosyan said 2200 ethnic armenians who fled the violence in 
azerbaijan had been registered as refugees by a newly created 
armenian government commission the republic allocated 28 million 
in aid he said 
the armenian supreme soviet or legislature broke off its 
regular fall session tuesday after a kremlin envoy arkady volsky 
said the situation in the caucasus had become too enflamed to 
proceed the lamwakers had been scheduled to debate the 
nagornokarabakh issue 
about 200 deputies resumed the session thursday night enough 
members for a quorum said victoria manukyan chief of local news 
for armenpress 
mrs manukyan gave no details on the decisions reached but 
rafael popoyan an armenian activist said the deputies again 
demanded unification of nagornokarabakh with armenia and rejected 
the constitutional changes proposed by gorbachev 
they decided that the constitutional amendments do not 
correspond to the interests of armenia or of democracy and demanded 
that new proposals be drawn up in two months that will meet those 
criteria popoyan said from yerevan 
the meeting in the opera house took place in the absence of 
armenias president and top local communist party officials but 
samson tonoyan chairman of the supreme soviet led the session 
popoyan said he said tonoyan announced the decision to a crowd 
after the meeting 
gorbachevs amendments have provoked strong criticism especially 
in the baltic republics where activists argue they would strengthen 
moscows powers at the expense of the 15 soviet republics and 
eliminate the republics right to secede the legal changes are to 
be voted on by a special nov 29 session of the national supreme 
soviet 
the parliaments of estonia latvia and georgia have demanded 
changes in the gorbachev proposals and lithuania has rejected them 
both azerbaijan and the soviet leadership have rejected any 
change in sovereignty for nagornokarabakh with the kremlin opting 
instead for a longterm economic and social development plan for the 
region 
in february ethnic riots broke out in the azerbaijan city of 
sumgait and at least 32 people including 26 armenians were killed 
azerbaijanis said the latest unrest was caused by an illegal 
building project carried out by armenia in nagornokarabakh as a 
purported attempt to reinforce the armenian majority there 
mamedov reported thursday that new clashes broke out in 
kirovabad and said there was an unspecified number of deaths 
however the azerbaijani official said today that he had been 
reporting unofficial information and said he had no official 
information about events there

the municipal council in the 
industrial town of boksburg has voted to ban blacks from public 
facilities that were open to all races for the past few years a 
town official said today 
town clerk johann coetsee said the recently elected town 
councilors voted 17 to 12 thursday night to ban blacks from the 
municipal lake swimming pools town hall and tennis courts 
about 50 residents attended the meeting in boksburg 30 miles 
east of johannesburg the town has a population of 87000 whites 
110000 blacks and 36000 people of mixed race who live in separate 
townships 
the proapartheid conservative party gained control of the 
boksburg town council in the oct 26 municipal election the 
conservatives won control of about 100 municipalities in the the 
transvaal and orange free state provinces 
the party does not have control of parliament and cannot reverse 
national policy but it says it plans to institute strict apartheid 
in the cities and towns it controls 
in recent years white authorities in most areas have been doing 
away with segregation of public facilities 
the conservative party has said it would not necessarily call for 
reposting whites only signs but might employ more subtle means 
of carrying out its segregation policies 
some segregated facilities in south africa now have the sign 
right of admission reserved 
in boksburg the councilors voted to put up whites only signs 
at only one public facility boksburg lake a 37acre former dam 
surrounded by terraces lawns gardens and trees 
coetsee said that after a fence is erected around the lake the 
signs would be taken down but the area would remain open only to 
whites 
he said the council majority decided to bar nonwhites from using 
the town hall because the townships have new community halls that 
are better than the whites hall 
the towns swimming pool had previously allowed nonwhites to use 
it only for organized competitions but the council decided thursday 
that it would be only for whites except in the case of a nonwhite 
foreigner competing in an international competition in boksburg 
the council also rescinded a decision by the previous council 
that allowed tennis clubs to have integrated membership if they so 
desired

new eightyear defense agreement with the united states that forces 
the removal of 72 us f16 fighter bombers by 1992 a spokesman 
said 
spokesman guillermo una told the associated press the cabinet 
approval means the accord will go soon for ratification before 
parliament where the governing socialist party has a comfortable 
majority 
spanish negotiator maximo cajal and us ambassador reginald 
bartholomew signed the texts in spanish and english on thursday at 
the foreign ministry ending negotiations that began in july 1986

government of gen francisco franco 
in the new agreement spain will not receive any us military 
aid in exchange for us armed forces use of two air bases a major 
naval station and nine communications posts

officials have identified a second body 
among the the seven found buried in the yard of a boardinghouse 
this time the remains of a man named in the only murder charge 
against the homes owner 
meanwhile the national attention given to a 59yearold los 
angeles man who helped lead police to the boardinghouse owner 
brought about a reunion with three children he hadnt seen in more 
than 30 years 
the body identified by fingerprints is alvaro bert montoya 
a spokesman for the sacramento county coroners office who requested 
anonymity said thursday 
the only other body identified so far is that of 55yearold 
benjamin fink described by his family as a chronic alcoholic and 
transient who moved into the home operated by dorothea montalvo 
puente earlier this year 
autopsies have been completed on the victims but causes of death 
have not been determined court documents indicate that one police 
search of puentes home turned up 14 bottles of pills and various 
unknown substances 
among the items seized were a book titled 150 commonly 
prescribed drugs an 8inch kitchen knife a quilt with possible 
blood stains a coffee can with lye imprinted on the lid and a 
book called the smell of evil 
police believe puente killed the boarders for their social 
security checks 
social workers and neighbors who reported people missing led 
police to question puente who was interviewed by police after the 
first body was discovered she was allowed to walk away by 
authorities who said they had insufficient grounds to hold her she 
fled the area and was captured five days later at a downtown los 
angeles hotel 
sacramento police using a plane provided by a television station 
news department flew to burbank retrieved puente and returned her 
to custody in sacramento 
the departments actions in letting her go and then using a tv 
stations plane to transport her have been criticized in newspaper 
editorials and by puentes courtappointed public defenders 
sacramento mayor anne rudin said late tuesday that she has asked 
the state commission on peace officer standards and training to 
examine the sacramento department 
michael di miceli a commission official said wednesday the 
review would take 45 to 90 days 
on tuesday police detectives met with social security officials 
to obtain the records of 16 missing tenants of puentes 
boardinghouse police want the payment records of people reported 
missing after living at the home hoping to determine whether their 
social security checks were improperly cashed 
detectives believe the bodies found in the yard may be among 
those on the list of names 
charles willgues sr who left his wife and three children in 
detroit for reasons the family wont discuss met a woman he later 
recognized as puente earlier this month in a los angeles bar he 
called a television station and she was soon taken into custody 
last week a television reporter looking for willgues visited his 
previous apartment and learned that the manager there was holding a 
letter for him the letter was from his daughter debbie sculley 
just weeks before she had tracked him to his old address 
willgues was soon on the telephone to the detroitarea city of 
taylor where his children charles jr 35 sculley and linda 
willgues live

federal regulators have pulled the plug on an 
experimental radiowave device intended to heat malignant tumors 
inside the body and make them stop growing 
the food and drug administration said in a letter that 
researchers have failed to prove the device works on tumors deep in 
the body or that it is safe for patients and technicians 
researchers responded that 10 years of research has shown that 
the heat treatment while not a cure often relieves patients pain 
and extends lives the los angeles times said 
there is no scientific basis whatever for what the fda has 
done said dr f kristian storm iii chairman of surgical 
oncology at the university of wisconsin madison 
storm who helped design the device has been testing it with the 
assistance of 12 researchers at nine institutions including the 
university of california los angeles 
in a letter dated oct 6 robert sheridan acting director of 
fdas office of device evaluation told storm the government was 
withdrawing approval of the socalled magnetrode hyperthermia system 
concentric coil applicator 
the letter said researchers have failed to monitor patients 
internal temperatures during treatments and that the device could 
leak potentially significant levels of radiation 
the times quoted unidentified researchers as saying they have 
told the fda they would monitor the temperature of tumors and 
internal organs during initial treatments but are unwilling to do so 
on a repeated basis during followup treatments because the probes 
are potentially hazardous to cancer victims 
the manufacturer of the system henry radio and henry medical 
electronics inc of los angeles acknowledged there is potential for 
radiation leaks but insisted such leaks fall within established 
safety limits and that all technicians take precautions

sales of existing homes fell for a second 
straight month in october even though mortgage rates declined 
slightly during the month a real estate trade group reported today 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 363 million 
units last month 
the 11 percent october decline followed a similar 11 percent 
september drop sales had been up 22 percent in august after 
falling 45 percent in july 
the pattern of declines in three of the past four months 
indicated that sales have cooled analysts said 
the summer rush is over and despite the window of opportunity 
afforded by low mortgage interest rates in october the surge of 
home sales we saw earlier this year has run its course said john 
tuccillo the realtors chief economist 
tuccillo predicted that sales for all of 1988 would be very close 
to the 35 million homes sold for all of 1987 
the decline in sales was accompanied by a small drop in prices 
the median cost of an existing home sold in october was 88100 
down 100 from the september level however the price was still 41 
percent higher than a year ago when the median home price was 
84600 
the weakness in october reflected a 29 percent drop in sales in 
the west which fell to an annual rate of 700000 units this offset 
a 22 percent rise in home sales in the midwest where the annual 
rate edged down to 960000 units 
sales in the south were unchanged at 139 million units but this 
represented an increase of 86 percent from a year ago reflecting 
perhaps some improvement in depressed conditions in the oil belt 
sales in the northeast were also unchanged at an annual rate of 
650000 units

a bomb blast today damaged the family tomb 
of military president augusto pinochet on his 73rd birthday 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack which 
marred a day of ceremonies in homage to the rightwing leader 
the bomb went off just behind the tomb shortly after 10 am at 
the citys general cementery about 20 blocks north of downtown 
santiago cementery director arturo urrutia told the associated 
press 
the explosion shattered stained glass windows religious icons 
and flowerpots in and around the concretewalled mausoleum 
reporters who went to the site also found that several nearby crypts 
also were damaged 
urrutia first said the explosion blew open the steel doors of the 
mausoleum but the damage turned out to be less extensive than he 
thought 
a second bomb was found and defused by police explosives experts 
according to security officials at the scene they said the 
mausoleum is guarded around the clock and that the bombs apparently 
were planted when a police guard briefly left his post to visit the 
cementerys offices 
leftist extremist groups have been active in chile since the 
early 1980s occasionally attacking military and political targets 
pinochet who was born nov 25 1915 seized power in a bloody 
1973 coup that toppled an elected leftist government in october he 
lost a referendum on extending his rule eight more years and is 
obliged to call open elections planned for december 1989 to pick a 
successor 
the president began his birthday celebrations in the central port 
city of valparaiso with a serenade from a military band in front of 
his residence he later went to the presidential palace where 
military and government officials paid him homage and a folk group 
performed traditional dances

crude prices shot up today following a 
tentative opec deal to end a bitter dispute over production between 
iran and iraq and reduce the cartels output analysts were 
skeptical the pact would last 
opec ministers predicted oil prices would jump to 18 a barrel if 
the accord is signed prices have been at least 4 lower in recent 
months 
analysts said they did not believe opec members could restrain 
production for more than a few months if at all 
a rise to 18 a barrel theoretically could add up to 10 cents to 
the price of a gallon of gasoline but analysts said they doubted 
that would happen because retail prices did not fall during the 
recent slump in crude prices 
the tentative deal worked out by the ministers of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to limit their 
production next year was announced late thursday 
irans oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh flew to tehran today 
to get his governments approval for the pact which sets a ceiling 
on opecs production at 185 million barrels a day in the first half 
of 1989 
analysts estimate opec has been producing more than 21 million 
barrels a day recently far above the cartels current cap of about 
15 million barrels 
issam abdul raheem chalabi the iraqi minister also expressed 
confidence the agreement would push crude prices back to opecs 
benchmark of 18 a barrel prices have been at least 4 lower in 
recent months i think we can reach that 18 price within a few 
months chalabi said 
but analysts remained skeptical that an accord would lead to 18 
oil in the near future 
if they have an agreement the market will take it as a good 
deal and prices will go up said cyrus tahmassebi an economist 
for ashland oil inc but once the realities of the market hit 
prices will come down again and sharply 
tahmassebi said among the realities are that the market needs 
only about 17 million barrels a day of oil from opec well below the 
185 million cap the cartel proposed 
in london futures prices rose between 155 and 165 a barrel 
for brent crude the benchmark grade for north sea oil analysts 
said they did not expect prices to go much higher before coming down 
again in the weeks ahead 
oil trading in the united states was closed for the thanksgiving 
holiday 
analysts say each 1 rise in the price of a barrel of oil 
theoretically adds 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices 
the ministers opened their winter meeting monday but postponed 
further discussions until saturday to give them time to end the 
stalemate between iran and iraq which agreed to a ceasefire in 
august in their eightyear war 
the ministers want the production agreement to dry up some of the 
glut on the market so prices will go up 
the major stumbling block to the accord which would replace one 
drawn up in 1986 has been the iraniraq dispute 
iraq has been insisting that its production quota or ceiling in 
any new pact be the same as irans aghazadeh repeatedly said no 
it was not known exactly how that dispute was resolved 
aghazadeh said iran would retain its share of total cartel output 
at 1427 percent i received a new proposal in which my main 
concern which is to preserve my percentage share is taken into 
consideration he said 
with a ceiling of 185 million barrels this would give iran a 
quota of 264 million barrels a day its current cap is 24 million 
barrels 
as for the iraqi quota 11 members have agreed to donate part 
of their share to that country aghazadeh said insofar as this 
particular issue is concerned i find it necessary to consult with 
my government 
but other issues i have agreed to he said 
aghazadeh did not say how large iraqs quota would be under the 
plan its ceiling was set at 15 million barrels under the current 
pact although it has refused to honor that level 
asked if he was still refusing to allow iraq the same quota as 
iran he replied this is exactly the issue which i have to 
consult with my government 
if tehran agrees that other countries could donate part of 
their share to iraq we will be able to have a strong agreement 
he said 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela

a paintcovered crack has been blamed for 
the collapse of a whirling dipping carnival ride that killed a 
17yearold girl and injured six others state investigators said 
an inspection of the monster ride thursday at the broward 
county fair showed that one of its six arms had collapsed at the 
spot of a tiny metal fracture a crack that went unnoticed in 
previous inspections because it was painted over said wally rich 
director of the states bureau of fairs and expositions rust under 
the paint indicted it had been there fore some time he said today 
the onsite inspection showed no signs of negligence or improper 
inspection however he said 
with six inspectors and 1161 carnival rides licensed in florida 
last year its unrealistic to expect inspections with the time and 
sophisticated equipment that would have been needed to detect the 
tiny crack rich said 
it would be almost impossible for us to carry out a program of 
that magnitude he said 
the broken arm and the arm opposite will be studied by a 
metallurgist at florida atlantic university he said his inspectors 
will sandblast the other four arms to search for any other defects 
james e strates shows which owns and operates the broward 
fairs midway purchased the 10yearold ride in the early 1980s 
according to the state investigators 
were terribly sorry this thing happened said ben e 
braunstein a spokesman for the orlandobased strates shows this 
was purely and simply an accident 
christie schafale died of head injuries suffered in wednesdays 
accident her brotherinlaw christopher burch 23 was 
hospitalized in stable condition with fractured ribs and chest 
injuries five others were treated for injuries 
only hours after the accident a shooting at a house where 
friends of ms schafale had gathered left one youth dead and a 
second charged with murder police said 
peter tersigni 19 had been arguing with sean stemmerman 18 
and stemmerman picked up a shotgun and aimed it at tersignis chest

group of ruling party officials that enough has been done 
as a long friend i felt deep sorrow for the former president 
who had to leave in such a way roh was quoted as saying any 
legal action against him is not only undesirable but also against 
the repeated promise by all opposition leaders objecting to 
political reprisals

than last year 
the 12th day would cost 1378563 down 06 percent said robert 
christian director of economic and fixed income research at 
provident national bank 
if you were to buy or hire each item every day it is mentioned in 
the popular carol youd spend a total of 6774574 down 14 
percent from last year 
this may be due to a decrease in the price of five gold rings 
which are down 125 or 20 percent from a high of 750 in 1987 
christian said people just arent buying them in groups of five 
anymore these days usually one will suffice 
besides gold rings the real deal this year is a partridge in a 
pear tree 3995 down 5 because of lower pear tree costs pipers 
piping and drummers drumming cost more this year and all other

a woman found guilty of trying to 
kill her comatose son by cutting his throat with a razor blade got a 
oneyear suspended prison term a court spokesman said friday 
in court earlier this month the woman admitted that in february 
she tried to cut the neck artery of her 20yearold son patrick 
who has been unconscious for 16 years since he fell through ice in a 
pond 
the mother was identified only as philippine g 44 in line with 
dutch judicial practice 
the court recognized that the woman who said patricks suffering 
had become intolerable acted out of compassion the spokesman 
said 
although euthanasia is banned an estimated 5000 cases occur 
annually according to the netherlands royal medical association 
recently dutch courts have meted out only token sentences to 
doctors under unofficial guidelines permitting euthanasia at the 
explicit request of a patient if a terminal illness causes 
unbearable suffering the dutch government is preparing to 
legalize this 
but the dordrecht court noted the woman lacked medical training 
and her son did not ask to die

the reactor from the nations first 
commercial nuclear power plant will be barged down the ohio and 
mississippi rivers in the spring but officials say theres no 
danger to residents along the route 
the reactor from the shippingport atomic power station about 35 
miles northwest of pittsburgh has been emptied of its uranium fuel 
and filled with concrete to prevent any radioactive particles from 
escaping into the environment said dan butler press officer for 
the us department of energy 
the plant commissioned in 1957 was shut down in 1982 the 
federal department of energy and duquesne light the 
pittsburghbased power company operated the plant as a 
demonstration project 
the reactor will be lifted out of the ground in early december in 
preparation for the trip to a federal nuclear reservation 
removing the 1000ton reactor 45 feet high and 18 feet across 
and getting it to the river is expected to take at least several 
days butler said the department of energy wants to wait until good 
weather in the spring before it begins that moving process butler 
said 
it wont be started down the river until spring he said 
winter is not a good time to be going down the river 
its probably the largest single shipment of nuclear waste in 
the nations history david ney a nuclear engineer for the 
pennsylvania department of environmental resources said earlier 
this year 
the reactor will be placed on a seagoing barge on which it will 
travel down the ohio river to the mississippi and across the gulf of

sheila tate george bushs campaign 
and transition press secretary said friday she has taken herself 
out of the competition for the same job in the bush white house 
i found myself in almost a permanent bad mood thinking about 
what did i want to do tate 47 said in a telephone interview 
from transition headquarters in washington 
i talked to members of my family and i just had a reluctance 
to give up the good personal life she said i worked in the 
white house for four years i do not want to go back 
tate succeeded peter teeley as bushs campaign press secretary 
six months ago giving up a public relations executives job with 
the washington firm of hill amp knowlton to do so 
there had been rampant speculation that tate who served as press 
secretary to first lady nancy reagan during president reagans first 
term would be named by bush as white house press secretary 
no woman has ever held that position 
asked if she felt her decision to withdraw would have the effect 
of ensuring that the job go to a man she said there are plenty 
of qualified women so i dont take it upon myself that it is 
less likely 
bush had said that he wants to bring more women and minorities 
into highranking government positions among the names mentioned as 
possibilities for the press secretarys job are tom defrank of 
newsweek magazine and teeley 
there also has been speculation that bush was prepared to offer a 
highprofile job to bernard shaw a cable news network anchorman who 
is black 
tate said that her husband william was willing to have me do 
whatever i wished but said that she had found the campaign and 
transition press secretarys work very demanding she said her son 
hager is a senior in high school and that she and her husband are 
building a new home in mclean va 
tate said she informed bush of her decision on wednesday the 
same day that the presidentelect announced the selection of retired 
air force gen brent scowcroft as his national security adviser 
she said that he did not try to talk her out of it he asked me 
my thought processes we talked for about 10 minutes 
she said they reminisced about the wars wed been through he 
understood my concerns and we left it at that 
tate is the second key bush aide to announce departure plans 
craig fuller who had been bushs chief of staff for the past four 
years said last week that he would be leaving once his work as 
codirector of the bush transition office is complete in january 
were both old faces and why not get some new faces tate 
said 
she said that bush will find the best people for the jobs and i 
know that a lot of them will be women and a lot of them will be 
minorities 
she said that she and fuller and others who may not be remaining 
for the bush administration share above all else a desire that 
george bush succeed 
tate said she believes that bush has a good attitude about the 
role of the press in american life and predicted that he will be 
regularly available to reporters 
hes made no commitments on the number of press 
conferences she said but all you have to do is watch how he 
has conducted himself during th transition period to see that he 
recognizes the critical role of the press 
i dont think the press is going to have any complaints about 
george bushs accessibility tate said

employees at kennewick general hospital

construction 
they say it reminds them of the satirical movie and television 
series mash short for mobile army surgical hospital 
so next friday they plan to come to work dressed as characters

michael frazier will play the part of col sherman potter ms 
smolen said shes not sure if anyone is going to play the part of 
cpl maxwell klinger who wore dresses in an effort to get 
discharged from the army 
the employees cafeteria will serve food reminiscent of the chow 
that disgusted the mash characters including creamed chipped beef 
on toast ms smolen said 
she said the simulation is a way for hospital workers to laugh at 
the construction disruptions instead of getting angry

archaeologists on friday reported 
finding a huge stone age factory in the outback where aborigines 
crafted stone blades and cutting tools for barter some 2000 years 
ago 
scattered among weathered stone outcrops were hundreds of 
thousands of remains of stone tools and implements that point to a 
sophisticated aboriginal enterprise long before europeans set foot 
on the continent 
the site at tiboobura 530 miles northwest of sydney is so large 
that archaeologists believe its output may have formed the basis for 
a local export industry 
almost certainly these people operated the workshop to 
exchange goods said dan witter archaeologist for the 
governments national parks and wildlife service of new south wales 
he said tiboobura is an aboriginal word meaning pile of rocks a 
reference to granite hills in the area the cutting tools were made 
from a silicabased rock 
witter told the associated press the stone age toolmakers most 
likely traded for a mildly hallucinogenic drug pituri the 
australian newspaper in a report on the quarry said pituri was 
used by nomadic aborigines to counteract hunger pains during the 
long treks between hunting grounds 
the find follows the recent discovery of a fragment of human bone 
in central australia that has been dated at 60000 years old 
pushing back the date of human occupation of australia by 20000 
years 
indigenous aborigines number about 160000 almost one percent of 
australias 165 million population 
witter of cody wyo said the site consisted of fragments of 
stone artifacts no stone implements were found but the discards 
indicate blades up to 12 inches long that have only been found 
hundreds of miles away in northern queensland and the northern 
territory 
because the site is so big it appears aboriginal toolmakers 
produced implements mainly for trade and export to other areas of 
australia witter said 
tiboobura is a parched area bordered by three states new south 
wales queensland and south australia 
the remains suggest the inhabitants crafted spear heads and 
knives not only to hunt wildlife such as kangaroos lizards and 
dingoes a native australian wild dog but as a form of industry 
it takes a great deal of skill to make these things witter 
said we have only really scratched the surface of the material 
that is lying around there is clearly a great deal more under the 
ground and that material may prove to be even more important 
stone age tool factories exist elsewhere but witter said the 
tiboobura site was significant because it is the first one found 
where tools were made but not used locally 
theres no other site like this he said 
paul jennings local ranger for the national parks and wildlife 
service said the tools were designed for lightness and versatility 
because nomadic aborigines had to minimise the equipment they 
carried

a freighter that embarked from philadelphia more 
than two years ago with a cargo of toxic waste that no country would 
accept has reached singapore 
now called the pelicano the vessel is believed to have started 
its odyssey aug 31 1986 with 14000 tons of municipal and 
industrial incinerator ash under the name khian sea according to 
published reports and shipping sources it was renamed the felicia 
during a stop for repairs in yugoslavia in july these sources said 
we dont want the pelicano to come in an official of the 
port of singapore authority said thursday 
there is no need to give reasons we dont know its country of 
registration the vessel is anchored outside singapore in 
international waters and has been there for about three days said 
the official who insisted on anonymity 
in a radiotelephone call to the ship by the associated press a 
man who said he was the captain declined to answer questions or 
give his name 
the straits times newspaper thursday quoted a crew member as 
saying in another phone call that the ship originally carried toxic 
waste but disposed of it 
it said the crew member confirmed the ship was previously known 
as khian sea and felicia 
the felicia was last sighted early this month off sri lanka where 
it was denied entry according to lloyds list a shipping 
newsletter there were unconfirmed reports then that it was heading 
toward the philippines 
the environmentalist group greenpeace said earlier this week that 
the ship dumped its cargo somewhere in the indian ocean spokeswoman 
uta bellion said greenpeace learned this from shipping sources 
at least 11 countries on four continents spurned the toxic waste 
a report by the us environmental protection agency said the cargo 
contained aluminum arsenic chromium copper lead mercury 
nickel zinc and dioxins 
other ships are involved in toxic transport but because of the 
length of its voyage the wayward freighter came to symbolize the 
problem of toxic dumping particularly in the third world 
greenpeace estimates at least 11 developing countries have taken 
in waste from the united states and europe since 1986 while 38 more 
were approached the epa said about 22 million tons of toxic 
garbage crosses international borders each year 
said to have been registered in liberia the bahamas and honduras 
at different times the khian sea spent 18 months wandering the 
caribbean seeking an unloading port after leaving philadelphia 
between 2000 and 4500 tons of waste were left in haiti before the 
ship made an unsuccessful attempt to enter delaware bay shipping 
sources said 
senegal in west africa next rejected the vessel before it went to 
the mediterranean and then the indian ocean 
in another phone call to the ship thursday the associated press 
was told by a crewman who refused to identify himself that the ship 
had no cargo on board 
asked where the vessel was bound he said it had no further 
instruction from the owners romo shipping of greece 
the freighter was anchored five miles southwest of the malaysian 
state of johor near singapores sultan shoal lighthouse 
the port of singapore authority spokesman said it was being kept 
under surveillance

about the countrys nazi past 
lawmakers voted 38093 for rita suessmuth 51 previously head of

the number of abortions in the united states each 
year is holding steady according to the latest figures friday from 
the centers for disease control 
the cdc said 1328570 legal abortions were performed in the 
united states in 1985 the latest year for which statistics are 
available thats virtually no change from 1984 when 1333521 
legal abortions were performed 
in 1985 as in previous years the typical woman obtaining an 
abortion in the united states was young white and single with no 
children 
the 04 percent decline in 1985 is the second drop in abortions 
reported by the cdc 
abortions rose from a reported 22670 in 1969 when the cdcs 
recordkeeping began until 1982 then dropped 3 percent in 1983 
the number rose 5 percent in 1984 
since 1980 the abortion numbers appear to be relatively 
stable with minor yeartoyear fluctuations the atlantabased 
health agency said 
dr hani atrash a cdc researcher cautioned that states are not 
forced to report each abortion as they are required to do with 
certain diseases so the numbers may not be precise 
women under age 25 made up 61 percent of all women having 
abortions in 1985 the cdc said sixtyseven percent were white 81 
percent were single and 57 percent had never given birth to a live 
child 
in 1972 when the cdc began tabulating detailed characteristics 
of women having abortions 65 percent were under 25 77 percent were 
white 70 percent were single and 49 percent had never given birth 
to a live child 
the cdc cautioned that the number of states reporting such data 
varies from year to year and trends based on the information 
should be viewed with caution

want a romantic winter evening turn up the 
lights 
thats right brighter 
theres a hormonal link between light and wintertime blues that 
include a seasonal loss of sexual desire says professor russel j 
reiter of the university of texas health science center 
as the daylight hours grow shorter so too does sexual desire 
in nearly 5 million americans affected by the hormonal changes 
reiter said but cravings for starchy foods frequent mood swings 
depression and lethargy increase 
reiter said lower light levels force a tiny pine coneshaped 
pineal gland located under the brain to produce a hormone called 
melatonin which can plunge a particularly sensitive person into 
depression and shut down his sexual responses 
similarly the lengthening daylight of springtime has the 
opposite effect on the melatonin cycle shutting down the pineal 
gland sooner and turning on sexual desire 
reiter said seasonal affective disorder is more common in 
northern states where winter days are much shorter than the normal 
10hour texas days he said women are four times more likely to be 
affected than men 
the common treatment is sitting in a brightly lit room in the 
morning for up to two hours reiter said 
the bottom line is that light is a drug that can have 
significant impact said reiter what im more interested in is 
sex scientifically speaking that is

ranchers who want to know if their llamas are 
going to be mamas are keeping the pregnancy testing lab busy at a 
california hospital 
queen of the valley hospital performs up to 600 llama pregnancy 
tests a month for breeders as far away as louisiana texas and 
canada said glenn lee head of outpatient laboratory services 
the hospital in napa about 40 miles northeast of san francisco 
estimates it now performs five times as many tests for llamas as it 
does for humans 
were the llama pregnancy factory of the world said lee 
llamas prettyeyed longnecked members of the camel family are 
popular as pets and pack animals with baby llamas selling for 
10000 or more people who raise the creatures like to know as soon 
as possible when their animals are expecting 
the hospital began doing the tests in 1982 when a local 
physician who raises llamas asked if the lab could run a test on one 
of his animals word of the labs services spread among breeders 
and what began as a favor soon became a business that offers llama 
breeders the sameday testing and notification it gives to its human 
patients 
this has to be one of the more unusual outpatient services 
said kirkwood reid the llamaraising doctor but its very 
successful the queen is probably the countrys no 1 pregnancy

president reagan on friday 
proclaimed the week of nov 28dec5 as national book week saying a 
free society must prize its libraries just as it values its 
liberties 
anyone who doubts the power or permanence of books need only 
look today at countries around the world where the mere composition 
printing binding and distribution of a book is a prosecutable act 
of defiance against the state reagan said in a proclamation 
released during his vacation 
we can all resolve during national book week to take stock of 
our own reading practices and our attentiveness to sharing books 
with others especially the young the proclamation said

prince mohammed eldest brother of 
king fahd of saudi arabia and a warrior who played an important part 
in the conquests of his father the late king abdelaziz ibn saud 
died friday at the age of 80 
the royal court proclaimed the death to the nation and said the 
prince would be buried saturday 
the conquests of the princes father led to the overthrow of 
turkish domination from the preceding century and the unification of 
most of the arabian peninsula in 1932 into what is now saudi arabia 
the alsaud dynasty does not pass on the rule by primogeniture 
but an inner circle of the family selects kings and crown princes 
whenever needed 
in saudi arabia mohammed was dubbed the maker of kings 
because he declined the crown in favor of king faisal upon the 
downfall of his halfbrother king saud in the early 1960s 
he also refused the throne in favor of another halfbrother king 
khaled after the assassination of faisal in 1975 
mohammed the eldest of the surviving sons of the founder of the 
saudi monarchy was also called abu alsharrain or father of two 
evils because of his fiery temper he remained the most respected 
personality in the house of alsaud and even the kings used to refer 
to him to settle domestic disputes 
in july 1977 mohammed ordered the execution of his granddaughter 
princess mishael and her lover khalid muhallal a nephew of the 
thensaudi ambassador to lebanon 
the execution was ordered by mohammed for adultery as mishael 
was married to a royal cousin she was shot and he was beheaded the 
executions caused a stir in western europe and the united states and 
were the basis for a widely watched british tv show the death of 
a princess

cuban president fidel castro will attend the 
inauguration of carlos salinas de gortari returning after 33 years 
to the city where he planned the cuban revolution officials said 
cuauhtemoc cardenas a leftist leader who lost the july 
presidential election he contends was fraudridden said salinas 
invited castro and other foreign leaders to the thursday 
inauguration to legitimize his victory 
castro will probably arrive in mexico city the day of the 
ceremony according to salinas office 
castro 61 lived in the capital from mid1955 until he and 81 
fellow rebels sailed for cuba on nov 25 1956 from tuxpan on the 
gulf of mexico he has not been back to the capital since 
during his mexican exile castro set up clandestine guerrilla 
training camps raised funds stockpiled weapons and put the 
finishing touches on his plans for the revolution that overthrew 
dictator fulgencio batista in january 1959 
it was also during this exile that he met the argentine 
revolutionary ernesto che guevara who played a key role in 
batistas overthrow guevara died trying to launch another 
revolution in bolivia in 1967 
castro has been to mexico only once since 1956 he held two days 
of talks in the yucatan peninsula resort of cancun in 1979 with 
thenpresident jose lopez portillo 
security is expected to be tight when castro attends the 
inauguration secretary of state george shultz will represent the 
united states at the ceremony 
castro is revered by much of the mexican left rumors he might 
attend the inauguration sparked sharp arguments in leftist circles 
where some feel castro should not endorse salinas victory in the 
july 6 election 
both the right and the left accuse the governing institutional 
revolutionary party of election fraud the party which claimed 
victory with just over 50 percent of the vote denies the charges 
cardenas was the secondplace finisher 
salinas inauguration will be the first mexican inauguration 
attended by foreign heads of state salinas office said only such 
leaders of latin america were invited 
so far the presidents of nicaragua argentina brazil honduras 
uruguay and venezuela are confirmed guests 
cardenas said friday that salinas invitations to foreign leaders 
means that the government of mexico is searching with a certain 
desperation for foreign support because they dont have enough 
internal support 
he was asked if he would advise castro and other foreign leaders 
from attending inauguration 
its up to them whether they want to lend support to an 
illegitimate government or if they dont want to lend support to an 
illegitimate government he said 
cardenas late father the revered former president lazaro 
cardenas befriended castro in mexico 
despite mexican wariness about castros vow to export his 
revolution relations between the two countries have remained 
basically sound mexico was the only country in latin america that 
resisted us pressure to break relations with cuba in the 1960s 
one of the rougher patches in mexicancuban relations came in 
1983 when police arrested two cuban diplomats with a bomb in a busy 
mexico city bus terminal the two were expelled

the children in jesse runnings photo album 
are all shown lying in coffins all died before the age of 16 
jesse and russ running began caring for terminally ill children 
about 10 years ago when mrs running met 7yearold karen a young 
girl who had suffered severe brain damage in a car accident 
all i could do was cry when i first saw her mrs running 
said 
the family cared for karen until she died at 15 i became very 
bonded to that child as though she was our own mrs running said 
since then the runnings have either adopted or taken as foster 
children five other terminally ill children all have died except 
3yearold missy who is still hanging in there 
they presently have six adopted and foster children four of whom 
have severe health problems 
asked why her family takes such il children mrs running said 
its pretty hard to explain 
you have to have words in order to make other people understand 
feelings and thats hard for me to do she said 
missy spends much of her day in a baby seat gasping for air a 
rare blood disease has paralyzed her 
some doctors may call her a vegetable mrs running said 
ive never met a vegetable the children will respond to the 
person they are bonded to even if it isnt any more than a knowing 
look in their eyes or a slight grin 
you can tell when a child is happy that lets you know that you 
are that special person in their life 
photos in her album show one young girl splashing in a swimming 
pool and playing with the runnings biological children another 
picture shows her in a coffin she was 6 
mrs running said her husband works while she cares for her three 
foster and three adopted children they have eight biological 
children but only the youngest 15yearold chris still lives at 
home 
one of the adoptees is a 10yearold boy from south america who 
swallowed a cup of lye when he was about 1 hes a normal kid in 
every way except that he breathes through a hole in his windpipe 
their three foster children include a 23yearold profoundly 
retarded quadriplegic woman a 4yearold girl whos also a 
quadriplegic and who suffers from cerebral palsy and a 2yearold 
girl who weighed little more than a pound at birth and who still 
relies on oxygen to breathe 
the runnings get state aid for their foster children but mrs 
running says its never enough however she said the state does pay 
for the foster childrens medical care and medical equipment 
the children have come to the runnings through referral from 
doctors and wordofmouth some parents have come to them directly 
and asked that they take care of dying children 
its too hard for them to be with the child emotionally she 
said about such parents 
at some point mrs running said she may no longer be able to 
stand the pain 
after each death i go through a lot of soulsearching and say 
i cant do this anymore but then you get another phone call 
asking you to take care of a child who is dying and what do you say 
no for me it seems it starts all over again

el nino the warming of pacific ocean 
waters blamed for droughts typhoons and storms worldwide may be 
caused by undersea volcanic lava flows says a study by the us 
geological survey 
the lava from rifts in the ocean floor may bring about the 
dramatic changes in sea temperature air pressure winds and 
currents that characterize the phenomenon according to the study 
the current issue of eos the publication of the american 
geophysical union 
el nino from the spanish for the child because the event was 
noticed to occur around christmas caused staggering economic damage 
on four continents in 198283 it occurred again in 198586 on a 
lesser scale 
herbert r shaw and james g more of the geological survey in 
menlo park speculated that flows erupting through rifts in the 
earths crust transfer much of their intense heat to ocean currents 
flowing around the equator 
according to the theory the warming of the water causes a drop 
in air pressure at the ocean surface that in turn weakens or even 
reverses the normal easttowest trade winds 
the overall result is a drastic alteration of normal weather 
patterns and an abrupt halt to the upwelling of cold currents that 
carry rich nutrients from the sea bottom to the surface along the 
coast of south america 
scientists have been unable to predict when the weather 
disruptions will return but they seem to occur every three to seven 
years with varying degrees of impact and can last up to two years 
the 198283 el nino wiped out fisheries in peru and ecuador 
touched off searing drought in australia and southern africa and 
typhoons in tahiti and caused unusually violent rainstorms in 
california and abnormally wet winters in the southeast 
both the 198283 and 198586 occurrences did major harm to 
fishing off the west coast 
the pacific rim is one of the most active seismic regions in the 
world recent underwater lava flows discovered near the hawaiian 
islands cover nearly 9000 square miles

twentyone paratroopers have been sent to jail 
for up to two weeks each for smashing cars and windows in a rampage 
at a palestinian refugee camp the army said friday 
an israeli officer was quoted as telling a military court in gaza 
city that four soldiers standing trial for the beating death of a 
palestinian from gazas jabaliya refugee camp were following orders 
soldiers opened fire on stonethrowing youngsters in two gaza 
strip refugee camps wounding a 14yearold in nuseirat and a 
16yearold in bureij arab hospital officials reported they said 
both suffered head wounds and the older boy was in serious 
condition a 14yearold arab was wounded in the deir elbalah camp 
hospital officials said 
in the west bank three arabs were wounded two in the city of 
nablus and one in the tulkarm refugee camp hospital officials said 
at least 315 palestinians have been killed and more than 7000 
wounded since an uprising against israeli occupation began in the 
west bank and gaza on dec 8 1987 eleven israelis have been slain 
the paratroopers sentenced to jail attacked the kalandia refugee 
camp north of jerusalem after their bus was stoned sunday night at 
least four cars and 20 houses were damaged 
lt gen dan shomron army chief of staff said there was no 
excuse for the rampage he noted that the paratroopers had attended 
an officertraining course and thus belonged to the military elite 
the incident had nothing to do with a misunderstanding of 
orders shomron said on israel radio the army insists that 
orders be carried out exactly 
standing orders allow soldiers to use force in catching rioters 
but prohibit them from beating people or damaging property once a 
protest has been dispersed and rioters are in custody 
an army spokesman said the paratroopers were given jail sentences 
thursday of one to two weeks and three sergeants received twoweek 
sentences with a further two weeks suspended the squadron leader 
was given a twoweek sentence tuesday 
legislators from both left and right criticized the decision 
yuval neeman of the rightwing tehiya party said the soldiers 
should be pardoned and israel should consider itself at war with 
palestinian activists 
ran cohen of the leftwing citizens rights movement said 
politicians who block peace initiatives should be blamed not 
soldiers facing an impossible situation in the occupied lands cohen 
is a paratroop reserve officer 
the military trial of the four soldiers involves the death of 
hani el shemi 43 on aug 22 in jabaliya 
a report by the newspaper hadashot quoted lt rafil tawil as 
telling the court the order to beat arab rioters came straight 
from the commander of the gaza strip brig gen zvi poleg and the 
soldiers were carrying out the spirit of the order 
haim teferberg a soldier and witness said el shemi was taken to 
the military base in jabaliya accoring to a report in the newspaper 
haaretz 
he was hunched over as he walked and blood was dropping from 
his mouth it quoted teferberg as saying i saw him up close 
they put him into the camp his breathing was heavy he kept saying 
i want to die 
when they put him on the floor i saw a soldier run quickly 
toward him and kick him as though in a karate move after that he 
no longer had a pulse 
this is customary many soldiers beat up prisoners he was 
quoted as telling the court

yule trees are sprouting among the palms 
in central florida where christmas tree farms are a growing 
business 
the 9yearold florida christmas tree growers association has 
grown from 23 to nearly 300 members in eight years said roger webb 
associate professor in the university of florida forestry department 
still 750000 christmas trees are brought into the state from up 
north while only about 50000 trees are grown and sold in florida 
mostly in states midsection a fertile belt with bountiful 
citrusproducing groves 
we still play secondfiddle to the northern christmas tree 
industry we still have lots of room to grow in florida webb 
head of the live oak reserve center for research in christmas trees 
said recently 
most of the farms which average five to seven acres are in 
small towns near metropolitan areas 
if youre going to have a florida christmas youre going to 
have to buy a florida christmas tree said fred lloyd who has 
been growing christmas trees for four years in plant city about 20 
miles east of tampa better known for its winter strawberry harvest 
lloyd and other farmers experiment with growing trees like the 
virginia pine in florida but theres also the scrappy native 
florida sand pine the lush aromatic red cedar and the leyland 
cypress 
for 20 to 30 customers at lloyds farm can cut their own 
8foot red cedar and take it home 
like the lloyds many tree farmers are longtime farmers who added 
christmas trees to help shore up incomes others are retirees or 
businessmen who grow trees in their spare time 
webb says growing trees requires diligence hard work and usually 
a minimum of four years before a farmer sees any return on his 
investment 
out of 100 interested people we might get five that end up 
in christmas tree production he said nobody gets rich quick 
but people in the business once they have really gotten into the 
business sell everything they have 
large wellestablished farms gross as much as 37000 in the 
threeweek season beginning with the weekend after thanksgiving 
webb said 
with regular trimming the trees generally assume the conical 
shape of the traditional tinsel bearers 
but particularly in a state where the industry is in its infancy 
there are some that fall victim to the treetrimmer in training 
last year some of my trees looked like telephone poles

former soviet dissident natan sharansky on 
friday lashed out at what he called intolerance among israelis of 
differing beliefs saying such attitudes endangered the nations 
existence 
sharansky who arrived in israel in 1986 after being imprisoned 
for nine years in the soviet union singled out the mistrust between 
religious and secular jews which escalated after four religious 
parties won unprecedented political power in the nov 1 elections 
it seems that we need a cataclysmic war to concede the 
communality of our destiny sharansky wrote in an article 
published in the englishlanguage daily jerusalem post 
to illustrate the point he recalled that when he first arrived 
in israel people speculated that his wife avital would force him 
to wear the skullcap worn by observant jews mrs sharansky is 
observant while he is not 
the gossip lost its humor for me when i began to realize that 
it contained disbelief in our ability to live happily together 
despite our different customs wrote sharansky who during his 
long imprisonment became a symbol for the struggle of soviet jewry 
sharansky said a stranger recently congratulated him for not 
wearing a skullcap 
i felt even my own bald pate was being conscripted into service 
in a kulturkampf cultural struggle my supporter was not 
interested in my soulsearching he was only interested in knowing 
if i was on his side or theirs he wrote 
sharansky 40 also cited the practice by soviet authorities of 
placing prisoners of radically different backgrounds in the same 
cell to break their spirits 
our only recourse was to be as tolerant as possible of each 
other and unite against the common enemy sharansky wrote 
he said such unity was rare in israel 
we are so inured to selfhatred so accustomed to our own 
antisemitism that when it raises its monstrous head it hardly 
raises a ripple sharansky wrote 
he also expressed disillusionment with israels political system 
after participating in free elections for the first time in his life 
the election gave the rightwing likud bloc 40 seats and the 
rival labor party 39 with the rest going to small rightist leftist 
and religious parties the result has been a flurry of political 
bargaining as likud tries to form a coalition government 
sharansky said all parties had shown their readiness to sell out 
in exchange for a place in the new government 
principles were being auctioned off with dizzying dispatch it 
was not a pretty sight wrote sharansky who despite overtures 
from many political leaders has not joined a party 
sharansky suggested that electoral reform might alleviate some of 
those problems but added that ultimately it will be our 
ability to see ourselves in every face around us which will 
truly bring us to the promised land

voters in this college town are considering 
a crackdown on polystyrene coffee cups and other food containers 
made of longlasting plastic foams 
the proposal is expected to come before the 350yearold 
institution of the town meeting on monday in the community of 35000 
people 
the aim of the ban is to discourage the use of plastics because 
they are not easily biodegradable take up considerable space in the 
town dump and release gases that deplete the earths ozone layer 
when they are manufactured and burned according to sponsor cynthia 
pauley 
but a spokeswoman for the polystyrene packaging council a trade 
group in washington dc disputed those claims saying researchers 
have found that fastfood packaging takes up only onequarter of 1 
percent of landfills by weight and volume 
spokeswoman betsy decampos said the polystyrene industry 
voluntarily agreed to stop using chlorofluoromethane in the 
manufacture of plastic cups by january out of concern for the ozone 
layer 
and decampos contended that plastic is not the only material that 
takes a long time to decompose there are newspapers that are 50 
years old that are still intact and readable she said 
several communities from oregon to florida are considering bans 
on polystyrene cups bans already are in effect in berkeley calif 
and suffolk county ny on long island this summer massachusetts 
gov michael s dukakis issued an executive order banning state 
agencies from purchasing plastic foam food packaging the ban goes 
into effect in july pauley said 
however pauley said backers of the amherst law would be 
satisfied with a sixmonth study of the problem a measure that the 
selectmen are expected to propose

when joseph sexton and bethanne thye 
were married they promised to love honor and respect each other 
but the respect part of the vow which they agreed to seal by 
sharing surnames has not been easy to fulfill 
the university of florida law students are challenging the state 
department of highway safety and motor vehicles for not allowing him 
to combine his surname with hers on his drivers license 
basically what my wife could do for free i would have to go out 
and hire an attorney to do he said and thats what struck me 
as wrong with the whole system 
a 1952 florida supreme court decision allows a name change only 
with a court order which he estimated would cost 200 
but officials stand behind the policy that allows women to change 
their names when they marry but requires men to have court orders 
you must admit that it is a custom of the american way of 
life said glenn blocker assistant director of the division of 
drivers licenses its been with us for eons centuries 
a second couple has challenged the policy as sex discrimination 
michael and susie boydstonwhite of tallahassee sued nov 15 in 
leon county circuit court claiming the policy is unconstitutional 
because it allows women a courtesy not provided to men 
the thye sextons who initiated their challenge in july have a 
hearing tuesday before the division of administrative hearings 
before their aug 8 1987 marriage sexton and thye decided to 
take each others surname out of respect when they returned to 
gainesville from their wedding the couple went about getting legal 
papers changed to their new name

the government wont neglect political 
reforms despite the heavily economic background of new premier 
miklos nemeth and economic reform theorist reszo nyers officials 
said friday 
communist party leader karoly grosz who relinquished his 
additional post as premier thursday in favor of the 40yearold 
nemeth said the new team would be better able to manage the reform 
program of austerity combined with economic and political change 
nyers 65 was appointed to the newly created post of minister of 
state for economics 
he and minister of state imre pozsgay are two of the most adamant 
proponents of reform in hungarys communist leadership pozsgay 
reported to parliament thursday on planned political reforms 
indicating he will take charge of this area 
at a news conference friday he denied political reforms have 
taken a back seat to necessary economic changes 
he said the draft of a new constitution which may allow for a 
multiparty system could be ready in six months but it cannot be 
adopted until 1990 to allow for broad social debate he said 
in an interview with the government daily newspaper magyar 
hirlap nemeth said recent lessening of tension between the 
superpowers created favorable conditions for hungarys reforms 
this is a rare fortunate moment in history when both our 
allies and the other side are taking an interest in the 
success of the hungarian reform policy nemeth told the daily 
in this changing europe we live in we have to emerge as a 
country which promotes the overcoming of the continents divide 
without any local tensions he said 
under grosz hungarys leadership has been grappling with 
unpopular reforms to revive the stagnating economy and curb a 17 
billion debt 
nemeth like grosz would like to see the development of what the 
leadership calls a socialist market economy 
nyers considered the pioneer of economic reforms in the 1960s 
was returned to the countrys top leadership last may after being 
ousted from the ruling politburo in 1974 
grosz told western and hungarian journalists in an impromptu 
interview friday that he supports both men wholeheartedly 
he described nemeth who spent a year at harvard university in 
the mid1970s as a gifted young man and outstanding economist 
asked why the second post was created and why nyers lost his bid 
challenging nemeth for the premiership grosz said the two would 
complement each other in a way impossible in the reverse 
constellation 
you cannot imagine the amount of drudgery the premier faces 
around the clock grosz said there is little time to deal with 
theory 
he described nyers as a farsighted scholar who for 20 years 
has dealt with theory rather than daytoday work 
grosz 56 said he hoped nemeth would bring in young people 
capable of taking on burdens preferably those in their 30s

presidentelect george bush said 
friday he would turn his attention quickly to the problem of cutting 
the us deficit but he brushed aside questions on reports he may 
attempt to trim 35 billion to 5 billion from medicare 
i keep reading in the papers a lot of things im supposed to be 
doing that i dont know anything about bush told reporters during 
a shopping trip while on a fourday thanksgiving vacation at his 
familys oceanside retreat 
bush indicated he has made no decisions yet on budget cuts 
dont make judgments based on stories that dont really have any 
authority behind them bush said 
a spokesman stephen hart said suggestions on medicare cuts were 
completely speculative 
its premature for anyone to speculate about the budget hart 
said 
bush worked for several hours in a small cabin which serves as 
his office in the family compound but told reporters he had no 
appointments during the holiday 
bush spoke with reporters briefly as he and wife barbara made 
their morning shopping round including a stop at a wine and cheese 
shop named the tipsy mouse where he picked up goodies to serve 
reporters at a reception later in the day at their house 
the vice president also visited a video store where he rented 
the movie broadcast news and dropped by a hardware store and a 
golf equipment shop at a local country club 
meanwhile sources close to the vice president who spoke only on 
the condition of anonymity said the selection of a new defense 
secretary remained up in the air key advisers remained deeply 
divided on the prospect of filling the post with former senate armed 
services chairman john tower of texas the sources said 
bush himself has given few clues but in recent days has appeared 
to discourage suggestions that it would be tower in any event bush 
said he has not yet made up his mind 
bush declined to comment further on recent news reports 
including one in fridays editions in washington post that his 
administration would go along with billions of dollars worth of 
medicare cuts expected to be proposed in president reagans final 
budget submission to congress in january 
asked whether he advocated any cuts in medicare funding bush 
said only that my view is ill address the whole budget problem 
very soon 
bush vowed earlier this week to appoint negotiators on the first 
day of his presidency to meet with members of congress on budget 
cuts richard darman his choice as budget director suggested the 
strategy whereby bush would refrain from submitting his own rewrite 
of the reagan budget but instead would work behind the scenes with 
congress to forge a compromise 
but darman also has said that medicare is an area where bush will 
look for savings without changes the giant health insurance 
program for the elderly is projected to cost the government 977 
billion in fiscal 1990 which starts next october an increase of 
145 percent over the current year that rate of growth is four 
times the expected rate of overall inflation 
bush has insisted he will not support any form of tax increase 
and would seek to reduce the nations 150 billion budget deficit 
with a flexible freeze on spending such as freeze would hold 
overall spending at the level of inflation with expenditures in new 
areas offset by cutbacks in others 
the bushes were to have dinner friday night at their home with 
cardinal bernard law the archbishop of boston 
toward evening bush jogged on a dirt road near his home wearing 
an oak ridge boys sweatshirt 
hanna has been replaced by the oak ridge boys bush 
playfully shouted at reporters the day before bush had worn a 
sweatshirt bearing only the word hanna and aides said they had 
no idea what it meant later the mystery was partially resolved 
with their explanation that it had come from a high school somewhere 
in pennsylvania

leaving office in an fbi investigation into efforts by w patrick 
moriarty to influence lawmakers to allow the sale of safe and 
sane fireworks 
young was convicted of accepting payments and favors such as use 
of a vehicle and of laundering 18500 in campaign contributions 
from moriarty to other candidates for office 
he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined 5000 fine but 
remained free on bail and served no time 
the us supreme court ruled last year in a case from kentucky 
that the right to good government cannot be the basis for a mail 
fraud conviction 
federal prosecutors nevertheless urged the appeals court to 
uphold youngs conviction arguing that he had defrauded the public 
of his salary office expenses and consulting fees gained solely 
because of his office 
the ruling does not prevent the government from seeking another 
trial on a theory of property fraud 
moriarty was released from prison nov 3 after three of five mail 
fraud convictions were overturned he had admitted laundering 
campaign funds paying kickbacks and promising hidden business 
interests to public officials

a lawyer for a fund created in the wake of 
the three mile island nuclear reactor accident contends the 
department of energy is blocking researchers from crucial data on 
the accidents longterm health effects 
the three mile island public health fund which supports health 
research filed a petition this week with us district judge sylvia 
rambo asking that the department be ordered to turn over health 
records it and previous federal agencies have collected since the 
beginning of the nuclear age 
considered the worlds most extensive compilation of 
atomicrelated health data the records cover 300000 people who 
have worked since 1943 at federal nuclear weapons and energy 
research and production laboratories 
the department has acted in bad faith and has no present 
intention of releasing he data the funds attorney daniel 
berger said in his brief filed wednesday 
the data holds the promise of producing more precise and 
authoritative estimates of cancer risks of lowlevel radiation 
exposure than was previously available the brief said 
the tmi public health fund was created in 1981 by a settlement in 
a classaction suit bergers father david had filed against 
subsidiaries and contractors of general public utilities corp 
owner of tmi 
the unit 2 reactor at the plant was severely damaged in a march 
1979 accident when a series of operator errors and equipment 
malfunctions allowed a loss of cooling water which led to the 
melting of some of the uranium fuel and the release of some 
radiaoctive particles and gas 
the settlement created a 20 million fund to pay damages and the 
5 million health fund to back research bergers firm manages the 
health fund under the supervision of ms rambo 
berger said researchers supported by the fund alice stewart and 
george kneale of birmingham university in england cannot move ahead 
with a 14 million four to sixyear study without the does 
complete computerized records 
the studys goal is to examine cancer risk from lowlevel 
radiation among federal nuclear energy workers and use that to help 
better understand the effects of the march 1979 tmi accident 
the new york times has reported that the department was prepared 
last month to reject the funds may 1987 freedom of information 
request for the data but reconsidered when the times asked about 
it the times reported thursday that the department was still 
rethinking its 24yearold policy against releasing the raw health 
data 
department spokesman jeff sherwood said friday that standard 
policy is not to comment on matters pending before the courts 
normal court procedure gives the department 15 days to file a 
response 
in its petition the fund contends the department verbally agreed 
in january to release the data with some restrictions but a short 
time later said it would turn over only those records used by 
department researchers for previously published studies 
ms stewart and kneale argue that it would be meaningless to work 
with data screened by somebody else and that they need to see the 
complete records themselves both have worked on previous doe 
radiation health studies according to the brief 
the fund also said the department deliberately tried to put the 
records further out of reach the department has said the fund would 
need clearance from 21 states and us territories that were 
promised the death and health records they submitted would not be 
released to outside researchers it initially said clearance from 
all 50 states was needed 
after the fund filed the freedom of information request the 
brief contends the department tried to establish formal agreements 
with more states ensuring the death data from the states could not 
be released

the red cross said friday it is hopeful a 10day 
air shuttle can repatriate more than 1500 disabled iraqi and 
iranian prisoners as planned although the exchange started with 
fewer prisoners than expected 
on thursday the first day of the exchange each side sent back 
fewer than half the number of prisoners envisaged under an accord 
they signed earlier this month with the international committee of 
the red cross 
red cross officials said they were working with both sides to 
resolve the problems in the first major exchange of prisoners since 
a ceasefire aug 20 ended fighting in the 8yearold war between 
the persian gulf neighbors 
the international committee spoke of a setback but spokesman 
juerg bischof said it is hopeful the goal of returning all sick or 
wounded prisoners by the end of the year can be achieved 
he said red cross delegates in baghdad and tehran were in touch 
with the responsible officials and other contacts were made through 
diplomatic channels in an effort to reconcile differences of 
interpretation 
bischof said plans to continue the exchange saturday remained in 
effect and we hope that this time the numbers of returnees will 
be as planned 
under the accord 115 iraqis and 41 iranians are to be 
repatriated daily in air shuttles between the capitals except on 
friday the moslem holiday 
on thursday only 52 iraqis and 19 iranians were flown home 
aboard a dc9 jet chartered by the red cross 
iran said 36 of those chosen for the first flight sought or 
already had been granted political asylum and 27 had recovered from 
illness and no longer met the criteria for repatriation 
iraq accused iran of reneging on the accord and responded by 
reducing the number of iranians sent home 
bischof would not comment on the iraqi charges 
he said the accord was based on a list of 1569 disabled pows the 
red cross compiled some years ago 
this old list was the only concrete basis he said at 
least it was something to work with as no other sick and wounded 
prisoners have been registered yet by the icrc only if the whole 
list has been covered will we be able to say how many no longer met 
the criteria for repatriation 
all prisoners are examined by a threemember commission two 
swiss red cross physicians and a local doctor subsequently each 
prisoner is asked by a red cross delegate without witnesses to 
make sure he agrees to repatriation 
under the accord both sides agree that red cross registration of 
all other disabled prisoners can begin dec 5 
we have no reason to assume that this date will be changed 
bischof said 
more than 100000 prisoners of war are believed held by both 
sides 
in iran meanwhile speaker of parliament hashemi rafsanjani 
vowed that iran would never start a war and warned that his country 
must be wary of new attacks by iraq the islamic republic news 
agency reported friday 
rafsanjani in remarks to a gathering of paramilitary troops in 
tehran on thursday said iraqs commitment to peace was 
questionable the agency reported

only about 20 percent of people at high risk of 
complications from the flu are immunized against the disease each 
year the us centers for disease control said in its weekly report 
friday 
however state and local flu vaccine programs are increasing and 
some reach hundreds of thousands of people at risk for flu 
complications federal health researchers said 
the cdc recommends flu vaccine especially for elderly americans 
heart patients people with chronic health problems and others at 
increased risk of severe and possibly even fatal complications 
from influenza 
cdc spokesman don berreth said the major complication of 
influenza is pneumonia but it also can exacerbate any existing 
condition such as heart disease diabetes or kidney disease 
healthcare providers should make every effort to ensure that 
highrisk persons are immunized during routine healthcare contacts 
during the fall and early winter the atlantabased cdc said 
flu season in the united states traditionally occurs during cold 
weather months 
the cdc noted three programs that have achieved success in 
distributing flu vaccine to atrisk people an allegheny county 
pa health department program which vaccinated 84 percent of the 
countys nursing home population in the 198687 flu season a 
california program which distributed some 350000 doses of flu 
vaccine to elderly residents in the 198687 season and a vermont 
program by which the state receives a blue crossblue shield grant 
for flu vaccinations

archaeologists searching fort mchenry for 
underground drainage conduits have stumbled upon a long trench 
presumably used by infantrymen the night the british attacked 
baltimore in 1814 
the bombardment of fort mchenry inspired francis scott key to 
write the poem the starspangled banner later adopted as the 
national anthem 
the trench originally about three feet deep is about seven feet 
below todays surface level and is more than 100 feet long it 
contained a pewter infantrymans button the size of a nickel and a 
10pound fragment of a british cannon ball 
at first the trench was very puzzling but it was the 
infantrymans button and bomb fragment which linked it with the 
war of 1812 the button was of the type worn then during the late 
18th and early 19th centuries said charles d cheek the 
archaeologist in charge of the dig 
the trench was dug around the forts western flank the side 
farthest from the harbor and the british fleet historians believe 
the 600 infantrymen stationed at fort mchenry could have been 
ordered into the trench as a safety measure 
if the british had landed successfully in the attack on the night 
of sept 13 1814 the infantrymen would have been called upon to 
defend the city 
however the british bombardment of the fort killed only four and 
wounded about two dozen the british were unable to get ashore and 
retreated 
the existence of some sort of old trench was known as early as 
1984 when a section was discovered during an earlier dig the 
archaeologists doing the work then were unsure what the depression 
was cheek said 
cheek and six other archaeologists arrived at the fort five weeks 
ago under a 105000 contract from the national park service to find 
the forts original drainage conduits they failed to find all the 
drains 
park ranger paul e plamann said the archaeologists were called 
in to see if there was an existing drainage system that could be 
repaired and reopened because the fort has been troubled with 
deterioration of its brickwork for many years

the nations largest organization of orthodox 
jews on friday condemned interference by some north american 
jewish circles in an immigration law question it said israelis 
alone should settle 
the resolution adopted at the 90th anniversary convention of the 
union of orthodox jewish congregations of america didnt identify 
any particular group as interfering with israeli sovereignty 
in new york leaders of 21 organizations associated with 
judaisms reform and conservative branches were announcing they will 
fly to jerusalem on sunday to plead against a proposal by orthodox 
leaders in israel that would deny automatic citizenship to 
nonorthodox converts 
the question of who is a jew should be decided by the jewish 
people and not by a political body the delegation said in a 
statement 
the orthodox convention which claims more than a million members 
in some 1200 us synagogues said in its resolution it has 
become increasingly fashionable in some north american jewish 
circles to publicly interfere in the most delicate questions of 
israeli foreign policy domestic security and religious integrity 
we call upon all north american jews to desist forthwith from 
public campaigns that only lead to diminishing israels stature in 
the eyes of the general public while further dividing and polarizing 
north american jewry 
the issue arose in the wake of the recent israeli election in 
which neither major party achieved a parliamentary majority 
parties of the religious orthodox which have the swing votes to 
form a government demand a change in the law of return as the price 
of joining a coalition that would be led by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir the law grants israeli citizenship automatically to all jews 
the group visiting israel to oppose any change in the law will be 
headed by ruth popkin past president of hadassah and rabbi daniel 
syme of the union of american hebrew congregations from the reform 
branch of judaism said richard cohen speaking for the delegation 
in a related action the uahcs leader rabbi alexander 
schindler urged reform synagogues throughout the united states and 
canada to fight the proposed change but not allow the controversy to 
turn us away from israel

tens of thousands of people packed bakus central 
square friday facing red army tanks sent by the kremlin to quell 
ethnic rioting and panic in the southern republics of azerbaijan and 
armenia 
a spokesman for the azerbaijan government said by telephone from 
baku that soldiers had cordoned off armenian districts in the city 
of 17 million people 
mikhail s gorbachev president and communist party chief said 
soviet leaders would meet soon with delegations of armenians and 
azerbaijanis seeking a solution that would conform to the best 
interests of these two peoples and our country 
gorbachev made the comment in a joint interview with visiting 
president francois mitterrand of france broadcast friday night on 
the french television network antenne2 
scenes of milling masses and military armor in both baku a city 
in azerbaijan and yerevan capital of neighboring armenia were 
shown on the soviet evening television news 
an announcer said the passions and emotions accumulated in the 
hearts of baku residents spill out in the square and another in 
yerevan added contradictory rumors are being floated which 
aggravate the atmosphere 
more than 2000 ethnic armenians have fled azerbaijan to armenia 
panicked by violence that killed three people and injured at least 
126 reports of far higher tolls are rife in the armenian community 
but cannot be confirmed 
ethnic conflict in the two caucasus republics began last february 
because of a dispute over nagornokarabakh a territory with a 
predominantly armenian population that has been part of azerbaijan 
since 1923 
armenians held general strikes and mass demonstrations demanding 
that the territory be annexed to armenia although they do not have 
a common border but moscow did not approve it 
a riot feb 28 in the azerbaijani city of sumgait killed 32 
people 26 of them armenians 
armenian legislators issued another challenge to gorbachevs 
policies friday at an impromptu meeting that rejected his proposed 
constitutional reform and again demanded annexation of 
nagornokarabakh 
musa mamedov chief of information for the azerbaijan foreign 
ministry said baku remained tense and industries in the caspian sea 
port were closed by strikes soviet television confirmed the strikes 
he said interior ministry soldiers had cordoned off armenian 
districts 
in a report thursday mamedov said people were killed in 
kirovabad but on friday he called that unofficial information 
and said he had nothing official about thursdays events in 
kirovabad 
izvestia the soviet government newspaper said pressmen in baku 
refused to print local copies of national papers friday because 
they are reporting nothing about events in azerbaijan izvestia 
said it had to ship 134000 copies from moscow 
its only other coverage of the unrest in the south was a brief 
report on curfews in several places and an appeal for calm from 
local writers 
the newspaper baku rabochii carried a report wednesday that 
speakers in the citys main square claimed izvestias coverage was 
onesided fully ignoring the question of azerbaijani workers who 
are living in armenia 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
thursday in moscow that tanks and troops had been sent to 
reestablish order in baku and in kirovabad and nakhichevan the 
cities where rioting began tuesday 
ruben karagosyan chief editor of armenias official news agency 
armenpress said by telephone from yerevan that a curfew was imposed 
there thursday night 
soldiers are patrolling the streets and army helicopters are 
flying over the city he said 
karagosyan said 2200 ethnic armenians who fled azerbaijan had 
been registered by an armenian government commission created to help 
them the republic allocated 28 million in aid he said 
armenias legislature ended its regular fall session tuesday 
after a kremlin envoy arkady volsky said the situation in the 
caucasus had become too hot to proceed the lamwakers had intended 
to debate the nagornokarabakh issue 
about 200 deputies resumed the session thursday night meeting 
until 2 am in the opera theater in yerevan said victoria 
manukyan chief of local news for armenpress 
she did not say what decisions were reached but rafael popoyan 
an armenian activist said the deputies again demanded unification 
of nagornokarabakh with armenia and rejected the constitutional 
changes proposed by gorbachev 
those amendments have provoked strong criticism especially among 
activists in the independentminded baltic republics who say they 
would increase the central governments power at the expense of the 
15 soviet republics 
the amendments to be considered at a special session of the 
national parliament next week also strengthen the powers of the 
presidency now held by gorbachev and create a new fulltime 
legislature 
legislators in estonia latvia and georgia have demanded changes 
in the texts proposed by gorbachev and estonia rejected the 
amendments outright

police said friday they arrested 116 
refugees from the dominican republic who made the dangerous 90mile 
crossing of the mona passage in flimsy boats 
they said 84 men and 32 women were in the group 
thousands of dominicans enter puerto rico illegally each year by 
crossing the strip of water that separates their impoverished 
caribbean island from the wealthier us commonwealth of puerto rico 
authorities said 109 of the refugees were caught friday and seven 
had been apprehended thursday police in helicopters patrolled the 
shoreline between aguadilla on the western tip of the island and 
nearby rincon in search of others who may have fled 
police said the arrested refugees aged 15 to 42 were given to 
immigration officials for deportation authorities said it was the 
largest group of illegal dominicans ever caught in puerto rico in 
one day 
the dominicans pay organizers 5003000 each for a trip on a 
yola the name given the frail boats of aluminum or wood 
in august the dominican navy said one organizer of a trip to 
puerto rico threw two men overboard drowning one when the boat was 
detected in late july at least seven people drowned and 11 
disappeared after their boat capsized 
inflation as high as 60 percent and rising unemployment drive an 
increasing number of dominicans to risk the trip in hopes of jobs 
and better living conditions in puerto rico 
because puerto ricans are us citizens with us passports 
entry to the united states is easier for dominicans from there 
hundreds of dominicans apply daily for us visas at the us 
consulate in the dominican capital santo domingo embassy officials 
say they believe about 1 million dominicans live in the united

three top officials resigned friday 
from yugoslavias policymaking communist party central committee 
the state news agency tanjug reported 
it said the resignations by vice president stane dolanc deputy 
premier janez zemljaric and federal trade union chief marjan orozen 
were in line with recent policy that bans officials from holding 
state and party jobs simultaneously 
the policy was adopted at a central committee session last month 
that focused on yugoslavias political and economic crises 
the three officials announced their resignations at a party 
meeting in their native republic of slovenia 
national party chief stipe suvar said at least a third of the 165 
federal central committee members who now hold both state and party 
jobs will have to resign 
dolanc was a vice president in the ninemember collective state 
presidency and a close aide to the late josip broz tito who founded 
communist yugoslavia and led it outside the soviet bloc dolancs 
senior posts have included such influential jobs as communist party 
secretary and interior minister 
yugoslavia a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces has been rent by ethnic strife 
the nation also has struggled with a 236 percent annual inflation 
rate a 15 percent unemployment rate and a 21 billion foreign debt 
it now looks geared to launch a market economy system next year in 
efforts to cope with its economic problems 
a popular serbian magazine intervju on friday denounced suvar 
as an impassioned dogmatic with a stalinist profile 
the magazine known for its allout backing of serbian leader 
slobodan milosevic accused suvar of failing to lend support to the 
serbian leadership 
suvar is a croat by nationality and was rotated to the top of the 
collective party presidium in the annual changeover last summer 
the republic of serbia under milosevic seeks greater control 
over its southern province of kosovo the reason reportedly is to 
protect the slav minority there from alleged persecution by ethnic 
albanians and also to pursue the ambitious serbian leaders plans 
for more centralist power 
serbias action has run into opposition in the northern republics 
of croatia and slovenia 
serbia forced the dismissal of two top kosovo leaders a week ago 
but the move sent up to 100000 ethnic albanians to the streets in 
protest last weekend 
scores of rallies in serbia and in montenegro have lent support 
in recent months to milosevics hardline policies with frequent 
denunciation of leaders from the nations other republics or the two 
autonomous provinces within serbia kosovo and vojvodina

cuauhtemoc cardenas runnerup in mexicos 
disputed presidential race said friday that any foreign president 
who attends his opponents inauguration would be supporting an 
illegitimate government 
cardenas spoke at a news conference to introduce the book 
xray of a fraud which lists him as coauthor 
this book investigates how and why the official results of the 
july 6 election differed from the true vote he said 
the book says a close analysis of election returns revealed 
numerical logical and statistical inconsistencies which prove that 
vote totals were altered fraudulently 
presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party or pri takes office on dec 1 
he offered on thursday to begin a dialogue with the opposition 
national democratic front a coalition of leftist and centrist 
parties headed by cardenas 
there can be a thousand kinds of dialogue cardenas said 
friday but we will maintain our position that the first objective 
must be to discuss ways of restoring legitimacy to the government 
he was asked if cubas fidel castro and nicaraguas daniel ortega 
would be giving salinas the blessing of the international left by 
attending the inauguration 
cardenas replied we assume they like any other president are 
coming in accordance with the purposes of their own governments 
its up to them whether they want to lend support to an 
illegitimate government or if they dont want to lend support to an 
illegitimate government 
he noted that mexico invited foreign heads of state to the 
inaugural for the first time and said for me it means that the 
government of mexico is searching with a certain desperation for 
foreign support because they dont have enough internal support 
in official returns salinas received 9641329 votes or 5036 
percent to cardenas 5956988 or 3112 percent manuel clouthier 
of the rightist national action party got 3267159 votes or 1707 
percent minor parties split the rest 
xray of a fraud said a reconstruction of the actual vote 
gave the democratic front 41 percent the pri 36 percent and 
national action 23 per cent 
the pri says that while some irregularities did occur during the 
election they did not materially affect the results it also says 
opposition candidates manipulated the vote in some areas themselves 
xray of a fraud tries to track the footprints of fraud 
opposition representatives said in a statement 
as an example the book notes that party vote totals in a ward 
have a onein10 chance of ending in zero but pri totals in wards 
where the party won by large margins ended in zero far more often 
the statistical odds of that happening by accident are the same 
as if you flipped a coin 191 times and they all came up heads 
said the statement

friday fbi agents arrested the 34yearold fugitive when he arrived 
in massachusetts late wednesday by private lear jet 
saliarelis who deals in precious stones and shipping was taken 
into custody in athens and accused of providing the jet he said his 
two pilots used the aircraft without his knowledge while he was on a 
business trip in africa 
if convicted saliarelis could receive a 10year prison term 
koskotas first fled to brazil and then to the united states as a 
scandal rocked premier andreas papandreous socialist government and 
forced two ministers to resign it prompted a call friday for new 
elections 
opposition conservatives claimed that koskotas was allowed to 
escape so he would not implicate top government officials in illegal 
financial deals magazines and leading newspapers accused 
papandreous son education minister george papandreou of being 
involved 
koskotas was chairman of the bank of crete a preliminary 
government report said he siphoned off 135 million in bank money 
into his own accounts and used 200 million more for unsecured loans 
and gifts to soccer clubs athletes business associates 
journalists and friends

scandal has captivated the ordinary citizens who ask for a cleaning 
up of the situation while the recent government reshuffle proved a 
total absence of sensitivity by certain persons 
papandreou made a minor reshuffle last week but kept all 
ministers accused in the scandal 
general elections are scheduled for june when the governments 
fouryear mandate expires elections can be called earlier if the 
governing party chooses

the peronist party on friday 
renounced violence as a means of achieving political change and 
expelled the montoneros the leftist former guerrilla group from 
the party organization 
the move appeared to be an attempt to deflect criticism by 
political foes and clean up the partys image 
peronism is a force for peace and repudiates violence carlos 
menem the partys presidential candidate and a member of its 
national board said 
menem leads rival eduardo angeloz of the governing radical civic 
union by a substantial margin in virtually every poll prior to next 
mays national elections 
efforts to link peronism with violence are a campaign launched 
by the radicals menem said 
the 24member board ruled that the montoneros no longer may take 
part in party affairs pablo unamuno leader of the montoneros 
political wing revolutionary peronism was suspended indefinitely 
the montoneros were formed in the 1960s when the peronist party 
was banned from all political activity they staged spectacular 
kidnappings and bank robberies and waged open war with police and 
soldiers 
after becoming one of the most powerful guerrilla groups in latin 
america the socalled soldiers of peron were almost wiped out 
by military and security forces during the late 1970s 
the montoneros formally disbanded following the end of the 
military regime and the election of civilian president raul alfonsin 
in 1983 and channeled their activities through the revolutionary 
peronism movement within the peronist party 
the boards decision on friday came in a short communique after a 
fivehour meeting no explanation was given but it followed weeks 
of reports and speculation that former montonero leader mario 
firmenich would be pardoned if menem becomes president 
menem strongly denied statements by unamuno to that effect or 
that he as president would consider a general amnesty of people 
convicted of crimes related to the violence and suppression of 
violence in which thousands died 
its too early for any amnesty im not in favor menem said 
in rome this month during a western european tour aimed at 
diminishing the black legend of peronism as a party that 
tolerates violence and authoritarianism 
firmenich is serving a 30year prison sentence for his part in 
the 1974 kidnapping of two argentine businessmen in which a 60 
million ransom was paid 
menem is trying to broaden his partys base from workers unions 
and the disadvantaged to include the middle class 
peronism dates to juan domingo peron who was elected president 
in 1946 and inaugurated a dictatorship that was overthrown in 1955 
peron was restored to the presidency in september 1973 elections 
after 18 years of exile but died the following year

guerrilla sabotage that cut electric power and 
fouled the water supply caused havoc for a fourth day friday among 
lima residents already plagued by increased terrorism and a crippled 
economy 
we are in the middle of total chaos there is a complete lack 
of government labor leader flavio rojas told reporters 
near ayacucho gunmen shot a journalist and blew up his body in 
nearby huancavelica guerrillas killed two high school teachers and 
a parent authorities said friday 
prices of food and other goods have doubled since tuesday when 
the centerleft government of president alan garcia implemented 
austerity measures to pull peru from its worst recession this 
century and slow annual inflation which has soared to more than 
1200 percent 
but the measures have not brought an end to long lines for such 
basic foods as milk sugar rice and bread 
food shortages developed during the past month adding to 
scarcities in other consumer and industrial items such as drugs and 
tires the scarcities are due in great measure to a lack of dollar 
reserves to pay for imports 
the dollar shortage has been aggravated by a paralyzing 
37dayold strike in the mineral industry which produces more than 
50 percent of perus export earnings 
on thursday most of the capitals bank employees went on strike 
for higher wages 
our country is a mess said guillermina de canales an 
elderly woman waiting in long line at a food market there are 
these long lines and then the deaths from terrorism no one can 
restore order to peru 
the austerity measures came hours after maoinspired shining path 
guerrillas blew up strategic power pylons high in the andes 
sparking a widepread power failure which also crippled limas water 
purification system 
since early tuesday limas water has been undrinkable the 
blackout is affecting about 60 percent of this capital city of 7 
million officials said 
businesses have been forced to reduce or halt operations 
warnings by city officials to use only bottled or boiled tap 
water have been difficult to comply with due to a rapid sellout in 
stores of mineral water and the lack of electricty to boil water 
slum residents have complained that the water is causing children 
to develop diarrhea 
limas electrical supply has been sabotaged dozens of times since 
the shining path launched its guerrilla war eight years ago but the 
current outage is the longest since 1983 when the city blacked out 
for nearly a week 
the rebels also have stepped up attacks since the weekend 
officials said dozens of people have been killed in the mountains 
and jungle including at least 22 soldiers 
garcia who began a fiveyear term in july 1985 has sought to 
restore calm saying the austerity measures will soon work to 
strengthen the economy 
meanwhile hugo bustios 34 a correspondent for the lima news 
magazine caretas was killed and eduardo rojas 27 a correspondent 
for the lima daily actualidad was wounded thursday as they traveled 
by motorcycle outside of huanta 30 miles north of ayacucho police 
said 
officials said it was undetermined if the killing was carried out 
by the shining path or a new antirebel death squad the rodrigo 
franco command 
both groups have threatened journalists in ayacucho 225 miles 
southeast of lima 
in the adjoining state of huancavelica shining path guerrillas 
friday killed two teachers and a father visiting their rural school 
police said they said the teachers were killed for refusing to join 
a regional strike called by guerrillas 
the government says more than 12000 people have died in the 
insurgency

a spokesman for the strategic air command said 
friday it is too soon to tell whether ice buildup may have caused 
the crash of a b1b bomber at an air force base in south dakota last 
week 
its too premature to speculate on any cause of the crash of 
the 280 million aircraft said maj dennis pierson of sac 
headquarters at offutt air force base 
he was responding to a report in the chicago tribune that quoted 
an unidentified pentagon official as saying ice buildup on the 
plane which was not equipped with wing deicers may have caused 
the crash 
the four crew members ejected safely when the bomber crashed nov 
17 while approaching for a landing during bad weather at ellsworth 
air force base sd 
it was the second bomber to crash in less than two weeks and the 
third crash of a b1b in 14 months 
the tribune reported that the pentagon source who requested 
anonymity said an ice alert was in effect at the time of the crash 
and another bomber that landed about five minutes earlier had a 
buildup of about half an inch of ice on the leading edge of its 
wings 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified aeronautical engineer as 
saying such a buildup could cause a plane to crash by changing the 
shape of the airfoil resulting in a loss of lift 
mike mathews a spokesman for rockwell international the prime 
contractor for the b1b confirmed that the bomber unlike civilian 
aircraft of comparable size is not equipped with wing deicers 
our wind tunnel tests showed it did not need them for normal 
cold weather operations said mathews who contended that the ice 
buildup was not significant 
pierson said the bomber is equipped with an icedetection system 
that would warn pilots of problems 
a former military pilot told the tribune that many of the 
nations other military jets are not equipped with wing deicers he 
cited the t38 and the a4 
theyre built to just boom through the lowaltitude weather and 
get to the clear air at higher altitudes he said 
one function of the b1b however is to fly hundreds of miles at 
extremely low altitudes

a crack that would have been nearly 
impossible to detect by normal inspection methods used on traveling 
carnival rides appears to have led to the collapse of a ride in 
which a teenager was killed state officials say 
an inspection of the monster ride thursday at the broward 
county fair found that one of its six metal arms had collapsed at 
the spot of a tiny crack that went unnoticed in previous inspections 
because it was painted over said wally rich director of the 
states bureau of fairs and expositions 
rust under the paint indicated the crack had been there for some 
time he said friday 
the broken section was sent for detailed study by a metallurgist 
at florida atlantic university 
this ride has been inspected in four states in the past two 
months by four inspectors and in that time no one found that crack 
neither the inspectors nor the staff operating the ride rich 
said 
wednesdays collapse at the fair killed a 17yearold high school 
senior and injured seven other fairgoers one remained in a hospital 
friday 
the ride was built in 1975 by eyerly aircraft co of salem 
ore rich said he said the company went out of business about 
three years ago but that a new company formed by the owner of 
eyerly still supplies replacement parts for its rides 
each arm of the ride supports four baskets that hold up to three 
people each and whirls them up and down 
rich said the ride at the broward fair had been subjected to a 
thorough inspection in anderson sc on sept 14 inspection each 
day at the broward fair also showed no signs of negligence or 
improper inspection rich said 
rich said his department hoped to get a final report from the 
university on the cause of the accident in two weeks 
we havent found any area of negligence rich said theres 
nothing we can really put our finger on were not technical 
experts 
rich said his departments six inspectors would be hard put to 
give frequent exhaustive tests to the states 1161 licensed 
carnival rides 
it would be almost impossible for us to carry out a program of 
that magnitude rich told reporters at the fairground 
product safety investigator jeff simon of the federal consumer

rights activists down fifth avenue on friday in the largest of 
nationwide protests against the killing of animals for their fur 
fur is murder dont buy fur they shouted waving signs 
depicting cute creatures in various stages of annihilation 
wheres mom said the caption on a picture of a baby racoon 
the protest by transspecies unlimited was one of more than 60 
the group said it held around the country as part of its third 
annual furfree friday

neimanmarcus department stores in beverly hills calif police 
said 
in boston more than 25 people clutching signs reading fur 
the ultimate sadist symbol protested in front of a fur store 
roxci moser 33 who was heckled when she walked by the 
protesters in a raccoon coat said i noticed they were wearing 
leather shoes and i assume they ate turkey yesterday for 
thanksgiving if they want to act like that they should be strict 
vegetarians and wear only cloth clothes 
in san francisco where gunsmoke actress amanda blake led 
about 50 demonstrators in a rally organizers said some dropped off 
furs as taxdeductible donations 
blake explained her own decision 25 years ago to stop wearing 
real fur by saying its agony for the animals and i dont believe 
that animals should have to suffer for some dumb broads vanity or 
for some stupid mans vanity for that matter 
blake defended the leather boots she was wearing saying 
producers use the whole cow thats important 
in harrisburg pa where about 25 pickets walked outside a

frivolous luxury garments 
edissa simpson whose husband owns a fur store in suburban 
harrisburg said cows and pigs are used for clothing and no one is 
calling for an embargo against their slaughter

do not confine or kill animals in cruel ways she also noted that 
many people rely on furs for their livelihood

people who wear fur 
im happy to say that they run the same risk in new york city 
now barker said reporting that a woman had admonished him 
shame on you one of your people spit on me 
i said only one related barker 
during the march dozens of shoppers stopped along the sidewalk 
to stare and point one couple sporting his and her furs beat a 
hasty retreat 
my fur is beautiful please dont kill me or my friends read 
a sign worn by a labrador retriever 
one woman trudged along in a beaver costume and another wore 
bunny ears 
the protesters paused outside one fur store shouting if you 
stop buying theyll stop killing a few protesters angrily waved 
signs 
the groups president george cave urged members to spend their 
winter handing leaflets to people wearing furs on the street 
if you want to be a little more aggressive and tell them how 
much that fur bothers you thats ok too he said

iran said friday that it would allow the 
first visit to the country by un human rights investigators next 
month a move seen aimed at countering reports that it has launched 
a wave of executions 
the general assembly is scheduled to vote next week on a 
resolution that strongly criticizes iran for blocking a probe of 
alleged human rights abuses 
the uns special monitor on human rights in iran reynaldo 
galindo pohl issued a preliminary report in early november that 
condemned iran for executing large numbers of opposition members 
after accepting a ceasefire with iraq 
galindo and his staff from the special commission on human rights 
have never been allowed to visit iran and rely on reports in iranian 
and western media and testimony from defectors and opposition 
members 
iranian un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said his 
country would prefer a resolution with milder language one that 
would call for galindo to receive full cooperation of the 
government of the islamic republic of iran in all respects before 
the end of 1988 for the purpose of carrying out his mandate 
on wednesday ambassador michael costello of australia one of 
the sponsors of the resolution called upon iran to give a clear 
unconditional and public indication of its readiness to allow a 
visit by human rights investigators within a specified period 
 
mahallati replied friday i have delivered today in no 
uncertain terms what the sponsors in the draft resolution have 
called for 
he said irans cooperation with galindo would refute claims of 
execution and torture that were made by the peoples mujahedeen of 
iran an opposition group 
mahallati contended that iran had been preoccupied by its war 
with iraq and only now has been able to spare time to respond to 
international criticism 
he said irans administration of justice has been the most 
lenient of any country that has gone through a revolution and 
subsequent war and that the members of opposition groups however 
violent are entitled to due process of law 
the iranian envoy said galindos previous report relied on the 
peoples mujahedeen organization a terrorist organization and is 
filled with the bogus allegations leveled against the islamic 
republic of iran with clear malice purely political and propaganda 
objectives 
galindos interim report cited mass executions in iran from july 
through september that included 1140 political prisoners as well 
as other common criminals 
the executions followed a july 2528 raid into iran by the 
national liberation army the armed wing of the peoples mujahedeen 
and irans acceptance in midjuly of a ceasefire with iraq the 
truce took effect aug 20

a high court judge on friday awarded 45200 in 
damages to a 25yearold teacher who said a physiotherapist raped 
her although the man has never been tried for the crime 
the woman sued in the civil courts after police charged the man 
with rape but the crown prosecution service said evidence was 
insufficient to put him on trial for a criminal offense 
it was believed to be the first civil action for rape without a 
prior conviction in a criminal court 
judge sir bernard caulfield stayed his award to the woman pending 
a possible appeal 
the judge said he believed the 47yearold physiotherapist 
assaulted his patient in december 1985 and raped her three days 
later when she returned to continue treatment for shoulder injury 
and back pain 
during the judgment the defendant sat in court with his head in 
his hands 
the defense contended that the woman fantasized or dreamed the 
rape but the judge said under the greatest stress in the 
witnessbox she impressed as basically a truthful woman 
he said the woman was shocked by the first assault but returned 
to the clinic because she was too frightened to tell her father and 
kept the next appointment so he would not find out 
defense witnesses testified they were in adjoining cubicles and 
heard nothing of any assault in the clinic at benfleet essex 36 
miles east of london 
but the judge said their evidence lacked the necessary precision 
for him to say the teacher lied or gave dishonest or fanciful 
evidence 
essex county police said later they did not intend to reopen 
investigations and the crown prosecution service said it would need 
new evidence to reopen it 
a spokesman for the service said the burden of proof in a civil 
case was on the balance of probabilities but a criminal case 
required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt 
its very often the case that where a story sounds more 
plausible thats sufficient for civil proceedings therefore one 
is able to succeed in civil litigation and obtain damages but not 
succeed in achieving a criminal conviction the spokesman said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the women against rape organization said its a big victory 
theres a lot of rape being committed by men in positions of 
authority teachers doctors lawyers landlords 
obviously theres something very wrong with the system if the 
case was originally thrown out and then a judge finds in favor of 
the woman

the senate president accused a new 
political party backing president corazon aquino of dictatorship 
on friday after it cemented control of the lower house by stripping 
nonmembers of committee chairmanships 
the legislative revamp by the majority struggle of the democratic 
filipino party on thurday had been expected since the party was 
launched in september it represented the latest step in a 
realignment of forces that helped topple president ferdinand marcos 
in february 1986 and catapult mrs aquino to power 
this is oneparty dictatorship sen jovito salonga said in a 
radio interview friday they have committed an act of injustice in 
the house of representatives

to members of a sixparty proaquino coalition regardless of 
individual party affiliation

parties controls at least 145 of the 202 house seats in the 
reshuffle it stripped other parties of nine chairmanships and took 
control of the houses 45 committees

politically powerful brother said in creating the new party that 
they wanted to bring all aquino supporters under one umbrella to 
boost her programs

the ldp now assumes full responsibility for the success or 
failure of the legislative program of the government mitra said 
using the partys tagalog language initials

iran on friday renewed an offer to work 
for the release of nine american hostages in lebanon if the united 
states would make the same efforts on behalf of iranian hostages 
there 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani made the offer in a friday 
prayer sermon broadcast on official tehran radio other iranian 
officials have made the same suggestion in the past 
if you are interested in having your people held hostage in 
lebanon released then tell the phalangists to release our people 
who have been in their hands for years and of whom we do not have 
any news rafsanjani was quoted as saying in the broadcast which 
was monitored in nicosia 
in washington the state department on friday reaffirmed its 
policy against making any deals for release of american hostages in 
lebanon spokesman charles redman said that all hostages american 
and iranian alike should be released immediately 
three iranians ahmad motevaselian hussein musavi and kazem 
akhavan were kidnapped by rightwing christian phalangist gunmen 
in northern lebanon in 1982 their lebanese driver who had an 
iranian passport also disappeared the four are widely believed to 
be dead 
rafsanjani alleged in his sermon that the united states backed 
the christian phalangists in lebanon and thus could not claim it had 
no influence among them the radio said 
if the united states helps free the iranians rafsanjani said 
we will also suggest to our wellwishers and friends in lebanon to 
release any hostages they may have 
fourteen foreign hostages including nine americans are being 
held in lebanon by proiranian islamic fundamentalists in addition 
a swiss red cross official was kidnapped in the southern port of 
sidon on nov 17 but no one has claimed responsibility 
the longestheld foreign hostage is terry a anderson 41 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
rafsanjani also condemned former us president jimmy carter for 
trying to link resumption of usiranian ties to the hostage issue 
in a letter made public by the iranians last week carter asked 
iran to release the hostages saying it would overcome a main 
obstacle to the renewal of ties between washington and tehran 
we are neither hostagetakers or interested in resuming ties 
with the us rafsanjani said 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini responding to carters letter last 
week said the relationship between iran and the us is like the 
relationship between a wolf and a lamb and between these there can 
never be reconciliation 
a spokeswoman for carter in atlanta said the letter was 
responding to an initiative from iran 
rafsanjani said carter had sent him a similar letter and he was 
preparing a reply 
america is looking for a way to establish contact with the 
islamic republic and the malice of its leaders has driven it to 
this sending the letter the radio quoted rafsanjani as saying 
the american leaders do not have enough courage to say we 
have made a mistake we mistreated the islamic republic and we had 
a bad attitude towards the islamic revolution and we want to make 
up rafsanjani said 
if you want to establish ties with the islamic republic then 
you must give up your vile schemes he said

an earthquake rattled eastern canada and the northeast quadrant 
of the united states on friday but there were no immediate reports 
of major damage or injuries 
the epicenter of the 646 pm est quake was 90 miles north of 
quebec city canada with a preliminary magnitude of 60 on the 
richter scale of ground motion said us geological survey 
spokesman don finley in washington dc 
the quake knocked out power in montreal and elsewhere in the 
province of quebec canadian press reported that the quake lasted 
about 15 to 20 seconds and also was felt in ottawa toronto and 
quebec city 
a foreshock recorded wednesday had a richter magnitude of 45 
finley said 
in the united states the quake was felt from the great lakes to 
the atlantic coast with tremors reported in michigan indiana 
ohio pennsylvania new york new jersey maryland connecticut 
rhode island vermont maine new hampshire and massachusetts 
there were no reports of damage to us power plants 
transmission lines dams and telephone lines 
it was widely felt and the northcentral and northeastern 
regions of the united states said arch johnston director of the 
center for earthquake research at memphis state university in 
tennessee some reported feeling it as far south as washington 
dc 
police firefighters radio and television stations were deluged 
with calls officials said houses shook ceilings cracked dishes 
fell from shelves and windows rattled in the northeast 
in new york city firefighters went to 40 locations where there 
were reports of tremors but no damage could be found said fire lt 
kenneth murphy 
in the central vermont community of berlin a chimney collapsed 
but there were no injuries reported 
in maine the quake broke windows and knocked pictures off walls 
however the secret service in kennebunkport said the quake was not 
felt at the weekend home of presidentelect george bush and his 
wife barbara 
the quake rattled bostons top of the hub restaurant on the 52nd 
floor of the prudential center while about 120 people were dining 
said maitre d stephen brown it was enough to make you feel 
queasy he said 
the entire dining room felt it everyone felt they were 
becoming dizzy or faint they all sort of smiled and looked at each 
other no one felt panicked or anything he said 
there were scattered reports of temporarily dead telephones in 
new hampshire and vermont but new england telephone spokesman paul 
hardiman said outages could have been caused by the too many callers 
jamming local exchanges 
effectively what theyre doing is jamming the whole network 
he said some switching machines especially in smaller offices 
will deny dial tone hardiman said he had no reports of widespread 
telephone outages 
canadian press said the tremor was felt all over the island of 
montreal along the north and south shores of the st lawrence river 
as well as in the laurentians and quebec city 
traffic lights were out throughout montreal and there was no 
electricity in major hotels and montreals central train station 
telephone lines are also down around the island 
michel morin of jonquiere where the quake was quite severe said 
the quake happened very quickly i was in a store and things fell 
of the shelves he said people ran out of their houses and 
their telephones and power was gone 
i was sitting watching tv and all at once i started feeling 
dizzy said roy tabikha of cambridge mass i thought there was 
something wrong with me then i realized everything was shaking 
tabikha said he filled a glass with water and watched it vibrate 
he said the shaking lasted about 15 seconds 
we ran out of our house our lampshade was shaking we were 
shaking said carol dalessandro 40 a travel agent in wakefield 
mass 
in pennsylvania the tremors rattled windows on the sixth floor 
of eries hamot medical center and in the control tower of erie 
international airport four floors above ground level 
one lady called us and said she had whitecaps in her fish tank 
and her chandelier was shaking said cpl clifford williams of the 
pennsylvania state police 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 
severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale 
seismologists consider a magnitude6 earthquake to be a moderate 
jolt even though such a quake can cause severe damage in populated 
areas that lack modern building codes 
because the earths crust is much older cooler and more brittle 
east of the rockies than in the west eastern quakes tend to be felt 
over areas 10 times larger than in the west where complicated 
geology also interferes with seismic waves as they travel through 
the ground 
we have had earthquakes up there before said waverly person 
director of the us geological surveys national earthquake 
information center at golden colo in 1925 there was a quake in 
the area with a magnitude of 7 
bruce presgrave a geophysicist with the survey said aftershocks 
could shake the area for weeks 
this is what we would call an intraplate or within the plate 
earthquake presgrave said which is an earthquake in the north 
american plate as opposed to one along plate boundaries such as the 
san andreas fault

a un report released friday decried what 
it termed growing human rights abuses and frequent use of violence 
by israeli soldiers fighting the palestinian rebellion 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar wrote in the un 
review the overall situation in the occupied palestinian 
territories has worsened civilian deaths and injuries continue to 
be widespread and so do other serious violations of human rights 
he said he was deeply distressed by the high number of 
casualties and by israeli measures such as deportation 
administrative detention curfews and razing of houses he said such 
measures can only aggravate tension 
at least 315 palestinians and 11 israelis have died in the 
uprising that began against israeli rule last dec 8 in the west 
bank and gaza strip which israel seized from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war 
the un center for human rights put together the report from 
news items in newspapers israeli officials have not yet made a 
decision on a request by un officials to visit the occupied lands 
a spokeswoman for israels un mission said the mission was 
aware of the report but had no immediate comment 
in tripoli libya plo chairman yasser arafat met with libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi on friday to discuss the declaration of 
a palestinian state on the occupied territories libyas official 
news agency jana reported the report was monitored in rome 
the palestine national council the plos legislature declared 
the state this month 
jana said arafat discussed the unjust and illegitimate 
attitude of the us government in refusing to grant him a visa to 
address the un general assembly in new york 
washington has not yet said whether it will grant the visa to 
arafat who hopes to attend the assembly debate on the palestinian 
question dec 12 he is expected to request un membership for the 
newly declared state 
the plo formally applied to the us consulate in tunis tunisia 
on friday for a visa for arafat

europe and the united states plan to send a space 
probe to titan the solar systems biggest moon and the only one 
with an atmosphere much like primordial earths the european space 
agency announced friday 
the joint mission to saturns immense gasshrouded satellite 
would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to 
test soil from the mysterious moon 
the mission to be called the cassinititan probe was chosen 
from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings thursday 
and friday of the european space agencys science program committee 
nasa however still is seeking official approval for the 550 
million project it is expected to ask congress for some funding 
during the 1990 fiscal year that begins oct 1 nasa spokesman 
charles redmond said in washington 
redmond said he expects the europeans would contribute about 100 
million to 150 million they proposed paying for at least one major 
instrument system helping to pay for some others and providing 
propulsion components 
the project is named after 17thcentury italian astronomer 
giovanni domenico cassini 
titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a thick 
organicrich nitrogen atmosphere the surface temperature is about 
minus 354 degrees 
scientists believe that the chemical processes in titans 
atmosphere may resemble those at work on the primitive earth before 
the origin of life 
cassinititan is to be launched in april 1996 by the national 
aeronautics and space administration and should arrive in the saturn 
system in october 2002 the european space agency said in a 
statement 
saturn and its system of rings and satellites were briefly 
encountered in 198081 during the united states voyager 1 and 2 
missions 
the cassinititan mission will place around saturn a nasabuilt 
orbiter that will send an europeanbuilt probe into titans 
atmosphere the probe is to slow down to subsonic speeds when it 
gets within 110 miles of the moon 
the probe is named huygens after the dutch astronomer and 
physicist christian huygens who discovered titan in 1656 
a parachute system will be deployed to allow a slow descent to 
the surface of titan which some scientists say is covered by ethane 
and methane lakes or oceans the lowvelocity impact may be soft 
enough to allow analysis of a surface sample before the probe dies 
the european space agency said 
during the descent of huygens the orbiter will be used as a 
radio relay station to transmit the probes data to earth after 
huygens mission the cassini orbiter is to circle saturn for four 
years at an altitude of only 620 miles

a un conference opened friday to adopt 
an international convention against illicit drug trafficking and 
drug abuse 
the convention will provide a new powerful weapon to combat 
drug abuse and illicit trafficking axel wuestenhage deputy 
director of the un information office in vienna told the 
associated press 
whats very important is that they the new rules include 
rights to forfeit assets of illicit drug traffickers and rights of 
extradition given to all signatory countries for the first time 
he said 
the conference is scheduled to last until dec 20 the convention 
to be adopted complements two existing international legal 
instruments the convention on narcotic drugs of 1961 signed by 121 
countries and the convention on psychotropic substances of 1971 to 
which 88 countries have so far acceded 
the new convention is meant to meet the challenge posed by an 
upsurge in illicit drug trafficking and associated organized 
criminal activity both are viewed as undermining legitimate 
economies and threatening the stability security and sovereignty of 
un member states 
the innovations will reportedly deal with such issues as 
forfeiture and confiscation of the proceeds and assets derived from 
illicit trafficking extradition mutual legal assistance and

a severe earthquake hit eastern canada friday 
shaking buildings knocking out power and frightening thousands of 
people a major rail line was shut down after a section of track 
reportedly collapsed near montreal 
there were no immediate reports of serious injuries 
the earthquake measured 60 on the richter scale with an 
epicenter at chicoutimi quebec said janet drysdale seismologist 
with the geological survey of canada chicoutimi is about 200 miles 
northeast of montreal 
this is the largest earthquake in eastern canada since 1935 
said john adams of the geological survey of canada in ottawa 
the quake was felt throughout eastern canada including in 
montreal toronto quebec city ottawa and along the shores of the 
st lawrence river it also was felt in the northeastern united 
states 
tremors began at 646 pm est and lasted from 15 seconds to two 
minutes canadian press reported 
the news agency said traffic lights were out in quebec city and 
there was no electricity in montreals central train station and 
major hotels telephone lines also were down around the island 
canadian press said the tremors caused the ground to cave in 
beneath a railway track just west of montreal at the approach to a 
railway bridge it said the damage forced canadian national railroad 
officials to shut down the major eastwest rail line from montreal 
to senneterre 220 miles to the west 
the tremors caused a fluorine gas leak at the alcan aluminum 
smelter in jonquiere quebec 25 miles west of chicoutimi but leak 
was repaired shortly afterward the agency said 
another tremor was felt wednesday and was centered in the same 
southeastern section of quebec the charlevoix region said adams 
that quake measured 45 to 49 on the richter scale no serious 
damage was reported during that tremor 
radio stations and newspapers were flooded with telephone calls 
from panicked residents 
were on the seventh floor and i thought we were going to be on 
the first said charlie popejoy 80 of the central ontario city 
of orillia 
the quake shook the southern part of new brunswick and was felt 
as far east as the annapolis valley on nova scotias western shore 
the whole apartment building started to shake wobble back and 
forth one caller told a toronto radio station who said he was on 
the top floor knives lined up on the wall and the coffee mugs 
hanging on hooks on the wall started to clatter and shake back and 
forth 
weve had about 100 calls here in the last five minutes a 
reporter at the toronto sun said 
a police spokesman from laurentian park just north of quebec 
city said in a restaurant next to our office a dishwasher broke 
and a cigarette display came crashing to the ground 
power was out in quebec city and a highvoltage power line 
between toronto and ottawa was momentarily interupted canadian 
press reported 
there were no immediate reports of damage however 
in moncton new brunswick people watching an american hockey 
league game at the 7000seat moncton coliseum got up from their 
seats when the quake shook the building cp said 
jackie finnemore a clerk at a fredericton gas bar and 
convenience store said the stores telephone went dead for a few 
minutes 
i hung on to the counter i didnt know what was happening 
drysdale said tremors measuring above a magnitude of 50 on the 
richter scale happen about once every 10 year 
there is a possibility there may be slight damage with a quake 
this size but not devastating damage by any means she said 
the tremor reportedly lasted 20 seconds in ottawa 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake measuring 5 on the richter scale can cause 
considerable damage a 6 severe damage and a 7 is a major 
earthquake

christmas shoppers wading into the postthanksgiving rush today 
face a little added pressure this year tight inventories thats a 
business decision prompted by a longrunning slump in the retail 
business but for consumers it means limited selection and shortages 
of hotselling items 
todays opening of the nations annual shopping spree finds 
retailers optimistic about improving their seasonal sales but 
conservative enough to stock sparingly 
inventories have been tight for much of the year and few 
retailers are likely to take many chances at this point

laboratory experiments announced today show 
that a plant toxin combined with a synthetic protein is able to 
attack and kill cells infected with the aids virus while leaving 
healthy cells untouched 
in a study published today in the journal science a group of 
researchers report that a manmade molecule called recombinant cd4 
can be used to deliver a killer toxin to cells infected with aids in 
testtube experiments 
however they cautioned that the new laboratory development 
like other incremental advances in aids research was far from 
being ready for clinical application and at best might offer a 
potential new treatment approach rather than a cure

military president augusto pinochet his 
15yearold rule nearing an end is swiftly moving his army back to 
the barracks and away from the political battlefield where he 
suffered a major defeat in october 
political observers and specialists say recent government and 
military appointments by pinochet are aimed at restoring the armys 
professionalism and reaffirming his leadership over the service 
which has served as the backbone of his power since a 1973 coup 
he is trying to preserve the army after the electoral defeat he 
led it into said ricardo lagos a socialist and prominent 
opposition leader in an oct 5 referendum chilean voters rejected 
a proposal by gen pinochet and other military commanders that he 
remain in power until 1997 as a result he was obliged to call open 
elections planned for late next year and must hand over power in 
march 1990

in sweden citizens can walk into the 
prime ministers office and read his mail they also can peek into 
government records and find out a lot about a neighbor from salary 
to debts 
as a matter of policy government records have been open to the 
public since 1766 when a political party known as the caps ousted 
the rival hats from government in an election fought over charges 
that the hats were keeping too many things secret 
now in the era of the computer and probing media some swedes 
complain about invasions of their privacy 
prime minister ingvar carlsson is not one of them however 
of 5577 documents that crossed his desk in the first 10 months 
of this year only 109 were classified the majority were internal 
memos and correspondence with foreign governments 
vivianne eriksson who registers the mail and indexes the 
documents on a computer said not many people take advantage of the 
privilege of going through carlssons mail 
she estimated that no more than one visitor a week usually a 
journalist comes into her office for a look 
i suppose most people dont know they can come here she said 
scanning the computer index a reporter recentlly found subjects 
ranging from theories about who murdered carlssons predecessor 
olof palme to requests for an autograph 
other letters were appeals for political asylum and complaints 
about pollution or the hunting of moose 
this entry was about correspondence from majbritt hedlund of 
boden wants a new kitchen and to find palmes killer 
a letter of thanks to walid jumblatt leader of lebanons druse 
community was classified secret so was a letter from president 
reagan on nuclear disarmament memos on military subjects and on 
trips abroad by government officials also bore the stamp of secrecy 
the principle of public access is not limited to authorities the 
highly developed swedish bureaucracy has numbered registered 
compiled and processed information about the citizenry most of 
which is open to the public 
every swedish resident has a 10digit personal number which 
begins with the birthday knowing your neighbors date of birth is 
enough to gain access to his file at the national taxation board 
which lists his income and tax from the previous year his church 
membership marital status and current address 
if you take that number to the county police you can find out if 
he has any unpaid bills and how much he owes other registers list 
his education state of health and his hobbies if he is a member of 
an association 
all this has been accepted as a price for keeping people honest 
in a society that strives for equality among its citizens but 
hundreds of people complain every year that authorities and private 
companies abuse public records 
such complaints come to data inspection a 40member department 
of the justice ministry that monitors compliance with the 
regulations governing access to information and privacy 
the department was set up in 1973 when the government instituted 
a law to guard against misuse of the personal number criminal files 
are restricted as are files about cases of serious social problems 
further efforts to limit access have failed to find the right 
balance between the publics right to know and the protection of 
privacy said leif stenstrom an official of data inspection 
theres been a uturn he added from enabling the common 
man to control the authorities you could say free access now 
helps the authorities to control the common man 
peter seipel a law professor at stockholm university said the 
idea endorsed by the caps 200 years ago that men of power and high 
rank need watching still applies 
the principle of public access is an important part of our 
democracy although the judicial right is not often used seipel 
said in an interview 
one cannot imagine a society without it now administrative 
secrecy would reign 
marie kronmarker lecturer at the fojo journalism school said 
reporters dont exercise their right to find out whats happening at 
the top 
everyone has the right to appeal the classification of a document 
as secret she said but journalists were too often intimidated by 
the label of secrecy or by difficulty of locating mislaid documents

us and bolivian authorities say 
corruption of police military and court officials by cocaine 
traffickers is rampant despite government efforts to contain it 
they fear drug money will influence the elections for a new 
president and congress in may 
one reason given is that joint usbolivian drug enforcement in 
the field has become so effective that traffickers now are turning 
to bribing officials to win the release of those arrested 
jorge alderrete interior ministry undersecretary for drug 
enforcement and other bolivian authorities said in interviews they 
suspect drug traffickers might help finance some campaigns 
including the one for president 
drug related corruption has become endemic in certain law 
enforcement circles and drug traffickers will no doubt try to 
influence the elections alderrete said 
congressman fernando salazar said drug traffickers offer 
financing and this provides the base for political campaigns that 
must spend large sums on television advertising 
bolivians will vote for a successor to president victor paz 
estenssoro as well as a new congress with substantial us 
assistance paz estenssoros 3yearold conservative government has 
waged a firm but uphill battle against a cocaine industry that reaps 
an estimated 500 million in yearly profits 
according to bolivian officials accounts of corruption abound in 
a web of complicity among traffickers policemen soldiers and court 
officials 
in september police caught an alleged trafficker carmelo nunez 
del prado in a pickup truck they say was loaded with 1125 pounds 
of coca paste in the chapare region us drug enforcement 
administration agents working in bolivia describe nunez del prado as 
one of the countrys biggest dealers in paste which is made from 
mashed coca leaves and is refined into cocaine 
after the arrest alderrete said an associate of nunez del prado 
offered the national police forces antidrug commander col 
nicolas anaya 50000 in return for the suspects release anaya 
refused the bribe the undersecretary added 
but after nunez del prado was jailed in city of cochabamba it 
took police 20 days to pass the case to the district attorney when 
normally it takes two to three days the original police report was 
altered and after a 10minute hearing district attorney nora vasquez 
de montoya released him for lack of evidence 
the suspected trafficker has vanished mrs vasquez de montoya 
was jailed but later released interior minister juan carlos duran 
said she faces charges of receiving a bribe 
i have strong evidence that the 50000 was paid to the 
district attorney and a police adviser alderrete said 
cochabamba in the eastern foothills of the andes is considered 
the gateway to the chapare a jungle area the size of new jersey 
where 80 percent of the countrys coca is grown several police and 
military officials assigned to the area are alleged to have provided 
protection to traffickers in return for payments of 10000 to 
15000 a week 
gen gustavo arrazola chief of the armys biggest regiment and 
four other officers were dishonorably discharged in october they 
were accused by the government of protecting a clandestine airstrip 
from which 7900 pounds of coca paste worth at least 10 million was 
smuggled over a threemonth period 
authorities claim some poorly paid policemen seek assignments in 
the chapare even though living conditions are difficult many 
officers leave the region as rich men after even a brief assignment 
the officials say 
when a private loan institution collapsed in la paz last year 
among the list of people who lost their deposits were 17 bolivian 
policemen including a top drugenforcement officer each had the 
equivalent of 100000 to 150000 in the bank according to 
government records 
alderrete said he often tries to change police assignments to 
discourage corruption 
in addition according to interior minister duran an increased 
us presence since 1986 including 30 us drug enforcement and 
border patrol agents who often work with local police has made 
bribery of bolivian officers more difficult 
the us assistance is helping stem some of the drug production 
and smuggling in october bolivian antidrug police and us agents 
raided and destroyed a record 12 major cocaine processing 
laboratories in the jungle 
duran said two men arrested at one of the labs the biggest ever 
to be discovered testified that they worked for the fugitive 
trafficker jorge roca suarez 
the two workers were taken to the city of trinidad considered a 
major international drug smuggling center where authorities began 
preparing charges against roca suarez there according to duran 
five lawyers hired by the trafficker offered money and property to a 
trinidad district attorney in return for her help the district 
attorney rejected the offer but was told her refusal to cooperate 
would jeopardize her children she resigned from the case 
a new district attorney jorge palma sandoval took over and 
threw out the testimony of the two workers he accepted the 
testimony of a new witness who said the ranch were the lab was found 
belonged to him and that chemicals at the site were used for 
tanning leather the case against roca suarez was dropped 
palma sandoval is being removed from his post while authorities 
investigate his action in the case duran said 
duran also said that as usbacked raids have increased the 
bribery of court officials is rising 
since we have become much more effective at interdiction 
traffickers are now corrupting the judicial system and making us 
waste time arresting traffickers who later will be released by the 
courts duran added in an interview 
in a bid to stifle the corruption a tough antidrug law passed 
in august calls for setting up special threejudge panels dedicated 
exclusively to handling drug cases the theory is three judges will 
be tougher to suborn than one 
despite the bleak picture duran said the corruption problem can 
be controlled 
without a doubt one of the evils of our time is corruption of 
the police courts and elections he said it is not fair to 
say however that everybody is corrupt although few cases make it 
appear as if it were widespread

nearly everyone brought to trial on criminal 
charges in japan is convicted 
this has raised questions about the fairness of the nations 
legal system and whether human rights are violated 
the japan federation of bar associations which groups the 
nations lawyers has long argued that the nearly 100percent 
conviction rate actually symbolizes a legal system so out of balance 
that it violates international human rights covenants 
from a prosecutors point of view the high success level in the 
courts is a source of pride and is cited as evidence of the 
efficiency of law enforcement in japan 
very few people are found innocent here because in our system 
we try only those we believe we can convict said a justice 
ministry official 
the official who requested anonymity said that 998 percent of 
all defendants facing criminal charges are found guilty though not 
necessarily on all charges brought by the prosecution cases in 
japan are heard by judges only there are no juries 
in a statement nov 4 the bar federation argued there are 
several ways to interpret the conviction statistic but the 
overemphasis on confessions the violation of the rights of the 
accused and the restriction of the accuseds access to legal counsel 
can be suspected 
speakers at a recent bar federation symposium in kobe contended 
that the postarrest treatment of suspects not yet formally charged 
was a major source of human rights abuse 
the treatment they argue includes physical and mental torture 
roundtheclock surveillance and inordinately long periods of 
interrogation 
when they were finished with me you couldnt tell the top of my 
head from the side said yoshimitsu umeda who spent nearly 19 
years in prison for a murderrobbery committed in 1950 
umeda told the symposium the police led him through the 
confession telling him what to say he had done kicking and 
punching him for days until his statement matched their conclusions 
following several appeals umedas name was cleared by the 
supreme court in 1986 due to discrepancies in his confession 
there is no assumption of innocence attorney takashi mikami 
said at the symposium japanese judges find it easy to find the 
accused guilty but it takes courage for a judge to hand down a 
verdict of innocent 
the bar federation claims the excesses that led to umedas false 
confession continue and are fostered in part by the diayo 
kangoku system which allows arrested suspects to be detained in 
cells where they are under constant police control 
the police detention cells serve as substitutes for 
governmentdesignated detention centers two bills that would 
institutionalize the system accepted on a temporary basis 80 years 
ago are now before the diet japans parliament 
this system unique to japan where substitute jailhouses are 
used to obtain confessions upon which many criminal cases are based 
is the source of numerous human rights violations said human 
rights advocate futaba igarashi 
igarashi said that in the substitute cells known as birdcages 
police decide when suspects can eat drink or go to the toilet 
about 90 percent of the suspects detained by police end up in such 
cells according to the federation 
in most cases warrants to arrest and detain a suspect must be 
obtained from a court but the bar federation says only 045 
percent of the requests for detention were denied in 1984 the most 
recent year for which statistics are available 
the maximum period a suspect may be held following arrest and 
before formal charges are filed is 23 days that period is often 
extended however as police can rearrest suspects on unrelated 
charges to continue their questioning 
the detainees cant read newspapers listen to the radio make 
telephone calls or with a few exceptions write letters igarashi 
said when they deny police accusations they arent allowed to 
see their families and in some cases are only allowed to see their 
lawyer for three 15minute visits over the 23 days 
governmentappointed lawyers are not provided to the accused 
during detention though such counsel is available for the trial 
release on bail is not permitted until formal charges are 
pressed only about 27 percent of those charged with crimes in 1984 
were released pending trial and of them 60 percent posted bail of 
about 7600 according to the bar federation 
detainees awaiting trial are either kept in the substitute jail 
cell or moved to a formal detention center following police and 
court consultation 
jun kurata assistant chief of the national police agencys 
general affairs division denied many of humanrights advocate 
igarashis charges saying detainees in substitute jailhouses are 
overseen by police guards not investigators 
kurata said he was unaware of any recent cases of police 
brutality during questioning and said detainees are allowed to read 
newspapers if they so request 
he said phone calls are restricted and mail is screened but that 
the same restrictions are observed in regular detention centers

when their single another lover hit the 
american charts giant steps joined the growing list of british acts 
that have found success across the atlantic before gaining 
popularity at home 
i dont know why its happening but it probably has something 
to do with the quality of the songs said george mcfarlane 
onehalf of the duo giant steps 
if you look at the songs that have been successful in america 
they are very good i think the american market is more about songs 
the british charts are more gimmicky they just tend to latch on to 
trends 
in the past americans have accepted only the cream of the 
british charts u2 and george michael were successful years before 
the united states took notice 
but american record companies are now taking chances on 
previously unsuccessful british bands turning them into american 
pop stars and exporting them back for rerelease in britain 
the situation also occurred with breathes single hands to 
heaven after failing in britain it was released in the united 
states where it stayed in billboards top 10 for several weeks 
subsequently rereleased in britain its american success pushed it 
into the top 20 a few weeks later the escape club hit no 2 with 
wild wild west it is now moving up the british charts as is 
giant steps peppy dance single another lover 
already we are noticing a better reaction to the record this 
time around mcfarlane said its getting more air play and the 
general vibe is a bit better all because it was a hit in america 
mcfarlane and partner colin campsie recorded their album the 
book of pride in los angeles with american producers which may 
explain the records american appeal they began working with an 
american producer last year but he was too busy to devote enough 
time to them 
in the end we just got fed up so we sacked him said 
mcfarlane it caused problems because our record company said 
you just cant come to la and sack your producer we said well 
we have so goodbye 
their insouciance clearly did them no harm because they returned 
to los angeles in the fall and started work with songwriterproducer 
gardner cole who wrote madonnas hit open your heart 
cole cowrote their hit another lover and helped with their 
next single into you 
mcfarlane said input from an outsider was both helpful and 
difficult gardners writing influences are similar to ours so 
that was great but its difficult writing with someone else 
because songwriting is a very personal thing and having someone 
else involved can be a problem 
before becoming giant steps mcfarlane and campsie were known as 
the quick under that name they released a couple of albums and 
had good reviews but few sales 
we changed the name because we decided there was a certain 
stigma attached to the quick we had released records for quite a 
few years but they were never commercially successful we finally 
decided that at least in this country wed never get djs to notice 
our records as the quick plus we felt we needed a fresh start 
thats what this is for us a new start 
the fresh start may include an american hit but mcfarlane said 
its still important to be successful in britain 
having success in the uk leads to things in europe so that 
would be nice he said but most of all its just nice to be 
appreciated by the people in your own country its our home so of 
course wed like to have success here

hague is one of the top pop producers in this country a figure 
so familiar on the local music scene that few people know hes 
actually american 
thus the information came as a shock to the bpi that bastion of 
british music when it decided to nominate him as british producer 
of the year for 1986 following his success with the pet shop 
boys single west end girls 
the bpi had to withdraw the nomination because its rules say only 
britons are eligible 
my manager phoned them to let them know im american hague 
35 said in an interview at londons advision studios they said 
oh thats too bad because hes going to win 
hague a bostonian has made his name producing hits by the pet 
shop boys orchestral manouvres in the dark new order and erasure 
he is rarely out of the top 10 but has built a reputation as an 
individualist rather than a formula hitmaker 
stephen hague isnt associated with a restricted style said 
paul trynka editor of britains international musician and 
recording world magazine thats why hes maintained his 
credibility 
unlike producers whose songs are interchangeable no matter who 
their artist is hague tends to consider the band and the song and 
work from there hes seen as being much more versatile trynka 
said 
hagues first productions were of his own band jules and the 
polar bears after they split up in 1979 he got deeper into 
recording technically speaking things were a little backwards 
back then hague recalled but it was good learning that way 
id be a little concerned about people coming into the 
technical side of the business now there are a lot of things people 
in my generation learned that they dont have the opportunity to 
learn now it was harder to make things work then you had to try 
and get a good sound without much equipment 
with modern technology anyone with enough money can make a 
decentsounding record hague says its too easy theyve got 
this great drum sound or horn samples and theyve got the miami 
beat or the chicago sound but they havent got a song a lot of 
people skip the idea of having a good song these days 
besides his recent work with american singer jane wiedlan hague 
works exclusively with british acts preferring their energy and 
originality the whole british scene is just much more vibrant 
he says 
in 1979 singer peter gabriel gave a hague tape to his recording 
company charisma which liked it enough to hire him as a producer 
his first hit was with the british band rock steady crew 
he now works in britain france norway and australia commuting 
between hotels and rented apartments but he considers boston his 
home and owns a house there 
i didnt wake up one day and say id like to be a producer 
but now i think it is the best job in the music business hague 
said 
the main reason is that my career doesnt rise and fall with 
each individual release the way an artists does an artist can wait 
10 to 18 months between releases and one flop can affect them for a 
long time if i have a flop now i have something else coming out 
almost immediately 
his failures are rare thats why artists wait so long for hague 
to become available hes booked through may 1989 
its a great position to be in so even though its a lot of 
work id be stupid to back off he said ive worked a long 
time to be where i am now 
he says he would have liked the bpi award but has no hard 
feelings i dont really need awards big validating gestures of 
my work he says thats not necessary im pretty content with 
myself

a reallife crocodile dundee is 
heading for america meet the bush tucker man australias newest 
folk hero 
but unlike the character made famous by paul hogan in two hit 
movies les hiddins is for real and his tv show on how to survive 
on food found in the bush is one of the most popular programs around 
a major in the australian army hiddins has spent 10 years in the 
bush showing soldiers how to survive on tucker australian slang for 
food bush tucker is food that abounds in the bush such as crocky 
apples mangrove worms matchbox beans supple jack a 
kind of celery and witchety grubs which resemble giant worms 
and taste like cashew nuts 
snakes and lizards also get the thumbs up from hiddins 
he says he never gets ill but a typical hiddins bush menu might 
make the less adventurous slightly queasy 
supper to him might be devils guts with fruit from a plant 
he calls dogs vomit tree because it tastes so awful washed 
down with water from a billabong the aboriginal word for pond 
when i can i eat steak and eggs like all australians he 
said but it doesnt always work out right thats when you start 
scratching for food 
napoleon bonaparte who said an army marches on its stomach may 
have had second thoughts if he had seen hiddins menu but to the 
australian army hiddins is a hero who deserves a medal 
thanks to the hidden things he finds and talks about on his 
show the army is mapping entire northern australia from the 
kimberleys in the west to cape york in the east with photographs 
of whats edible in each area just in case australian soldiers are 
ever forced to live off the land in the outback 
the army is indebted to him said lt col ian edwardeson 
if australians ever find themselves at war in those areas the 
army would know how to survive you cant put a price on that 
hiddins is not easy to reach he has covered 31000 miles in his 
quest for undiscovered bush foods he spends eight months of the 
year in the bush and in a recent interview attributed 999 
percent of his bush tucker knowledge to aborigines he has listed 
600 kinds of foods 
when i was a kid i used to eat bush tucker he said i used 
to eat the odd green ant 
his hobby developed after reading about australian explorers who 
perished in the interior for lack of food in areas indigenous 
aborigines regard as a pantry 
in one episode of bush tucker man hiddins stood in the wreck 
of an american b24 bomber little eva which had crashed in 
northern queensland in 1942 during world war ii three american crew 
members perished because they didnt know what to eat in the bush 
the whole area in which they perished is loaded with food its 
like a supermarket hiddins said 
the army has published 400 different maps of hiddins 
gastronomical guide to the outback and several hundred more are to 
be printed edwardeson said 
the swarthy 42yearold bushman is to quit the army next year to 
become a civilian consultant to the army 
according to australian broadcasting corp production manager 
anne chivas bush tucker man is one of the networks most 
popular programs she said it has been offered to the united states 
and a second series may be in the making 
bush tucker man is the latest television series in which 
australians are rediscovering the outback the crocodile 
dundee movies were smash hits here and in america the nature of 
australia a pbs series celebrating australias bicentennial won 
rave reviews here 
aborigines australias indigenous inhabitants have always known 
the bush was a supermarket as well as a giant drugstore for 
centuries they used plants leaves and barks to solve ailments 
ranging from arthritis and stomach problems to flu skin sores and 
itching 
i used to think aboriginal remedies were hocus pocus said 
andy barr a pharmacist with the northern territory health 
department not anymore

the patch of beach on the sea of galilee 
where jesus is believed to have performed the miracle of the loaves 
and fishes has become a sanctuary from the violence of the 
arabisraeli conflict 
palestinian activists wounded in the nearly yearlong uprising 
against israel live side by side in tabigha with handicapped 
israelis and german volunteers 
in this place there is no room for violence said johannes 
roelofsen a west german social worker who four years ago founded 
the tabigha resort for the handicapped nestled amid palm trees and 
flower beds on the northern tip of the sea of galilee 
the spirit of the place is still present a place where all of 
a sudden 5000 people became a community he said referring to 
the new testament account of the miracle in which jesus fed 5000 
followers with five loaves of bread and two fishes 
roelofsen a large bearded man from wissen an der sieg in west 
germany spoke in tabighas outdoor dining area where palestinians 
in wheelchairs and young german volunteers sat around large wooden 
tables noisily sharing a simple rice dish 
the intefadeh palestinian uprising is making us all a little 
crazy here we can have some fun and forget whats happening in the 
west bank said one of the diners hassan dahdouh a 24yearold 
laborer from the west banks nablus whose right leg has been rigid 
since being shot in the knee during a clash with israeli troops in 
march 
in a later interview ephraim moore 35 an israeli paralyzed by 
polio said i met a girl from the west bank in tabigha we went 
to a conert in jerusalem together 
tabigha and the adjacent church of the multiplication of loaves 
and fishes are administered by the roman catholic benedictine order 
and financed by donations from around the world handicapped guests 
stay free sleeping in simple huts and helping with the chores 
after the first victims of the uprising began to arrive 
roelofsen recruited an israeli physiotherapist daniela epstein to 
set up exercise routines he said hospitals in the occupied lands 
dont provide rehabilitation programs 
ms epstein a volunteer said many palestinians were initially 
suprised to be treated by an israeli but quickly settled into a work 
routine 
one of her patients is akram muktassab a 23yearold paraplegic 
from hebron on the west bank who was shot by jewish settlers last 
year he was using a wheelchair until he met ms epstein who taught 
him to walk along parallel bars his legs encased in plaster casts 
he was very excited when he took the first steps ms epstein 
said he cried he couldnt believe he could do it 
muktassab said meeting ms epstein has helped him get over the 
hatred he felt for jews after being wounded 
daniela is jewish but she helped me said muktassab his 
muscular arms resting on his withered legs 
other palestinians are less conciliatory 
i want to take revenge and build up my arms so i can throw 
stones again said amer albasha 24 a tailor from nablus who has 
been walking on crutches since april when he said he was beaten 
unconscious while in army custody 
albasha spoke while sitting on the floor with his legs stretched 
out and pushing up his lower body with his arms the exercise was 
designed for him by ms epstein 
this is certainly not my intention ms epstein said in 
response to albashas remarks but palestinians also have a right 
to rehabilitation regardless of politics 
roelofsen 39 said when handicapped israelis and palestinians 
first meet at tabigha they are usually suspicious of one another 
and sometimes get entangled in political arguments 
but after a while the handicap becomes more important he 
said they talk about where you can find the best wheelchairs 
roelofsen cited a recent encounter between jewish teenagers in 
wheelchairs and palestinian youths from broken homes 
the jewish kids wanted to go swimming in the lake but we 
didnt have enough attendants to take them he said so the 
palestinian kids took them into the water 
friction does exit at tabigha but its usually over things other 
than the palestinian conflict 
for example albasha shouted at maria gorius 25 a volunteer 
exercise coach from saabruecken who had taken one of his crutches in 
an effort to prod him into walking again 
this kind of straightforward treatment is a new experience for 
the handicapped roelofsen said 
they feel for the first time what its like to be accepted as 
equals

is dennis miller the sarcastic wisecracking 
anchor of saturday night live too smart of a smartaleck 
millers sardonic style and obscure asides are what make his 
humor work but they sometimes work against him 
david letterman arguably the sultan of sarcasm recently needled 
miller for making a particularly esoteric reference 
its doctor iq paul hes here tonight letterman sneered 
to bandleader paul shaffer 
a chicago suntimes critic while calling miller hip and 
brilliant said the persistent putdowns in his recently 
released video make him sound like a pompous jerk by the tapes 
end 
even snl has poked fun at miller colleague dana carvey showed up 
on weekend update to do a perfect impression of miller while 
sitting right next to him flipping the hair and smirkingly calling 
everybody chacha 
but the style seems to be working 
this fall is miller time he was married earlier this year and 
just celebrated his 35th birthday his standup routines can be 
bought on video live from washington its dennis miller or 
on record the offwhite album and he received three awards for 
cable excellence nominations for his hbo special mr miller goes 
to washington 
then theres the regular exposure on snl as weekend update 
anchor the role originated by chevy chase the fall presidential 
campaign provided a mother lode of material 
one jibe now let me get this straight bush is antiabortion 
but prodeath penalty it guess its all in the timing huh 
and another inspired by a picture of dan quayle holding a 
pumpkin whats the difference between these two spherical 
objects one of them will eventually have a light in it 
in october michael dukakis was shown in a videotape playing the 
trumpet with taps dubbed on the audio 
miller a pittsburgh native who studied journalism at point park 
college labored for years as a standup comic before being spotted 
by snl veterans al franken and tom davis producer lorne michaels 
putting together a new cast for the 1985 season tapped him to 
anchor the weekend update segment 
i have the luckiest life in the world i pinch myself 
miller sounding not the least bit pompous said recently in his 
small 17thfloor office i cant believe ive gotten what ive 
gotten from these same little jokes i used to tell and get nowhere 
on his desk under the gaze of a large silkscreened image of 
elvis presley is a stack of paper scraps notes for an upcoming 
update jotted down whenever they strike him he reads several 
newspapers and magazines and watches newscasts each day 
when im off im a usa today guy im like anyone else the 
first thing i go for is the box scores he said 
but when im on i read everything i watch it during the week 
i try to keep up on jargon phrasings important to a newscast i 
try to keep up on the lexicon of america 
although pegged to the news weekend update often becomes 
millers standup act only sitting down 
its obvious to everybody its not a parody of a newscaster 
anymore its dennis just being dennis at a news desk he said 
and what is being dennis 
the overall tenor of it is lowkey cynicism nonthreatening 
cynicism he said i think theres a certain arrogance to it 
but i dont think its offputting 
the sneering attitude that fuels his humor is taken too 
seriously he said when he said west virginia makes mayberry look 
like a thinktank the offended state was a random choice its 
not as deep or as vindictive as people would tend to think miller 
said 
as for his fondness for obscure references often to babyboom 
pop culture he says its sometimes for the cognoscente and i 
dont need everyone to get it i dont feel elitist about that i 
just write for me at some point 
of course he writes for others as well and hes clearly 
pleased with the album and video 
i was more than happy to get my act out there intact he 
said its like a childhood fantasy if youre a comedian i 
remember the album wonderfulness and all the cosby things and 
to think you have an album its a neat feeling

nbcs miami vice has thrived on style and 
executive producer michael mann is determined the detective series 
will wrap up its fifth and final season the same way 
for the final season our writers are taking the mythology of 
our best episodes seriously said mann what were trying to do 
is write to that mythology our aim is to do a series of classic 
vices the stories the writers are coming up with are on track 
what is that mythology 
a hardnosed attitude toward life mann replies yet its 
not all grim and serious 
the decision to bring miami vice to an end wasnt lightly 
made but mann and stars don johnson playing sonny crockett and 
philip michael thomas ricardo tubbs thought it was time to move 
on nbc has not officially acknowledged the decision to end the 
series 
it was by our election to end the show so were planning for 
it said mann as a result its kind of liberating and has 
generated a lot of enthusiasm the shows going to be around a long 
time in syndication and we all want it to end well were going to 
end it with a twohour episode salazar a latin american strong man 
who can cut deals will figure in that story 
the finale is still under wraps but dont look for sonny 
crockett to open a bait shop in the keys and ricardo tubbs a charter 
service in bimini 
the original concept of the show which made its debut in 
september 1984 was a kind of mtv cops it pulsated with rock music 
and vibrated with pastels its sparkling imagery came right out of a 
music video 
but this season sonny and ricardo seem to wear only blacks and 
grays and the images seem to be filtered through sepia 
creator anthony yerkovich set the tone in the twohour pilot 
script in which sonny and tubbs battled evil and corruption against 
the backdrop of floridas glitzy gold coast 
the show was symbolized by the reflection of the neon and lights 
in the black sheen of their ferrari as they raced around miami 
sonny crockett was a vice detective whom johnson played as a 
knight errant in dented armor he had a raspy voice a threeday 
beard no socks and pastel versace suits his partner tubbs played 
by thomas was explained as a black new york street cop who first 
came south to find the drug dealer whod killed his brother edward 
james olmos played their taciturn boss lt martin castillo 
at the start of the fifth season sonny has been knocked cuckoo 
and thinks he really is sonny burnett his drugdealing undercover 
alter ego and mann is preparing for the windup sonnys brother 
will show up this season and cause him trouble a few loose ends 
from various stories will also be taken care of 
although miami vice was rapped several years ago for 
emphasizing style over content mann said he is now satisfied with 
the scripts being turned out under the direction of robert ward the 
show got off the track when mann temporarily left to direct 
manhunter based on thomas harris suspense novel red dragon 
in the second season i went off to do the picture and i 
thought i had everything set up to function while i was gone he 
said forget about that it was total meltdown the first day of 
shooting manhunter i got a phone call from miami vice all hell 
had broken loose 
there was no conscious attempt to rely on style its not in 
the script but once you set the style it becomes automatic the art 
director costumers editors all know what to look for you dont 
have to reinvent it every week but you do have to reinvent the 
story every week and what we had was an absence of stories the 
style became more obvious because the story wasnt there 
after miami vice mann has a number of other projects lined 
up among them is a sixhour miniseries for nbc based on elaine 
shannons desperados the book tells of latin drug lords and the 
murder of enrique kiki camarena of the us drug enforcement 
agency

this fall hutchinson county became the 
52nd texas county without a hospital when the town of borger lost 
golden plains community hospital a 33bed center brought down by 
financial problems and a steadily declining number of patients 
the decision to close was made by its outside owners the 
atlantabased gateway medical systems inc and doctors and county 
officials are trying to find a buyer 
but in the meantime residents of the rural panhandle county must 
drive at least 28 miles if they need anything fancier than stitches 
or a cast for a broken bone 
the doctors will meet patients in their offices to treat minor 
emergencies said dr eduardo coligardo who was chief of staff at 
golden plains if its a major emergency we refer them to a major 
hospital usually in amarillo an hour away 
just 100 miles to the southeast is the town of memphis a fifth 
the size of borger but recently the victor in a fight to keep hall 
county hospital open and operating after predictions it would shut 
in two months local people raised 366000 in six weeks to buy new 
equipment and recruit another doctor 
small community hospitals have become all but extinct in the 
western and southwestern sections of texas home to about 400000 
people in 1986 and 1987 texas led the nation in hospital closings 
twentyfour of the 32 hospitals that were shut were in rural areas 
so far this year 19 texas hospitals have closed 10 of them in 
small towns and rural areas according to the texas hospital 
association 
charles bailey tha vice president of legal affairs said the 
states vastness is one simple reason for the high failure rate 
among hospitals tiny rural hospitals cant afford to keep up with 
the technology and expertise offered by the big medical centers in 
the cities demand for rural hospital beds has dropped below 20 
percent in some cases bailey said as urban hospitals advertise to 
attract outlying patients 
but more important is the ailing texas economy 
with businesses having trouble and some employees being laid 
off and losing thir insurance uncompensated care has increased in 
the state which puts strain on hospitals financially he said 
the worsening texas economy has added to the indigent population 
hospitals provide more than 12 billion in uncompensated care each 
year 
while thousands of rural texans are learning to live without the 
protection of a nearby hospital people in hall county decided to 
take a stand 
in midseptember an analysis team from an urban hospital 
predicted the county hospital was failing and would fold by 
thanksgiving it took just six weeks for residents to prove them 
wrong 
we realized we had to do something for ourselves or we 
wouldnt have a hospital said bill cosby a retired accountant 
during the sixweek fund drive children emptied piggybanks 
citizens raffled off pickup trucks and sides of beef and the 
memphis police chief used his radio to appeal to passing truckers 
for donations 
almost twothirds of the money raised was earmarked for new 
equipment that would draw patients other funds went to recruitment 
costs and salary for a new doctor to supplement the efforts of two 
elderly physicians who serve the countys 5000 residents whose 
average age is 57 
the strong community support that characterized the fundraising 
effort should be enough to ensure the hospitals future survival 
but most communities arent as lucky said dave clark regional 
health care services coordinator for the panhandle health care 
coalition 
hospitals will continue to close although some may be able to 
convert to clinics or emergency care centers 
some of these towns will just have to face the fact that they 
wont have a hospital he said their hospital may just be a 
facility where a patient can be stabilized before taking the patient 
on to a city hospital

in the beachfront copacabana neighborhood 
in rio de janeiro drivers run red lights on an average of 50 times 
an hour 
since becoming mayor of sao paulo in 1985 former president janio 
quadros has personally given out more than 20000 tickets for 
traffic violations 
across this nation of 144 million people and 13 million motor 
vehicles 25000 people are killed and 350000 injured a year in 
traffic accidents 
so far as anyone here knows that makes brazil the worlds most 
hazardous place to drive or cross a street 
about 47000 people are killed annually in traffic in the united 
states but it has 177 million vehicles in a population of 2422 
million 
faced with highway carnage brazilian officials have started to 
take serious steps to punish reckless drivers including proposals 
for increased jail sentences and stiff fines that in some cases can 
exceed what a person earns in monthly wages 
reasons given for the carnage on brazilian roadways include 
an inborn passion for moving fast 
weak and ineffective traffic laws and enforcement 
national economic problems such as 1000 percentplus annual 
inflation that forces people to run around day and night to make 
ends meet 
we have a vietnam in traffic every year said justice 
minister paulo brossard in announcing a national traffic safety 
program proposing tougher treatment of bad drivers 
it is civil war said jose fernando eichenberg the no 2 
official in the ministry and a critic of weak traffic laws 
under the new program traffic fines have gone up by as much as 
300 percent in some places a ticket for speeding or running a red 
light costs the equivalent of 88 while parking in a prohibited 
zone can go as high as 140 brazils montly minimum wage is about 
60 
people are concerned with what hurts their pocketbooks said 
cyro vidal the traffic director of sao paulo brazils biggest city 
and trafficaccident leader it used to be cheaper to take a 
ticket than pay for parking 
but vidal added in an interview that sao paulos 4 million annual 
traffic fines equal to the number of cars in the city really 
havent reduced violations or accidents 
mayor quadros routinely jumps out of his official car to hand out 
tickets for traffic violations for really gross infractions he 
calls a tow truck to haul away the violators car the mayor also 
has placed the remains of smashed and twisted cars on special 
platforms throughout the city pinning signs to the wreckage that 
read haste 1 life 0 
but the wrecks continue anyway 
gov orestes quercia of sao paulo state has outlawed the sale of 
liquor at cafes and truck stops along state highways but the news 
media have reported that the law the first of its kind in brazil 
is being widely ignored 
the head of the traffic department in rio de janeiro jose alves 
de brito said that in his city at least repression does not 
achieve objectives 
rio drivers are not civilized he said citing such 
violations as chronic drunken driving speeding lack of respect for 
traffic lights and signs parking on sidewalks and even highspeed 
zigzagging in tunnels 
brito said that because of brazils dismal economic situation 
with record inflation and the falling buying power of the cruzado 
the nations currency people need to earn more to maintain their 
economic status and so must be on the go all day 
accidents are a reflection of those problems he said 
traffic authorities have some hopes for a plan to modify brazils 
penal code to change traffic violations from simple misdemeanors to 
felonious crimes the plan proposes up to six months in jail for 
reckless driving a year in cases involving serious injuries and 18 
months for a fatal accident 
it also provides for mandatory driver education in high schools 
and colleges and monthly upward readjustment of the amount of 
traffic fines the latter is aimed at violators who wait until the 
end of the month to pay the fines and thus take advantage of the 
daily devaluation of the cruzado

oldtimers with long memories 
knew it was there archivists gave it a special place in the history 
books but millions of people passed by the wreckage without a clue 
it was there 
then in the summer of 1988 a woodcutter dropped a cigarette and 
started a 450000acre forest fire that laid bare the bones of a 
world war iivintage b17 bomber 45 years after it went down on a 
frigid spring night carrying 10 young airmen to their deaths 
besides blackening hundreds of thousands of acres in americas 
first national park and triggering an uproar over firefighting 
policy on public lands the intense blazes in yellowstone also 
revealed some of its old secrets 
the fires exposed a lot of old road cuts torn up culverts and 
bridges and abandoned dump sites said tim hudson yellowstones 
maintenance chief and a sanitary engineer we vaguely knew about 
all that stuff but over the years trees had grown up around it and 
it became hard to get to too expensive to remove or people forgot 
about it 
our rehabilitation efforts following the fires have also given 
us an opportunity to do some monumental cleanup of old junk because 
we have the helicopters here to help us do it 
besides rebuilding burnedout bridges repairing bulldozed and 
handcut firelines and fixing trails and public facilities park 
crews also raced the winter to remove all debris from the crash of 
the b17 tail no 4230260 
ground teams carefully collected the shattered rusted pieces of 
50caliber machine guns splinters of practice bombs once filled 
with sand and dozens of bullets 
much of the aluminum and steel already twisted by the crash was 
charred from the north fork fire the weathered metal was loaded 
into helicopter slings and hauled four miles north to a sorting area 
inside the park near west yellowstone mont 
the main wreckage and the 20foot crater created by the massive 
bomber when it plowed into the ground around midnight may 23 1943 
had been covered over by initial rescue crews so hudsons cleanup 
team left it undisturbed 
the stuff we pulled out totals about 25000 pounds said 
hudson we flew all the bullets out first then dumped and burned 
their powder the biggest piece we recovered was a wing tip we also 
found the vertical and horizontal stabilizer on the tail section a 
mile from the main crash site 
even the archivists had missed that one on their maps and charts 
because in the past half century the forests of yellowstone had 
grown up around the site to create a living green shroud 
hardly any wreckage was recognizable park records indicate that 
a few years after the crash a yellowstone ranger salvaged enough 
aluminum to make a snow plane forerunner of the snowmobile the 
area also showed signs of earlier scavenging and looting nothing 
recovered this fall was deemed usable so the park service with 
department of defense approval will sell it as scrap to the highest 
bidder 
poking through the forest fires ashes park employees also found 
small reminders of the airmen who died 
we found part of a leather jacket a shoe some pieces of belts 
and rings off of parachute harnesses said dick bahr 
yellowstones air operations supervisor there was no identifying 
markings on any of the personal gear so we sent it to a mortuary to 
be incinerated 
it was precious little to commemorate the burial ground of an 
airplane once hailed as the queen of the skies and singled out 
by the smithsonian air and space museum as the most powerful weapon 
in the war against hitlers germany 
in 1983 park service historical archivist andy beck collected 
every scrap of information he could find about aircraft no 4230260 
and compiled it in a plastic ringbinder now kept at yellowstone 
headquarters 
the plane with 11 men on board was flying from marysville 
calif to its home base at lewiston mont according to an army air 
corps investigation the pilot climbed to 15000 feet above reno 
nev and soon hit rough air he was flying by instruments 
next to the line citing nature of accident was this notation 
airplane encountered icing conditions no definite knowledge of 
what happened 
retired yellowstone park ranger tom ela never knew the cause but 
he remembers the crash well 
my wife betty and id been to a birthday party and had just 
gotten home when we heard the plane go over i went to the window 
because i knew it wasnt sounding right we could hear it go into a 
scream as it went down 
ela rushed to a nearby observation plateau and saw the sky alight 
with flame the plane carrying live ammunition burned on impact 
there was confusion about the number of men aboard so ela was 
among searchers looking for survivors on the third day when he 
clibed a tree and hollered hallooooo for the hundredth time an 
answering call came back 
he said his name was mcdonald he was very very cold and he 
asked where am i because he had no idea recalled ela who now 
lives in santa fe nm 
when i told him he was in yellowstone national park he couldnt 
believe it he told me hed been sleeping right by the hatch with 
his parachute on apparently hed had a tight squeak before on a 
flight and he was the only one in the crew who had his chute on 
when he heard in his headphones this is it this is it get 
out he just rolled out the hatch and pulled the cord he saw the 
plane crash below him and knew hed made it but didnt know if 
anybody else did that was bothering him a lot 
mcdonald told ela that later as hed wandered alone in the woods 
for two days hed wondered if hed had a nightmare and bailed out 
by mistake as his plane flew on to its home base 
the army air corps listed lt william mcdonald bombardier as 
the only survivor after leading mcdonald out of the woods ela 
helped pack out on horseback the dead men and the planes top secret 
equipment 
the official investigation concludes that 2000 square feet of 
yellowstone were damaged the aircraft was totally destroyed and 
the pilot no signature available deceased absolved the park 
service of any blame 
hudson bahr and other park employees agreed that working on the 
b17 cleanup had been an interesting chapter in the story of the 
yellowstone fires next summer they hope to tackle an even bigger 
rehabilitation project 
theres a b47 bomber still out there in an area that didnt 
burn said hudson it crashed in 1963 killing four air force 
crewmen without any fire or explosion we estimate its wreckage at 
85000 pounds if we can get the big helicopters back in here next 
summer that ought to keep us busy

before leaving for work aliza 
herbst packed sandwiches for her five children and drank a cup of 
coffee with her husband 
then she slipped a pistol into her purse 
irrational violence has made us fearful explained mrs 
herbst 36 an immigrant from san antonio but were the kind of 
people who will put our bodies and lives on the line for what we 
believe in 
nearly a year of palestinian rebellion has prompted many jewish 
settlers in the occupied west bank to make pistols or automatic 
rifles a part of their daily lives 
mrs herbst and her husband gershon moved to this tightknit 
west bank community 13 years ago because they wanted to put down 
roots in a place where crime was virtually nonexistent and 
neighbors shared basic religious values 
but ofra like the 118 other jewish settlements in the west bank 
has been thrust into the midst of the palestinian uprising in which 
settlers have become targets of roadside ambushes and rockthrowing 
protests 
the americanborn couple still describes the settlement with its 
lawns and rows of identical orangeroofed houses as a community in 
which kids can wander free and you dont have to lock your front 
door 
but the the violence surrounding ofras 760 residents echoes at 
the herbst familys dinner table and in its living room 
on one recent jewish sabbath the youngest children played on the 
bare tile floors in the family home before joining their parents in 
prayers songs and friday night dinner 
after the meal 10yearold yehuda brought a tattered palestinian 
flag into the kitchen 
i will give it to them then kill them he boasted to a young 
friend while clutching the red white green and black banner 
his parents cast disapproving looks across the table explaining 
later that teaching the children to deal with anger is one of the 
challenges of raising a family in the midst of the uprising 
i dont want my kids going around being hateful said herbst 
a native of brooklyn ny we always take time to talk to them 
about the situation they know people get hurt and they have to 
express their fears 
traveling beyond the settlements perimeter has become risky 
herbst a partner in a farm cooperative carries an m16 assault 
rifle on trips to his fruit orchard which is near jerusalem 15 
miles south of ofra 
its not an overreaction to shoot id rather deal with the 
judicial system than the hospital system herbst explained as he 
drove along unlighted west bank roads on a saturday night with the 
rifle at his side 
according to law in the service of man an arabrun human rights 
group jewish settlers have killed 12 of the 315 palestinians who 
have died since last december as a result of the violence five 
israeli civilians have been killed in the occupied lands 
one victim of palestinian attacks was meshulam moscowitz a 
neighbor of the herbsts who is still recovering from a head wound 
suffered in a stonethrowing arab ambush eight months ago doctors 
implanted a plastic plate to repair his damaged skull 
now moscowitz wears a bicycle helmet and carries an automatic 
rifle when he travels beyond the line of olive trees that separates 
ofra from the neighboring arab village of ein yabrud 
i dont want it to happen again said the new yorkborn 
moscowitz who taught selfdefense courses to the settlements 
children before the attack but im not going to leave now and 
show them that throwing stones works

finally with the christmas 
season hard upon a wintry land the fires have gone out in 
yellowstone national park 
it has been half a year since lightning hit a tree near rose 
creek on may 24 and ignited the first of 20 wildfires in the 22 
millionacre park 
that blaze died on its own but others christened hellroaring 
and storm creek clover and mist and huck roared up from smoldering 
embers to engulf nearly half of the first national park in walls of 
flame that eventually stretched 20 miles wide and 40 miles long on 
two fronts 
the firestorms of yellowstone were awesome and frightening 
despite the efforts of 25000 firefighters only the natural forces 
of snow and rain were a match for the fires fury 
by midnovember the firefighters were gone and the remnants of 
flame no longer demanded constant attention as inches then feet of 
snow fell on the park tucked into the corner where wyoming idaho 
and montana meet park officials officially declared the 
conflagration over nov 18 
after six months of trying to fight fires patch together 
disrupted services and keep the park gates open yellowstone 
officials at last had a chance to assess damage and prepare for the 
future 
they have already asked congress for 213 million toward fire 
recovery including elaborate exhibits books traveling information 
teams and extensive research of that money 10 million would be 
used to repair actual fire damage 
we lost 100 power poles and 18 miles of line which amounted to 
about 40000 pounds of copper wire said tim hudson yellowstones 
maintenance chief at one time we were running 13 generators and 
using 5000 gallons of diesel fuel a day just to keep this park 
operating we didnt get full power restored until october 
about 200 miles of roadside terrain needs to be rehabilitated 
by taking down all the burned trees the snags which threaten to 
fall on the highway lord knows how many need to be pulled down 
along the hiking and ski trails then we have to cut the stumps down 
to ground level and grind up their tops spread wood chips out and 
cover them with soil so theyll decompose 
we had 32 miles of bulldozer line but we got that fixed about 
1000 miles of handcut fire lines still have to be repaired on one 
trail alone weve got to replace seven pedestrian bridges weve got 
to clean up and aerate the soil at more than 150 helicopter landing 
sites all the backcountry campsites used by fire crews also have 
to be rehabbed 
hudson is a straightforward manager whose vanity is a handlebar 
mustache that makes him look like the villain who tied pauline to 
the railroad tracks he was an unheralded hero of yellowstones 
summer of smoke as he organized his beleagered maintenance crews to 
rush from one disaster to another 
they set up miles of sprinkler pipe at old faithful and canyon 
village saved 26 backcountry cabins with a juryrigged system of 
hoses strung from tiny creeks and frantically wrapped an enormous 
steel water tank in fiberglass insulation that burned off but saved 
the tank 
generally hudsons staff held the entire parks infrastructure 
together with ingenuity improvisation and as hudson put it a 
lot of luck 
at some point i knew it would end i just never thought it 
would go on so long said hudson who took six days off in the 
five months of the worst strain i also knew that when it did 
ultimately end wed be stuck with the leftover mess 
of the request for funds now with congress hudson asked for 
90000 to rehabilitate bulldozer lines 15 million for electrical 
services 1 million to groom highway corridors another 1 million 
to upgrade 600 miles of hiking trails and 15000 to rebuild a 
burnedout bathroom 
decades of forgotten debris camouflaged by growing trees was 
exposed by the fires so rehabilitation crews also targeted for 
cleanup piles of tin cans old culverts abandoned campsites and 
even the wreckage of a b17 bomber that crashed in 1943 
immediately after the worst of the fires were contained park 
officials offered free firewood along the roadside to anybody who 
wanted it hudson estimated several thousand cords of charred fuel 
went to the public he also negotiated a contract with a livingston 
mont lumber company to pay the park 25 for every 1000 cubic feet 
of snag trees it hauled away that project is expected to last well 
into next summer 
never without his walkietalkie hudson prowled yellowstones 
roads supervising crews trying to clean up the leftover mess 
until snow closed most of the highways its his responsibility to 
get the park in shape for next summers tourist season 
lore williams is one of hudsons assistants as yellowstones 
landscape architect ms williams 33 was criticized at the height 
of the blazes for resisting the use of bulldozers and heavy 
equipment to build fire breaks inside the park 
i felt the heat both literally and figuratively ms williams 
said wryly acknowledging her role in helping direct a firefighting 
strategy that is to be reviewed by congress amid outcries about 
mismanagement 
from the beginning we assigned resource people to work on every 
fire to brief crews on how to cut hand line in a serpentine way so 
it wouldnt be so hard to rehabilitate it said ms williams a 
park employee for four years when they put that bulldozer line 
in it was overrun six hours later we knew it wouldnt hold 
it took an operater 325 hours on a rubbertired excavator plus 
20man crews using hand tools for several weeks to fix it now im 
worried that poachers will use the new dozer roads in the back 
country 
ms williams is frustrated by the amount of humancaused damage 
left behind by the thousands of firefighters who camped for months 
in yellowstone 
our top priority was hauling out trash and food that could 
attract bears she said we worked our tails off to get the 
bulldozer firebreak rehabbed before winter but weve got a long way 
to go on the hand line a 20person crew can only rehabilitate two 
miles of hand line a day 
ms williams supervised eight crews this fall and hopes to have a 
similar number back on the job next spring if theres enough money 
each crew includes seven sawyers certified to use chain saws two 
fallers approved to bring down trees one emergeny medical 
technician and at least two squad bosses 
its filthy unglamorous work in the cold wind and ash said 
ms williams who spent part of every day supervising from a 
helicopter but we are trying to work with the natural scene we 
are trying to heal the scars

when ltv corp announced a 124 billion 
thirdquarter loss the news passed almost routinely largely 
because the troubled aerospacesteelmaker has been under bankruptcy 
court protection for more than two years struggling to find a 
formula to cut expenses and pay creditors 
but buried in ltvs quarterly financial statement released this 
past week was an explosive accounting charge that grabbed the 
attention of many publicly owned companies that could face similar 
balancesheet shockers in the next few years 
ltv said it was putting 226 billion aside for what the company 
anticipates will be its potential liability in health insurance 
costs of 118000 current and retired employees 
under present accounting rules companies arent obligated to 
report these estimated expenses or reserve money for them they only 
have to report retiree health insurance costs as they are incurred 
on what is known as a pay as you go basis 
but the financial accounting standards board the 
governmentsanctioned authority for accountants is planning to 
propose a new rule in january that would require companies to show 
all retiree health insurance costs those incurred now and expected 
in the future as a liability 
with medical costs soaring at an average rate of 20 percent a 
year the potential liability of us corporations is staggering 
with nothing in place to offset the expense 
the employee benefit research institute a nonprofit organization 
in washington has estimated that nongovernmental employers owe at 
least 1687 billion in retiree health benefits assuming medical 
inflation eventually is brought under control 
more pessimistic forecasts put the potential liability at 2 
trillion to 3 trillion said deborah shollet an institute official 
none of this liability shows up in quarterly earnings statements 
or annual reports to shareholders as though it doesnt exist that 
is the main reason why the accounting rule change was proposed 
these are big benefits they represent big obligations said 
michael johnston a partner at hewitt associates a chicagobased 
benefit consulting concern that has been advising clients on the 
implications of the rule change he said many corporate accountants 
are concerned 
i think most companies are going to fight tooth and nail 
against this type of thing johnston said its accounting for 
future inflation long before inflation comes into play and its 
going to have such a big hit on earnings so most corporations have 
to argue against it 
many accounting experts saw ltvs move to anticipate the expense 
now as part of its bankruptcycourt housecleaning and some believed 
other companies would wait for the new accounting rule before doing 
anything 
if youre trying to come out of bankruptcy and come out 
starting fresh you dont want to do it with a 226 billion 
liability said diana scott project manager of the financial 
accounting standard boards change on postemployment benefits who 
is helping draft the new rule 
she said companies will have an opportunity to comment on the 
rule after the board promulgates a draft in january public hearings 
would follow and a final rule is expected in 1990 
almost everybody will acknowledge theres a liability and it 
should be recorded the question is how to record it ms scott 
said 
the uncertainty raised by the accounting boards intentions as 
dramatized by the ltv action is likely to at least force some 
companies to start making contingency plans benefit consultants say 
a few already are looking closely at how to minimize their 
retiree health insurance exposure by restricting the amount of money 
they contribute or even eliminating such benefits entirely 
such cutbacks could affect millions of employees hewitt 
associates has calculated that 86 percent of the 800 biggest 
companies provide medical coverage after age 65 and 92 percent 
provide it before age 65 
it will be impossible for employers to provide the same 
benefits theyve been providing said richard s raskin a new 
yorkbased consultant with the wyatt co a large 
compensationbenefits consulting firm 
i think the trend is to take a look at what the promise to 
employees is and make it limited and manageable he said its 
no longer a case of were going to provide you with all sorts of 
medical benefits 
some experts speculated that large mature industries with huge 
retiree populations such as the steelmakers automakers and 
utilities will have the hardest time under the new rule vibrant 
young businesses with relatively few retirees wont feel the impact 
for a while 
nevertheless all companies with retiree health plans could be 
equally affected as the babyboom work force matures into retirement 
age early next century and the cost of such benefits escalates 
ms scott said the accounting standards board has been working on 
the proposed rule for a few years and realizes the enormous 
pressures it could create on corporate americas finances for that 
reason she said such a change would likely be phased in over a 
period of years 
we have this tremendous unfunded obligation right now she 
said to put that on the balance sheet would just be onerous we 
recognize that

wall streeters are bracing for what might be a 
long winter waiting for the first skirmishes in the battle of the 
budget between george bush and congress 
most handicappers in the financial world say the odds are not 
good that the presidentelect will be able to get much cooperation 
from the democraticcontrolled congress on measures to deal with the 
federal budget deficit 
even if a constructive mood should develop most analysts agree 
the new administration will start out burdened with a heavy load of 
problems and no clear mandate from the voters on what to do about 
them 
and while such worries have become a dominant force in the 
thinking of many investors there is still nearly two months to go 
before bush even takes office 
george bush has inherited some serious problems say analysts 
at wright investors service in bridgeport conn 
the takeover activity that pushed stock prices so high these 
past five years represents a significant risk should recession or 
high interest rates turn the leveraged buyout debt bad 
the deficit spending that helped propel the us economy to the 
longest peacetime expansion in history cannot be counted on forever 
there is a limit to the debt which the us economy can 
support and the dollars recent weakness suggests we are close to 
that limit 
yet the wright analysts say bushs mandate does not appear to 
extend beyond maintaining the status quo 
congress may not allow president bush a graceful way out of his 
read my lips no new taxes pledge and may not support his 
flexible freeze on government spending 
byrle abbin a tax partner in washington with the accounting firm 
of arthur andersen amp co says the new president and congress are 
likely to find themselves playing a game of chicken leaving 
budget matters to be resolved in a lastminute crisis atmosphere 
stock prices which had been slumping since the election early 
this month managed to show signs of steadying in the past week but 
trading was quiet and by all accounts uninspired 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1227 to 207468 
the new york stock exchange composite index edged up 45 to 
15063 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 120 to 36638 while the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 452 at 29119 
volume on the big board averaged 10788 million shares a day 
down from 13608 million the week before 
financial analysts say bushs campaign vow against increasing 
taxes while it may have helped him win the election may hinder him 
in his dealings with congress by fostering an adversary atmosphere 
the flexible freeze which limits spending increases to the 
rate of inflation will also be very hard to attain declared 
harold nathan at the wells fargo bank in san francisco 
it would require big cuts in defense spending which bush does 
not so far want 
adding to the problem of reducing the deficit is the 
presidentelects preferences for reducing the capital gains tax and 
for increasing spending on education and child care 
in addition said nathan the optimistic forecasts for 
balancing the budget by 1993 assume rapid economic growth and low 
interest rates a recession between now and 1993 would set back the 
timetable extensively 
so it is no wonder that the postelection focus on the deficit 
reduction process weakened the dollar significantly

the farmers home administration is mailing out 
today the last of 83480 delinquency notices to farmers who owe more 
than 8 billion in pastdue government loans 
agency officials began sending out the notices by certified mail 
on nov 15 telling fmha borrowers they have 45 days to complete and 
return the nine forms basically the notices tell farmers about the 
options they have for settling their debt including restructuring 
and writeoffs 
congress ordered fmha in the agricultural credit act of 1987 to 
revise its lending practices including ways to handle longoverdue 
debt owed by thousands of farmers parts of the law were put into 
effect earlier in the year but debt writedown or forgiveness 
kicked in this month 
the purpose of the notices is to give delinquent borrowers an 
opportunity to let fmha know how they want to handle their debt 
under the new laws provisions 
leland h swenson president of the national farmers union 
explained the new law basically says fmha must give borrowers 
whose delinquency was caused by factors beyond their control 45 days 
to convince the agency that it could recover more by working with 
them than it could by forcing them out 
swenson added clearly the law puts the burden on borrowers to 
prepare their financial arguments quickly and thoroughly 
if a farmers response or application to fmha on how he plans 
to settle the debt is accepted by the agency the chances of 
survival are brightened but if a borrowers plan is rejected or 
if a reply is not sent at all then foreclosure or forced sale of 
property is likely 
although agency spokesmen say no hard estimates are available as 
to how many of the 83480 delinquents may be foreclosed or forced to 
sell out estimates have ranged from around 10000 to more than 
40000 
vance l clark fmha administrator has said that eventually up 
to 30000 borrowers could face foreclosure 
clark resigned his job earlier this week according to fmha 
spokesmen he had previously indicated leaving around dec 1 sox 
johnson acting associate administrator took over the job 
no official announcement was made of clarks departure although 
a farewell party was held in usda on tuesday afternoon 
clark who spent 42 years with the bank of america before taking 
over fmha more than three years ago bristled at accusations the 
agencys notices or program are unfair 
if anything i tell my people were getting ready to jump start 
thousands of american farmers out there clark said recently in 
des moines at a bankers meeting the good news is that the relief 
measure is being offered i think its going to play well 
but there is some pressure on fmha to extend the 45day period 
for borrowers to return their financial forms including a request 
from 14 members of congress 
rep byron l dorgan dnd one of the petitioners said he was 
concerned that borrowers may not be able to get all the information 
and assistance they need before jan 1 because many banks and 
offices may be closed several days for the holidays 
these notices include over 200 pages of complex regulations 
dorgan said i feel that farmers should be given sufficient time 
to analyze the regulations and compile the necessary information to 
fill out the forms correctly

a federal judge has ruled that 
tennessees antitakeover laws are unconstitutional and cannot be 
used to stop tyson foods incs bid to buy out holly farms corp 
these acts violate the commerce clause of the us constitution 
to the extent they apply to target corporations organized under the 
laws of states other than tennessee us district judge thomas a 
wiseman wrote in a memorandum 
wiseman on wednesday enjoined the state from enforcing the laws 
to prevent a takeover of holly farms 
tyson of springdale ark the nations largest poultry producer 
last month made a 52pershare takeover offer for the memphisbased 
food producer it has extended the offer until middecember 
holly farms has rejected tysons bids and struck up a deal to 
merge with conagra inc of omaha neb through a stock swap 
conagra is the fifthlargest poultry processor in the nation 
wednesdays ruling came just days after tyson sued holly farms 
and conagra in chancery court in wilmington del where the three 
companies were chartered 
the suit filed monday seeks to invalidate the proposed holly 
farmsconagra merger as well as an option the holly farms board 
granted to conagra allowing the nebraska producer to purchase holly 
farms top poultry assets in the event the merger fails 
wiseman said tennessees laws violate the commerce clause because 
they regulate interstate commerce risk inconsistent regulation and 
place an excessive burden on interstate commerce in relation to 
local benefits 
the state laws passed march 11 include the investor protection 
act which regulates takeover offers for corporations that are 
incorporated or have principal offices in tennessee and substantial 
assets in the state 
the other three laws require an investor to wait five years or 
more after acquiring 10 percent of a companys stock to make a 
takeover offer strip voting rights from a potential buyer and 
regulate corporations not incorporated in tennessee 
state attorney general charles burson said he had not yet decided 
whether to appeal wisemans decision

britains merchandise trade deficit more than 
doubled to 293 billion pounds or about 54 billion in october as 
exports fell sharply and imports surged the government announced 
friday 
the bank of england pushed up interest rates a full percentage 
point to 13 percent half an hour after the trade report was released 
at 1130 am the rate increase the first since a fullpoint hike 
on aug 25 steadied a plummeting pound but sent stock prices 
plunging 
the increase underscores the governments determination to take 
no risks with inflation said a treasury official who wasnt 
identified in accordance with british practice the benchmark rate 
has been pushed up 55 points since june 
britains major commercial banks quickly responded to the central 
banks signal with barclays bank plc national westminster bank 
plc and lloyds banks plc increasing their benchmark rate 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said on british 
broadcasting corp television that the worsening october figures 
should be viewed together with good figures in the previous month 
adding interest rates do take time to take their full effect 
lawson has said repeatedly that interest rates would have to rise 
further if the nations economy continued to move at too fast a rate 
the british pound dropped from about 18335 to 18220 on the 
trade news but it bounced back to 18370 on the rate increase 
but developments sent the financial times stock exchange

about 1 pm its worst level for the day moments before the trade 
report the index was down just 11 points

blamed partly on erratic items and distortions caused by a september 
mail strike compared with a revised deficit of 109 billion pounds 
or 2 billion in september and of 954 million pounds or 18 
billion in october 1987 
exports fell 10 percent in october while imports gained 12 
percent the department of trade and industry said

pounds 45 billion in october compared with a revised deficit of 
594 million pounds 109 billion in september and a deficit of 491 
million pounds 903 million in october 1987 
the department said the september postal dispute affected the 
recording of exports but not imports as much as 300 million pounds 
of exports 552 million that were allocated to september should 
have been allocated to october it said 
the department also said that octobers imports included around 
400 million pounds 736 million in erratic items such as precious 
stones and aircraft 
since the beginning of 1988 britains merchandise trade balance

ask wall streeters why they are so worried about 
the economic outlook right now and chances are they will point to 
the socalled yield curve 
if this statistical measure keeps going the way it has been 
headed lately a good many analysts say it could signal trouble 
ahead for both the business outlook and the stock market 
the yield curve depicts the relationship between shortterm and 
longterm interest rates 
most of the time it stands to reason that longterm rates should 
be significantly higher than shortterm rates since longterm 
lenders expose themselves to greater risks 
you might be highly confident of a borrowers ability to repay 
six months from now but much less sure of its prospective status 20 
or 30 years in the future 
similarly you might not worry much about inflation eroding the 
purchasing power of your principal between today and next summer 
but who knows what a dollar will buy two or three decades down the 
road 
in the real world however the relationship of short and long 
interest rates is constantly fluctuating when long rates are 
significantly higher than short the curve depicting them is said to 
have a positive slope 
since early this year by contrast the yield curve has been 
flattening while longterm rates have risen overall shortterm 
rates have been climbing faster 
by one measure using shortterm commercial paper issued by 
businesses and topgrade corporate bonds the yield spread has 
lately grown narrower than at any time since 1981 observed martin 
zweig in his advisory letter zweig forecast 
at least the spread between long and short rates is not 
negative zweig said when that is true an inverted yield 
curve it tends to be poison for stocks 
why should a seemingly arcane statistic cause such a fuss a 
flattening or inversion of the yield curve is often associated with 
a recession said jack lavery research chief at merrill lynch 
the link between inverted yield curves and recessions comes 
from underlying imbalances 
a rise in shortterm rates usually occurs because the federal 
reserve tightens monetary policy when inflation pressures start to 
build during the mature stages of a business cycle speculative 
inventory building adds to pressure on shortterm rates 
high shortterm rates in turn act as a brake on economic 
activity 
the last three times shortterm rates went higher than long rates 
in 1969 1973 and 198081 the stock market took a beating and 
the economy headed into recession 
only once during the past 30 years has an inversion in the 
curve not been followed by a recession lavery said the 
exception was in 1966 when slower growth but not a recession 
followed 
lavery notes that the forces flattening the yield curve this time 
seem to differ from past instances for one thing he says business 
inventories are not building up to extreme levels 
but the federal reserve has been tightening credit in an effort 
to forestall any substantial revival of inflation and to some 
degree to support the dollar in foreign exchange markets 
there is widespread conjecture on wall street that the fed might 
soon clamp down further with another increase in its discount rate 
concluded zweig we certainly dont have an inverted yield 
curve right now but were getting closer and if the dollar 
continues to disrupt the financial markets we might just get 
there

christmas shoppers wading into the postthanksgiving rush today 
face a little added pressure this year tight inventories 
thats a business decision prompted by a longrunning slump in 
the retail business but for consumers it means limited selection 
and shortages of hotselling items 
todays opening of the nations annual shopping spree finds 
retailers optimistic about improving their seasonal sales but 
conservative enough to stock sparingly 
inventories have been tight for much of the year and few 
retailers are likely to take many chances at this point 
the advice from industry analyst monroe greenstein of the 
investment firm bear stearns amp co is to shop early 
if consumers want to buy popular items they better not wait 
he said 
many shoppers took that advice seriously 
in the dayton ohio suburb of miami township k mart manager 
william parsons said there were more than 400 shoppers in his store 
by 720 am he said luggage appears to be popular this year 
especially small customized foot lockers those things are just 
flying he said 
ll bean inc opened a warehouse sale at 8 am in freeport 
maine and hundreds of people were waiting in line said spokeswoman 
catharine hartnett the long line remained even an hour after the 
doors opened she said 
there were already at least a dozen shoppers in line when 
levinskys department store in portland maine opened at 7 am 
said general manager fred bowering 
filenes basement bostons highly popular discount department 
store was packed less than an hour after it opened were fed up 
with all the people said shopper kathy donahoe some of them 
are really hostile 
the most popular items this season are expected to include 
designer and cashmere sweaters leather goods and compact disk 
players and for children nintendo video games and barbie dolls 
it is still too early to get a true reading on whether this is 
going to be a nailbiting christmas we never anticipated christmas 
1988 to be a barnburner christmas said mike wellman marketing 
vice president for k mart corp in troy mich 
there are more people working the election is behind us and 
people seem to be reasonably if not optimistic comfortable with 
the shape of the economy 
k mart with thousands of discount stores book shops and 
drugstores expects holiday sales to run about 6 percent ahead of 
last year in the range of most optimistic forecasts 
for k mart and other big retailers the decisions that may make 
or break christmas 1988 were made as long as 16 months ago 
we have been playing the whole inventory thing conservatively 
all year long and thats continued right into christmas wellman 
said 
promotions are expected to help generate traffic 
while the day after thanksgiving is the traditional start of the 
season many stores have had their decorations up for weeks at saks 
fifth avenues flagship store in manhattan for instance the 
evergreens went up right after halloween 
to get chicago shoppers in the spirit marshall fields hired 
carolers and minstrels to roam its stores and installed a christmas 
tree in one location that it calls the tallest indoor 
handmadeornament tree in the world 
some sale signs and price markdowns will be popping up around 
the country but analysts say many of these promotions also were 
planned in advance and prices have been adjusted to account for them 
we continue to operate in a very competitive environment and 
we see some caution on the part of the consumer said kathy 
blackburn of mervyns a hayward califbased department store 
chain 
sears roebuck amp co the nations largest retailer plans to 
give shoppers a taste of the new low prices that are part of its 
recently announced restructuring plan 
most sears stores will not switch to everyday low pricing 
until next year but the company will still be touting holiday sale 
items 
some retailers say price chopping may be inevitable later in the 
season 
in a survey conducted last month by the accounting firm touche 
ross amp co 90 percent of a group of 70 new england retailers said 
major markdowns would take place earlier or at the same time as last 
year 
the last couple of weeks have been especially encouraging to some 
retailers who noticed a pickup in business immediately after the 
elections 
if you had asked me eight weeks ago i wouldnt have been as 
optimistic said randolph burnette division president of jb 
whites department stores in augusta ga

management of the chicago tribune has accepted a 
settlement to end a 3year strike by the newspapers unionized 
printers officials said today 
the printers members of local 16 of the chicago typographical 
union approved the pact and an 856 million settlement fund sunday 
on a 18043 vote 
a company spokesman said lawyers accepted and signed the 
settlement on behalf of the newspaper thursday and forwarded it to 
morton bahr president of the washingtonbased communications 
workers of america the parent body of the printers union 
the agreement was crafted under the guidance of former us labor 
secretary wj usery 
under the agreement the 119 printers who have remained on strike 
will have the option of a buyout or a lifetime annuity as well as 
receiving companypaid medical insurance 
when the strike began 40 months ago 240 printers walked off the 
job 
under the agreement the 50 printers who remain at the newspaper 
after a 1986 unconditional offer to return can stay or can each 
accept a 30000 cash buyout 
the agreement does not affect strikes by mailers and pressmen at 
the newspaper those unions and the company are involved in a series 
of strikerelated lawsuits and proceedings before the national labor 
relations board 
the printers strike largely resulted from the companys desire 
to gain greater control over hiring and assignments in the composing 
room the unions representing mailers and pressmen went out in 
sympathy with the printers but teamster drivers of delivery trucks 
stayed on the job and distribution of the newspaper continued 
under the agreement the printers also agreed to drop a lawsuit 
pending in federal court the lawsuit alleged that the company 
violated a 1975 agreement in which members were guaranteed lifetime 
employment in exchange for the introduction of new laborsaving 
technologies

futures prices of grain and soybeans opened 
moderately higher in light trading today on the chicago board of 
trade reflecting higher prices for soybeans and soybean meal in 
europe on thursday 
up to 80000 metric tons of soybean meal and as many as 40000 
metric tons of soybeans were traded at higher levels in rotterdam 
the netherlands and that sparked interest here this morning 
because it showed interest over there said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
forecasts for a dry weekend in the south american soybean belt 
added to the bullish tone in the soy markets he said 
futures prices of wheat and corn were up slightly on continuing 
expectations that the soviet union and the united states will sign a 
longterm grain sales agreement early next week 
the grain markets are optimistic about a new grain pact with the 
soviets if it doesnt happen itll be a disappointment 
lespinasse said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 420 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 1 cents higher with december at 265 a bushel oats were 2 
cents higher across the board with december at 214 a bushel 
soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with january at 761 a 
bushel

the pressure to force george bush to renege on 
his promise not to raise taxes began months ago but it turned 
fierce within hours of his election as president he must go back on 
his word they said 
they can be just about anyone so diverse is the they 
group it includes financial leaders and labor leaders tightfisted 
republicans and liberal democrats conservative and ultraliberal 
economists 
so uniform is the cry it would seem to leave bush with no 
options but it isnt so he has several of them 
most cynical of them is to give in and then blame congress to 
fight a battle worthy of his promise knowing that in the end he will 
submit and while still denouncing higher taxes allow them to be 
imposed 
another is only slightly less cynical but it has been used over 
and over in recent years it is a creative technique an art that 
raises taxes without ever using the word tax relying instead on 
a string of elusive euphemisms 
why bring up the nasty t word when user fees revenue 
enhancers earmarking mandated benefits education premiums and 
other nontax taxes have already been imposed and can be reused and 
extended 
revenue enhancers for example raise funds without any 
legislation or attendant controversy laws already on the books 
simply are employed more intensively congress is not involved 
controversy is kept to a minimum 
revenue enhancing at the internal revenue service for instance 
means tightening procedures hiring more auditors scrutinizing 
returns challenging taxpayers and carrying more disputes to court 
aside from these two procedures however the bush team has still 
another option and that is to hold firm 
such a stand would seem to require fortifying the white house and 
building a moat around it because the tax increase crowd is armed 
for the battle with statistics moral preaching and a near consensus 
of economic thinking 
any economic consensus is a frightening thing seeking to trample 
and ridicule other notions uncertain mercurial changeable most of 
the time economists in consensus constitute a rigid selfrighteous 
intellectual bloc 
but there is another side to the budget deficit controversy and 
it is likely to emerge more forcefully over the next fe weeks in 
response to the onslaught from advocates of a tax increase 
stephen moore of the heritage foundation a washingtonbased 
conservative think tank that has been highly influential in the 
reagan administration has challenged the consensus 
moore maintains that the deficit already is being reduced by 
economic growth and that if congress holds spending to a rate of 
less than 4 percent a year the entire deficit will be eliminated in 
1993 without any new taxes 
the facts are on bushs side says moore there is no 
reason for him to retreat from his pledge 
paul craig roberts former white house adviser and now with 
georgetown universitys center for strategic and international 
studies also contends the deficit already is being overcome 
in a column for business week magazine roberts says federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and others who claim we cannot 
outgrow the deficit are in obvious contradiction to the fact that 
we have been doing precisely that 
he also cites the view of robert eisner a professor at 
northwestern university and president of the american economic 
association that the budget deficit might even be a product of 
incorrect measurements 
it is conceivable in fact that once the bush team marshals its 
economic arguments it might not even have to consider any option but 
that of standing firm

a federal appeals court stalled the 26 
billion hostile takeover of polaroid corp by shamrock holdings 
inc ordering the investment group to make corrective disclosures 
about its offer shamrock said 
shamrock headed by roy disney a nephew of the late walt disney 
planned to make the required disclosures promptly and seek to have 
the court order lifted so it can pursue its offer to acquire the 
instantfilm company shamrock spokesman tom reed said friday 
the ruling was issued late wednesday by the 3rd circuit court of 
appeals the court instructed the us district court in delaware to 
enjoin the shamrock offer until corrective disclosures were made 
the court sought clarification of the applicability of federal 
margin regulations to the offer reed said calling the order to 
provide more information a technicality 
the ruling followed a polaroid appeal of an earlier order to 
provide the names and addresses of workers who participate in an 
employee stock plan reed said 
that legal wrangle is separate from a suit by polaroid seeking an 
order blocking burbankbased shamrocks 42ashare tender offer to 
buy the company from shareholders 
thats the big case that will decide this thing reed said 
this other thing about technical disclosures is just a little 
sideshow 
polaroid is incorporated in delaware where state laws make 
hostile takeover bids more difficult to complete than in some other 
states

late rains dried up plans by 
argentine wheat farmers to cash in on last summers drought in the 
united states further enhancing the switch to soybeans in this 
agricultural exporter 
not just me every farmer anticipated sowing more cereal 
crops said alejandro delfino whose 1976acre farm lies in santa 
fe province northwest of buenos aires 
but the countrys fertile pampas were hit by their own mild 
drought during a threemonth period through early october when the 
rains returned 
the national grain board estimates 114 million acres of wheat 
were planted a decline of 494000 acres from last year which was 
the smallest planting in a decade 
farmers intended to plant as much as 6 million hectares 148 
million acres said hector niell the boards president who 
estimated that yields would drop by 20 percent an acre or more 
the ministry of agriculture projects that wheat production will 
amount to about 84 million tons a drop of about a million tons 
from this years crop 
the planting of other crops is taking place normally however 
and 1989 looks to be another banner year for farmers who reaped a 
1 billion bonanza when prices for soybeans soared due to the 
drought in the united states 
prices have remained high and argentinas crop exports in 1989 
should fetch 55 billion or about 1 billion more than this year 
niell said 
an additional 25 million acres are being planted in soybeans 
affirming that as the main export crop in a country that for decades 
depended most heavily on wheat farmers planted 104 million acres 
of soybeans in 1988 
argentina is the worlds no 2 exporter of corn no 3 producer 
of soybeans and no 4 producer of wheat soybeans replaced wheat as 
the countrys top export in 1987 
total production wheat soybeans corn sorghum soybean oil 
pellets and other crops is projected at 38 million to 40 million 
tons up from 36 million tons in 1988 niell said 
about 12 tons are consumed domestically and the rest is offered 
for sale abroad said guillermo toranzas an economist for rural 
society a powerful farm group 
peak production 44 million tons was achieved in the 198485 
season 
argentina easily could produce 60 million tons a year bu 
does not because of agricultural subsidies by the united states and 
european economic community that protect their lucrative markets 
niell said 
but farm groups also complain about domestic barriers to 
production 
the most aggravating is a dual exchange system by which farmers 
who want to import machinery are obliged to purchase us dollars at 
the commercial rate of 14 australs to 1 but are reimbursed by the 
central bank for dollars they earn from export sales at the rate of 
121 
the system was imposed by the government in august to raise 
revenue and foreign exchange farmers consider it an export tax 
also farmers say argentinas infrastructure deficiencies 
inadequate roads outofdate trains lack of bank credits limits 
production as do government policies that favor industry at the 
expense of agriculture

los angeles county had a yen for new dollars so 
it went across the pacific to get some in a roundabout way 
deciding to forgo the public bond market the county agreed to 
borrow 100 million from nippon life insurance co and long term 
credit bank of japan ltd with the loan to be repaid over 10 years 
at a belowmarket interest rate 
while simple on the surface getting to that point took two years 
of groundbreaking bargaining 
the pact is thought to be the first of its kind between a local 
us government body and foreign businesses it involves a special 
currencyswap arrangement said anthony c hughes a vice president 
at first boston corp los angeles countys financial adviser 
under the agreement he said the county will receive 100 
million worth of yen that will be converted into dollars at a fixed 
rate the loan will be repaid in dollars then converted back to yen 
hughes said the currency rate will be fixed at the date of the 
deals closing expected before years end and that will provide a 
hedge against any risks from fluctuating currency exchange rates 
a fixed interest rate also will guard against volatility in the 
credit markets which set the pace for rates interest repaid by the 
county will be equal to the rate of the 10year us treasury note 
at the closing plus 058 percentage point at todays rates that 
is lower than the 10 percent charged for the prime lending rate of 
major american banks 
hughes said that while the deal appears to be more favorable to 
the county it also will help boost japans image in the area 
there is significant interest on the part of japan to do business 
in la and with labased companies he said 
hughes said the 100 million would be invested in highgrade 
bonds with the profits used to help reduce the unfunded liability 
in the employees retirement system 
we have been shopping for opportunities in the taxable market 
and this is the first and best opportunity we have found said 
richard b dixon the countys chief administrative officer 
the county had been seeking alternatives to the domestic market 
after congress eliminated local governments ability to issue 
taxexempt pension bonds under the 1986 tax reform act 
while some analysts predicted the countys arrangement with 
nippon and long term credit bank might prompt other municipalities 
to seek similar arrangements to get a more competitive interest 
rate those close to the los angeles county agreement were not so 
sure partly due to the complexity of their deal 
weve had a lot of calls mostly from municipalities that are 
curious said sharon yonashiro director of public finance for the 
county treasurers office but im not sure how broad this is 
going to apply 
she also noted that most japanese companies prefer to deal with 
large loans 
other than very large borrowers the us taxable bond market 
would generally be more attractive she said 
neal attermann municipal reserach director of the investment 
firm kidder peabody amp co inc agreed 
he predicted such a deal could become a viable alternative if 
californias controversial insurance rate rollback was upheld by the 
courts and insurance companies ultimately left the state 
california itself might have to become an insurer and go 
abroad for funds he said

this might be considered a crummy year for boeing 
co if it werent selling commercial jets at the rate of 85 million 
a day 
theres been no dearth of bad news in 1988 for the giant 
planemaker 
longtime customers complained about quality employees working 
with new materials complained of mysterious ailments the navy was 
upset with a contract there are lingering problems with commuter 
planes 
a muchpromoted new jumbo jet was delayed so was a major star 
wars project so was a new helicopter so was the presidents new 
jet 
most dramatically a harrowing accident in which the top sheared 
off a boeing 737 over hawaii underscored concerns about how long 
airlines can continue to fly old jets 
all of that aside the company smashed industry records for 
number and value of aircraft ordered in a single year 
with this fourth straight year of record orders boeing has 
guaranteed work for its two jetliner factories well into the 
mid1990s its boeing commercial airplanes division is increasing 
production across the board only the third such time its done so 
boeing has introduced two new passenger jets this year plans a 
third for may and is thinking about a fourth and possibly a fifth 
on the military and aerospace sides several projects could start 
moving from development into production in the next few years 
meaning theyll start bringing in money 
they can have all eight cylinders percolating at the same time 
here in a few years said paul nisbet aerospace industry analyst 
for prudential bache securities in new york 
so far this year boeing has announced orders for 595 commercial 
planes worth 28 billion up from 366 planes worth 199 billion 
last year boeing has about twothirds of the world commercial jet 
market with rivals airbus industrie and mcdonnell douglas corp 
sharing the remainder 
the record could go higher several major carriers including 
united airlines and twa reportedly are considering major purchases 
for the first nine months of 1988 boeing earned 440 million or 
288 a share on sales of 1209 billion up from 339 millon or 
218 a share on sales of 1087 billion in the same 1987 period 
boeing has an order backlog of more than 1000 jets and has been 
setting delivery dates as late as 1995 
to accommodate that growth boeing is boosting production of 767 
widebodies and 747 jumbo jets next year midsized 757 jetliners in 
mid1989 and the smaller 737s in mid1990 
an absolutely massive exercise says philip condit boeing 
commercial airplanes executive vice president for production and 
engineering 
in late summer boeing announced that electrical problems had 
forced delays in delivery of the new 747400 jumbo jet the worlds 
largest commercial plane to the first 20 customers deliveries are 
expeted to be on track by secondquarter 1989 
boeing began 1988 with the unprecedented introduction of two new 
aircraft on the same day the 747400 and the 737400 an updated 
and stretched version of the workhorse twinjet both are popular 
sellers 
but soon came word that some major boeing customers including 
japan air lines british airways all nippon airways and american 
airlines were upset at the quality of some planes they were getting 
more production problems were reported in early summer when 
workers at a boeing fabrication plant began reporting ailments 
ranging from nosebleeds to headaches and memory loss they 
attributed the illnesses to chemicals used to make lightweight 
aircraft parts 
air samples at the plant showed nothing untoward but the 
complaints have persisted two medical panels have been formed to 
study the problem and boeing has cut back on the chemicals use 
on april 28 the top of an aloha airlines 737 ripped off at 
24000 feet sweeping a flight attendant to her death before the 
plane could land safely the 19yearold plane with nearly 90000 
flights was one of the mostused in the 737 fleet and the accident 
prompted a round of investigations and discussions about aging 
aircraft 
boeing says its planes have an indefinite life if they are 
properly maintained and intensified its studies of older aircraft 
the four airlines whose workmanship complaints were publicized 
all have since made sizeable orders with boeing aloha also bought 
replacement 737s 
boeing offers eight aircraft models with anywhere from 108 to 660 
seats the planes are grouped into three families 747s 75767s 
and 737s that share many systems and dont require a pilot to 
recertify to fly another model within a family 
boeings newest plane the 108seat 737500 rolls out next may 
and condit said were looking very hard at a larger 767 
an existing 767300 holds about 250 passengers and condit said 
the new plane designated 767x is envisioned at 300 or 350 seats 
or both 
as boeing speeds jet construction its struggling to keep its 
moneylosing de havilland commuter plane line on schedule boeing 
officials havent hidden their disappointment since buying de 
havilland from canada in 1986 
in defense and space work 1988 also has been uneven this fall 
boeing rolled out its first avenger launch system for stinger 
missiles and the space shuttle discovery carried a boeingbuilt 
rocket booster in september 
but there have been delays on several major projects including 
navy a6e attack aircraft the v22 osprey tiltrotor helicopter and 
the airborne optical adjunct a strategic defense initiative project 
problems with wiring in two 747s being built as new air force 
ones pushed back the delivery of the first presidential jet 13 
months to next november 
judith comeau analyst at goldman sachs amp co in new york said 
boeings earnings from military and aerospace work will fall to 48 
million this year from 179 million in 1987 
how long can the good times roll depends on the economy says 
boeing commercial airplanes president dean thornton what it comes 
down to he says is that if people have money to fly airlines have 
money to buy planes 
still condit remembers that both times boeing increased 
production on all its lines in 196768 and 197879 it promptly was 
pounded by a recession 
everybodys been watching that one he said everybodys 
been looking over their shoulder and saying ok when

boeing cos future probably holds one and 
possibly two larger widebody jets and a supersonic transport 
company executives say but not the 7j7 
when first proposed three years ago the 7j7 j for the 
consortium of japanese manufacturers interested in the plane was 
to be one of the most innovative planes boeing ever built 
it was to make extensive use of composites and other hightech 
materials fly by wire electronic controls computerized 
instruments and a new unducted fan engine that would have 
external propellers 
trouble was boeing said after postponing the program last year 
market indicators continued to present different requirements on 
airplane size and configuration 
translation nobody wants to buy one 
asked recently whether the 7j7 would ever be built philip 
condit executive vice president for production and engineering at 
boeing commercial airplanes said as described at that point 
probably not 
he said manufacturers have to try to guess market demands 10 
years into the future 
our best guess is there is going to be a fair amount of 
pressure due to airport gate constraints congestions on the 
bigger sizes condit said thats why the effort now on 767x 
the 767x is a new larger version of the 767 widebody which 
comes in two sizes the model 200 which holds 216 passengers in 
two classes and the 300 which carries 261 
condit said boeing is considering a version that would seat 300 
people and possibly a version for 350 passengers 
the 767 is becoming more attractive to airlines thanks to a 
federal aviation administration rule change earlier this year 
allowing the twoengine planes to fly routes 120 minutes away from 
usable airports that qualifies it for use on many overwater routes 
richard albrecht executive vice president for sales and 
marketing at boeing commercial airplanes said the company expects 
the faa to extend the authorization to 180 minutes soon which would 
allow 767s to fly transatlantic routes 
boeing also has plans for a supersonic airliner but executives 
doubt it will fly in the next 20 years 
the economics of the supersonic transport have to be roughly 
comparable to that of the subsonic transport in order for it to make 
sense commercially albrecht said 
a supersonic flight between los angeles and australia might take 
five hours instead of 15 aboard a 747 but albrecht says he doubts 
too many passengers would pay double the fare to save that time 
while the concorde supersonic airliner has been successfully 
marketed as a premium transatlantic service i dont believe 
anybody will build the next generation of the supersonic transport 
to serve a niche market which is what the concorde is serving 
now he said

futures prices of wheat and soybeans posted solid 
gains friday on the chicago board of trade in a broad rally 
analysts said the rally was fueled by brisk soybean trade on 
european markets and expectations for a new ussoviet grain 
agreement 
the wheat market had its strongest day since oct 3 wheat 
futures surged in response to a french press report that us and 
soviet negotiators would open a final round of talks monday in 
moscow on renewing a 5year grain pact that expired on sept 30 a 
2year extension is expected 
analysts said up to 80000 metric tons of soybean meal and as 
many as 40000 metric tons of soybeans exchanged hands at higher 
prices in rotterdam the netherlands during the week an indication 
that export demand for us soybeans may also rise 
recurring talk of dry conditions in the south american soybean 
belt where planting is well underway also lent support to the 
soybean market but analyst cathy leow of thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york said such concerns were premature 
there are some areas of dryness but at this point in the crop 
year you cant get too excited about it she said 
at the close of trading wheat was 1 cents to 7 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 425 a bushel corn 
was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 265 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with december at 215 a 
bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 12 cents higher with january at

stock prices lost ground in very light 
postthanksgiving day trading today depressed by expectations of 
higher oil prices 
the session after thanksgiving is usually one of the quietest 
days on the year on wall street as many market participants take a 
long holiday weekend 
this time however those traders who were present responded 
early in the session to the news of a tentative agreement by members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries on production 
quotas aimed at shoring up oil prices 
the prospect of increased energy costs weighed down the credit 
markets prices of longterm government bonds which move in the 
opposite direction from interest rates fell nearly 10 for each 
1000 in face value this morning 
the stock market followed suit with the notable exception of 
energy stocks

crude oil prices soared friday after opec 
ministers announced a tentative accord on curbing production but 
analysts expressed skepticism the cartel would be able to restrain 
output for long 
analysts said they doubted the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries would succeed in driving prices back 
up to their target of 18 a barrel even in the short run 
the analysts also said consumers should see little effect from 
the agreement 
we dont know if opec nations are going to adhere to an 
agreement said william byers an analyst at bear stearns amp co 
in new york if so prices could go higher but thats an 
assumption thats premature to make 
steve hanke an economics professor at johns hopkins university 
in baltimore said cheating could occur right from day one and 
in fact theres every reason to believe it will 
opec members have been producing far above the cartels overall 
ceiling set in a 1986 agreement 
final approval was still up in the air for the latest accord 
which hinged on iran accepting production parity with iraq iranian 
oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh who previously had said iran 
would never agree to sharing an equal quota with iraq flew to iran 
friday morning to seek agreement from his government to do just that 
to win agreement the ministers apparently agreed to allow iran 
to pump more oil while most of the remaining countries would cut 
output to meet the new overall ceiling 
the ministers scheduled a meeting for saturday evening for a 
formal vote on the pact 
asked if he thought the proposed agreement would be ratified 
saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer sounded cautious i hope 
so yes he replied 
the oil minister for the united arab emirates mana saeed otaiba 
also left to consult with his president sheikh zayed bin sultan al 
nahyan who was in rabat morocco the uae is one of several opec 
members that have been openly violating their quotas 
the proposed agreement calls for opec to sharply cut its 
production from an estimated 225 million barrels a day currently to 
185 million barrels a day in the first six months of the year the 
aim is to reduce the glut of crude oil on the world market and 
bolster prices 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi said the 
cartel will try to achieve that the benchmark price as quickly 
as possible 
i think we can reach that within a few months he said 
but fergus macleod an oil analyst with barclays de zoete wedd in 
london said he doubted the price of west texas intermediate the 
major us crude grade would climb beyond 17 a barrel 
in london the price for january delivery of brent the benchmark 
north sea crude shot up 167 a barrel to 1442 it had been 
trading below 12 a barrel before the opec meeting 
the new york mercantile exchange was closed thursday and friday 
for the thanksgiving holiday so there was no trading in west texas 
intermediate the january contract for that grade rose 11 cents a 
barrel to 1397 on wednesday 
analysts predicted the opec accord would have only a minimal 
impact on consumers 
ian graham an analyst at the london investment firm county 
natwest noted that oil companies had not lowered gasoline prices 
during the recent slump in crude oil prices 
there seems little justification for increasing them on the way 
back up he said 
macleod also said he doubted oil companies would try to pass an 
increase through to the retail level 
the tentative accord was announced late thursday after a week of 
informal private negotiating sessions at opecs annual winter 
meeting much of the talking was aimed at resolving the bitter 
dispute between iran and iraq which ended an 8year war in august 
iraq demanded an equal production quota in any new accord with 
iran but aghazadeh said iran would never agree to that iraq had 
refused to abide by the previous production agreement because it was 
not given parity with iran 
opec did not release details of the tentative agreement but one 
provision would give iran and iraq the same daily production quota 
of 264 million barrels without diminishing irans demand to retain 
a 14 percent share of opecs total output under the current 
production agreement iran had a quota of 24 million barrels 
analysts calculated saudi arabia would have a quota of about 452 
million barrels a day under the new proposal up from 435 million 
barrels in the existing accord that would be a sharp drop from the 
6 million barrels that saudi arabia is thought to have been pumping 
recently 
the united arab emirates which has been greatly exceeding its 
current ceiling of 948000 barrels a day would get a new cap of 
986000 according to an estimate by macleod

a tentative opec accord aimed at boosting crude 
prices by cutting back output would have little immediate impact on 
texas oil producers industry experts said friday 
but it could help bolster natural gas prices and brighten the 
budget outlook for the 1989 legislature they said 
iraqs oil minister predicted the tentative deal would send crude 
oil prices soaring to 18 a barrel within a few months although 
analysts said they doubted prices would rise that high 
obviously from the standpoint of texas the higher the price 
of oil the better our economy can perform said ray perryman 
director of the baylor university forecasting service 
over the short term our economy has been driven by other 
things such as manufacturing but over the long term it would have 
a much more substantial effect perryman said 
the tentative deal worked out by the ministers of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries was announced late 
thursday it would reduce the amount of oil opec has been producing 
by an estimated 4 million barrels a day 
but given the history of infighting among cartel members and 
cheating on individual quotas many analysts predicted the agreement 
would not last long enough to push prices up to 18 from the 
14abarrel range 
nevertheless such a steep climb would not prompt drastic changes 
among texas oil producers but could stimulate exploration and 
production among natural gas companies next spring when gas prices 
would otherwise fall after a peak season experts said 
the impact would obviously be positive but i dont think the 
impact would be as much as some people might think said charles 
m strain director of energy research for lovett mitchell webb amp 
garrison in houston 
based on our conversations with major oil companies and even 
smaller producers they are not reacting to shortterm swings in 
price anymore strain said they are not going to change their 
expenditure plans dramatically when prices go down to 13 for a 
month or two or go up to 20 for a month or two 
perryman also expects some hesitation among producers who have 
watched opec ignore past production quotas however he predicted an 
agreement could draw immediate reaction in the halls of the texas 
capitol 
probably the most interesting shortterm effect is the impact 
on state revenues it could literally change the entire character of 
the next legislative session if they go in with oil at 18 a barrel 
instead of 13 perryman said 
if they go in with oil at 18 the way things are structured 
right now on the revenue base the legislators would probably be 
looking at a small surplus and that would enable them to focus on 
other issues he said

the dollar crept slightly higher against several 
key currencies in quiet dealings friday but the british pound took 
center stage in volatile trading linked to the latest report on 
britains trade deficit 
the metals markets were closed for the thanksgiving day holiday 
in the united states but gold prices strengthened overseas 
james chorek a technical analyst with mms international in 
chicago said the dollar received an early boost from persistent 
intervention by the bank of japan 
the dollar also was helped later in the trading session by 
speculation that the federal reserve might push up shortterm 
interest rates by raising the discount rate or the interest charged 
on loans to member banks 
higher interest rates tend to support a currency and that was 
the case with the pound friday it ended higher in domestic and 
european trading after news of a record british 45 billion trade 
gap triggered a full point rise in interest rates 
the trade report had sent the pound plunging to around 18220 in 
europe but dealers said it rebounded after the bank of england 
pushed up base interest rates to 13 percent from 12 percent 
in london the pound rose to 18435 from thursdays late 
18375 later in new york sterling fetched 184235 up from 
18365 
in tokyo where markets close before europes business day 
begins the dollar ended at 12115 japanese yen unchanged from 
thursday it also was quoted at 12115 yen in london

it reached a 40year low

bond prices tumbled and interest rates surged in 
light postholiday trading friday amid concerns that the dollar may 
continue to fall while inflationary pressures intensify 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond dropped point or 
about 625 for every 1000 in face amount 
its yield which moves in the opposite direction from its price 
and is often seen as an indicator of broader interest rate trends 
climbed to 917 percent from 910 percent late wednesday 
the bond market was closed thursday for the observance of 
thanksgiving and analysts said dealings also were light on friday 
as many traders took a fourday weekend 
the cash markets for treasury securities closed in the early 
afternoon several hours earlier than normal on the recommendation 
of the public securities association 
but analysts said speculation that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries would ratify a tentative oil production accord 
over the weekend had already knocked bond prices sharply lower 
the 13nation cartel hopes that production restraint will lift 
oil prices 
oil prices had been a positive disinflation force so the bond 
market saw the tentative opec agreement as disappointing said 
david hale economist for kemper financial services in chicago 
if oil prices rose the increase would add to inflationary 
pressures at a time when the economy is already operating at a 
relatively high rate inflation erodes the value of fixedincome 
securities such as treasury notes and bonds 
hale said another reason bond prices fell was speculation that 
the dollar may be headed lower possibly discouraging foreign 
investors from maintaining their holdings of dollardenominated 
securities 
the dollar has been falling steadily since the election of george 
bush because of doubts that the republican president and a 
democratcontrolled congress will be able to take effective steps to 
reduce the us trade and budget deficits 
william v sullivan jr director of moneymarket research at 
dean witter reynolds inc said the price decline also reflected 
bond dealers efforts to find retail buyers for the big supply of 
new two and fiveyear treasury notes that the dealers bought at 
auction earlier this week 
weve got too many negatives on the table here sullivan said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues fell point intermediate maturities lost about 
point and longterm issues dropped point according to telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer fell 424 to 113028 
in the corporate bond market prices lost ground moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures price 
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer was down 104 to 29269 
in the taxexempt market prices dropped by about point 
according to the bond buyers municipal bond index 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 829 percent as the 
discount rose 4 basis points to 802 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 857 percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to 
812 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 876 percent as the 
discount rose 7 basis points to 812 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

wheat futures prices posted their strongest gains in nearly two 
months friday on the chicago board of trade amid signs that the 
united states and the soviet union were nearing agreement on a new 
multiyear grain deal 
on other markets soybeans and other grains also advanced cotton 
futures surged cattle futures were higher pork futures were mixed 
and stockindex futures retreated 
the major us markets for oil metal coffee cocoa and sugar 
futures were closed friday for thanksgiving 
heavy speculation surfaced wednesday that us and soviet 
negotiators were about to sign a grain pact and those expectations 
were enhanced on friday by a french press agency report that a final 
round of talks would begin monday in moscow 
deputy us trade representative alan holmer confirmed after the 
grain markets closed that the talks would resume next week in the 
soviet union 
the pact being discussed was rumored to be a 2year extension of 
the 5year agreement that expired sept 30 guaranteeing annual 
soviet purchases of 9 million metric tons of us grain 4 million 
of wheat 4 million of corn and 1 million of the buyers choice 
wheat futures prices leaped 3 cents to 7 cents higher on the 
news the sharpest oneday rally since oct 3 with the contract 
for delivery in december settling at 425 a bushel 
were confident the longterm agreement will be signed early 
next week by monday or wednesday or so said victor lespinasse a 
grain trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
if not it could be a problem he said and even if it is 
signed it could be a case of that old saying buy the rumor sell 
the fact 
soybean futures hit new highs for the week in response to brisk 
trade in soybeans and soybean meal on european markets on thursday 
and friday an indication that export demand for us soybeans may 
rise 
recurring talk of dry conditions in the south american soybean 
belt where planting is well underway also supported the soybean 
market but analyst cathy leow of thomson mckinnon securities inc 
in new york said such concerns were premature 
there are some areas of dryness but at this point in the crop 
year you cant get too excited about it she said 
soybeans settled 4 cents to 12 cents higher with january at 
765 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with december 
at 265 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with 
december at 215 a bushel 
cotton futures surged on the new york cotton exchange on 
indications of increased demand analysts said 
the soontoexpire contract for december delivery opened 24 
cents higher an extremely sharp gain in reaction to a pending 
17200bale decline in the exchanges certificated warehouse stocks 
the owners have declared their intention to decertificate the cotton 
because they have found buyers for it 
i have hardly ever seen a big figure like that pending 
decertification said ernest simon cotton specialist with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york that brings the 
certificated stock down to 33500 bales thats a small stock 
in addition simon said us cotton is beginning to find more 
overseas buyers despite its high price on the world market a usda 
report issued after the close of trading said cotton exports for the 
week ending nov 17 were about 45 percent above both the prior week 
and the fourweek average 
simon said the reliability of us cotton suppliers apparently 
was the reason for recent sales to south korea indonesia and the 
philippines 
cotton settled 67 cent to 190 cents higher with december at 
5570 cents a pound 
cattle futures gained modestly on the chicago mercantile exchange 
on strong spot markets and expectations for higher spot markets next 
week pork futures finished mixed amid expectations of lower spot 
hog prices on monday analysts said trading activity was light 
live cattle settled 15 cent to 48 cent higher with december at 
7375 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 28 cent higher 
with january at 8267 cents a pound hogs were 15 cent lower to 23 
cent higher with december at 3985 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 35 cent lower to 17 cent higher with february at 
4245 cents a pound

the broadest measure of the nations money supply 
rose in the week ended nov 14 but two narrower measurements fell 
the federal reserve board reported friday 
the fed said its allencompassing measure of money known as m3 
rose to a seasonally adjusted 3881 trillion up from 3878 
trillion the previous week a narrower measure known as m2 averaged 
a seasonally adjusted 3044 trillion down from 3045 trillion the 
prior week 
the narrowest measure known as m1 fell by 24 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted average of 7793 billion vs a revised figure 
of 7817 billion the prior week 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the dollars value commodity prices and the difference 
between short and longterm interest rates rather than focusing 
heavily on money supply figures it also has suggested that of the 
three figures m2 and m3 are more significant 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual 
growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent which is 
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 percent 
the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since early 1987

the government on friday pushed up interest rates a 
full percentage point to 13 percent their highest level in more 
than 3 12 years after announcing that britains merchandise trade 
deficit for october more than doubled to a record level 
financial markets were shocked by the news of the first rate hike 
since a fullpoint increase on aug 25 and of the unexpectedly large 
trade shortfall of 293 billion pounds or about 54 billion 
share prices plunged on the london stock exchange with the 
financial times 100share index falling as much as 505 points 
before recovering somewhat the index finished 383 points or 21 
percent lower at 17947 
the pound also plummeted on the trade news but the interest rate 
increase pushed it back up it was quoted at 18435 in late 
trading up from 18375 late thursday 
the developments raised new questions about the effectiveness of 
prime minister margaret thatchers policy of fighting inflation 
her no 1 economic priority by discouraging consumption with 
higher interest rates 
but chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the interest 
rate hike was a clear indication that this government is not 
prepared to take any risks with inflation 
the government has pushed up interest rates by a total of 55 
percentage points since june but the annual inflation rate still 
has risen to 64 percent from 33 percent in january partly because 
the rate hikes have meant higher mortgage rates 
the poor trade figures for october confirmed that consumption 
hasnt slowed car imports were up 10 percent for example but the 
department of trade and industry partly blamed the figures on 
erratic items as well as distortions caused by a mail strike in 
september 
lawson speaking to a group of businessmen in birmingham said he 
would prefer to average septembers good figures and octobers 
freak result 
having said that it is perfectly clear that we have got 
imports still rising strongly he added although the earlier 
rises in interest rates have been undoubtedly having an effect 
which you can see in the housing market for example interest rates 
do take time to have their full effect 
chris anthony an economist at the london brokerage firm of 
phillips and drew ltd said the october trade report was a clear 
indication that the governments policies havent begun to work on 
the trade front there is still no clear sign of a downturn in 
consumption 
david smith economist at the brokers william de broe hill 
chaplin and co said consumption hasnt appeared to be that 
interestrate sensitive 
some economists said interest rates had to go still higher 
but opposition legislator bryan gould who serves as the labor 
partys spokesman on trade issues said lawsons strategy was 
causing great damage to british industry 
a halfhour after the department of trade and industry reported 
at 1130 am local time that exports fell 10 percent as imports 
surged 12 percent in october the bank of england by raising its 
moneymarket lending rate signalled commercial banks to increase 
their 12 percent base lending rate to 13 percent that is the key 
rates highest level since april 1985 
britains four leading commercial banks barclays bank plc 
national westminster bank plc lloyds banks plc and midland bank plc 
quickly raised their lending rates to 13 percent 
commercial borrowers can get loans at 1 percentage point above 
the base lending rate

a court hearing that had been set for monday 
in the delaware lawsuit against pillsbury co has been called off 
because the food and restaurant company has postponed the record 
date of its planned spinoff of burger king 
hostile suitor grand metropolitan plc is suing pillsbury to block 
the spinoff and invalidate pillsburys poison pill defense 
designed to make a takeover prohibitively expensive 
the british liquor gambling and specialty products conglomerate 
says the two defense tactics are preventing pillsbury shareholders 
from cashing in on grand mets 523 billion tender offer 
equivalent to 60 a share 
a hearing had been scheduled for monday in delaware chancery 
court on the burger king spinoff but a clerk for chancellor william 
allen said friday it was called off 
joseph rosenthal a lawyer for dissident pillsbury shareholders 
said the need for a hearing on monday was eliminated when pillsbury 
postponed the record date of the planned spinoff from dec 2 to dec 
19 
rosenthal said friday the spinoff issue probably will be 
addressed at a court hearing dec 12 before chancellor allen 
early this week pillsbury delayed its plans to spin off burger 
king into a separate company after burger king franchisees voiced 
opposition to the spinoff saying it would add too much debt to the 
slumping fastfood chain that accounts for a large portion of 
pillsburys profits 
under the plan pillsbury shareholders would be issued stock in 
the newly separated burger king which would borrow money and issue 
a special dividend to shareholders 
grand met has said a separate burger king would present a huge 
tax liability to grand met if its takeover bid is successful

hilton hotels corp chairman and 
president barron hilton on friday tentatively settled a dispute with 
the conrad n hilton foundation over acquiring stock held in his 
fathers estate 
the agreement would give barron hilton and the charitable 
foundation control of about 34 percent of outstanding shares of 
hilton hotels common stock with the chairman having sole voting 
power over about 25 percent 
the settlement is subject to execution of a definitive agreement 
in los angeles superior court which has jurisdiction over conrad 
hiltons estate and approval by the internal revenue service which 
will take several months 
the accord provides that of the 135 million shares held in the 
estate 4 million shares be distributed to barron hilton 35 
million shares to the foundation and 6 million shares to barron 
hilton as a trustee of a charitable remainder trust 
that trust would last the lifetime of the 62yearold barron 
hilton or 20 years whichever is longer sixty percent of income 
would go to hilton and 40 percent to the foundation when the trust 
expires remaining assets go to the foundation 
the pact resolves a dispute over 678 million shares given to the 
foundation when conrad hilton died in 1979 at age 91 his will gave 
his son an option to buy all the stock that couldnt be properly 
held by the foundation 
an announcement of the deal friday provided no other details of 
the tentative agreement representatives of parties to the agreement 
could not immediately be reached by phone 
in march the states 2nd district court of appeal reversed a los 
angeles county probate judges decision and concluded that the 
stockpurchase option granted by the father to the son covered all 
678 million shares 
a 1969 irs rule prohibits private foundations from owning more 
than 20 percent of any public company barron hilton claimed that 
since the rule was violated he could exercise his option to buy all 
the stock at 24 a share or 163 million its value at the time of 
his fathers death 
the foundation reclassified itself as a publicsupport 
organization to avoid the rule in april 1987 a probate judge ruled 
that action was proper and the foundation didnt need to divest 
itself of the stock 
barron hilton appealed resulting in the court of appeal ruling 
last march

news of rising oil prices hurt the stock and bond markets but 
trading was light and most americans paid no attention anyway 
preoccupied instead with that annual postthanksgiving pilgrimage 
christmas shopping 
oil traders bid up the price by more than 1 a barrel friday to 
the 1440 level on international markets because of the expectation 
that the organization of petroleum exporting countries would ratify 
a tentative production accord to limit output and help reduce a 
chronic supply glut 
while opec ministers meeting in vienna austria appeared 
determined to enforce production discipline industry analysts 
expressed skepticism given the cartels history of failing to honor 
its own pacts because of member cheating 
some analysts said they didnt believe the price rise would have 
much of an impact on prices of gasoline or other petroleum products 
because it would be shortlived 
still the magnitude of the oil increase rattled the bond market 
a key barometer of the economy inflation and interest rates prices 
of 30year treasury bonds dropped sharply and their yields which go 
in the opposite direction climbed to 917 percent from 910 percent 
late wednesday 
the impact spilled onto wall street where stocks slumped partly 
because rising yields in the bond market tend to siphon investor 
money out of stocks but trading volume was the lightest in nearly 
two years since many investment professionals had taken the day off 
for a fourday thanksgiving weekend 
the dow jones industrial average fell 1760 points to 207468 
the markets evidently saw little significance in a national 
association of realtors report that showed sales of existing homes 
fell in october for the second straight month even though mortgage 
rates declined the report suggested the economy is slowing down 
none of this news appeared to dampen consumer enthusiasm for 
christmas shopping an annual rite on the day after thanksgiving 
a random spot check of stores nationwide by the associated press 
suggested a surprisingly strong beginning to the traditional 
christmas selling season a crucial time for retailers the mood 
contrasted with the cautious buying that has pervaded during the 
previous few years

an agreement to curtail opecs rampant oil 
production could produce a temporary rise in petroleum prices but 
any change is likely to be shortlived analysts say 
ministers from the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries were expected to meet again saturday in vienna austria 
to ratify a proposed sixmonth oil reduction accord 
but analysts remained skeptical over just how long the deal would 
last or how much impact it would have on prices 
in reality well see whatever potential gains are going to 
come from this accord on monday said william byers an analyst 
with bear stearns amp co the market will level off after monday 
on the international petroleum exchange in london friday prices 
for january delivery of brent the benchmark north sea crude oil 
climbed 165 a barrel to 1442 
us petroleum exchanges closed early wednesday for a fourday 
thanksgiving holiday but analysts said us markets would match the 
european gains if the opec ministers signed a final accord over the 
weekend 
futures prices on the new york mercantile exchange closed 
slightly higher on wednesday in anticipation that opec would reach 
some sort of agreement the contract for january delivery of west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude closed 11 
cents higher at 1397 a barrel after sharp swings during the 
trading session 
prices had convulsed upward since monday when opec convened its 
winter meeting in vienna analysts said the highly erratic trading 
sessions reflected the dramatic twists and turns emanating from the 
conference of ministers 
late thursday the ministers announced a tentative pact to reduce 
output from the more than 22 million barrels a day estimated now to 
185 million barrels the meeting was recessed until saturday night 
to allow irans oil minister to return home to consult with his 
government 
one of the key provisions of the pact would grant iraq production 
parity with iran something iran had fought bitterly however the 
proposal also reportedly would allow iran to increase its production 
and maintain its 14 percent share of opec production 
analysts said they expect an agreement to bolster prices in the 
short term but said they doubted the accord would last long enough 
to boost prices to opecs target of 18 a barrel 
cyrus h tahmassebi chief economist for ashland oil inc said 
he expected a shortterm strengthening of prices if a deal is signed 
but once the market fundamentals hit prices will go down he 
said 
steve h hanke chief economist of friedberg commodity management 
inc in toronto and a professor of economics at johns hopkins 
university said a combination of excess capacity a desperate need 
by opec countries for oil export revenue and prices that still far 
exceed production costs would drive prices down in both the short 
and long term

retailers wallowing through the second year of a damaging slump 
will have at least one brief shining moment to recall in 1988 
christmas shoppers crowded stores around the country friday in a 
postthanksgiving rush worthy of its traditional billing as the 
busiest day of the year for merchants 
malls and downtowns were crowded early with people racing to snap 
up electronic gear nintendo video games cashmere sweaters 
customized luggage barbie dolls and kitchen appliances 
part of the spurt was credited to postelection relief among 
consumers but the main motivation came from the retailers 
themselves who tightened inventories and cooked up promotions in an 
effort to reverse their sagging fortunes 
the strategy led to warnings of shortages and to giveaways no 
selfrespecting shopper could resist 
this is serious i set my alarm for the first time in my life 
to go shopping said lynn loull who arrived at emporiumcapwell 
in san francisco at 840 am its going well ive gotten four 
people done in an hourandahalf 
the 7 am shoppers at a k mart in suburban new orleans included 
charlene jones and her sons nathaniel 7 and leonard 5 
i woke up the boys and said lets go she said 
store managers around the country found customers lined up to 
greet them when they opened the doors 
theres stroller gridlock in places said susan inskeep 56 
who had brought her grandson to the galleria glendale in suburban 
los angeles 
in boise idaho where last months opening of boise towne square 
ended residents 20yearlong wait for a modern shopping mall 
crowds swelled to 60000 double the average daily traffic 
in lexington ky crowds were probably the best ive seen in 
my 30 years with mcalpins said scott overley of the regional 
department store chain its just a blowout on everything 
while most retailers and industry analysts had predicted a modest 
5 percent improvement in sales over last year activity began 
picking up after the elections earlier this month 
whether it was an expression of confidence in presidentelect 
bush or just plain relief at having put politics to rest spending 
increased noticeably even before thanksgiving 
people have loosened up more said paul lantz floor manager 
at toys r us in raleigh nc they are feeling a little more 
relaxed at this time 
they were anxious about the availability of popular gifts 
however 
melanie bergeron of bourg la traveled 90 minutes to a toys r 
us looking for a toy grocerystore checkout scanner she said she 
hadnt known such a toy existed until her daughter asked for it and 
it wasnt in the stores in houma the city nearest her home 
retailers said they were well stocked for the surge but they 
also agreed close inventory control might stave off the disastrous 
markdowns they were forced to make last christmas 
our inventories are better finetuned than last year which 
should result in less of a panicsale environment said gerald 
gura president and chief executive officer of cherry webb amp 
touraine a chain of retail fashion stores based in south attleboro 
mass 
stores also plied customers with inventive promotional gimmicks 
like earlybird sales giveaways and visits from fairytale and 
cartoon characters 
in florida maison blanche stores advertised a crackerjack of a 
sale and gave away 4500 boxes of crackerjacks some with diamond 
rings or gift certificates inside 
in green bay wis more than a thousand people lined up before 
sunrise for a 7 am coupon giveaway at the hc prange store 
elsewhere disney characters decorated the corridors of the 
cinderella city shopping mall in englewood colo a mall in jersey 
city nj beamed in the cartoon space family the jetsons and 
santa claus showed up almost everywhere 
the lure of santa may have inflated the size of the crowds 
according to some skeptics at macys in manhattan one of the 
nations largest shrines of the season the toy department and santa 
land were packed while traffic in the rest of the store appeared 
light 
today were just looking around and taking the kid to see santa 
claus said louise hickey who was browsing through the colonie 
center shopping mall in albany ny with her husband and grandson 
well do the heavy shopping later 
layton widner manager of walmart in decatur ala said buying 
was heading in a practical direction 
people are buying the basics he said there are no hot 
items in toys like the cabbage patch doll of previous years
