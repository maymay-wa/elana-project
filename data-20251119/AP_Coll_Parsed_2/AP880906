bond was revoked tuesday for a couple 
facing sentencing for income tax evasion after an irs agent 
testified they stashed 1 million in valuables in hiding places 
such as trucks and a chicken coop 
randall and trula walker of springfield are accused of 
plundering campbell 66 once a nationwide trucking firm run by 
trula walkers father 
walker the companys former secretarytreasurer pleaded guilty 
aug 2 to concealing income by submitting false income tax returns 
from 198185 he also pleaded guilty to filing false income reports 
to the interstate commerce commission for campbell 66 
mrs walker was found guilty in august of tax evasion and 
conspiring to defraud the federal government 
the walkers were jailed friday after authorities discovered 
caches of jewelry furniture and cash at several sites in 
springfield 
by the irs recovering part of this treasure trove the risk 
that the walkers might flee is enhanced not lessened us 
district judge dean whipple said in ordering them held without 
bond it is obvious that they intended to keep these assets 
hidden until they paid whatever fines might be assessed and then 
still have a mother lode to start over with 
whipple said he hoped to sentence the couple this week 
irs agent james pierce testified tuesday that two confidential 
sources led agents to the stashed assets some of which had been 
buried in a chicken coop and a machine shed agents also found 
semitruck loads of furniture including a 5foottall chandelier 
and several pieces of antique furniture 
pierce said as many as four truckloads may have been filled with 
the walkers assets in the past two years 
other assets uncovered included about 315000 in cash nearly 
600 precious stones and 30 pounds of gold flatware 
pierce testified that agents were still trying to determine the 
whereabouts of furs and almost priceless jeweled faberge easter 
eggs 
once about 150000 of the buried money became wet and one of 
the confidential sources dried it in a clothes dryer pierce said 
the confidential source said that at one point with both 
walkers present he put jewelry in a pipe pierce said the 
jewelry was found in a machine shop near the sources home buried 
under a floor 
pierce also said agents found jewelry and cash encased in cement 
in a tool shed and about 150000 to 160000 in a chicken coop 
another 180000 was found buried in two glass jars 
he said a preliminary assessment showed that the items found 
were valued at a little over 1 million the walkers owe the irs at 
least that much he said 
ken kabonic a probation officer in springfield testified that 
the walkers submitted 1988 financial statements to him in august 
saying they had 6250 cash on hand and total personal property of 
about 5000

teachers carried picket signs in more than 20 public school 
districts in four states tuesday many held out for raises and the 
biggest pay demand 42 percent over three years drew the ire of a 
mayor as irresponsible 
the teachers decided its time to take a stand and that stand 
actually is a walk and thats what well be doing tomorrow morning 
walking a picket line said thomas grady head of the united 
teachers of lowell mass after a unanimous strike vote there 
tuesday the first day of school was canceled wednesday for the 
citys 13100 pupils 
nationally walkouts affected more than 100000 pupils in 
michigan pennsylvania massachusetts and illinois a strike in its 
third week in louisiana was settled tuesday night 
more than 1400 professors and academic staff members at wayne 
state university in detroit also went on strike tuesday over union 
work rules and salary university president david adamany predicted 
classes for the roughly 30000 students would continue with other 
fulltime and parttime instructors but professors said they 
expected few classes to be held 
an additional 950 clerical workers and secretaries represented 
by the united auto workers have been on strike at wayne state since 
aug 25 
in pontiac mich bargainers representing 991 teachers met with 
school officials through the weekend with no success major issues 
were class size and salary with teachers asking for a 10 percent 
raise and being offered 2 percent michigan education association 
spokeswoman colleen hudgens said 
superintendent labarbara gragg said monday night that talks 
would be scheduled later in the week meanwhile classes that 
opened sept 1 were canceled tuesday for pontiacs 17284 students 
as teachers picketed deputy superintendent byron love said 
in state college pa 415 teachers staged the first strike in 
the districts history said union spokesman george apaliski about 
5900 students missed the scheduled opening day of school tuesday 
we are not at all close district spokeswoman patricia best 
said its very discouraging the school board offered a 33 
percent raise over three years ms best said the state college 
area education association has not made public its pay demand 
in massachusetts teachers in nearly 40 school districts are 
going to work this week without a contract the only strike votes 
taken however were in lowell and peabody teacher strikes are 
illegal in massachusetts

wednesday in lowell mass after the districts 970 teachers voted 
unanimously to strike for more pay and to preserve longevity 
bonuses 
in peabody the citys 408 teachers rejected a 17 percent wage 
increase over three years and held out for 42 percent over the same 
time span 
to sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally 
irresponsible said peabody mayor peter torigian 
school superintendent james buckley said administrators were 
trying to bring in enough substitutes to keep classes going 
bert latessa of the massachusetts federation of teachers 
defended the unions position the 42 percent wage request latessa 
said is smaller than it appears because the teachers maintain that 
they have been performing extra duties such as elementary 
preparation and handling oversized classes without extra pay

the death of an 11yearold girl caught in a cross 
fire between rival drugdealing street gangs has galvanized a 
boston community like nothing else in years one city official 
says 
tiffany moore who had been sent away by her mother to live with 
relatives in the south because of the violence in her roxbury 
neighborhood was home for a visit when she was shot twice in the 
head aug 19 while sitting on a corner mailbox talking with friends 
more than 400 people attended the funeral in the weeks since 
the shooting neighborhood leaders have met with the mayor and 
police commissioner to demand a war on crime some even suggested 
that the national guard be called up 
at meetings in the adjacent roxbury and dorchester sections 
people have developed proposals that include circulating the names 
and pictures of known drug dealers some activists have gathered 
hundreds of signatures on petitions calling for evening court 
sessions to handle drugrelated cases 
bruce bolling roxburys representative in the boston city 
council said the shooting had galvanized this community like 
nothing else in years 
in 29 years of law enforcement said deputy police 
superintendent william r celester i have never seen the 
cooperation i have seen in the past three weeks people are 
telling me to take the gloves off and take back the streets 
bolling suggested why the death of the girl had touched people 
so deeply 
a little girl totally innocent people can relate to that 
because they think of their own families and suddenly they 
recognize how vulnerable they are and how pervasive this problem 
has become he said 
violence in roxbury had captured the communitys attention by 
the time of tiffanys killing in july two undercover state police 
troopers were wounded when they attempted to make a drug buy 
within hours of the two shootings a boston police office also was 
wounded and police wounded a suspect in an unrelated shooting 
a week after tiffanys death richard bailey 14 was fatally 
stabbed in front of his sister and other children police said the 
stabbing stemmed from an earlier fight and may have been connected 
to young gang activity 
the pressure on police was intense to make quick arrests in the 
two killings at one point boston police commissioner francis 
roache publicly rejected the calls by activists to call in the 
national guard roache said the citys 1900member police force 
could handle the situation 
thirty detectives were assigned fulltime to hunt for tiffanys 
killers within two weeks they had arrested two suspects four 
suspects were arrested in the 14yearold boys stabbing 
police also have assigned two police officers to walk the street 
in the roxbury neighborhood where tiffany was killed 
two years ago the violence in roxbury had so alarmed tiffanys 
mother that she sent tiffany and an older sister to live with 
relatives in greenville sc 
tiffany was in boston for a twoweek visit with her mother on 
aug 21 two days after the shooting she was supposed to return to 
south carolina 
alice moore her mother was upstairs in her apartment that hot 
night lying on her bed and talking with a friend when a little 
girl ran up and said tiffany get shot and i ran down 
i didnt take time to put on my shoes or lock my door or 
nothing but when i got there she was already dead i was rubbing 
her skin and it was tightening up i called her name and i called 
her name and she didnt say nothing 
mrs moore sitting in her living room under a tapestry of jesus 
and a portrait of marthur luther king jr said people cared about 
her daughters death not just because she was so innocent but 
because she was special 
tiffanys ambition she said was to become a doctor or teacher 
she played the organ and trombone she like to talk with her 
friends as they took turns braiding each others hair 
mrs moore said shes talked with all the politicians reporters 
and television crews who visit her apartment because it makes me 
feel like people care 
holding a diary tiffany kept and looking at family snapshots 
mrs moore said i was trying for them to be somebody not just 
hanging on the street

burglars recently broke into the home 
of an elderly couple ransacked the house and stabbed the wife a 
few weeks later a city councilman was found dead after exposing 
members of a car theft ring 
on the surface such incidents appear regrettably routine in a 
city with one of the worlds highest crime rates but in both cases 
officials admit the crimes were carried out by police 
hardly a day passes without newspapers reporting crimes of 
violence in manila and elsewhere that were carried out by the very 
people charged with protecting society 
during the first seven months of 1988 67 policemen were fired 
for involvement in crimes nationwide most were assigned in the 
manila area of the 67 policemen 18 were charged with murder 
according to official figures 
cicero campos chairman of the national police commission said 
his agency receives an average of 1500 complaints each year of 
criminal activity among the countrys 52000 policemen 
but he admits the figure represents the tip of the iceberg 
because the majority of crimes committed by police and soldiers are 
never reported 
much of the crime involves petty shakedowns for example 
traffic policemen extorting motorists for unauthorized onthespot 
fines are a common sight on manilas busy thoroughfares 
last month maj gen ramon montano commander of the philippine 
constabulary told a congressional committee that investigators 
recently cracked a massive cartheft ring made up mostly of 
soldiers and police 
montano said the arrests of the corrupt officers contributed to 
a significant reduction in the number of car thefts in the country 
poorly paid policemen often moonlight as bouncers for bars and 
prostitution fronts others join crime syndicates involved in 
gambling narcotics and prostitution either by guaranteeing them 
virtual immunity from arrest or in some cases serving as 
bodyguards for mob leaders 
policemen are widely assumed to have been involved in the 
unsolved slaying of leftist leaders 
five policemen have been charged with the attempted murder in 
june of leftist nemesio prudente president of the polytechnic 
university of the philippines the officers who were on duty when 
they allegedly attacked prudente are scheduled for arraignment 
this month 
crimes committed by police rose to unprecedented levels during 
the 20year rule of president ferdinand marcos who was ousted on 
feb 25 1986 after a civilianmilitary uprising that propelled 
corazon aquino to the presidency 
many soldiers and police joined the uprising against marcos 
once in office mrs aquino pledged to restore honest government 
and end abuses by police and soldiers but the police departments 
image as well as the governments own prestige is now threatened 
by a resurgence of corruption 
julie yap daza a prominent newspaper and broadcast commentator 
wrote in the manila standard that corruption has reached 
unacceptable levels 
police corruption is not unique to us all right she wrote 
but this is corruption with a different face the face of 
perversion it is a dark time for the good cops if there are 
any left 
campos a retired constabulary brigadier general blames the 
problem on low salaries a patrolman receives a monthly starting 
salary of 50 well below the governments poverty line of 120 a 
month for a family of five 
we do not have a coterie of angels or saints in the police 
force he said in an interview but certainly these people are 
all humans and they are up for temptation perhaps what we can do 
is insulate them from temptation 
he said the commission has recommended that congress increase 
police salaries as a step toward curbing corruption

nevada voters were expected to set the stage today for 
democratic gov dick bryans drive to oust republican sen chic 
hecht while six florida democrats and two republicans fought over 
the seat of retiring sen lawton chiles 
hecht and bryan faced only token opposition in todays 
primaries and for months they have been attacking each other 
hecht who is seeking his second term has criticized the governor 
as too prolabor bryan in the middle of his second term has 
charged hecht with lacking credibility and being ineffective 
a poll taken in august for the gaming industry showed bryan with 
a 14point lead over hecht who six years ago narrowly defeated 
democratic sen howard cannon after the incumbent was implicated in 
a teamsters union scandal hecht has stopped releasing his own poll 
results but said he is closing the gap and considers the race a 
tossup 
hecht whose voting record is extremely conservative has become 
known for his occasional verbal miscues once referring to a 
nuclear suppository when he meant repository a recent 
survey of senate administrative assistants ranked him as the least 
effective senator in washington 
hechts only primary opponent is larry scheffler 38yearold 
owner of a graphics business in henderson who said he would press 
for reprocessing nuclear waste brought to nevada so that only 
lowlevel less radioactive waste would remain 
bryans opponents in the democratic primary are manford cave 
rock manny beals patrick fitzpatrick and larry kepler 
in florida a twoman republican primary matched rep connie 
mack iii grandson of the legendary philadelphia as baseball 
manager against former us attorney robert merkle who 
successfully prosecuted colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder 
rivas 
merkle entered the race late in june and mack was heavily 
favored in preelection polls after outspending his rival by about 
22 million to 100000 
president reagan and former marine lt col oliver north made 
appearances for mack who has one of the most conservative records 
in congress 
merkle was frustrated by macks refusal to debate and 
emphasized that point by carrying around a lifesize replica of 
mack he called cardboard connie 
if he debates me he knows the jigs up said merkle hed 
be forced to discuss issues people would see the lights are on 
but nobodys home 
mack said merkle wasnt a viable candidate and that there 
was no reason to have been drawn into his campaign my feeling 
was that we should continue with delivery of the message we started 
with in october talking about the importance of freedom free 
markets less taxes freedom as an objective of foreign policy 
for the democrats state insurance commissioner bill gunter 
appeared to hold a wide lead but not wide enough to win a majority 
and avoid an oct 4 runoff with the secondplace finisher 
others in the race were reps dan mica and kenneth buddy 
mckay state sen patricia frank former republican gov claude 
kirk and former senate postal clerk fred rader 
gunter who lost to paula hawkins in the 1980 senate race 
raised 1 million within six weeks of announcing and opponents 
noted he took at least 160000 from the insurance industry he 
regulates mackay campaign manager greg farmer called gunters 
department a saga of sleaze 
the early democratic frontrunner former gov reubin askew quit 
the race in may saying running for office had become too expensive 
democrats acknowledge that their crowded field and likely runoff 
may hurt their prospects in november 
i dont think itll be an easy race but i think its 
winnable said state democratic chairman charles whitehead

or never going back to the house again nelson said in his 
book 
he chose to leave and the couple divorced 
nelson whose hits include mama dont let your babies grow up

time has run out on a congressional bid to 
grant tennis star ivan lendl immediate citizenship so he could play 
on the us olympic team lawmakers said 
lendl has lived in greenwich conn since 1981 and wanted to 
represent his adopted homeland in seoul this month 
enlisting the help of connecticut lawmakers lendl won house 
judiciary committee approval in april of a special immigration bill 
rep f james sensenbrenner jr rwis blocked the measure on 
the house floor saying he would drop his opposition only if the 
czech government provided a waiver for lendl to be a member of the 
us team 
olympic rules required a waiver because lendl had represented 
czechoslovakia in international competition at the davis cup 
the czechoslovak association of physical culture rejected the 
waiver 
we pressed the issue rep bruce a morrison dconn said 
last week maybe we could have succeeded with more time but 
time has basically run out 
lendl 28 received his permanent residence status last year he 
will be eligible for citizenship through traditional procedures in 
1992 his attorney and spokeswoman did not return telephone calls

the prince and princess of wales canceled an 
appearance at the premiere of a film about a daring british train 
robber because its star singer phil collins advised them not to 
go 
collins who plays train robber ronald buster edwards in the 
film buster said monday he wrote prince charles and princess 
diana that they should shun the sept 15 premiere 
buster does not in any way glorify crime as critics have 
claimed collins said 
but he said in light of the controversy he wrote the royal 
couple suggesting that it would probably be best if they did not 
attend 
a buckingham palace spokesman said the prince and princess were 
aware of the contents of the letter that phil collins has written 
them and in the light of this they have decided not to go 
the great train robbery of aug 8 1963 was one of britains 
most daring heists more than 120 mailbags containing 7 million in 
used banknotes were taken off a mail train from glasgow to london 
of which less than 980000 were recovered 
thirteen people including edwards stood trial in 1964 for the 
crime no one was killed during the robbery but one man was 
seriously injured

miss arkansas a blueeyed blonde 
singer has the best chances of winning the 1989 miss america 
title says a retired statistics professor 
patti thorn 23 has a 71 chance over the 50 other contestants 
vying for the crown saturday said george l miller of bellevue 
wash 
for the past 10 years to the displeasure of pageant officials 
miller has entered facts and figures about the contestants into 
his home computer and calculated their odds based on past winners 
and finalists 
millers statistics gained credibility in 1980 when he correctly 
predicted cheryl prewitt would take the title 
but he has not been successful every year most recently miller 
picked kellye cash as miss america 1987 but did not even have last 
years winner kaye lani rae rafko in his top 10 
she was a dancer who was a nurse and those are both zero 
categories on my list he said monday 
to make his predictions miller who retired from northern 
illinois university in 1984 uses such factors as height weight 
hair and eye color academic major and talent his computer 
analysis further breaks down talent 
if one is doing an acrobatic dance that would be better than 
an interpretive dance he said

soviets athletes who win gold medals at the seoul 
olympics will be awarded the equivalent of 19000 for their 
efforts the head of the soviet olympic committee says 
marat gramov announced the new policy at a news conference 
monday and denied such payments conflict with the purely amateur 
status soviet athletes purportedly possess 
he said those on the 550member soviet team in seoul who win 
gold medals will be paid 12000 rubles 19047 silver medalists 
will receive 5000 rubles and bronze medalists will collect 3000 
rubles 
those are handsome sums in a country where the average monthly 
wage for a factory worker is around 200 rubles 
according to mikhail dmitrieyev deputy foreign editor of the 
daily newspaper sovietsky sport the sums earmarked for seoul 
medalists will be the largest ever paid to soviet victors in a 
summer games 
if they received 100 in the past it was considered a large 
sum dmitrieyev said in a telephone interview referring to 
payments made to soviet participants in the 1976 montreal and 1980 
moscow games 
the soviet union did not take part in the 1984 olympics held in 
los angeles according to dmitrieyev soviet winners at the 1988 
calgary winter olympics also received large sums to reward them for 
good performance 
gramov noted that 15 percent of the prize money paid to soviet 
medalists will be in foreign currency 
that is important because the soviet ruble which is not 
convertible into foreign currency is useless abroad and cannot buy 
the sort of western consumer goods that many soviets covet

the last temptation of christ has proven to 
be a blessing for conservative christians 
denounced by its critics as blasphemous and profane the movie 
about a jesus with human frailties not only has energized the 
christian right it has revived stagnant fundraising christian 
leaders say 
the movie has helped our ministry more than anything else 
before said the rev donald wildmon leader of the american 
family association said don beehler director of communications 
for campus crusade for christ this gives us a wonderful 
opportunity to talk about the real jesus christ were taking 
lemons and making lemonade 
at the same time filmgoers are not avoiding the movie as 
christian leaders had hoped in fact the controversy seems to have 
prompted more people to see it 
that price though might be a small one for christian 
activists beset by negative publicity from the jim bakker and 
jimmy swaggart scandals conservative christians have used last 
temptation as a lightning rod around which to organize and raise 
money 
in addition to bringing together fundamentalists pentecostals 
prostestants and catholics the controversy makes for a natural 
fundraiser it pits the conservative christian organizations 
which often depict themselves as small and struggling against a 
hollywood goliath 
the concerned women for america in a fundraising letter said 
your gift of 100 75 50 20 or whatever amount is sorely 
needed we need your financial help to fight these rich hollywood 
moguls similarly the american family association has said that 
those giving 15 or more to help afa oppose the movie will 
receive a one year subscription to the afa journal 
jerry falwell has been preaching about the movie for the last 
three weeks said the rev robert hymers a los angeles minister 
who has been one of the movies most outspoken critics falwells 
doing a tremendous fundrasing job through the film 
the american society for the defense of tradition family and 
property used a fourpage fullcolor attack on the movie to 
solicit small contributions people have put their money where 
their values are said raymond drake president of the 
organization drake said that a phone campaign brought in 39000 
enough for a fullpage advertisement in the new york times against 
the movie 
it also may be true that some christianthemed organizations are 
trying to exploit the controversy for lessthannoble purposes 
ive seen the fundraising letters the movie has become 
another hype button to raise funds said cal thomas a syndicated 
columnist and former comunications director for the moral majority 
universal pictures meanwhile appears to have benefited from 
the controversy by telling people not to see the movie christian 
leaders may have encouraged the opposite response universal is 
raking in the dough thomas said 
studio officials refused comment 
although last temptation is by no means a blockbuster it 
has done respectable business for an art film grossing more than 
2 million since its limited release aug 12 it wouldnt have 
done anywhere near whats its done without the controversy said 
alex ben block editor of the industry newsletter sow biz news 
although some christians might have stayed away many other 
filmgoers went because of the controversy people say if they 
tell me i cant go ill go 
at the same time production plans for at least one movie with a 
christian theme are not being stalled by the flap christ the 
man to be directed by paul verhoeven is in the planning stages 
at mel brooks production company described by company spokeswoman 
randy auerbach as a serious interpretation of jesus life the 
movie will be absolutely unaffected by criticisms of last 
temptation 
it is too early to tell if the attacks on universal pictures 
will lead to any longterm losses though christian leaders are 
hopeful what were sensing is a lot of people in the tens of 
millions who are now angry at universal said tim penland who 
served as a consultant to film producer universal pictures before 
becoming a leading critic of the movie 
wildmon and other activists will soon launch a boycott against 
universals videocassette of et the extraterrestrial due 
out oct 27 
after that there are no announced plans aimed at universal 
but said beehler universal will always be remembered as the 
studio that made a film defaming jesus christ

fire trucks from as far away as nevada 
took position in two smokefilled montana towns monday and 
residents here waited to see if a backfire would burn fast enough 
to protect them from a winddriven forest fire 
first it starts snowing ash then it starts raining fire 
said fire information officer pat kaunert as he stood in a 
65footwide fire break bulldozed through the forest 
top federal officials said that blaze and 12 other fires in and 
around yellowstone national park had burned 900000 acres as of 
monday 
gary cargill chief federal forester for the rocky mountains 
warned that an additional 300000 acres may be consumed this week 
despite the efforts of 9000 firefighters 
and cargill warned that 20 to 30 mph southwesterly wind is 
expected to arrive in the region tuesday with a weather front 
protection of life and property are the top priorities he said 
at a news conference in bozeman containment of further acreage 
is just not in the cards 
he said many of the nations best firefighters are being 
whipped day after day by the yellowstone fires 
evacuation orders for cooke city and a town three miles west 
silver gate were issued sunday morning by monday night about 30 
of the approximately 150 residents in the two towns remained said 
bob fry an emergency services official 
some of them are staying around because they want to see what 
the fire does fry said theyre mostly packed up though and 
were trying to push them out 
a backfire had been set by firefighters as a shield against the 
approaching storm creek fire sunday just a halfmile from silver 
gate 
firefighters wanted to establish a twomile buffer of charred 
forest between silver gate and the 61300acre storm creek fire 
but by monday the backfire had burned only a halfmile swath said 
fire information officer chris comstock 
with an 18 to 20 mph wind behind the fire that line wouldnt 
stop it youd just stand there in the line and watch it go over 
your head he said 
and if the backfire hadnt gone far enough the wind would blow 
embers from the backfire itself into residential areas endangering 
the town it was meant to protect 
to prepare for that possibility fire trucks rolled into 
positions around the two towns about 75 trucks were called in from 
as far as nevada to protect buildings comstock said 
were here till they tell us to get out of dodge said ty 
ripley manning a fire truck from the eastern montana town of 
glendive 400 miles away 
comstock said firefighters also were worried that the storm 
creek fire and three other major fires in and around yellowstone 
have created their own wind circulation almost like a whirlpool 
of wind around the yellowstone basin 
that circular wind pattern may encourage the fires to reach out 
toward each other which could create a huge ring of flame that 
would eat its way inward through unburned forests comstock said 
also inside yellowstone firefighters worried that the expected 
wind would blow the 141900acre north fork fire back toward the 
complex of visitor facilities around old faithful geyser 
but steve iobst a fire information officer said a lack of 
vegetation in the old faithful area would make it easy to protect 
the development 
on the western side of the park which is largely in wyoming 
fire officials were confident they could protect west yellowstone 
mont a community of 750 people from an advancing lobe of the 
north fork fire just 2 miles away monday 
everything is based on what these winds do to us in a couple 
of days said brian avery a senior forest service fire oficial 
referring to the anticipated southwesterly wind 
about 30 miles to the west in the targhee national forest about 
55 firefighters battled a new 25acre blaze believed caused by 
humans the fire burned to within 50 yards of half dozen summer 
homes near macks inn idaho but the winds pushed the flames in the 
opposite direction fire commander wayne bushnell said 
in the northern rockies officials warned that an approaching 
weather front could drive existing blazes past fire lines and cause 
fires already brought under control to flare up again 
the weather predictions prompted forest service officials to 
begin work on an evacuation plan for permanent and summer 
residences south of fortine in northwestern montana the dry fork 
fire there has scorched 12300 acres 
right now weve got our fingers crossed that this wind isnt 
going to be that harsh said fire information officer dick guth 
that fire is considered about 60 percent contained 
elsewhere calmer wind and slightly lower temperatures monday 
helped firefighters grapple with blazes that charred nearly 21000 
acres of southern california brush 
oregons largest fire of the season was nearly contained at just 
under 57000 acres in the rugged hells canyon national recreation 
area 
washington gov booth gardner activated the national guard to 
help provide support and transportation for hundreds of 
firefighters 
containment of washingtons largest fire the 12500acre white 
mountain complex in ferry county was at least five days away 
officials said monday but it had stopped moving toward the town of 
republic 
in utah air tankers and fire crews scrambled monday to stop a 
runaway brush fire moving toward the northern utah community of 
paradise authorities said 
right now theyve got a problem said kathy jo pollock 
interagency fire center spokeswoman theyve got a 250acre fire 
heading for the town it just broke out a little while ago 
the fire was the latest in a series of fires raging on utahs 
tinderdry landscape monday air tankers that had been used for a 
5400acre brush fire near salt lake city were diverted to the fire 
near paradise a community of about 500 residents between ogden and 
logan in the wasatch national forest 
forests also burned in idaho

american schools have only one computer for 
every 30 students and even those pupils with access to computers 
get to use them an average of just one hour a week a report to 
congress said today 
the report by the congressional office of technology assessment 
said todays classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50 
years ago more closely than operating rooms or business offices 
resemble their 1938 versions 
the agency estimated that schools have spent 2 billion on 
computer hardware over the past decade there are now 12 million 
to 17 million computers in public schools and fewer than 5 
percent have no computers 
but the agency said it would cost 4 billion to buy enough 
equipment to reduce the studentcomputer ratio from 301 to 31 
the 246page report based on two years research said that 
between 1981 and 1987 the percentage of schools equipped with 
computers for instructional use grew from 18 percent to 95 percent 
but the vast majority of schools still do not have enough of 
them to make the computer a central element of instruction it 
said 
computers are not the only new machines in american classrooms 
the 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use of 
advanced technology of all types the report said 
in 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders today 
roughly 90 percent do it said adding that the availability of 
cable and satellite transmission has made the television a more 
potent teaching tool especially for schools in remote areas 
in practice there is wide disparity one computer in a 
classroom clusters of computers in the library or classrooms full 
computer laboratories and classrooms with no computers it said 
not all students use computers and those who do spend on 
average a little more than one hour per week on the computer 
the report said that although new interactive technologies 
cannot alone solve the problems of american education they have 
already contributed to important improvements in learning these 
tools can plan an even greater role both by helping children 
acquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticated 
skills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over their 
lifetimes 
to tap the potential of technology the report said a greater 
investment will be necessary including a more active federal 
role in spurring research and helping spread the new teaching tools 
the report warned that the vast majority of those now teaching 
or planning to teach have had little or no computer education or 
training most of what they have been taught is to how to use 
computers themselves not how to teach with computers 
despite a nationwide call to improve teaching there is almost 
no federal money for the training of new teachers it said 
it said there are more than 10000 educational software products 
on the market but the quality could be much better 
the office of technology assessment is a nonpartisan analytical 
agency for congress 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif chairman of the house 
committee on education and labor which commissioned the study 
said increasing federal support for hightech school aids would 
be good public policy and a wise investment for the future 
the report cited several examples of schools putting computers 
and other gear to good use including 
poteet high school in mesquite texas where interactive 
videodiscs are used throughout the physical science curriculum 
allowing ninth graders to bring a volcanic eruption or solar flare 
to life at the touch of a computer keyboard 
sacred heart model school in louisville ky where fifth 
graders recently assembled a computer database of their pets 
including 25 dogs 4 hermit crabs and 1 guinea pig and are 
currently testing the acidity of the citys tap water for a 
comparison with data from 199 other schools around the world

the droughttoasted 1988 hay crop is expected 
to be the smallest in 12 years and prices are likely to be the 
highest since the agriculture department began keeping annual 
figures in 1909 
preliminary figures show that hay prices at the farm in august 
averaged 8310 per ton although that was unchanged from july it 
was an increase of 35 percent from 6160 per ton in august 1987 
no dramatic declines in hay prices are in sight say department 
economists the supply is tight and demand is strong meaning that 
prices probably will remain high until spring 
according to usda records the record for hay prices over an 
entire season was 7580 per ton set in 1983 another drought year 
that was an increase of less than 10 percent from the 1982 average 
of 6930 per ton 
historically however there have been larger yeartoyear 
percentage jumps in hay prices in 1934 for example hay rose 52 
percent to 1170 per ton from 770 in 1933 but a year later in 
1935 prices plummeted just as fast to 760 per ton 
the latest usda production estimate on aug 11 put this years 
hay harvest at 1305 million tons on 662 million acres down 125 
percent from 1987 production of 1491 million tons on 607 million 
acres 
it also is the smallest since the 1976 crop of 1201 million 
tons says the departments economic research service in a new 
outlook report on the feed situation 
acreage harvested as reported in the august crop production 
report is almost 28 million acres more than the area indicated for 
harvest in the july report the agency said this increase 
likely reflects in part the emergency haying rules for 
conservation land under usdas drought assistance measures 
at the beginning of the hay marketing year on may 1 the us 
inventory was estimated at 273 million tons counting this years 
production that makes a total hay supply of 1578 million tons for 
198889 down 13 percent from last season 
meanwhile the number of cattle and other roughage consuming 
animal units will be about the same as last year meaning there 
will be less to go around 
if each animal eats as much hay as it did last year the us 
hay stockpile will be chewed down to only 38 million tons by may 
1 1989 a record low thus the report said it seems more 
reasonable that producers will reduce hay portions to ration 
available supplies 
hay use will depend on a number of additional factors the 
report said silage yields will be sharply reduced by the 
drought however the area of silage harvested likely will be 
increased because of abandonment of areas intended for harvest as 
grain 
the report added more straw likely will be baled this year to 
stretch out forage supplies fall pasture growth or lack thereof 
and spring pasture conditions also will be important to hay use 
good fall rains and pasture and good early spring pasture would do 
a lot to ease the pressure on hay supplies 
on the other hand converse conditions would intensify supply 
pressures and push up hay prices even further it said

from the same month in 1987 
so far this year production was about 1697 million pounds up 
from 1604 million pounds through july 1987 
in a related report usda said catfish farmers in 18 states had 
sales worth 247 million last year it was the first such survey 
since 1981 when sales were 72 million officials said 
of the 1987 sales total hatchery operations accounted for 201 
million while sales from production were reported at 2268 
million

the justice department says it now costs an 
average of 223 to provide legal representation for a poor criminal 
defendant and the number requiring such services has risen sharply 
since 1982 
the bureau of justice statistics said monday the 223 cost the 
average in 1986 is up from 196 per case in 1982 the caseload 
rose to nearly 45 million up about 40 percent from the 32 
million cases four years earlier the bureau said in a report 
the 50 states and washington dc spent a combined 991 
million for indigent defendants in 1986 compared to 625 million 
in 1982 an increase of 60 percent the programs are financed by 
state county and local governments in each state 
the rights of poor criminal defendants to legal representation 
were spelled out in a number of supreme court rulings beginning in 
1932 
one case was the landmark gideon vs wainright in 1963 when the 
court extended the right to counsel in state courts to all indigent 
defendants charged with a felony 
some states have expanded the program to include representation 
for proceedings involving parole probation parental rights civil 
commitment and postconviction matters 
the department said arkansas spent the least for indigent 
defendants an average of 69 cents per state resident the 
district of columbia spent the most 29 per capita 
the average per capita expenditure nationwide was 411 in 1986 
up from 276 in 1982 
when average costs per indigent case were computed arkansas 
again was last spending 63 per case in 1986 new jersey was 
first spending an average of 540 
there are three basic programs used to provide the legal 
services 
assigned counsel programs feature casebycase appointments of 
lawyers in contract programs the government contracts with 
individual lawyers law firms or local bar associations to provide 
services for a given period and in public defender programs a 
salaried staff is hired to provide legal services 
the report was an update to a 1982 study on indigent defendants 
since the initial study the report said there was a movement from 
county to state financing an increase in rates of compensation 
paid to private lawyers and expanded use of contracts for 
providing representation to the poor

a victory that could give 800000 to a fired 
government whistleblower sets precedents that he and his lawyers 
fear will make it riskier for other federal employees to expose 
waste and hazards 
bertrand g berube fired in 1983 after he accused the general 
services administration of becoming the nations slumlord said 
he will take early retirement in a settlement with the agency he 
had been gsas top regional director overseeing all major 
government buildings in the washington dc area 
despite the settlement ordered by the merit systems protection 
board berube said laws are needed to prevent the government from 
punishing other employees who disclose overspending and dangerous 
conditions and that the federal system to protect such 
whistleblowers actually worked against him 
berube who says he is the highest ranking civil servant ever 
fired for whistleblowing said federal employees should not think 
they can duplicate what he did unless they have several hundred 
thousand dollars to spend on attorneys he was defended by a public 
interest group that can afford to back only a fraction of those who 
go against government employers he said 
if a government employee has that kind of money theyre 
usually not working for the government said berube those who 
think they can get help from the special government counsel set up 
to protect whistleblowers may find theyre going to the 
executioner when they think theyre going to the doctor he said 
the special counsel for the merit board refused to take his case 
and ended up testifying in congress against him saying there were 
other grounds for firing him besides his criticism of waste fire 
danger and health hazards in federal buildings berube said 
the gsa had claimed that berube who earned 64000 a year 
overseeing 7000 employees engaged in irresponsible 
sensationalism in describing gsas problems 
herb koster a spokesman for gerald carmen former gsa 
administrator who fired berube said carmen would not comment on 
the settlement signed aug 18 carmen now heads the federal asset 
disposition association 
gsa spokesman paul costello said gsa officials also had no 
comment on the agreement 
thomas devine legal director for the government accountability 
project which represents berube and other government and private 
industry whistleblowers said rulings by the merit board during 
its consideration of berubes case further inhibit whistleblowing 
under the berube standards agencies have everything to gain 
and nothing to lose by opening up a witch hunt on a 
whistleblower he said 
devine said that under the precedent government agencies are 
allowed to look afterthefact for reasons to justify a dismissal 
the berube settlement agreement with gsa precludes further 
appeal by either side and says the settlement does not assume any 
unlawful personnel practice discrimination reprisal or any 
other unlawful or illegal acts by the agency or its officials 
devine said neither the merit board nor the courts have done 
anything to discourage government reprisals against whistleblowing 
employees 
the merit boards office of special counsel which was set up to 
represent whistleblowers actually has been a troan horse for 
civil servants who commit the truth he said 
berube said in a telephone interview over the weekend that 
problems with government buildings have gotten worse rather than 
better since he was fired with many buildings in serious 
disrepair while money is wasted in a may 1983 memo he had said 25 
percent of gsa buildings were unsafe and for all practical 
purposes were becoming the nations slumlord 
berube said he agreed not to go back to the agency so he could 
continue his successful woodworking business in washington and 
continue to fight for whistleblower legislation 
gsa spokesman costello said friday that a check for 530000 
would shortly be made out to berube and his lawyers 
berube 55 said that after legal fees he will get about 
350000 along with up to 430000 in additional retirement pay 
based on his normal life expectancy lawyers said gsa also will 
have to pay 24000 into berubes retirement account and reimburse 
the 6000 paid him in unemployment compensation 
berube said he would retire with a 32500 annual pension based 
on 26 years of government service including the five years since 
he was fired berube said that without the settlement he would have 
received annual retirement pay of 18000 when he turns 65 
a whistleblower protection bill has passed the senate house 
leaders are discussing whether to consider similar legislation 
passed by a house committee or a reagan administration bill opposed 
by whistleblowers

sarah brady whose husband was shot along with 
president reagan says reagan recently reaffirmed to her that he 
supports a mandatory waiting period for the purchase of handguns 
the wife of presidential press secretary james brady said she 
reminded reagan in a telephone conversation that john w hinckley 
jr shot him and brady in march 1981 with a gun purchased in a 
state texas without a waiting period 
mrs brady said reagan endorsed the concept of a federal waiting 
period but not the specific language in a comprehensive antidrug 
bill that the house will consider this week and likely pass 
he recognized the need for federal legislation mrs brady 
said after she told him that states are not doing the job in 
stopping drug dealers from obtaining handguns 
debate on the overall drug bill begins wednesday and a final 
vote could take place friday the senate will then follow with its 
own drug bill and the two versions would eventually be merged into 
final legislation 
the house bill as introduced would carry a 15 billion to 2 
billion annual price tag money that would be added to the 39 
billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight drug 
use 
the legislation includes something for everyone involved in 
fighting illegal drugs more money for education treatment and 
rehabilitation more resources for state and local law enforcement 
efforts to seize drugs on land in the air and on the seas 
strict controls would be placed for the first time on the 
chemicals used as raw materials in the manufacture of heroin and 
cocaine 
there will be controversies over republicaninspired amendments 
for a federal death penalty against those who kill during a drug 
crime a good faith exception that would allow use of illegally 
seized drug evidence in court and denial of many federal benefits 
for convicted drug users 
the gun language would require a sevenday wait in the purchase 
of a handgun from a licensed dealer 
the dealer must send law enforcement authorities a sworn 
statement that includes a description of the gun the serial 
number the name address and birth date of the buyer 
police may but are not required to conduct a background check 
purchasers who would be denied the pistol would be those already 
ineligible under existing federal law convicted felons fugitives 
from justice illegal aliens drug addicts those adjudicated 
mentally ill or committed to a mental institution those 
dishonorably discharged from the military and people under 
indictment for a felony 
rep bill mccollum rfla said he will offer an amendment to 
substitute a requirement that the justice department establish a 
computerized system to identify felons trying to purchase handguns 
access would be provided to local police and firearms dealers 
i dont think you should have a waiting period when it 
abridges the right to buy a gun for a lawabiding citizen 
mccollum said 
reagan first weighed in on the subject of waiting periods on 
june 21 the former california governor spoke favorably of 
californias 15day waiting period with a mandatory background 
check and added now i would like to see that generally i 
think that all states ought to take a look at that system 
mrs brady who became a guncontrol activist after her 
husbands shooting said she wrote reagan thanking him for the 
remarks and he called her a week later she brought up the federal 
waiting period during the conversation 
he wished it could be handled by the states she said but 
added that reagan was willing to have a federal law because of 
the overwhelming problem of drug dealers and other criminals 
obtaining guns 
i told him we were trying to get that attached to the drug 
bill mrs brady said i told him there is overwhelming 
evidence through the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms that 
guns used in crimes are traced back to states where there is no 
waiting period i indicated hinckleys gun came from a state 
texas where there is no waiting period 
other key provisions of the drug bill would 
require states to automatically pass through antidrug 
money to local governments 
revise banking laws to allow the government to closely watch 
institutions where drug money might be laundered 
require recipients of federal grants or contracts to maintain a 
drugfree workplace 
provide money for drug education treatment and rehabilitation 
for aids victims and groups with a high risk of getting the disease 
authorize 10 million for a latin american regional antidrug 
force if one is approved by the organization of american states

congress has left itself about a month to 
solve major environmental problems that have eluded solution in the 
1980s redoubling the battle against urban air pollution and 
launching an attack on acid rain 
lawmakers return to town wednesday shooting for an early 
october adjournment as the house and senate enter the home 
stretch clean air legislation is barely out of the starting gate 
neither chamber has even scheduled debate on the clean air act 
revisions that are being watched closely by some 100 cities and 
metropolitan areas that failed to meet last decembers deadline for 
bringing ozone and carbon monoxide levels within national health 
standards 
a comprehensive package to control urban smog acid rain and 
airborne toxic chemicals was ready for senate debate last november 
but it has been stalled by a variety of opponents most notably 
majority leader robert byrd dwva 
the packages principal sponsor sen george mitchell dmaine 
has been trying to negotiate floor time with byrd mitchell has 
said that if necessary he will offer his air bill as an amendment 
to mustpass legislation 
in the house serious closeddoor negotiations among leaders of 
the energy and commerce committee didnt begin until this summer 
leaving little time to get a complicated proposal ready for the 
floor 
any package produced by congress would most likely give cities 
more time to clean up their air but also require tougher actions to 
combat pollution from local driving restrictions to stricter 
emissions standards for vehicles 
debate a good bit of it in scientific terms centers on how 
much more time will be granted and just what corrective steps will 
be required a complicating factor is that the nation has already 
employed the measures that can bring large and quick reductions in 
pollution 
acid rain control is simpler scientifically but far more 
complicated economically and geographically 
acid rain a byproduct of coalburning factories and power 
plants is a major concern of the east which is downwind from the 
industrial midwest just who pays to clean up midwestern emissions 
is a major question with many western lawmakers cool to a national 
subsidy for midwestern cleanup costs 
byrd not only has power plants in his state that would have to 
reduce their emissions his state has huge deposits of high sulfur 
coal that could lose its market to cleaner burning coal from other 
states under an acid rain control bill 
congress has a fallback option if it fails to produce clean air 
legislation it can as it did last december pass another stopgap 
bill that would prevent the environmental protection agency from 
taking action against areas not meeting the standards 
the environment surfaced as an issue last week in the 
presidential race between republican george bush and democrat 
michael dukakis bush claimed to be highly committed to a cleaner 
environment although the record of the reaganbush administration 
has been given dismal marks by environmental groups 
the clean air fight is at the top of the 
environmentconservation agenda for the 100th congress but other 
issues are vying for attention in the closing weeks of the 
electionyear session 
one that might not take much time is the early 1987 request by 
the reagan administration and the oil industry to allow petroleum 
exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge on alaskas 
north coast 
the senate energy and house merchant marine and fisheries 
committees have endorsed drilling bills but the house interior 
committee where the environmental lobby has more clout is sitting 
on the house bill 
likely to emerge from capitol hill after a fouryear struggle is 
a renewal of the endangered species act authorizing a 50 percent 
increase in program spending in the early 1990s 
congress is also ready to pass a 98 billion fiscal 1989 
spending bill for the interior department and other land and 
resource agencies it is drawing veto threats because it would 
delay spending for cleancoal technology research and bar oil 
leasing off portions of the coasts of california massachusetts and 
florida 
house and senate negotiators are putting the finishing touches 
on legislation that would encourage the use of lesspolluting 
methanol ethanol and natural gas as alternatives to imported 
petroleum for powering vehicles 
awaiting senate action are housepassed bills that would 
reorganize the national park service to make its director 
independent of political appointees in the interior department cut 
back on commercial timbering in the tongass national forest in 
alaska and prevent a shopping center from being built adjacent to 
the manassas national battlefield park in northern virginia

after a week of refining his message and 
selling it to friendly audiences republican vice presidential 
nominee dan quayle is home preparing for the fall campaign 
following a patriotic season opener at the statue of liberty 
quayle is spending time with his family today and holds staff 
meetings wednesday before taking a quick swing to illinois and ohio 
at weeks end 
the indiana senator delivered a labor day tribute monday to the 
pledge of allegiance which the republicans have attempted to turn 
into a political weapon against democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis 
quayle blasted dukakis for vetoing a massachusetts bill that 
would have penalized teachers who did not lead their students in 
the pledge 
the values embodied in the pledge deserve to be transmitted to 
our children quayle said 
to us they are not hokey or cornball or passe he said 
quayle also toured ellis island where millions of immigrants 
entered the country and which is now undergoing restoration the 
quayles are of scottish descent and their relatives did not come 
through ellis island but the couple and their three children posed 
for photographs anyway with a group of people dressed in costumes 
of their native countries 
quayles speech at the base of lady liberty with the manhattan 
skyline in the background and ellis island nearby was planned as a 
moving kickoff to the countdown to election day 
but it was disrupted briefly by about 30 demonstrators members 
of a coalition that believes the reagan administration and quayle 
have not done enough in the fight against aids 
quayles aides said later that the senator had an exemplary 
record on aids issues and had recently voted to provide 12 
billion in funding for aids research education and prevention 
the demonstrators however said quayle voted against 
legislation to give the experimental drug azt to aids victims 
quayles speech outlined what will be his themes this fall the 
economy is doing well inflation and interest rates are under 
control and earnings and job growth are up 
quayles task will be to sell the voters on the idea that they 
will enjoy a bright future if they stick with the republicans 
according to campaign strategists that was the message quayle had 
for the liberty island crowd 
we will win this election because we are the party of the 
future we believe in our families we believe in the future and we 
believe in preserving freedom in this country we will never let it 
go he said 
it was the same message quayle worked on last week during his 
southern campaign swing speaking before largely sympathetic 
audiences on conservative college campuses and elsewhere in the 
deep south 
but quayle is also beginning to get some less receptive crowds 
as he ventures outside conservative territory 
on monday he got a mixed reception when he dropped into detroit 
to address polishamericans after a parade the audience booed and 
heckled him as he spoke although he did get a cheer when he 
declared we will never give up until theres freedom again in 
poland

the federal governments 2 billion bailout of 
american savings and loan association of stockton calif will be 
the most costly rescue ever of a single savings institution 
the federal home loan bank board announced the plan on monday 
with chairman m danny wall saying the agency will provide 500 
million in promissory notes and at least another 15 billion in 
cash assistance over the next 10 years 
the california sampl was the nations largest insolvent savings 
institution the largest previous rescue of a single savings and 
loan was the 13 billion infusion last november into vernon 
savings and loan association in texas 
the robert m bass group of fort worth texas will infuse 550 
million in private funds and assume control of the california 
institution which is owned by financial corp of america irvine 
calif the bank board will own 30 percent of the institution and 
will receive 75 percent of the tax benefits arising from the 
transaction 
wall said bass and negotiators for the bank board struck a deal 
late friday and the board approved the agreement shortly after 
midnight on saturday he said the board decided to delay announcing 
it so the news would appear in newspapers on a business day 
wall said he expected the deal to be signed within a few days 
to a couple weeks after the irs approves the distribution of tax 
benefits in the transaction and california officials approve a 
state charter for the reconstituted institution 
wall said regulators had agreed to provide cash assistance 
through the 10year agreement and that there was no upper limit on 
the assistance he said 2 billion is the bank boards best 
estimate of its ultimate cost of the rescue after it sells its 
stake in the sampl which wall said should occur within less than 
five years and reaps its share of the tax benefits 
we gave some and they gave some i dont think we have 
given away the store by any means he said 
financial corp of america with 302 billion in assets at the 
end of june is the nations secondlargest thrift holding company 
after los angelesbased hf ahmanson amp co it has been sampl 
regulators biggest problem for four years 
financial corp first came under regulatory scrutiny in 1984 
when it suffered a 68 billion run on deposits that sent shock 
waves through the industry 
another 490 million deposit run in the first two months of this 
year prompted regulators in march to promise to protect all of 
americans depositors even those with more than the 100000 
insurance limit 
the old management resigned in august 1984 and william popejoy 
the current fca chairman was installed but the company continued 
to lose money on its portfolio of soured loans which had 
accumulated during fcas rapid expansion in 1983 and 1984 most of 
it was secured by real estate in california and the 
economicallytroubled oil country of texas 
in the first six months of this year fca reported losses of 
2237 million still with enough federal assistance american 
fcas largest holding has been considered a valuable purchase 
because of its broad access through 186 branches and 23 loan 
centers to the lucrative california market 
the bank board which regulates the nations 3000 sampls had 
been negotiating exclusively since april 21 with the bass group 
the investment arm of a member of a wealthy texas family 
the exclusive arrangement has drawn criticism from members of 
congress and executives of the san franciscobased first nationwide 
bank a subsidiary of the ford motor co 
first nationwide had unsuccessfully sought for nearly a year to 
acquire american before talks with regulators broke off 
the fca rescue is the latest in a series of large transactions 
beginning in midaugust to clean up insolvent thrift associations 
since aug 18 the bank board has committed 122 billion in 
aid including the fca deal to rescue 47 savings institutions 21 
in texas 14 in oklahoma five in minnesota two others in 
california and one each in florida iowa idaho and tennessee 
so far this year the bank board has resolved the cases of 96 
insolvent institutions compared with 48 last year

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen is stepping up his attacks on the republicans while 
hammering home the democratic theme that the us economy can do 
better and distribute the benefits more fairly 
i think youll see a more aggressive campaign bentsen told 
reporters on monday he then went on to criticized vice president 
george bush as someone who gets his economic advice at 
disneyland 
bentsen was visiting a job training program today in 
lawrenceville ga where people are taught to make computer 
circuit boards he later planned to visit virginia polytechnic 
institute in blacksburg va before returning this evening to 
washington 
the visits appeared to be aimed directly at republican positions 
gop vice presidential nominee dan quayles sponsorship of a jobs 
training bill and george bushs statement that he wanted to be 
the education president 
beginning his fall campaign on labor day in his native texas 
bentsen attacked bush and quayle as operating on autopilot when 
the nation needs to compete more aggressively in world markets 
echoing democratic presidential nominee mike dukakis he said 
ideology is not the issue 
the republicans like to talk about left and right but this 
election is not about moving left or right he said it is 
about standing still with george bush or moving forward with mike 
dukakis 
bentsen speaking to a partisan democratic rally in beaumont 
ridiculed bushs statement that the republicans would create 30 
million new jobs noting there were only 6 million people out of 
work 
i understand george bush is out at disneyland today i think 
hes out there talking to his economist he said 
bentsen told reporters traveling with him that he expected to 
take texas and win the national election but he acknowledged the 
democrats were revising their tactics 
you cant keep taking the kind of attacks that we saw such 
as bushs repeated suggestions that dukakis was unpatriotic 
the texas senators events on labor day were boastfully 
patriotic his speech in beaumont was given standing before a huge 
american flag and when he met dukakis for a picnic in st louis 
later in the day the thousands of spectators had been handed 
little flags 
bentsens trip to atlanta was his first campaign appearance in 
georgia since he received the vice presidential nomination at the 
democratic national convention in july bentsen had planned to 
visit atlanta on his last campaign trip but was forced to cancel 
when his campaign plane was grounded 
bentsens spokesman mike mccurry acknowledged that the 
democrats were behind in the polls in both georgia and virginia but 
said with help from state democratic officials they think there is 
a chance to reverse that by election day

libyan leader moammar gadhafi says his 
country and the soviet union are moving in the same progressive 
direction and contends his ideas of socialist reform have 
influenced soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
in an interview monday with the associated press gadhafi also 
challenged anyone to prove us accusations that he sponsors 
terrorism and said his relations with washington may improve under 
george bush or michael dukakis 
asked about libyas relations with the soviet union its chief 
arms supplier gadhafi said we are very close to each other 
friends we respect the policy of each others side 
both of us are going in the same direction in the progression 
of socialism gadhafi said adding i believe gorbachev is 
affected by the green book 
the green book is a collection of the colonels philosophy on 
the revolution he has led in libya since coming to power 19 
years ago this month in a coup 
gadhafi fielded questions in his office at the bab elaziziya 
or heavenly gate military compound in tripoli soldiers were 
posted in watchtowers nearby and tanks were housed in camouflaged 
garages the entire area was ringed by walls topped with rows of 
barbedwire coils 
the 46yearold colonel dressed in a gold floorlength cape 
green suede shirt and white slacks sat at a polished cherry desk 
with glass and wood bookcases behind him 
he said he would like to visit the united states if things 
were different and charaterized americans who believe president 
reagans charge that he sponsors terrorism are very simple 
people ignorant people 
i challenge everyone in the world to give evidence that 
libya backs terrorism he said speaking english in the interview 
reagan accused gadhafi of sponsoring the december 1985 attacks 
that left 20 people dead at airports in rome and vienna 
us warplanes bombed libya in april 1986 in an attack that 
killed 37 people including gadhafis 15monthold adopted 
daughter the raid was intended to punish libya for its role in the 
april 5 bombing of a west german nightclub in which two american 
soldiers and a turkish woman were killed 
a july 11 terrorist attack that killed nine people on a greek 
cruise ship was linked to abu nidal who is believed to travel 
frequently to libya 
of course we are against imperialism racism and zionism 
said gadhafi we are not wrong we are right to defend our 
interests 
we are ready to improve our relations with america if the 
policy of america is changed i expect this relation to improve 
earlier monday gadhafi was asked whether he preferred 
republican nominee george bush or democratic candidate michael 
dukakis as president of the united states 
the one i would back would lose gadhafi said laughing 
last spring gadhafi told an american television news crew that 
bush would be a better president because he has suffered with 
reagan and he would sort of make up for it bush then said of the 
endorsement i could have done without it im going to ask him 
to reconsider 
in conversations with foreigners gadhafi has inquired about the 
background of both presidential candidates 
gadhafi said on monday he expects us foreign policy to change 
under the next administration but did say how

the government says it arrested a 
54yearold belgian air force colonel on suspicion of spying for an 
east european nation for profit and that the suspect had confessed 
defense minister guy coeme announced monday that the suspect 
col guy binet had access to documents of the belgian army and the 
north atlantic treaty organization and was believed to have started 
spying for a soviet bloc country two years ago he did not identify 
the country 
at first sight it does not seem that the documents that he 
might have passed on are of a nature to destabilize the nato 
strategy or apparently have extremely important implications for 
the national defense coeme told reporters 
he said binet was arrested saturday and had confessed but he 
did not say what binet had told investigators or where the suspect 
was being held 
coeme said it appeared that binet was driven by profit rather 
than ideological reasons 
he worked on his own and in direct contact with the foreign 
power the minister said and apparently received tens of 
thousands of dollars for the information he provided 
a search of binets house yielded material that certainly had 
to be used for espionage including a foreignmade suitcase with a 
secret compartment and special photographic material coeme said 
we have a list of documents that were sought by the foreign 
power he added we do not know whether these documents have 
been provided but the documents concerned the belgian army and nato 
strategy 
binet was two years away from retirement 
he was charged with treason and infractions against the 
external security of the state according to coeme if convicted 
binet could be sentenced to life in prison 
coeme said nato authorities had been informed of the arrest 
binet worked for the air force purchasing department and had 
access to files on the us f16 jet fighter and contracts for the 
acquisition of helicopters for the belgian army 
coeme said military authorities began investigating binet a year 
ago after the colonel aroused suspicion he did not elaborate 
binet was questioned friday and arrested saturday the minister 
said 
he said the case could lead to diplomatic problems between 
belgium and the unidentified east european nation

inner city hospitals collapsing in financial 
failure are likely to topple their ailing neighbors in a domino 
effect hastened by growing tides of poor and eroding government 
support medical authorities say 
rural hospitals are shutting down at an equal rate and are 
leaving large gaps in the availability of health care the 
authorities say 
last week a 437bed hospital in chicago and a 30bed 
institution in rural southwestern illinois announced they would 
close becoming casualties in an accelerating national trend 
its a fragile environment for hospitals says jan shulman 
a spokeswoman for the american hospital association which tallied 
a record 79 hospital closings nationwide last year 
in illinois for example five closed in 1987 twentyfive of 
the states 226 remaining hospitals fit the profile of endangered 
institutions most in chicago and one in east st louis said 
kenneth robbins president of the illinois hospital association 
typically the shaky hospitals are in poor innercity 
neighborhoods with 25 percent of their patients poor people 
covered under medicaid 30 percent to 40 percent elderly people 
covered under medicare and 5 percent to 10 percent indigent people 
with no way of paying robbins said 
the state pays hospitals only 73 cents for every dollar they 
spend treating medicaid patients and the federal government pays 
only 90 cents for every dollar spent treating medicare patients he 
said 
nearly 60 percent of all community hospitals lost money 
providing patientcare services in 1986 ms shulman said she 
noted that the number of uninsured people has risen from 33 million 
in 1983 to 37 million 
theres a certain domino effect that accompanies the closing 
of any hospital robbins said if a neighboring hospital has been 
treating many poor patients and it has to absorb even more the 
additional load could be the straw that breaks the back of that 
hospital 
edward duffy outgoing director of the illinois department of 
public aid says surplus beds as much as inadequate government 
support are to blame for much of the trouble he cited the 
soontobe closed st annes hospital as an example noting that it 
has been using only about onequarter of its 437 beds 
hospitals like st annes are the steel mills of the hospital 
industry duffy said after the hospital announced its closing 
last week people dont use hospitals like they used to i could 
have tripled my rates of medicaid reimbursement but that would 
not have kept that hospital open 
i totally disagree said robbins adding that st annes 
scaled back on beds as an appropriate response to falling demand 
in the final analysis it was inadequate payment that killed 
them not just this year or last year but over a period of 
years 
inner city hospitals are not alone in these difficulties 
texas whose 43 hospital closings since the beginning of 1987 
are the most for any state during the period sees most of the 
shutdowns among tiny rural hospitals said ann ward rogers a 
spokeswoman for the texas hospital association 
besides inadequate government reimbursement and falling 
occupancy rates rural hospitals have trouble attracting qualified 
doctors and nurses she said in a telephone interview last week 
from austin 
texas has 48 counties with no hospital mrs rogers said noting 
that residents of such counties must travel to seek health care 
if its a nonemergency situation that may be ok but if its 
a lifethreatening situation that might be too far she said 
robbins said solutions to the problem will come only through 
more adequate medicaid and medicare financing better incentives 
for physicians to treat poor patients in their offices relieving 
the burden of indigent patients on hospitals and better provision 
of nursing home care 
that will require more activism than in the past according to 
earl bird president of the metropolitan chicago healthcare 
council an organization of 96 hospitals 
individuals and agencies that represent the poor and elderly 
have got to tell their legislators that we cant afford any more 
underfinancing he said and the legislators have got to 
respond or there are going to be more closures

paramilitary police some carrying truncheons 
broke up a demonstration and arrested protesters marking the 70th 
anniversary of the launching of a bolshevik campaign to stifle 
political opposition 
at least 100 police officers occasionally aided by civilian 
auxiliary police also detained some pedestrians who shouted that 
the arrests were a disgrace 
mondays demonstration was on the 70th anniversary of the red 
terror the bolshevik campaign that decreed class enemies 
should be put in concentration camps and political opponents shot 
the demonstration in downtown pushkin square was called by the 
democratic union an unofficial political group 
reporters saw five people arrested and put into buses tass the 
official news agency said 17 members of the democratic union were 
detained and a court would decide punishment 
yuri mityunov a spokesman for the democratic union said none 
of the members had been in touch with him by late monday and 
interpreted that to mean they still were in jail 
during the demonstration police hauled away an elderly woman 
and arrested a man after he put a black ribbon over his mouth 
apparently to symbolize that authorities prevented freedom of 
speech 
it was not clear whether the man or the woman belonged to the 
democratic union 
more than 100 people gathered around the woman as she spoke of 
being jailed and sent to internal exile years ago 
when a police officer yelled disperse a column of about 50 
policemen forced the crowd aside and grabbed the woman 
the democratic union called the demonstration to remember the 
red terror which began with the sept 5 1918 decree against 
opponents 
that started government repression of political dissidents the 
democratic union said in a statement and serves to show that only 
a multiparty system and pluralistic economy can safeguard human 
rights 
on aug 21 the democratic union tried to demonstrate in pushkin 
square against the sovietled invasion of czechsolovakia 20 years 
earlier police broke up the rally arresting more than 100 people 
protesters said later they were beaten at the police station 
a dozen police officers carried rubber truncheons monday but did 
not appear to use them on demonstrators 
tass said the program the democratic union calls the red 
terror was necessary and all revolutionary regimes use such 
measures to protect themselves from external and internal 
enemies

hussein musavi resigned monday after 
seven years as irans prime minister but will remain as a 
caretaker premier until a successor is named the official islamic

the agency on tuesday quoted tehrans jomhuri eslami daily 
which printed the full text of musavis letter of resignation to 
president ali khamenei 
in that letter musavi 44 said he wanted to step down 
primarily because he believed as many as eight of his cabinet 
members will fail to win a vote of confidence in the majlis irans 
270seat parliament 
the letter apparently did not specify why he believed that but 
but musavi said his administration would not be able to function 
with eight vacant cabinet posts 
musavi did not identify the cabinet members who have been at 
their posts since he carried out minor shuffles following twostage 
parliamentary elections in april and may 
after that balloting musavi a radical who has sought major 
economic reforms in the face of bitter opposition from conservative 
clerics said he planned only minor changes in his cabinet 
jomhuri eslami did not say whether khamenei had accepted 
musavis resignation but irna said the president had apparently 
done so

with 94 labor days under his belt former 
teamsters chief dave beck sees stronger days ahead for organized 
labor 
labor is strictly a business beck said all i ever did in 
the labor union movement was sell labor for the best price i could 
get and thats the only thing labors got to sell is labor 
although statistics indicate the percentage of unionized workers 
in the labor force is declining beck isnt worried 
were doing just fine he said last week at his home in 
suburban lake forest park 
now you take all these mergers sure every time theres a 
merger it does cut 200 or 300 jobs but let it reverse and it 
will and well reverse it union representation too 
becks own success was due as much to his own business deals as 
his rise to the top of organized labor he quit school in his early 
teens to support his family by driving a laundry truck in seattle 
and became a multimillionaire from realestate investments 
some of his activities led to trouble he spent 2 years on 
internal revenue service charges at mcneil island when it was a 
federal penitentiary and paid 13 million in back taxes and 
penalties 
beck is largely unconcerned with that history but he does 
recall his days as reigning power in the teamsters union when 
presidents franklin delano roosevelt harry truman and dwight 
eisenhower asked him to join their cabinets as secretary of labor 
he turned all down 
eisenhower said you cant say no to the president of the 
united states recalled beck i said i not only can i am 
beck also oversaw the teamsters withdrawal from the american 
federation of labor when the afl merged with the congress of 
industrial organizations 
the greatest mistake former afl chief george meany ever made 
was throwing the teamsters out because the teamsters didnt need 
the afl but the afl sure needed the teamsters beck said 
beck also has observations about the current scene including 
the justice departments recent civil lawsuit seeking to vacate 
teamsters union leadership to rid it of alleged corruption it 
was definitely politics and bad politics that will never 
reach trial he predicted 
how ronald reagan could do that to us ill never understand 
he said i sat at the same table with him in our hollywood days 
when reagan was screen actors guild president 
there is no mob influence in todays unions beck said and if 
there is union racketeering going on not one ounce of it goes on 
west of chicago 
im not here to say somewhere along the line youre not gonna 
find some evidence of illegality but you can go right over to 
wall street and find people who stole hundreds of millions of 
dollars he said 
as for beck himself he said he hopes to see his 100th labor 
day and i plan to 
but he added i dont know that id bank on it

thousands of journalists across india 
went on strike today to protest a proposed new defamation law they 
say aims to curtail press freedom 
all but one of new delhis 17 dailies carried frontpage notices 
announcing they would not publish wednesday the two national news 
agencies the press trust of india and the united news of india 
stopped working at 3 am and said they would resume after the 
24hour strike 
the proposed defamation act expands the concept of defamation 
and negates the presumption of innocence of journalists or others 
making disclosures newspapers branded it draconian 
fascist and undemocratic 
the legislation would allow punishment of up to two years in 
prison for first offenders and up to five years for subsequent 
convictions it shifts the burden of proof from plaintiff to 
journalists and calls for speedy trials something not stipulated 
for murder treason or rape trials 
professional organizations and the political opposition called 
the bill censorship in disguise an attempt by prime minister rajiv 
gandhi to muzzle the press following reports that top government 
officials accepted millions of dollars in kickbacks from defense 
purchases 
the suspension of publication is an extreme step the 
antigovernment indian express said in an editorial but it said 
the strike is bound to be just one in a long struggle against a 
cabal which has lost its head 
even the normally progovernment hindustan times newspaper said 
it supported the strike it will be honorable for the government 
to admit its mistake and rectify it it said in an editorial 
gandhi said he was fully convinced of the need for the bill 
the lok sabha the lower house of parliament approved the 
defamation act on aug 30 
the rajya sabha the upper house was supposed to take up the 
bill monday but gandhi delayed consideration and appointed a 
committee of seven cabinet ministers to discuss the matter with 
journalists 
the bill must be passed by both houses and then signed by 
president ramaswamy venkataraman before becoming law 
gandhis move to delay consideration on the bill does not does 
not fully meet the purport of the objections to and the grave 
apprehensions about this draconian bill said the leftist patriot 
newspaper 
but the progovernment national herald the only new delhi 
newspaper which worked today said the government has shown it 
has an open mind and that it does not stand on prestige it is now 
for all of us to display a constructive approach so that the 
measure is discussed without any kind of acrimony

ruled by the worlds youngest monarch 
tiny swaziland marked 20 years of independence today as a nation 
rich in tradition and largely free of the turbulence that plagues 
its neighbors 
wedged between south africa and mozambique this kingdom of 
rolling hills and lush valleys has spent the past two decades 
pursuing both westernstyle modernization and preservation of 
ageold customs 
progress means a new cocacola bottling plant in the capital of 
mbabane video cassette recorders in the expanding shops and luxury 
tourist hotels 
tradition meanwhile calls for regular celebrations with 
singing and dancing by barebreasted maidens in tribute to 
20yearold spearwielding king mswati iii and his mother known as 
the great she elephant 
for these festive occasions including a ninehour independence 
celebration planned today at the countrys main stadium both men 
and women appear in traditional red orange and yellow skirts with 
long strands of beads and feathers in their hair 
the men carry animal skin shields the women wear beehive 
hairnets 
the babyfaced king who already has four wives was barely four 
months old when his nation received independence from britain on 
sept 6 1968 
two years ago he replaced his father the late king sobhuza ii 
who ruled for 62 years and had at least 68 sons 
economically landlocked swaziland remains an agricultural 
nation heavily dependent on south africa which borders it on three 
sides 
thousands of swazi men work in south africas mines and the vast 
majority of swazilands imports reach the country via its powerful 
neighbor 
a handful of foreign firms that disinvested from south africa 
such as cocacola have moved their plants to swaziland another 
approach has been for firms in south africa to falsely label their 
goods as made in swaziland to evade embargoes against south 
africa 
canada has received made in swaziland wine even though 
there are no vineyards in swaziland citrus produce amounting to 
four times swazilands annual output has turned up with swazi 
labels in the middle east 
swazilands eastern neighbor mozambique offers access to the 
indian ocean and alternatives to south africa transport routes but 
mozambiques main contribution at present is an unwelcome one 
more than 100000 refugees who have fled into swaziland from famine 
and civil war in their country 
swaziland half the size of belgium has two refugee centers 
designed to hold just a few thousand people 
aside from the refugees who swell the countrys population by 
about 15 percent swaziland is ethnically homogenous and has 
avoided the intertribal strife that has plagued many other african 
countries 
the relatively few indidents of political violence in recent 
years generally have involved antiapartheid activists and 
guerrillas from south africa who on occasion have been targets of 
crossborder raids and kidnappings by south african agents 
the king and the royal family have the final say on all major 
matters but most daytoday business is left in the hands of the 
cabinet parliament and the bureaucracy which conduct the 
political affairs with a distinctive swazi touch 
when the parliamentary electoral college was selected last 
november members were chosen by voters who passed through cattle 
gates next to the candidate of their choice 
when retired white farmer rex baxter and his wife arrived to 
vote policemen grabbed him placed him at a gate and told him he 
had been chosen as a candidate while being whisked away for 
weeklong private consultations with the other winners baxter 
shouted to his wife to bring his heart tablets and cigarettes from 
home

raeedzo northwest territories ap two native groups in the 
arctic will become the largest nongovernment landholders in north 
america under a historic agreement signed by prime minister brian 
mulroney 
the longdelayed agreement signed in this tiny community 200 
miles south of the arctic circle on the shores of great slave lake 
will give the denes and metis indian nations nearly 4000 square 
miles of land and special rights to an area the size of oklahoma 
mulroney said the signing marked a day of justice and 
heralds new economic and political development for the north 
but native leaders say many specifics must be negotiated before a 
final pact is signed in two years 
mondays agreement gives about 15000 natives of the dene and 
metis indian nations ownership and oil and mineral rights to about 
3850 square miles of the rocky bush land bordering the arctic 
ocean 
it would also give them special rights and interests including 
a voice in wildlife forestry and land management for a nearly 
70000 square miles area 
the agreement which followed 15 years of negotiations includes 
a 405 million cash settlement that would be paid out over 20 years 
beginning in 1990 the year negotiators hope to have a final 
settlement 
this agreement of principle when carried forward to its final 
form will establish a new stronger and healthier relationship 
between the people of this area and the governments which serve 
them said mulroney who was welcomed with the beat of drums and 
a ceremonial prayer chant 
he added that the agreement marks real progress in the dene 
quest for selfdetermination 
but the chief of the dene nation warned that ottawa and native 
leaders must still negotiate issues such as aboriginal title and 
selfgovernment 
we will be seeking changes before we reach the final 
agreement bill erasmus told about 1000 dogrib indians on the 
steps of the villages roman catholic church 
the dogribs are the largest of seven groups making up the dene 
nation 
ottawa said the dene handed over their aboriginal rights when 
they signed 1899 and 1921 treaties 
but the dene contend they never gave up their aboriginal rights 
and under mondays agreement are handing over some of their land 
in return for financial compensation and the guarantee of hunting 
and fishing rights 
mike paulette president of the northwest territories metis 
association said he was sure we can now negotiate a satisfactory 
deal within the next two years 
mulroneys visit to raeedzo 65 miles northwest of the 
territorial capital of yellowknife marked his first trip to the 
northwest territories since his conservatives gained power four 
years ago

to avoid possible controversy during 
the olympics south korea has temporarily halted foreign adoption 
of its babies 
the government has not officially confirmed the ban but 
adoption agencies acknowledged they were asked to stop sending 
babies overseas for adoption for two months before and during the 
olympics which run from sept 17 to oct 2 
south korea sends about 7000 children abroad annually for 
adoption in the united states and europe adoption officials say 
south korea is one of the easiest nations for overseas adoptions 
we are getting a lot of complaints from foreign adoptive 
parents but we have to follow the government order said one 
senior official at a seoul adoption agency speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
he said his agency alone would not be able to send 200 babies 
for adoption in the united states during the twomonth period 
baby adoption is an embarrassing issue for south korea with 
critics saying that now that the nation has achieved prosperity it 
should care for its orphans and other unwanted children 
overseas baby adoption began when south korea was poor its 
economy devastated by the korean war of 195053 and the government 
encouraged the practice to help alleviate the countrys social and 
economic problems 
some unofficial estimates indicate that about 14000 south 
korean babies are adopted at home and abroad each year they are 
given up for adoption by unwed mothers or abandoned by their 
parents 
government officials refused to give out any figures or grant 
interviews but many social workers agree that south korea probably 
was the largest supplier of babies for adoption in the united 
states in 1987 
social workers estimated that about half of the 12000 foreign 
babies adopted in the united states last year came from south korea 
domestic adoption continues to be a problem because most 
koreans value blood ties and do not want to take in unrelated 
children 
there are signs however that the problem could ease in several 
years because the number of babies given up for adoption or 
abandoned continues to decrease social workers say 
the changing trend is extending the waiting period for foreign 
adoptions of korean children from about 1 years to 2 years they 
said 
about 80 percent of the babies given up for adoption are born to 
unwed mothers and social workers said the governments active 
birth control and other programs are helping reduce the number of 
babies born out of wedlock 
in confucianoriented korean society babies born out of wedlock 
tend to be despised and considered castaways 
foreign adoptive parents now pay 4000 in adoption fees that 
include care costs transporation and adoption processing expenses

hussein musavi submitted his resignation 
after seven years as irans prime minister but president ali 
khamenei rejected it today irans official islamic republic news 
agency reported 
musavi had tendered his resignation monday saying in a letter 
to khamenei that he wanted to step down primarily because he 
believed as many as eight of his cabinets 21 members would fail to 
win a vote of confidence in the majlis irans 270seat parliament 
the agency said 
it was not immediately clear whether musavi would accept 
khameneis action 
musavi had indicated in the letter printed today in tehrans 
jomhuri eslami newspaper that he would remain as a caretaker 
premier until a successor was named irna reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted khameneis office as 
saying the president turned down the premiers resignation in a 
letter to musavi 
the majlis had been scheduled to vote on musavis cabinet today 
but called off the session after the announced resignation which 
took foreign observers by surprise musavi a 46yearold radical 
has sought major economic reforms in the face of bitter opposition 
from conservative clerics 
in his letter musavi apparently did not explain why he believed 
the cabinet members would not win the confidence vote but did say 
his administration would not be able to function with eight vacant 
cabinet posts 
he did not identify the cabinet members who have been at their 
posts since musavi carried out minor shuffles following twostage 
parliamentary elections in april and may musavis appeared to have 
strengthened his hand in the balloting with radicals who seek 
sweeping reforms making major gains 
musavis cabinet includes foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
who heads irans delegation to the unsponsored peace talks in 
geneva aimed at ending the 8yearold war with iraq 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ended years of playing off one 
faction against the other earlier this year by openly supporting 
the musaviled radicals and their campaign for economic reform 
amid persistent reports that khomeini 88 is ailing a power 
struggle between rival factions in tehran to fill the vacuum when 
the aging patriarch dies has intensified in recent months 
khomeinis unexpected decision last month to unconditionally 
accept a unsponsored ceasefire in the gulf war after a string 
of military defeats also sharpened divisions that have plagued 
tehran 
the bearded musavi a militant fundamentalist who trained as an 
engineer and architect at tehrans melli university was named 
prime minister in october 1981 
musavi has been criticized by conservative factions who favor 
private enterprise for his handling of irans warbattered economy 
he favors wider state control of the economy and a major 
redistribution of land much of it still held by the merchants and 
religious groups and the nations wealth to help the poor 
before being named prime minister musavi had been foreign 
minister and a member of the central council of the governing 
islamic republic party which khomeini disbanded last year he was 
one of the few laymen in the initial postrevolution period to take 
high office in the theocratic islamic republic 
musavi began his revolutionary career as a clerk for ayatollah 
mohammad beheshti secretarygeneral of the islamic republic party 
and one of the key revolutionary figures 
beheshti was killed with other senior political leaders in june 
1981 when leftist opponents bombed the party headquarters

foreign minister shimon peres kicked off 
the labor partys election campaign by calling on palestinians to 
end their uprising and start a peace dialogue with israel 
peres also vowed to return occupied territory in exchange for 
peace saying such a move would assure a stronger israel with a 
clear jewish majority 
we shall rid ourselves of gaza we shall rid ourselves of 
areas densely populated by arabs peres told a crowd of 3000 
supporters monday night in a concert hall 
peres called on palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip to end their 9monthold rebellion and negotiate with israel 
we do not wish to oppress them humiliate them or deport them 
the road is open before them instead of fighting there can be 
dialogue peres said 
the palestinians will come to negotiate because a military 
option does not exist for them and they still do not have a 
political option of their own peres added and was wildly 
applauded 
the palestinian revolt is the major campaign issue in the nov 1 
elections billed as the most crucial in israels 40year history 
at least 258 palestinians and four israelis have died in the 
unrest which began dec 8 
in its new platform the leftleaning labor party calls for the 
first time for direct talks with palestinians and leaves the door 
open for dialogue with the plo said peres aide yossi beilin 
labor will be willing to hold a dialogue with palestinian 
people or agents who recognize israel oppose terror and accept 
two un resolutions which implicitly recognize the jewish state 
the platform says 
the palestine liberation organization is now banned in israel as 
a terrorist organization 
labors platform supports relinqushing parts of the west bank 
and gaza for peace the territories are home to about 15 million 
palestinians and about 60000 jewish settlers 
however defense minister yitzhak rabin made it clear that 
israel would not yield all the land captured in the 1967 middle 
east war 
defensible borders cannot be the pre1967 borders rabin 
told the rally we will not return to those lines not even for 
peace 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rival likud bloc objects to 
relinquishing territory to the arabs and to talks with the plo but 
it favors a peace dialogue with other palestinians on the basis of 
the 1978 usbrokered camp david accord which preceded israels 
1979 peace treaty with egypt 
the camp david agreement calls for five years of palestinian 
selfrule in the occupied territories as an interim solution 
on july 31 king hussein of jordan announced he was cutting 
administrative ties with the occupied lands and yielding 
responsibility for their affairs to the plo 
peres said he still believed a peace settlement with jordan is 
possible 
we shall invite jordan and we shall invite the palestinians 
to peace talks he said the jordanians will come because when we 
talk peace jordan will not turn away 
speaker after speaker attacked the likud setting the stage for 
what promises to be a vitriolic election campaign 
we have 55 days until election day to confront the coalition 
of annexationists a right wing which has become more extreme 
said peres it is a coalition based on fear a coalition which 
spreads fear of peace 
while party leaders raised their arms clenched their fists and 
promised victory many spectators appeared doubtful 
recent public opinion polls indicate that the rightist parties 
led by the likud have a slight edge over the liberal coalition 
headed by labor 
likud and labor have maintained a tenuous coalition since 1984 
because neither party won a majority that year in the 120seat 
knesset israels parliament

from boston to mexico before arresting him there for the 1987 
slaying of a policeman 
ted jeffrey otsuki 36 was being extradited to los angeles late 
monday after a yearlong search that culminated in his arrest sunday 
in guadalajara mexico authorities said 
otsuki is a very very violent and dangerous fugitive said 
james f ahearn special agent in charge of the fbis boston 
bureau i characterized him as one of the most dangerous i 
had ever encountered 
otsuki a harlingen texas native was on parole after serving 
a prison sentence for robbing a texas bank when he allegedly shot 
detective roy j sergei 42 and rookie officer jorge torres in 
boston said fbi special agent neil gallagher 
on oct 2 1987 the two boston police officers had stopped a 
suspect after they spotted him trying to climb a fence behind a 
building 
while otsuki was being taken into custody police say he

the communist leaders of cuba continue to imprison 
citizens who speak out against them but have also taken 
significant steps toward improving human rights amnesty 
international says in a report today 
cubas recent release of large numbers of political prisoners 
improvement of prison conditions and limiting of the scope of the 
death penalty were welcomed by the international human rights 
organization 
however laws that have been used to stifle opposition and jail 
prisoners of conscience remain in force and seriously threaten 
government critics it said 
the report was written after a threemember team led by amnesty 
secretarygeneral ian martin visited cuba in march for the first 
time since 1977 
the group repeated its longstanding appeal to cuba for the 
unconditional release of prisoners of conscience people jailed for 
their political or religious beliefs many recently released 
prisoners have been forced to leave cuba it said 
most political prisoners were charged with enemy propaganda 
after writing or saying things the government disapproved of 
sometimes in private letters sent abroad or to foreign embassies in 
havana amnesty said 
it said others were convicted of trying to leave cuba without 
permission or of insulting behavior toward state officials 
the group believes others were sentenced for politically related 
criminal offenses where there is reason to believe that they may 
have been convicted solely on account of their peaceful opposition 
to the cuban government the report said 
amnesty urged the havana government to speed up a promised 
review of hundreds of political prisoners and expressed concern 
about their ability to obtain a proper defense and trial 
it said the steady pace of recent releases of political 
prisoners made it difficult to estimate how many are still held in 
cuba 
as of early august about 250 prisoners were being held for 
crimes against state security and an unknown number believed to 
be in the hundreds were held under other sections of cubas penal 
code used to restrict basic rights particularly the 
internationally recognized right to leave ones country amnesty 
said 
the amnesty team met senior cuban security and legal officials 
visited two prisons holding political prisoners and interviewed 
dozens of prisoners in private the report said 
it said political inmates in the two prisons combinado del este 
and boniato were in the past reported to have been beaten kept in 
poor conditions given inadequate food and denied medical treatment 
it said cuban authorities told the visitors they were trying to 
improve the worst parts of these prisons the report noted that 
improvements in physical conditions and the prison regime appear to 
have been introduced in the last eight months 
however amnesty said prisoners do not feel confident of getting 
a fair hearing about complaints and fear retaliation 
amnesty said use of the death penalty appears to have been 
reduced considerably since the early 1980s 
it quoted cubas justice minister as saying that although 216 
people were executed between 1959 and 1987 the number executed 
since 1984 is 11 all for common crimes rather than security crimes

residents near golden gate park oppose 
openair soup kitchens near their homes a neighborhood leader 
said after the arrest of 50 people who clashed with police while 
trying to pass out food and pamphlets 
no injuries were reported in mondays fracas on aug 29 29 
people were arrested in a similar confrontation and leaders of the 
group called food not bombs said they would return each monday 
lorraine rorke vice president of one of several neighborhood 
organizations opposed to the giveaways by the group said residents 
believe it is not so interested in giving away food as they are 
in promoting their particular message 
food and fists flew monday when police in riot gear closed in on 
about 200 people gathered for the giveaway 
the scene was next to haightashbury home of the flower power 
movement in the 60s but more recently a transitional neighborhood 
where restored victorian homes fetch hundreds of thousands of 
dollars 
food not bombs members have a right to their political views 
rorke said 
i just dont like their means of using the hungry and blocking 
the entrance to the park she said 
she added that it is difficult to reach a playground at the park 
without passing through a crowd of leftover hippies and 
burntout druggies 
police spokesman sgt jerry senkir said the action would not 
have been against the law had the group obtained permits 
as the officers approached food began to fly through the air 
with one officer being hit in the face with a plate of rice and one 
being struck in the neck with a tomato 
those arrested faced possible misdemeanor charges and one woman 
faced a charge of assaulting an officer senkir said 
besides passing out food food not bombs distributed leaflets 
saying the group had been harassed recently by police and had been 
unfairly characterized by mayor art agnos as being interested in 
exploiting the homeless and hungry

wearing a yellow poncho in the steady rain 
10yearold margaret nathaniel helped her mother stock their gray 
tent with camping supplies sleeping bags thin mattresses and a 
cooler 
outside the tent beneath a cluster of sturdy oak trees they 
had a clear view of the 12foot fence topped with a spiral of 
barbed wire that surrounded them and the rest of the dwight 
correctional center illinois only prison for women 
but inside at the start of an overnight campout for inmates and 
their children they could ignore the fence be alone and if only 
for a few hours do the things that mothers and daughters do 
it gives me pleasure today to sleep with her to comb her 
hair to wash her said margarets mother cathy nathaniel a 
convicted murderer 
the campout on the last weekend of august was the last of three 
held over the summer at dwight located some 75 miles southwest of 
chicago about 80 children and 36 inmates took part in the program 
funded by a federal grant said warden jane huch 
the children arrived on a saturday morning stayed overnight in 
tents with their mothers and left the next day volleyball crafts 
a play performed by the prison drama club and an evening bonfire 
helped fill their time 
the overnight visit gave sheryl decker 37 a chance to have 
some girl talk with her 17yearold daughter debbie but it 
didnt completely ease the pain of separation 
when we look at each other and i know shes got to go beyond 
that fence you know it hurts and we know it for a minute but then 
we shrug it off and we go on ms decker said we kind of play 
and get it up out of our system but its coming 
for ms decker and ms nathaniel separation from their children 
is the hardest part of imprisonment 
that is the punishment thats it said ms nathaniel who 
hopes to be paroled in 4 years 
but the visits help 
imprisonment means missing experiences that other mothers and 
daughters share said ms decker who hopes to be paroled in three 
years from an 18year term for armed violence 
you go to sleep at night and you wake up and its to the same 
thing every day she said its not like being with your child 
and raising them and teaching them the facts of life going through 
their first dating experience finding her first love 
ordinary visits can last from 9 am to 3 pm on a weekday or 
until 7 pm on weekends but ms decker said its not enough 
you really dont have time to really talk about the most 
important parts of a daughterandmother relationship she said 
ms decker has been in prison for six years since her daughter 
was 11 at first debbie lived with foster parents then at a 
childrens home now she lives alone in the central illinois town 
of paris as she begins her senior year in high school 
she cries as she describes life without her mother whom she 
calls her best friend 
you know how you get up for school and your mom always tells 
you you look nice or you go to prom and theyre there she says 
haltingly adding that for her theyre not there 
luz ferro 26 has been in dwight on a drugdealing conviction 
for nearly half of her 4yearold daughters life 
ms ferro says her daughter karina who is living with her 
sisterinlaw in waukegan is too young to fully understand why 
they have to be separated 
today she saw this little tent she said oh mama this is 
wonderful and i said yes honey were going to be sleeping here 
tonight 
and she said what about tomorrow night and i said no 
youve got to go back home 
she said why mommy why do i have to go back why cant i 
stay here and we can sleep in the tent 
thats when ms ferro tried to explain punishment and what it 
means 
i tell her they punished me because i did something wrong 
and the punishment is i have to stay away from you she said 
thats the punishment

more than 80 percent of parents are satisfied 
with their childrens public schools but if they had the money 
more than half would send their children to private schools a poll 
shows 
the survey commissioned by children magazine shows that 41 
percent of parents said they were very satisfied with their childs 
public school and another 40 percent said they were somewhat 
satisfied 
but if money were no object 51 percent would choose to send 
their child to a private or parochial school according to the 
survey 
the poll which has a margin of error of plus or minus 6 
percentage points drew from a sample of 305 parents with children 
in public schools 
the poll is included in a report in the magazines october 
issue report card on public education 
jeff meade a senior editor of the magazine writes that many 
education experts play down the popular solutions to solving the 
countrys education problems such as tougher graduation 
requirements more homework and teacher competency tests in favor 
of more parent involvement and more creative school management 
the current education system is inadequate meade writes and 
that inadequacy goes beyond sagging grades in the basics 
absenteeism violence drug use and social isolation are now a 
large part of the public school students environment meade 
writes the typical high school student winds up cutting 10 classes 
a year and one out of four high school students drop out he 
writes 
more and more students have both parents working outside the 
home meade writes but schools are not adapting to the shifting 
family structure 
for a community to battle these problems meade says the 
atmosphere of its school has to improve parents have to become 
more involved ask more questions and take part in curriculum 
planning principals have to be more interested in education than 
in management and teachers should have more say in their own 
educational programs

the scheduled pullout of the missile 
cruiser vincennes from the persian gulf region has been postponed 
because at least one arab government objected to its departure 
us military sources said 
the 9600ton cruiser was to have ended its patrol duties with 
the us joint task force middle east on sunday and was earlier 
reported to have left 
in reducing the force from 27 to 26 ships the vincennes would 
have represented the first cutback by the united states since the 
aug 20 ceasefire in the iraqiran war 
the military sources insisting on anonymity on monday said the 
vincennes was remaining on station in the arabian sea possibly for 
another five days 
the change of orders was based on diplomatic rather than 
military considerations and came from a much higher level than 
the navy in the gulf said one source that source speaking on 
condition of anonymity also said the pentagon decision not to 
replace the cruiser still stood 
us military and diplomatic sources said they could not 
identify the arab state that raised objections to the vincennes 
leaving the region 
the vincennes one of the navys powerful aegis cruisers is 
winding up a tour that was marred by its mistaken downing of an 
iranian jetliner on july 3 killing all 290 people aboard 
the vincennes which carries a crew of 385 left its home port 
at san diego in late april and entered the gulf on may 27 
conducting air surveillance in the strait of hormuz and southern 
gulf

flood waters receded today in some of 
the hardest hit parts of bangladesh but the country still faces 
massive problems in getting food medicine and safe drinking water 
to millions of marooned people 
we will have to feed the people for two months at least 
president hussain muhammad ershad said after a helicopter flight 
over villages and rice paddies swamped by flood waters that cover 
threefourths of this impoverished nation of 110 million people 
the floods that started in june then eased only to surge again 
last week have killed at least 406 people by government count but 
this figure is generally regarded as understated and daily tallies 
reported by dhaka newspapers put the death toll at 1122 
the health ministry says more than 100000 people are known to 
be suffering from diarrhea and 5715 more from dysentery as a 
result of drinking contaminated water 
in rajbari a town of 50000 people 45 miles west of dhaka 
people stood in chestdeep water as a motorboat carried ershad past 
their flooded houses 
he disembarked at a relief camp set up in a government school 
and handed out new bright pink 50taka notes worth about 155 
cents to people crowding around him he plunged into the flood 
water that surged past his knees as small boys splashed and paddled 
in the muddy brown swirl around him 
about 800000 people live in the rajbari district which 
includes hundreds of outlying villages munshi abdul latif a 
member of parliament from the district estimated at least 500000 
were temporarily displaced by the flood and had sought refuge on 
higher ground 
he said at least 15000 houses were destroyed 
the biggest problem at the moment abdul latif said was a 
virtual absence of fuel that has left people without any means of 
cooking rice or any other food they had managed to save from the 
flood 
the government has used boats and helicopters to ferry food 
mainly rice to people stranded on bits of high ground but with 
only a dozen helicopters in service the task is proceeding slowly 
wing commander firdaus a helicopter pilot who uses only one 
name said he had made 30 relief flights in the last three days 
in some villages we cant even land he said we just have to 
drop the food 
the flood control center said 12 major rivers were still rising 
today but three of the mightiest rivers the ganges brahmaputra 
and meghna have started receding 
this could be seen clearly in todays helicopter flight over 
four administrative districts west of the capital 
bright green rice plants poked above the flood level in neatly 
defined rectangular fields during a helicopter flight over the 
same area 24 hours earlier the paddies were completely submerged 
information minister mahbubur rahman told reporters monday that 
50 of the countrys 64 districts have been directly affected by 
floods and 21 million people rendered homeless 
he said 25 million people had lost relatives a home or 
business crops or other property 
the diarrhea cases primarily have hit the interior but were also 
reported today in dhaka a city of 6 million rahmat ali a 
municipal official said flood waters had entere the citys 
drinking supply through leaky pipes 
floods are an annual monsoon event in bangladesh a disaster 
that accompanies the blessing of rain for the crops but rahman and 
other officials said those of 1988 are the worst in memory 
last years floods killed about 300 people rahman said but 
dhaka newspapers put the 1987 toll at 1500 
bangladesh whose per capita annual income of 150 is one of 
the worlds poorest nations rivers run through it like veins 
making it a sort of giant drain pipe for flood waters that pour 
south into the bay of bengal

all 187 foreign ministry workers who 
belonged to burmas ruling party resigned from the party and 
employees of 16 diplomatic missions have expressed support for the 
formation of an interim government ministry sources said today 
a statement from ministry employees said the workers decided 
monday to resign from the burma socialist program party which 
protesters blame for 26 years of repression and ruinous economic 
policies 
ministry sources said that with the exception of the 
ambassadors employees at 16 of the 26 foreign missions have 
supported demands for formation of an interim government to lead 
burma to democracy 
the statement appealed for support from foreign missions we 
have now reached a stage where the government should comply 
forthwith with the peoples wishes any responsible government 
would have done so long ago 
procrastination in any form by the government either by 
resorting to irrelevant legal procedures or by various maneuvers 
tactics and ruses designed to retain the reins of power would 
inevitably bring about immense suffering to the people together 
with the ultimate threat of strife 
we must prevent such an outcome at all costs so those 
schoolchildren students and martyrs who have valiantly given up 
their lives in this historic struggle would not have died in 
vain it said 
many government departments have stated opposition to the 
government some have held street demonstrations this has crippled 
president maung maungs administration which faces the threat of 
nationwide demonstrations thursday unless it yields to demands for 
an interim government 
lawlessness spread to the capital today as looters stripped 
three government warehouses authorities made no attempt to 
intervene 
sources said hundreds of people carried away bags of rice from a 
warehouse in western rangoon in brisk business near the warehouse 
they sold the rice to merchants for 100 kyats or 17 cents per 
165pound bag a quarter of the normal price 
nearby looters took frozen fish trays and equipment from a 
fisheries department warehouse and another group stole provisions 
and office equipment from a food and beverages corp warehouse near 
rangoon university

with power restored in a 50block downtown area 
after a fourday blackout crews are checking for wiring similar to 
the kind that contributed to the cityowned utilitys worst outage 
the precise cause of the fire that resulted in the outage 
wednesday remained undetermined power to all but one building in 
the citys retail financial and hotel core was restored by sunday 
evening 
seattle city light officials attributed the severity of the 
blackout to the melting of an aluminum directcurrent supply cable 
for overhead electrical trolley bus lines in an underground vault 
that also contained six of the utilitys 13000volt feeder cables 
during the height of the blackout officials estimated that 90 
percent of all businesses were closed in the area which included 
an estimated 130 restaurants 55 shops in the popular pike place 
market the bon marche department store the 875room westin hotel 
and uncounted other hotels food stores and taverns 
city light officials said they had no estimate of the utilitys 
losses and the costs of restoring power there was no cost estimate 
available for losses sustained by the utilitys customers 
scott forslund a utility spokesman said it might be several 
days before power is restored to the last building without service 
a parking garage near the vault because its lowvoltage supply 
lines were destroyed in the same fire that wrecked the feeder 
cables 
the fire began in lowvoltage utility lines between transformers 
in the vault and individual buildings said city light assistant 
superintendent jerry garman 
as the system heated power to the highvoltage feeder cables 
should have been cut by current limiters but the transit cable 
melted and its molten aluminum cut the highvoltage cables before 
power could be shut off to all but two of them 
when aluminum melts its just like adding gasoline to a 
fire city light spokesman hugh mcintosh said 
it took what would have been a minor inconvenience and turned 
it into a major event garman said its like we had eight or 
nine welding torches going at the same time 
city light crews will check other locations with similar 
combinations of utility and metro cables to try to prevent a 
similar outage garman said

the national centers for disease control deleted 
all criticisms of its efforts to fight aids among minorities before 
making public its report on the subject the atlanta constitution 
reported today 
cdc director james o mason acknowledged that parts of the 
analysis were condensed from 16 pages to two pages after they were 
reviewed by cdc officials but the newspaper quoted him as refusing 
to say why the agency deleted critical sections of the report the 
newspaper cited government records as its source but did not 
elaborate 
mason said the cdc has not yet developed an overall strategy to 
fight aids among blacks and hispanics who account for more than 40 
percent of the victims of the disease 
if we were to craft a specific forwardlooking game plan we 
would involve them in crafting it he said 
the cdc paid a private consultant 12000 for an analysis of its 
efforts to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome among blacks 
and hispanics 
among other things the consultants report said cdc had no 
cohesive plan of action to prevent aids among minorities and is 
unaware of how much of the money given to local health departments 
for minority aids programs actually reached minority populations 
the report also said the agency does not have information about 
the knowledge attitudes and behaviors of minority populations 
mason said the consultants study was not intended to be used by 
the cdc to provide an overall picture of its efforts to prevent and 
control aids among minorities he said it was designed to provide 
him with information to present at a conference of minority health 
workers and to summarize cdc grants to minority aids programs 
surgeon general c everett koop has said the only way to control 
aids is by educating highrisk segments of the population the cdc 
estimates that among blacks and hispanics there are 200000 
infected homosexual and bisexual men 200000 infected heterosexual 
drug users 100000 infected women and 15000 infected children and 
infants

a deputy has been assigned to provide security 
for the family of martin luther king jr for the past five months 
a measure defended by the county sheriff as a valid use of tax 
money 
id say its public money going to protect a public family 
fulton county sheriff richard lankford was quoted as saying in 
todays editions of the atlanta constitution anything that 
happened to the king family at this juncture would become 
international 
king was assassinated april 4 1968 in memphis tenn his 
mother alberta king was shot to death in 1975 while playing the 
organ for a sunday service in an atlanta church 
it would be an indictment i think against our community if 
another tragedy would befall the family the sheriff said in 
acknowledging he assigned deputy angelo willoughby to the post 
the newspaper said it learned of the deputys hiring through 
county records 
county manager sam brownlee said the county commission should 
have been asked to approve the assignment because it amounts to 
publicly financed protection for a private family 
that is not something the board of commissioners has 
authorized he said thats something the sheriff has done 
willoughby reports daily to the martin luther king jr center 
for nonviolent social change 
i dont know if i would say hes a bodyguard but hes there 
for the protection of the family as well as for the security of the 
center itself lankford said 
the civil rights leaders son fulton county commissioner martin 
luther king iii said he appreciates the officers presence 
i carry the name martin luther king and that draws 
crackpots he said 
a guy came up and approached my mother coretta scott king 
last week king said he was just crazy if he willoughby had 
not been there something might have happened once he saw a police 
official there he backed off

hastings neb ap president reagan heading back to the white 
house after a threeweek california vacation today saluted a 
privately supported communications school in a college that runs on 
a balanced budget as a model for our society to follow 
dedicating the cj and marie gray communications arts center at 
hastings college reagan said the schools students will be 
entering a profession that at times does not seem to appreciate 
the simpler virtues 
in a speech at the dedication of the communications facility 
reagan said im told that hastings college operates on a 
balanced budget 
and the gray center itself has raised all its funds in the 
private sector not looking toward the government for a special leg 
up or a free lunch he said that kind of selfreliance is 
inspiring and a model for our society to follow 
its a philosophy i hope the students who come here to learn 
will carry with them when they leave to ply their skills elsewhere 
in a profession that at times does not seem to appreciate the 
simpler virtues the president said 
the center was built with the help of a 1 million grant from 
former reagan campaign official bob gray a hastings native gray 
is a washington public relations executive who was director of 
communications for reagans 1980 campaign for the white house 
the center is named for grays parents marie gray and the late 
garold cj gray the elder gray was an electrical engineer and his 
wife was a house mother at the college 
reagan was also attending a closed fundraising reception for 
nebraskas appointed republican sen david karnes at grand island 
neb karnes is seeking election against bob kerrey the states 
popular former democratic governor 
later in the day the president was speaking to about 7500 
delegates at an american legion convention in louisville ky on 
his way back to washington for the first time since george bush was 
nominated to succeed him 
bush and his democratic opponent massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis will speak to the legionnaires later in the week 
in the coming weeks reagan faces a new round of negotiation 
with congress on the thorny issue of aid to nicaraguan rebels and a 
busy round of campaigning for bush and other republican candidates 
on wednesday his first day back at work the president has 
scheduled a meeting with republican congressional leaders 
while the agenda has not been announced the legislative 
calendar includes aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua a landmark 
free trade agreement with canada 11 appropriations bills welfare 
legislation and confirmation of reagans nominations of nicholas 
brady as secretary of the treasury and lauro cavazos as secretary 
of education also hanging are backlogs of judicial and diplomatic 
nominations reagan hopes to see confirmed before he leaves office 
4 months from now 
contra aid is certainly one of the issues we have to deal with 
right off the bat said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the senate has passed a bill which the administration termed 
minimally acceptable and the house the biggest hurdle for contra 
aid in the past has not acted 
when asked whether the administration wanted to change the bill 
to include military as well as humanitarian aid fitzwater declined 
to answer saying its to be a negotiated process 
another administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the only way to get the right kind of contra 
aid is to let congress do it the more we come out for things 
sometimes the more it doesnt help the process 
in addition to his legislative battles the president is 
expected to make about two political trips a week until the 
election appearing on behalf of senate and house candidates but 
also pushing for the election of his vice president to succeed him 
reagan left washington on august 14 to speak at the republican 
national convention in new orleans he flew to california on august 
16 and has spent the time since at his 688acre ranch north of here 
and in los angeles 
since taking office in 1981 the president has spent 335 days at 
the ranch he is expected to return for a few days around 
thanksgiving 
officials say reagan may go to the united nations at the end of 
september as he usually does but fitzwater said no foreign travel 
is planned before his term ends on jan 20

iraqs ruling revolutionary command 
council today announced a general and comprehensive amnesty for 
kurdish rebels in an apparent effort to counter allegations its 
forces are using poison gas against the tribesmen 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia reported 
the council said the rebels whether in iraq or abroad had 30 days 
to turn themselves in to be pardoned but would then be allowed to 
leave the country 
those who have obligations abroad such as jobs or attending 
school would be allowed to leave the news agency quoted the 
announcement as saying their exit is guaranteed 
baghdads move came as kurdish guerrillas reported fierce 
fighting in northeast iraq where they said 60000 troops with 
tanks fighterbombers and helicopter gunships were advancing into 
the rebel strongholds 
the rebels are seeking autonomy in their mountainous region 
where about 20 million kurds live in the area where syria iraq 
iran and turkey converge 
the decree addressed to the glorious iraqi nation singled 
out the kurds but contained no reference to the kurds demand for 
an autonomous homeland 
iraqs estimated 35 million kurds about onefifth of the 
countrys population have been fighting on and off for 50 years 
for independence 
however the iraqi news agency said the amnesty did not extend 
to the traitor jalal talabani leader of the patriotic union 
of kurdistan and massoud barzani leader of the kurdish democratic 
party 
talabani and barzani joined forces with iran during the persian 
gulf war against iraq their organizations have long been outlawed 
by iraq 
spokesmen for the two kurdish parties claim the iraqis have 
repeatedly used outlawed chemical weapons against undefended 
villages in recent days killing at least 1900 civilians and 
wounding 5000 
iraq has dnied using chemical weapons against the kurds 
although it has admitted using them against iranian forces during 
the eightyear gulf war before fighting stopped when a united 
nationssponsored ceasefire took effect aug 20 
the iraqi decree said all kurdish prisoners would be pardoned 
and released immediately except those convicted or wanted on 
other charges the revolutionary command council statement said 
the amnesty was based on the islamic principle of pardoning 
wrongdoers and giving them a chance to repent even the most 
devious and cursed 
officials in turkey say about 90000 kurds have fled across the 
mountainous border since the iraqi offensive began last last month 
but turkeys foreign minister mesut yilmaz said monday that 
the heavy influx of kurds fleeing from iraq has ceased because 
iraqi troops who had been battling the kurds are blocking mountain 
passes to turkey 
in geneva iran has asked the un high commissioner for 
refugees to provide aid for several thousand kurdish refugees 
fleeing the army offensive in iraq a un refugee official said 
today 
iran says 2000 iraqi kurds streamed across the border into west 
azerbaijan province in recent days and another 600 families are 
heading toward the region said the un spokeswoman judith kumin

democrat michael dukakis and republican george bush offering 
starkly different views of the nations economy headed today into 
the decisive two months of the 1988 presidential campaign with 
dukakis saying republicans love to blame american workers first 
in a speech prepared for delivery to polishamericans in a 
chicago suburb the massachusetts governor saluted the polish union 
solidarity and went on to describe bush as insensitive to american 
workers 
bush was campaigning on the west coast and president reagan was 
hitting the campaign trail on his vice presidents behalf 
ending a vacation at his california ranch reagan was speaking 
in nebraska and to the american legion convention in kentucky 
before returning to the white house 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen visited a 
technical institute in lawrenceville ga where women were being 
trained to make electronic circuit boards 
education is the key to see that we restore the united 
states as the worlds economic leader he said adding that the 
republicans have presided over a throwing away of the key of 
education 
during labor day appearances and again today dukakis recalled 
bushs praise of soviet tank mechanics during a european trip last 
fall 
send them to detroit we could use that kind of ability 
bush said after being told of a troublefree soviet tank maneuver 
later he apologized to us autoworkers adding hey give me a 
break i didnt mean anything by it 
dukakis said today do you really believe we in america have 
anything to learn from a society where workers have no rights 
consumers have no choices and even mr gorbachev admits their 
economy is a shambles those republicans in washington love to 
blame american workers first 
dukakis speech was interrupted for about 15 minutes by 
demonstrators who shouted what about abortion and abortion 
is murder 
supporters of the candidate chanted back we want mike 
several of the demonstrators were removed from the room by people 
in the crowd and dukakis proceeded with his remarks his position 
on abortion is that he is personally opposed to it but believes a 
pregnant woman has the right to make her own decision 
in an interview published today in the washington post 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle said he saw 
little difference between soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and his 
predecessors quayle described gorbachevs reforms as nothing 
more than refined stalinism 
the indiana senator said gorbachev has a different approach to 
things and his mannerisms and style are unfortunately pleasing to 
the west unfortunately because i dont think from an 
ideological point of view hes any different from leonid brezhnev 
or anybody else 
at a labor day rally in detroit dukakis said that during the 
nearly eight years of a republican administration the rich have 
gotten richer the poor have gotten poorer 
he said millions of highpaying jobs have been replaced by 
lowwage positions and asked can we afford four more years of 
that 
republican rival bush touted economic gains under the reagan 
administration saying the administration has created 17 million 
jobs more disposable income for the american people lower taxes 
and all my opponent can do is tell the american people how bad 
things are 
the vice president said the campaign is about protecting the 
gains weve made in jobs and peace and its about how to make new 
breakthroughs in both areas 
after full schedules on labor day the symbolic opening of the 
fall campaign the republican and democratic candidates with the 
exception of quayle remained on the road 
bentsen joined dukakis at a labor day picnic in st louis and 
then headed back to the south 
quayle was back in washington after labor day appearances at the 
statue of liberty and at an ethnic parade in detroit 
demonstrators appeared at several events 
about 125 antiabortion activists by police estimates were at 
a dukakis appearance in philadelphia they waved signs and chanted 
life yes abortion no duke of death must go 
people carrying dukakisbentsen signs stood at the back of the 
crowd at a bush appearance in san diego and shouted where was 
george 
about 30 members of a group called the aids coalition to unleash 
power heckled quayle and said they were protesting his vote against 
a 30 million appropriation to provide the drug azt to aids victims 
security forces were busy in san diego a man with a stun gun 
on his belt was taken into custody at the bush campaign rally but 
he was later released 
the person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice 
president or anyone else there said steve sergek secret service 
special agent in charge of the san diego field office 
the secret service said another man who was carrying what 
police believed was a bomb was arrested in hamtramck mich 
shortly before quayles arrival there the device turned out to be 
a fake 
the 38yearold hamtramck man was arrested on charges of 
interfering with a secret service agent said jim huse of the 
secret services detroit office 
labor day was an occasion for the candidates to spell out the 
positive and negative themes of their campaigns 
dukakis and bentsen pressed their claim that jobs created under 
the republican administration pay less 
bush said dukakis was following the standard litany of the 
liberal left with his opposition to the mx and midgetman missile 
systems the star wars missile defense program and two new carrier 
task forces 
i wouldnt be surprised if he thinks that a naval exercise is 
something you find in jane fondas workout book he said in 
reference to the actress who was an active opponent of the vietnam 
war

the government charged today that cash jewelry 
fine wines and fruits were given to the nations former chief law 
enforcement officer by defendants in the influencepeddling trial 
of leonid i brezhnevs soninlaw 
as the trial before a threemember military tribunal entered its 
second day prosecutors alleged defendants gave former interior 
minister nikolai shchelokov then the soviet unions top police 
officer and a protege of brezhnev gifts ranging from neckties to 
three pearls valued at 5300 each 
the indictment which is being read in court said shchelokov 
was picky about the gifts he accepted and often refused things that 
didnt suit him 
the charges provided the most detailed account yet of official 
corruption at the top levels of the brezhnev regime 
recent newspaper reports say shchelokov took 11 million in 
state funds gave foreign luxury cars to his children and bought 
furs and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family 
he was fired by brezhnevs successor yuri andropov and died in 
december 1984 at age 73 shchelokov and his wife are said to have 
committed suicide and the indictment read today confirmed the 
former interior minister did indeed kill himself 
the court documents said boxes of money were left on 
shchelekovs desk and that one of the nine defendants gave him 
105000 rubles 170000 
he wanted good dry wines the indictment said adding that 
the defendants obliged him six times a year shipments from the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan would arrive at a moscow 
airport and be taken to shchelekovs country home outside the 
capital 
the indictment said the shipments contained cognac tomatoes as 
well as melons apricots and other fruits unobtainable in moscow 
most of the year 
when he received gifts he liked the account said the interior 
minister would politely accept them by saying i thank you 
sometimes however he refused to take things he didnt want 
according to the indictment shchelekov once was taken to a 
factory in uzbekistan and offered clothes and other products made 
there he reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of 
jewelry for his wife 
the central figure among the nine defendants 51yearold yuri 
churbanov was shchelokovs deputy and could face the death penalty 
if convicted on charges he accepted bribes and gifts such as wine 
cognac and grapes flown to him via the soviet airline aeroflot from 
uzbekistan 
one defendant was out sick today and two others were treated by 
a doctor in the courtroom 
a judge at the military tribunal announced that khushvan 
norbutaev would not attend todays session and the defendants 
lawyer olga rakitina said the former regional police chief from 
uzbekistan was suffering from angina pectoris a painful but not 
necessarily dangerous heart condition 
she sought a recess saying her client was entitled to hear 
everything that goes on in court but the judge rejected the 
request and a clerk then continued reading the indictment 
a physician later gave heart medicine to another defendant 
tashtimir kakhramanov and administered stomach pills to d 
dzhamalov 
the trial is considered part of mikhail s gorbachevs effort to 
separate his leadership from the corruption of brezhnevs rule 
which began in 1964 and ended with the communist party chiefs 1982 
death 
churbanov married galina brezhnev in 1971 he had worked as a 
mechanic before taking a lowlevel interior ministry job in 1961 
official media have reported extensively on the trial which is 
expected to last about two months some foreign reporters also are 
being allowed to attend 
during mondays reading of the charges it was repeatedly 
alleged that churbanov received the bribes from provincial 
officials due to his connection with brezhnev 
it said the codefendants were among those who bribed churbanov 
churbanov also requested and received government construction 
materials for a summer house the indictment said 
he was quoted as saying giftgiving was merely a sign of 
friendship in uzbekistan a republic in soviet central asia 
his codefendants accused taking bribes as well as giving them 
are former interior minister khaidar yakhyaev 61 of uzbekistan 
his former deputies pyotr begelman and kakhramanov and former 
regional police chiefs identified as norbutaev s sabirov 
dzhamalov m norov and y makhamadzhanov 
according to pravda beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests in 
uzbekistan were padded by almost 1 million tons annually with the 
government made to pay for the nonexistent crop by corrupt 
officials 
today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more 
than 4 billion rubles 634 billion from the state half of which 
they stuffed into their own pockets the official communist party 
daily reported earlier this year

michael dukakis today criticized george bush for 
saying us auto plants could use the abilities of soviet 
mechanics and he accused the reagan administration of trying to 
break unions and pit management against labor 
last fall on a trip to europe bush said hed been told in a 
meeting of nato ministers that 350 soviet tanks had recently 
completed maneuvers without a breakdown 
hey when the mechanics who keep those tanks running run out 
of work in the soviet union send them to detroit because we could 
use that kind of ability bush said at the time later he 
apologized to us autoworkers adding hey give me a break i 
didnt mean anything by it 
dukakis in a meeting today with hundreds of polishamericans 
and others at a banquet hall outside chicago praised the polish 
workers union solidarity while taking aim at reagan administration 
labor policies 
they dont understand that solidarity isnt just a beautiful 
word in polish its also a beautiful word in english dukakis 
said thats why theyve spent the last seven years trying to 
break unions and pit management againstqbor 
the democratic nominee chided bush for the vice presidents 
remarks about soviet mechanics 
i agree we have to pay attention to quality from the 
assembly lines to the executive suites dukakis said but do 
you really believe we in america have anything to learn from a 
society where workers have no rights consumers have no choices and 
even mr gorbachev admits their economy is a shambles those 
republicans in washington love to blame american workers first 
dukakis speech was interrupted for about 15 minutes by 
demonstrators who shouted what about abortion and abortion 
is murder 
supporters of the candidate chanted back we want mike 
several of the demonstrators were removed from the room by people 
in the crowd and dukakis proceeded with his remarks his position 
on abortion is that he is personally opposed to it but believes a 
pregnant woman has the right to make her own decision 
there was scuffling but police said there were no arrests 
one of the demonstrators richard freeman said several 
antiabortion groups met a week ago and decided to organize 
protests if dukakis is within 300 miles of a prolife activist 
were going to go out and greet him he said 
as freeman spoke to reporters he was jostled by other people in 
the crowd one of whom ripped his jacket 
one spectator obviously upset by the demonstators marion reis 
said he opposes abortion and has donated money to prolife groups 
he said he would make no further donations adding i think 
theyre full of hate not full of love 
dukakis was also to meet in illinois today with state democratic 
leaders but jesse jackson was not included 
jackson was very upset over the omission the latest in a series 
of what he has perceived as slights by the dukakis campaign said a 
source close to the former presidential candidate 
another confidant said jackson has expressed concern about his 
contacts with the dukakis campaign and whether or not hes going 
to be able to do what he could and should do for the ticket 
both sources spoke on condition they not be identified by name 
in illinois dukakis state press secretary judy erwin said 
jackson was not included in the meetings because he is regarded as 
a national leader and todays meetings were to focus on the 
illinois state campaign 
dukakis remarks today about bush marked a continuation of the 
effort dukakis has made in the past week to portray his republican 
rival as out of touch with average americans 
from illinois dukakis was heading to another key industrial 
state ohio after marking the traditional labor day kickoff of the 
fall campaign monday with appearances in pennsylvania michigan and 
missouri 
while dukakis campaigned his top campaign aides were to resume 
discussions with the bush camp on a fall debate schedule 
after an appearance in st louis on monday dukakis sized up the 
final nine weeks of his contest with bush as a tough competitive 
race he believes will swing on which candidate that low and 
moderateincome americans believe is most qualified to direct the 
nations economy 
dukakis said he hoped to keep the focus on substantive issues 
but said it has become clear in recent weeks that republicans are 
more intent on attacking him personally 
if they want a tough aggressive campaign im happy to give 
it to them dukakis said the signs are good and were raring 
to go 
at all of his monday stops and again today dukakis criticized 
bush for calling last months rise in national unemployment 
statistically irrelevant portraying the vice president as the 
standard bearer of the rich and insensitive to the needs of working 
americans 
i dont think he really understands average americans very 
well dukakis said in a meeting with local reporters in st 
louis i dont think he really understands what average families 
are going through these days 
the massachusetts governor repeatedly invoking the theme 
bring prosperity home said the reaganbush legacy will leave 
families working harder than eight years ago to pay their bills 
with millions unable to afford new homes or college educations for 
their children

a prominent black union leader 
accused of leading an attempted political takeover of a black 
township took the witness stand tuesday for the first time in his 
yearold treason trial 
moses mayekiso head of the countrys largest metalworkers 
union and four codefendants are charged with seeking to usurp 
state authority and install their antiapartheid civic group as an 
alternative government in alexandra 
the 39yearold activist whose release has been demanded by 
many international labor groups testified about his impoverished 
childhood and experiences as an illegal migrant worker after he 
moved to the johannesburg area in the early 1970s 
white people lived in civilized places but next door in 
alexandra black people lived in a place where pigs would live 
said mayekiso who will continue his testimony wednesday 
once a squalid slum wedged amidst white johannesburg suburbs 
alexandra has been upgraded extensively by the government since 
mayekisos arrest in june 1986 
the trial has attracted international attention because of 
mayekisos position as general secretary of the national union of 
metalworkers of south africa and because many activists view the 
prosecution as an attempt to stifle legitimate peaceful opposition 
activity 
the government alleges that the defendants organized rent and 
consumer boycotts sought to undermine the security forces and 
established peoples courts in 198586 the height of 
nationwide black unrest 
alexandra was one of the most militant black townships at the 
time and dozens of people were killed in clashes with security 
forces 
in the past two years the government has sought to restore 
control by detaining or restricting leaders of mayekisos alexandra 
action committee while undertaking a 45 million redevlopment 
program in which sewage electricity and paved streets are being 
provided to most of the 100000 residents 
many of the state witnesses who testified during the early 
stages of the treason trial were businessmen who said they suffered 
from boycotts enforced by the action committee 
under crossexamination some of these witnesses said the local 
crime rate dropped when young supporters of the action committee 
began an anticrime campaign 
another highly publicized court case reaches a critical stage 
wednesday when lawyers for the sharpeville six appear before the 
appeal court to challenge the dismissal of a motion to reopen the 
murder trial of their black clients 
the five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for their 
roles in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor there have 
been an extensive worldwide campaign appealing to president pw 
botha to grant clemency 
in june a lower court judge rejected a defense motion to reopen 
the trial to consider new evidence 
at wednesdays hearing in bloemfontein the defense lawyers will 
be asking the appeal court south africas highest court to 
allow a full appeal of the judges decision

dissident groups called tuesday for 
the release of about 700 political prisoners before the olympics 
and charged the games were being used to enforce dictatorial rule 
the 16 groups issued an appeal to the peace lovers of the 
161 nations taking part in the olympics to help obtain the release 
of all political prisoners before the games begin sept 17 
kim kuntae a top dissident told a news conference attended by 
80 other dissidents that the olympics are being used to cement 
military rule he charged the games will be a mockery if any 
political prisoners remain behind bars 
the seoul olympics is not an event to pursue global peace 
but to forcibly reinforce the dictatorship and legitimize 
violence the groups said in a joint statement 
the south korean government says all political prisoners have 
been released except for dissidents convicted of violent crimes or 
communism hundreds of political prisoners were freed over the past 
year 
kim who was released from prison in june said 370 people are 
serving sentences for opposing the government and more than 300 
others are awaiting trial on political charges 
the government says there about 250 dissidents serving criminal 
sentences or awaiting trial on such charges 
the dissidents also denounced communist north koreas exclusion 
from the olympics and called for reunification of the divided 
korean peninsula they said the games were being used to make the 
division permanent 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics because its 
demand to cohost the games was turned down the international 
olympic committee said the games are awarded to a single city and 
could not be shared 
the dissidents also charged the olympics were being staged by 
the government of president roh taewoo to enhance its prestige and 
cement authoritarian rule 
the dehumanizing torture and terror will not cease and at this 
very moment under the euphemism of peace during the olympics 
more people will be arrested the groups said in a statement 
they urged other nations to help them fight the government 
we ask for your fullfledged support in our difficult fight 
for national sovereignty democracy and reunification and 
resistance to rohs military dictatorial regime the statement 
said 
the dissidents also demanded withdrawal of the 42000 us 
troops based in south korea under a mutual defense treaty 
roh a former general who won presidential elections in 
decmeber has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled 
authoritarian controls imposed by former president chun doohwan 
dissident groups contend the government is a front for continued 
authoritarian rule by the military and there has been no democratic 
progress the dissidents and radical antigovernment students have 
little or no public support and rohs popularity has been growing 
most koreans want the olympics to be a major success the games 
are seen as a way to propel the nation into the forefront of newly 
developed nations and continue its rapid industrial development 
in another development south korea has temporarily halted 
foreign adoption of its babies to avoid possible controversy during 
the olympics 
the government has not officially confirmed the ban but 
adoption agencies acknowledged they were asked to stop sending 
babies overseas for adoption for two months before and during the 
olympics south korea sends about 7000 children abroad annually 
for adoption in the united states and europe

firefighters worried it would start 
raining fire today hosed down houses and bolstered lines 
against blazes that have blackened nearly 1 million acres in and 
around yellowstone national park 
county authorities declared a state of emergency today in cooke 
city and silver gate just outside the park and sheriffs deputies 
fanned out to order lingering townspeople to leave their homes the 
declaration authorized the sheriffs office to forcibly remove 
anyone who didnt leave the threatened areas voluntarily 
southwesterly winds 20 to 30 mph were expected in the 
yellowstone area after relatively light winds monday strong winds 
also whipped a 160acre fire in northcentral washington from 160 
acres monday to more than 20000 acres today 
authorities had feared the changing winds could send embers and 
flames into the two small towns from the advancing 61300acre 
storm creek blaze 
we have about a 25 percent chance of holding the fire out of 
these two communities david liebersbach incident commander in 
silver gate said on nbctvs today show this morning 
with these winds it will be heroic a real success to save 
some of these buildings said fire information officer pat 
kaunert 
elsewhere in yellowstone the 142000acre north fork fire 
burned to within a few miles of the old faithful geyser but 
authorities were optimistic the fire would not reach the tourist 
attraction 
the fires about four miles from old faithful so if we do get 
those predicted winds we could have some problems there but i 
think we have a good chance said bob barbee yellowstone 
national park superintendant also appearing on today 
thirteen fires in and around yellowstone have scorched 900000 
acres and should top 1 million acres today after aerial surveys 
are completed gary cargill head of the us forest service in 
denver said at a news conference in bozeman about 300000 more 
acres could burn this week he said 
in washington a fastgrowing fire in the eastern cascade hills 
destroyed one home and threatened others said nick mickel of the 
state department of natural resources he said he did not know how 
many homes or how near they were to the fire 
the fire about six miles west of entiat was burning on steep 
hills covered with sage grass pine and some douglas fir and was 
beginning to butt up against some orchards in washingtons premier 
fruitgrowing region mickel said 
the fire was reported sunday and pegged at 160 acres monday 
morning by 430 pm it grew to 500 acres but when 20 mph 
westerly winds moved in it accelerated rapidly to 3000 acres by 
730 pm and 20000 by 4 am today mickel said 
that fire and others across the state prompted gov booth 
gardner to call out the national guard late monday mainly to help 
transport firefighting crews to blazes in central and eastern 
washington a 12500acre fire near the white mountain complex 
about 75 miles northwest of spokane had been the states largest 
fire 
in idaho 13 forest fires raged out of control a new fire broke 
out monday seven miles north of island park on the western edge of 
the massive north fork fire that burned out of yellowstone during 
the weekend forcing an estimated 150200 summer cabin owners to 
evacuate 
in silver gate and cooke city near yellowstones northeastern 
entrance all but 30 of the approximately 150 residents had 
evacuated 
some of them are staying around because they want to see what 
the fire does said bob fry an emergency services official 
theyre mostly packed up though and were trying to push them 
out 
mild winds blew ash and smoke toward the towns monday afternoon 
fire lines were completed monday around silver gate and nearly 
completed around cooke city said fire information officer sue 
consolo 
about 75 trucks were called in from as far away as nevada to 
protect buildings in the communities firefighters also doused 
homes with water 
hopes of burning out fuels from a twomile swath in the fires 
path were dashed when backfires failed to burn as expected leaving 
towns with less protection than officials had wanted 
forest service officials in northwest montana also prepared an 
evacuation plan for homes in a residential area south of the tiny 
town of fortine 
right now weve got our fingers crossed that this wind isnt 
going to be that harsh said spokesman dick guth stressing that 
residents would be asked to leave only if winds materialize the 
blaze jumped over some lines and grew to an estimated 12300 acres 
while the forecast for brisk winds worried officials at most 
fires in the region it was welcomed at the 54270acre hellroaring 
creek fire burning in montanas absarokabeartooth wilderness and 
south into yellowstone 
spokesman stephanie gibert said the expected southwest winds 
would allow firefighters to set backfires that would burn into the 
main blaze 
elsewhere a blaze that has charred more than 20000 acres in 
southern californias los angeles and ventura counties continued to 
burn out of control today but fire dispatcher annie ironside said 
containment was anticipated late this evening 
oregons largest fire of the season was nearly contained at just 
under 57000 acres in the rugged hells canyon national recreation 
area 
in northern utah fire officials said a fire burning near 
paradise that was thought to be 250 acres was really only 5 acres 
heavy smoke was blamed for the error said ray tate an interagency 
fire center spokesman

chinese officials on tuesday asked defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to press the reagan administration to 
allow american satellites to be shipped to china and launched into 
space aboard its missiles 
carlucci who is visiting china for the first time met for more 
than three hours tuesday with national defense minister qin jiwei 
he also held talks with other officials including premier li peng 
and vice premier wu xueqian 
a senior defense department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said carlucci also discussed us concerns over chinese 
arms sales to nations in the middle east a sore point in 
sinoamerican relations 
the reagan administration is considering whether to grant 
licenses to export usmade satellites to china where they would 
be launched aboard the socalled long march boosters 
two companies have applied for such export licenses hughes 
aircraft co and asiasat a hong kongbased company that purchased 
hughes satellites according to don oneal director of 
communications for the hughes space and communications group based 
in el secundo calif 
there are rumors the launches from china may be as much as 
50 percent cheaper than the french or american shuttle programs 
oneal said on tuesday he said he could not speculate on the exact 
costs of chinese launches 
the us shuttle program was sidelined by the explosion aboard 
the challenger in jan 28 1986 in which all seven people aboard 
were killed 
oneal said hughes is applying for a licence for two of 
telecommunications satellites bought by the australian company 
aussat he said the satellites are owned by hughes until they are 
launched under a delivery in orbit contract with the australian 
company which has chosen china as the launch site 
hughes has received no response to its license application 
which was made in july according to oneal 
asiasat owns a hughesmade westar 6 satellite that was launched 
by the us shuttle in 1984 but failed to reach its proper orbit 
it was recovered by the shuttle in 1985 oneal said will be 
refurbished in the united states asiasat must have a us license 
to export it to china so it can be launched again 
the state department recommended the licenses be approved but 
the commerce department and some republican congressmen say 
allowing china to launch us satellites will undercut us 
companies developing the same service 
on the arms issue the united states has strongly urged china to 
curtail sales of silkworm antiship missiles to iran and voiced 
concern over the recent sale of ballistic missiles to saudi arabia 
china denied selling arms to iran 
deputy chief of staff xu xin told reporters tuesday that china 
has not sold its m9 medium range missiles to syria as reported by 
foreign news agencies 
on wednesday carlucci is to meet with senior chinese leader 
deng xiaoping

a malfunction of a soviet spacecrafts guidance 
system today forced two cosmonauts to delay their return to earth 
for one day a newspaper said their life support systems would last 
just two more days and food was running low 
aboard the soyuztm 5 capsule were abdul ahad mohmand 29 the 
first afghan in space and soviet crewmate vladimir lyakhov 47 
they were returning from the orbiting space station mir where they 
spent six days 
the government daily izvestia and the tass news agency said life 
support systems aboard the capsule are designed to last two days 
however a soviet space official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the cosmonauts could stretch supplies of oxygen 
water and food for up to a week he did not explain how the oxygen 
supply could be stretched out 
izvestia reported this exchange between mission control and the 
cosmonauts 
how are things with food a mission controller asked 
there is no food said lyakhov 
but in the accident reserves the controller asked 
there is some but why touch it we will endure said 
lyakhov 
the problems began shortly after the soyuz capsule disengaged 
from the orbiting station mir at 255 am moscow time izvestia 
and tass reported 
the capsule had brought lyakhov mohmand and soviet doctor 
valery polyakov to the mir on aug 31 polyakov stayed aboard the 
mir to monitor the health of two other cosmonauts who have been in 
space for more than eight months 
an engine used to slow the soyuz for reentry through the 
earths atmosphere fired automatically while the vehicle was out of 
radio contact with ground controllers izvestia said when contact 
was restored lyakhov reported accident the engine worked 60 
seconds and shut off a violation of the stabilization regime 
controllers decided to delay another reentry attempt for three 
hours and in the meantime scientists discovered that an infrared 
guidance system had malfunctioned and a computer automatically 
terminated the engine burn prematurely izvestia said the burn was 
supposed to have lasted 230 seconds 
seven minutes later the guidance system was activated 
automatically again and started the engine but would have put the 
capsule on a trajectory for a landing in china instead of its 
intended destination the soviet central asian republic of 
kazakhstan the newspaper said the cosmonauts manually cut off the 
engine burn after three seconds 
we will postpone the landing until tomorrow mission chief 
valery ryumin himself a cosmonaut told izvestia dont worry 
nothing terrible has happened yet the life support system will 
last for two days 
radio moscow said the soyuz cosmonauts are feeling well and 
there is reliable communication between the aircraft and mission 
control it said the landing was postponed so as not to take 
risks and to allow time for a new reentry trajectory to be 
programmed into the capsules computer 
the tass and izvestia reports did not say whether it was 
possible mohmand and lyakhov could return to mir if they are unable 
to get guidance systems to work properly 
aboard mir polyakov was monitoring the health of cosmonauts 
vladimir titov and musa manarov who are trying to break a 326day 
endurance record set by yuri romanenko they have been in space 
since last dec 21 
lyakhov and mohmand helped titov and manarov conduct medical 
geological and other experiments during their sixday stay on the 
research station

more than 20 years after columbia university 
began building a gymnasium a project abandoned after violent 
demonstrations rocked the campus in 1968 the empty foundation hole 
will be turned into a park pond 
stopping construction of the gym was one of the aims of the 
uprising in which university buildings were taken over by campus 
radicals who called the project racist others complained it took 
away part of morningside park 
new york citys parks department plans to put 12 million into 
rehabilitating the park in the next 10 years columbia is 
contributing 500000 to the project said spokesman fred knubel 
the nowovergrown hole will become a pond said parks 
commissioner henry stern 
while opposition to the vietnam war and mistrust of institutions 
in general also fueled the campus revolt protesters called the gym 
a perfect example of racism practiced by white elite columbia 
against its neighbors in poor black harlem 
columbia designed the 12 million gym to be shared with the 
black community saying it would not only provide recreation but 
also bring lawabiding residents back to a park taken over by 
muggers 
the protesters however harped on the two entrances planned for 
the gym one for students on the morningside heights campus atop 
the parks scarp the other for the community at the buildings 
base in the valley below 
columbias argument that the lower entrance would spare users a 
long steep climb through the park was largely overwhelmed by the 
symbolism of upper and lower entrances 
other opposition came from conservationists who objected to the 
gym taking away two acres in the central section of the 31acre 
park 
the issue of whether it is safe to use the park remains another 
institution bordering morningside the cathedral of st john the 
divine organized a reclaimthepark program saturday it 
consisted of a march and music and art programs to get people back 
into the park and push the pushers out 
stern called it a good idea but said the park was lightly used 
because mostly its a slope and it needs rehabilitation 
he said ball fields in the flat areas would be fixed up new 
lighting installed and a new path cut with shorter steps that 
will make it easier simpler and safer to go up and across the 
park

former ptl leader jim bakker received a 
twoday extension today on a deadline to produce a 3 million line 
of credit supporting his bid to regain control of the television 
ministry and religious theme park 
at a news conference this afternoon outside the heritage usa 
park offices bankruptcy court trustee mc red benton said he 
gave bakker until thursday to prove he has the money to regain the 
empire he lost in a sexandmoney scandal 
benton who had set today as the deadline said the reason for 
the delay was that attorneys were still working out final details 
of the contract for bakker to buy ptl 
benton said he was convinced that bakker had the 3 million but 
said the contract would not be completed until wednesday at the 
earliest 
a jubilant bakker told reporters he expected to have the 3 
million by the end of the day 
benton said bakkers total bid now is 172 million up from the 
165 million that had been reported and that bakker needs to 
present him with a bonafide plan for 74 million of the financing 
by friday 
bakkers bid is scheduled to be presented to us bankruptcy 
judge rufus reynolds on saturday benton said he would not rule out 
the possibility that other offers also would be presented to the 
judge 
bakker said he has 29 million in cash and pledges already and 
expects to top 3 million by the end of the day 
it looks like its all going to be there bakker said 
earlier today about the 3 million line of credit 
meeting with reporters at the world outreach center executive 
offices of ptl he acknowledged he did not have the entire amount 
yet saying we might be 100000 or 200000 short 
asked when he expected to have it all he said by midnight 
tonight 
bakker said he spent the morning at the jim and tammy ministries 
office answering telephones 
bakker and his attorney jim toms said monday they were certain 
supporters will donate the money needed to satisfy ptl bankruptcy 
trustee mc red benton 
to come up with 3 million in a holiday weekend i had to pray 
and say god help me bakker said 
we are sort of running our own labor day telethon without a 
television station he said im not going to leave any stone 
unturned im not going to stumble now 
bakker said a group of people was working on raising the 
remaining 1 million in 1000 pledges and he has set up a trust 
account at a hendersonville nc bank to accept donations those 
donations would be used only if he and his wife tammy faye 
succeeded in purchasing the ministry he said 
benton asked for the money as a sign of bakkers ability to 
follow through on his offer for the heritage usa christian theme 
park a satellite tv network and undeveloped property near the fort 
mill ministry 
bakker leads the bidding for the assets of the ministry that 
went into bankruptcy protection soon after he left in march 1987 
bakker stepped down after admitting to a sexual encounter with 
church secretary jessica hahn and after the ministry paid her hush 
money

republican presidential nominee george bush 
told a group of jeering shipyard workers today that the democrats 
are trying to mislead you and promised that if he is elected he 
would provide more jobs for americans 
listen to this one now bush told a group of about 250 
workers who booed loudly as the vice president spoke at an iron 
works i know the truth sometimes hurts 
the crowd chanted union buster but bush contined to speak 
in a loud voice telling the workers the democrats are trying to 
mislead you things arent going to get worse unless they get 
elected 
it was the most hostile audience the gop nominee has encountered 
since winning the nomination last month bush conceded that oregon 
is a state where he is trailing democratic rival michael dukakis 
speaking with reporters aboard air force ii en route from los 
angeles bush accused dukakis of waging a negative campaign 
he has to tear down he has to make everything negative to be 
elected i dont have to be responding to him the vice president 
said 
at the northwest marine shipyard bush toured a navy oil 
refueling boat and then spoke to a group of iron workers alongside 
the ship stressing the jobs theme and his claim that the reagan 
administration has helped to create more than 17 million new jobs 
many of the hardhat workers carried antibush signs that 
accused him of being antiunion including one that said union 
busting scabloving bush 
although bush was booed and hooted during his speech he did win 
a few cheers from the audience when he told the group im proud 
to be part of an administration that decided were not going to 
wear the kick me signs anymore 
bush said he thought the election was going to be a referendum 
on the direction of americas future and said that his single 
most important goal was that everybody who wants a job should 
have a job a good job at good wages he dukakis may talk 
about it but we delivered it 
he was to tour another plant in everett wash 
on a related matter a bush spokeswoman said campaign chairmen 
for the two presidential candidates spoke this morning by telephone 
and made some progress on a debate schedule 
alixe glen said dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas and bush 
chairman james baker iii will resume negotiations by phone on 
wednesday on dates and a format for the presidential debates 
the republican presidential nominee at a labor day waterfront 
rally in san diego accused dukakis of a negative ideology 
against weapons 
and he said at the navy base town i wouldnt be surprised if 
he thinks a naval exercise is something you find in the jane fonda 
workout book 
bush told the san diego audience that the two central issues of 
the campaign were jobs and peace and how to make new 
breakthroughs in both areas 
recent public opinion polls suggest bush is three to seven 
points behind dukakis in california which has 47 electoral votes 
dukakis is also viewed as stronger in oregon and to a lesser 
degree in washington 
bush aides say polling done by the campaign is becoming 
increasingly pivotal in determining the vice presidents campaign 
schedule 
many surveys suggest that the race nationwide is close to a 
dead heat

the city will clear out homeless youths living 
in a ratinfested salt warehouse and try to direct them to more 
appropriate facilities a sanitation department official said 
tuesday 
we have had problems in the past keeping both homeless and 
runaways from our facilities said vito turso chief spokesman 
for the sanitation department we chase them out they come back 
we chase them out again they come back again 
tursos remarks came after the new york post reported tuesday 
that dozens of homeless boys some of whom work as prostitutes 
lived in the saltfilled warehouse and in an adjacent row of 
brokendown garbage trucks in manhattan 
this time turso said sanitation workers will be issued cards 
with the telephone number of a runaway hot line to hand out i 
guess the answer to the problem is not to keep chasing them out to 
nowhere but to chase them out to somewhere they can get help he 
said 
atop a garbagestrewn mountain of salt which is used on city 
streets in the winter is a shantytown of mattresses and crates 
where the boys cook eat sleep and play the post said 
the newspaper said some youths stay for weeks or months turso 
maintained that the sanitation department chases away the youths 
and clears out their mattresses whenever a new load of salt is 
delivered most recently three weeks ago 
the newspaper reported that the youths walked in and out of the 
ratinfested warehouse in plain view of sanitation workers said 
turso the sanitation workers job at that location is to report 
and then to go out on assignment its not to be a security 
officer 
asked about the departments police force he said it did not 
have patrols regularly assigned to the warehouse but on the basis 
of the report turso said weve asked the supervisor to take a 
look to see if there are people there and to encourage them to 
leave 
outreach groups estimate that 20000 young people roam the 
streets every year and 80 percent to 90 percent of them live by 
prostitution the paper said

a rare florida mastiff bat the first 
one seen in the state in a decade was found near death on an 
office balcony but has recovered and escaped to the wild a 
biologist said 
wildlife biologist frank mazzotti said however the offspring 
the roundeared brown bat bore on labor day died at birth 
i dont think the death of the baby bat changes the 
significance of what has happened mazzotti said not only is 
the bat still in south florida but you have a reproductive 
population 
mazzotti and fellow bat hunter mark robson had been scouring 
florida since june trying to determine if the species still 
survived in the state they had alerted residents to watch out for 
the bat 
on aug 30 the bat was found by an office worker on the 
tenthfloor balcony of the turbana corp headquarters here 
the worker took it inside and gave it the nickname of pl 
which she declined to explain she called a veterinarian who took 
the bat 
a routine xray friday found the bat was pregnant the bat was 
in shock and dehydrated her blood sugar and body temperature 
extremely low 
pl gave birth to a stillborn baby bat at the home of the 
veterinarian who was nursing her back to health mazzotti said 
the previously silent pl who was scheduled to be released 
monday became vocal and active after the birth and soon wiggled 
out of her cage to freedom 
we can only hope shes ok out there somewhere robson said

cincinnati zoo officials are giving giant 
panda chia chia five days off to see if he can overcome what they 
believe is homesickness 
chia chia went on display friday at the start of a threemonth 
stopover on his move from the london zoo to mexico city but the 
zoo administrators closed the exhibit the same day because the 
panda was staying in his den and acting strangely 
at first we thought it was jet lag but its taken much 
longer than we expected said jo gipps curator of mammals with 
the london zoo who traveled with chia chia homesick is exactly 
the word for whats wrong 
since friday the 290pound panda has emerged periodically from 
his den to eat bamboo for a few minutes then quickly retreated 
from public view when keepers tried to lock the doors to his den 
to keep him in view the panda became agitated pacing rapidly and 
bumping the walls 
hes normally quite extroverted thats why were concerned 
said neil bemment the pandas keeper 
animals are unpredictable were not going to push him said 
edward maruska executive director of the cincinnati zoo he and 
officials from the london zoo decided chia chia needed time alone 
in his new surroundings 
zoo officials will meet thursday to decide if the exhibit can 
reopen friday 
zookeepers built a platform for the panda monday to make him 
feel like he is at his old london zoo home cincinnati zoo 
spokeswoman barbara brady said 
hes getting better hes looking a little better just a 
little lonely ms brady said tuesday 
the delay means about 3400 people with tickets to see chia chia 
this week will have to exchange their tickets or get refunds 
through sunday afternoon 81000 people had bought tickets to see 
the panda before he leaves nov 30 
the 16yearold panda captured in china at the age of 2 
arrived in cincinnati on friday after a sevenhour road trip from 
chicago following a 10hour flight from london 
chia chia is scheduled to become a permanent resident of mexico 
citys chapultepec zoo where it is hoped he will breed the 
mexican zoo has had success with its panda breeding program while

thousands of american investors will lose 
millions of dollars this year in what authorities on tuesday 
branded the fools gold rush of 1988 various swindles 
offering the chance to buy gold at belowmarket prices 
state securities regulators and the council of better business 
bureaus warned in an investor alert that the gold schemes 
represented the fastest growing fraud threat in the country since 
the spring of 1987 they said the number of known gold scams has 
jumped from eight to 52 under investigation currently 
officials said last octobers stock market collapse had created 
a climate allowing the swindles to proliferate 
thousands of individuals fled the markets turning their backs 
on mainstream investments james c meyer director of the 
tennessee division of securities told a news conference the 
result a huge pool of potential cashrich victims ripe for 
exploitation by the promoters of exotic investment swindles 
meyer who is president of the north american securities 
administrators association representing 50 state securities 
offices estimated that tens of thousands of americans nationwide 
would lose 250 million in the bogus gold deals this year 
the typical dirt pile swindle works this way 
a highpressure salesman calls from a boilerroom telephone 
operation offering to sell 100 tons of dirt for 5000 the con 
artist guarantees that the dirt pile will yield at least 20 ounces 
of gold an effective price of 250 an ounce far cheaper than the 
current spot market gold price of 430 an ounce 
the problem is the gold doesnt exist beyond microscopic 
economically unrecoverable levels meyer said he said 
investigators have found that many of the mine sites contain less 
gold than can be found in sea water 
the mine is nothing more than a godforsaken patch of desert 
scrubland he said these deals are a ripoff from the word 
go 
james h mcilhenny president of the council of better business 
bureaus said virtually all the swindlers operated by telephone 
calling people in other states thus avoiding detection by local 
authorities 
these swindlers are skilled they sweet talk you they 
guarantee you big profits in a short time he said their 
victims are from all stations of life from unsophisticated elderly 
persons to professionals who think they understand the risks of 
investing 
in one case officials said 2000 investors were bilked out of 
20 million by a former california furniture salesman selling off a 
new mexico mine site which he claimed would generate almost 100 
million in gold sales per year the salesman was convicted last 
month in a new mexico court of 12 felony counts 
in another case investigators said that a wyoming inmate 
already jailed on a fraud charge used prison telephones to persuade 
investors in minnesota and wyoming to pay an average of 6250 each 
for worthless dirt in an inactive utah mine when he was caught the 
second time prison authorities moved him to solitary confinement 
why people will commit their life savings over the phone when 
they wouldnt think of buying a car or house sight unseen is a 
continuing and troubling mystery to those of us whose job it is to 
promote investor protection meyer said 
officials urged consumers to hang up on highpressure telephone 
sales tactics they said investors also should not be swayed by 
officiallooking mineralcontent analyses known as assays because 
even legitimate testing labs can be duped by a dirt sample that has 
been salted or taken from a different mine site 
they also said investors should beware of vague promises on when 
the gold will be delivered the dirt pile con artists normally 
say delivery will take from one to three years long enough for the 
swindler to fleece the maximum number of investors possible and 
then move on to a new type of investment fraud

decisively to curb narcotics trafficking but andean coca 
production continues to grow as reflected by a bumper crop this 
year the state department reported tuesday 
the departments midyear update on the administrations 
international narcotics control strategy said the januaryjune 
period was characterized by a mix of progress and some frustration

forces against drug traffickers 
the report said the us program to reduce coca production by 50 
per cent in five years is working the strategy calls for a program 
of eradication enforcement development assistance public 
diplomacy and international cooperation 
during the past six months recognition by latin american 
governments of the urgent need to address the andean coca problem 
has grown significantly the report said 
not only is concern addressed in leaders public statements 
but latin american governments have begun to act and act 
decisively with us experts predicting our nations cocaine use 
levels may have peaked there is genuine concern in latin america 
and elsewhere about where new cocaine markets will open as 
traffickers seek outlets for the andes bumber crop 
the report said andean governments are taking steps on their own 
to deal with their narcotics challenges 
while the us continues to play a major role in assisting 
bolivia colombia and peru in eradication and enforcement these 
nations have launched important suppression operations separately 
and together the report said 
it noted that latin american enforcement organizations 
operating together this summer made 1200 arrests and seized a 
substantial amount of illicit drugs proving that regional 
approaches to drug enforcement are more effective than single 
country approaches

many of those injured suffered severe burns the force of the

harbor authorities in the industrial port 10 miles west of

we felt a series of sudden blinding explosions that threw us 
to different parts of the ship said evangelos polychronakis 38 
who was working aboard the tanker at the time of the blast 
as the deck blew up large chunks of metal went hurtling into 
the air i tried to get out from inside one of the tanks i was 
working in and then jumped into the sea he said 
when the explosion occurred i was at the bottom of one of the 
tanks said andreas varisis 27 sea water gushed into the ship 
as it ripped apart and i rose with it inside the tank trying 
deperately to find some way out 
the skipper of the anangel capt anastasios theocharis said 
the vessel had been certified free of gas before it sailed into 
perama for repairs monday 
merchant marine ministry officials said the ship carried 
documents showing all gas had been removed 
i was in the control room at the stern when i heard a 
tremendous noise and everything clattered to the deck theocharis 
said 
harbor authorities identified two of the dead as theodosis 
vorisis and aristides daskalakis fragments of what appeared to be 
five other bodies were also found said a perama police officer who 
demanded anonymity 
people were tossed all over the place there were dismembered 
bodies landing on the deck of another tanker berthed next to this 
one said costas sakaros a metalworkers union official 
the force of the explosion also shattered windows in stores and 
offices around perama

new york will no longer be the only state in 
the nation to prohibit the sale of nonprescription magnifying 
eyeglasses under a bill gov mario cuomo signed into law tuesday 
sponsors said the measure will slash the cost of glasses for 
reading or magnifying objects at close range 
lobbying on the bill which takes effect in 90 days had been 
intense in the legislature with consumer groups and eyeglass 
manufacturers pushing for its approval and some state optometrists 
and opticians advocating its defeat 
both houses of the legislature approved it last month 
obtaining magnifying eyeglasses with a prescription costs 60 to 
120 according to the american association of retired persons 
buying them without a doctors involvement cuts the price to 12 to 
15 said the sponsors state sen joseph bruno and assemblyman 
richard gottfried 
new york became the last state in the country to prohibit 
overthecounter sales of the glasses in june when rhode island 
gov edward diprete legalized sales in his state 
this clearly shows the absurdity of new yorks position and 
why it should change said morton getman a lobbyist on behalf of 
the nations largest manufacturer of magnifying glasses 
magnivision of miami its now 49 to 1 
new york states medical society opposed the measure for years 
but this year said it would go along with the bill after it was 
amended to require that all reading glasses carry a tag advising 
people to get their eyes checked regularly 
jan dorman executive director of the albanybased state 
optometric association said approval of the bill would represent 
bad public health policy 
dorman said magnifying glasses can mask serious medical 
conditions including glaucoma and detached retinas problems that 
health care professionals are trained to detect

testimony about a neardrowning last year 
involving a navy swimming instructor will be allowed in the 
instructors courtmartial for his role in the death of a recruit 
in march a judge ruled tuesday 
petty officer 2nd class michael combe 28 of tempe ariz is 
charged with involuntary manslaughter battery and conspiracy to 
commit battery in the march 2 drowing of airman recruit lee 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
combe is accused of holding mireckis head under water after 
pensacola naval air station instructors forced the panicstricken 
recruit back into a swimming pool when he climbed out and shouted 
he wanted to quit the voluntary training 
opening arguments in the courtmartial were scheduled to begin 
later tuesday in pretrial motions the military judge cmdr 
newell d krogmann rejected a defense motion to bar testimony and 
prohibit the introduction of an accident report about the sept 30 
neardrowning of christopher coccitti a navy reservist from 
jacksonville 
coccitti testified last week in the courtmartial of the former 
officer in charge of the swimming school that he blacked out under 
water while combe had him in a head hold coccitti had been 
participating in the sharks and daisies drill the same 
exercise being conducted when mirecki died 
an attorney for combe robert heath jr argued that coccittis 
testimony was irrelevant because the earlier emergency was 
unrelated to mireckis death 
the lead prosecutor lt cmdr larry wynne contended the 
information is pertinent because it showed combe had a cavalier 
attitude toward students who passed out in the swimming pool 
it was an occurrence known as smurfing because the skin of 
victims would turn blue like that of smurf cartoon characters 
former students have said 
mirecki who had a phobia about being dragged under water 
drowned after suffering a fearinduced heart attack a pathologist 
testified last week in the courtmartial of lt thomas a torchia 
former officer in charge of the navy rescue swimmer school 
torchia 32 of princeton ill was acquitted thursday on both 
of two derelictionofduty charges he is not scheduled to testify 
in combes courtmartial but four other instructors who received 
nonjudicial punishment are listed as defense witnesses 
the prosecution granted them immunity after defense lawyers said 
their testimony was vital to combes case

with the western forest fire season just 
entering its peak month the us forest service has already spent 
190 million battling this summers blazes and may be forced again 
to raid a key reforestation trust fund to pay for the effort 
the agency tapped the same account to help pay last years 
firefighting costs while congress traditionally has bailed out the 
forest service an oregon lawmaker said tuesday the smoke and 
mirrors budgeting could eventually jeopardize the replanting of 
national forest lands that have been logged 
its time the forest service rises above the politics of the 
office of management and the budget in trying to create the 
illusion that the deficit is being held down said democratic 
rep peter a defazio 
defazio said the forest service has known for six months that 
western forest were tinder dry but continued to use a 
shortsighted budget approach that requires congress to step in 
and appropriate additional funds 
they continue to budget in a pennywise and poundfoolish 
way said defazio 
a forest service budget official said no decision has yet been 
made on whether to borrow from the socalled knutsenvanderberg 
trust fund its a possibility said robert gordon an 
assistant director of the agency 
money from the fund comes from fees timber operators pay when 
they log national forests and is earmarked for reforestation 
projects 
traditionally the forest services budget request includes a 
token amount for fighting fires the agency will borrow from a 
trust fund if more money is needed and then ask congress for 
additional funding to repay what was borrowed 
an interior appropriations bill pending in congress includes 
125 million for firefighting and defazio said that most of it will 
be used to repay the trust fund from last years borrowings 
this whole things is incredibly frustrating said defazio 
they the forest service admit its not in their best interest 
but they keep doing it 
last year the forest service spent 265 million to fight fires 
that swept across about 800000 acres in the pacific northwest and 
california most of those blazes were in late august and september

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle says soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is no different from 
previous kremlin leaders and his system of reforms known as 
perestroika is nothing more than refined stalinism 
the indiana senator in an interview published tuesday in the 
washington post said gorbachev is new he has a different 
approach to things and his mannerisms and style are unfortunately 
pleasing to the west unfortunately because i dont think from 
an ideological point of view hes any different from leonid 
brezhnev or anybody else 
quayle said perestroika is nothing more than refined 
stalinism kick their people out and bring your people in thats 
his reorganizing its not changing the system 
gop presidential nominee george bush said last month that he was 
pleased with changes in the soviet union but he cautioned against 
complacency saying wed better not let our guard down 
earlier this summer the vice president had called the soviet 
reforms revolutionary but also said the cold war is not 
over 
quayle described soviet efforts toward glasnost or 
openness as something different that might prove to be a 
positive sign similar to the signing of the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty by president reagan and gorbachev last 
december 
quayle said the true test would be the soviet leaders dealings 
with dissent in eastern europe especially current problems in 
poland 
the bottom line is that gorbachev wants trade and credits from 
the west to help his economy out and we should not give it to 
him in a casual easy way he said 
bush said this summer that some reforms proposed by gorbachev 
would truly if implemented be revolutionary and should the 
reforms be put into practice it would represent historic 
change 
but bush added weve got to remember that the cold war is not 
over we must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change 
but at the same time as one pundit titled his column be prepared 
for the protracted conflict

computers are moving rapidly into american 
classrooms but too many minority and limitedenglish students 
arent reaping the benefits of the new educational technology an 
advisory group said in a report released tuesday 
us schools have acquired nearly 2 million computers during 
this decade said the report by the office of technology 
assessment a nonpartisan agency that advises congress on 
technological matters 
whereas fewer than one school in five had a computer in 1981 
now all but 5 percent of schools have at least one the agency said 
in a 246page report titled power on new tools for teaching and 
learning 
it has been a very important useful investment said report 
director linda roberts when students are using computers 
teachers are trained and the software is appropriate there really 
are advances in learning 
on the downside the report found that the total number of 
computers is equal to one for every 30 students average access is 
one hour a week and it would cost 4 billion to reduce the 
studentcomputer ratio to 31 
in general classrooms today resemble their ancestors of 50 
and 100 years ago much more closely than than they do todays 
assembly plants scientific laboratories and operating rooms it 
said most schools do not have enough computers to make them a 
central tool of instruction 
exacerbating the access problem is the fact that computers tend 
to be concentrated in affluent schools with smaller student bodies 
the report said 
the agency report said black students who generally attend 
larger schools have less computer access than white students and 
students with limited english proficiency have the lowest access 
of all 
other problems cited in the report include inadequate teacher 
training mediocre educational software and the absence of a 
coordinated federal policy limited and shortterm funding erratic 
political support and disorganized research and development efforts 
across agencies 
only onethird of teachers have even 10 hours of computer 
training the agency found and little of it focused on how to 
teach with computers 
and while there are 10000 educational software products 
available ota said their quality could be much better 
economic risks in the marketplace lead software publishers to play 
it safe 
at the current rate of investment roberts said the nation 
can expect continuing experimentation in some schools steady but 
slow improvement in software and spotty access to the technology by 
students 
speeding up the process will require greater efforts by the 
federal state and local governments as well as the private sector 
she said 
on the federal level ota recommended boosting the current 240 
million investment in learning technology research including 
development of software and encouraging school districts to buy 
more hardware and software with money from chapter 1 and chapter 2 
federal programs for disadvantaged students and general education 
spending by states 
the agencys report was requested by the house education and 
labor committee committee chairman augustus hawkins dcalif 
said in comments accompanying the report that increased federal 
support for computers in the schools would be a good public 
policy and a wise investment for the future 
rep matthew martinez dcalif chairman of the panels 
subcommittee on employment opportunities said minority and 
limitedenglish students must be ensured equal access to computers 
access to these technologies is spelled money but the 
schools our minority students attend are often overcrowded and 
underfunded martinez said technology can narrow or widen 
these differences if we do not act the classroom of tomorrow 
may always be left for manana in many of our schools

leonid i brezhnevs friend and law enforcement 
chief nikolai a shchelokov accepted lavish gifts and huge 
bribes then killed himself when his deeds were discovered the 
government charged tuesday 
the allegations about the former interior minister who died in 
disgrace in 1984 came on the second day of the briberycorruption 
trial of yuri m churbanov brezhnevs soninlaw churbanov served 
as shchelokovs top deputy 
the charges included the first official confirmation of rumors 
that the 73yearold shchelokov committed suicide when he felt the 
law closing in 
churbanov and eight former interior ministry officials from the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan are on trial before a soviet 
supreme court military tribunal their highly publicized trial is 
being used to further leader mikhail s gorbachevs drive against 
corruption and cronyism 
the trial also is seen as a further attempt to discredit 
president brezhnev whose 19641982 regime is routinely referred to 
by gorbachev and his top officials as a period of stagnation in the 
soviet union 
a 1500page indictment against the accused charges churbanov 
with accepting the equivalent of 1 million in bribes and its 
passages about shchelokov read aloud by a clerk to a full and 
silent courtroom gave the most detailed account yet of corruption 
in the tops ranks of the brezhnev regime 
recent newspaper reports have said shchelokov the interior 
ministry chief for 16 years lined his pockets with 700000 rubles 
11 million in state funds and lived an extravagant lifestyle 
giving foreign luxury cars to his children and buying furs and 
crystal chandeliers for himself and his family 
he wanted good dry wines the indictment said and some of 
the defendants in the moscow briberycorruption trial allegedly 
obliged him 
six times a year food shipments from uzbekistan arrived at a 
moscow airport and were taken to shchelekovs country home outside 
the capital the indictment said the shipments contained cognac 
tomatoes melons apricots and other fruits and vegetables 
unobtainable in moscow most of the year 
when he received gifts he liked the account said the minister 
who was in charge of the soviet unions uniformed police force 
always politely accepted them and said i thank you 
sometimes however he refused to take things he didnt want 
according to the indictment shchelokov once was taken to a 
factory in uzbekistan the center of the crime ring being exposed 
in the moscow trial and was offered clothes and other products 
made there 
he reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of jewelry 
for his wife on another occasion he received three pearls each 
worth 3300 rubles 5300 the indictment said 
the court documents said boxes of money were left on 
shchelokovs desk one of the nine defendants former uzbek 
interior minister khaidar yakhyaev was quoted in the indictment as 
acknowledging that he gave his moscowbased superior boss 105000 
rubles 170000 and neckties gold jewelry precious stones and 
other valuables 
yakhyaev explained the payments by saying they were necessary to 
win protection in the successful struggle against crime in the 
republic the indictment said of shchelokov yakhyaev said he 
was a capable person a good speaker and an influential man 
shchelokov was one of the closest confidants of brezhnev who 
was communist party chief from 1964 until his death in december 
1982 under his tenure the interior ministry became notorious for 
corruption and he was fired by brezhnevs successor former kgb 
chief yuri v andropov 
the indictment referred to shchelokov and two former uzbek 
police officials and said their involvement in the crimes 
committed was proved in full measure however fearing retribution 
for what they had done they committed suicide in view of this 
the cases against them were abated 
the trial in the neoclassic supreme court building in central 
moscow entered its second day with one defendant absent because of 
a heart ailment 
the judge rejected a defense request to halt the proceedings 
which are giving soviets a rare glimpse into the high living 
enjoyed by some kremlin officials 
two other defendants were treated by a doctor in the courtroom 
and the military tribunals chief judge army maj gen mikhail 
marov called a 50minute recess so yakhyaev who looked haggard 
and dazed could have his blood pressure checked by a doctor clad 
in a white smock 
the principal defendant in the case churbanov who married 
brezhnevs daughter galina could receive the death penalty if 
convicted on charges he accepted more than 1 million in cash 
bribes and gifts as well as regular supplies of wine cognac 
pomegranates grapes and other hardtofind fruit flown to him via 
the soviet airline aeroflot from uzbekistan

tuesday he would be forced to consider other bids

would have the entire amount and gave him until thursday to deliver 
it 
im thoroughly satisfied the 3 million line of credit or its 
equivalent will be there said benton who explained that 
bakkers offer had been raised from 165 million to 172 million

sen david karnes drew boos from the crowd 
and criticism from opponent bob kerrey when he told a crowds at the 
nebraska state fair that we need fewer farmers at this point in 
time 
i was perplexed when i heard all of the booing karnes said 
monday after the first of eight debates between himself and the 
former oneterm democratic governor i obviously dont support 
that statement we should be able to encourage people to look at 
agriculture as an investment 
karnes was speaking about increased agricultural technology when 
he made the remark to a standingroomonly audience of more than 
2000 people he said later that he had misspoken and attributed it 
to the heat of the debate karnes said what he meant by the 
statement was that technology has allowed fewer farmers to do more 
work 
kerrey after the debate called karnes statement a mistake 
in political judgment 
it is to assume again that weve got to have fewer farmers it 
is to believe that there is nothing we can do to provide support 
for the farmers we have now kerrey said 
another karnes slip brought applause and cheers from kerrey 
supporters as the republican rebutted kerreys criticism of a 
diesel fuel tax amendment he sponsored 
mr kerrey once you get to the united states senate youll 
know the importance of putting people on record karnes said 
karnes spokesman brent bahler said of the candidates verbal 
fumbles ill be blunt he is not as articulate as i would like 
him to be 
but people understand senator karnes is not a smooth talker 
like his challenger sometimes his words get jumbled but do we 
want a senator that is a smooth talker or one who knows his stuff 
karnes who was appointed to the senate after the death of 
democrat edward zorinsky is seeking election to his first full 
term

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini sent irans 
prime minister a letter tuesday criticizing him for trying to 
resign and analysts said longsubmerged political differences in 
tehran are coming to the surface 
prime minister hussein musavi attempted to resign monday to 
avoid what he feared would be a noconfidence vote in parliament 
over the postpersian gulf war reconstruction policies he advocates 
musavis resignation was rejected by president ali khamenei 
hours before parliament was due to vote irans official islamic 
republic news agency said in a report monitored from nicosia 
if you decided to resign it would have been better if you had 
at least informed me or other high ranking officials tehran 
radio said quoting khomeinis letter 
at a time when muslims donate their sons to help islam this 
is not the right time for complaining and resigning the letter 
said in a reference to the 1 million casualties suffered in the 
eightyear iraniraq war both sides accepted a unsponsered 
ceasefire on aug 20 
the fact that parliament might exercise its right to reject 
cabinet ministers was not sufficient cause for resigning 
khomeinis letter said 
khomeini adopting a fatherly tone at the end of the letter 
said he liked musavi and suggested they meet soon so he could 
remind the prime minister of the problems iran still faces 
western analysts who specialize in iranian affairs said khomeini 
may have intervened to keep musavis government in office a few 
more months to prevent a rupture right after the ceasefire with 
iraq 
they noted that khomeini rescued musavi from a noconfidence 
vote in the 270seat majlis or parliament four years ago to avoid 
a split while the war was at its height 
word of the resignation offer first surfaced when tehrans 
jomhuri eslami a publication of irans islamic clerics that musavi 
once edited printed his lengthy letter to khamenei 
musavi prime minister since 1981 said his planning and budget 
minister massoud zanjani resigned saturday and that the future of 
his energy construction and trade ministers were in doubt 
musavi said he believed five to eight of his ministers will 
not get the vote of confidence needed for them to continue their 
responsibilities 
he did not identify all eight who comprise more than onethird 
of the 21man cabinet he named july 21 after parliamentary 
elections in april and may 
he acknowledged differences of opinion with regard to domestic 
and international policies but said they must not detract from 
the need for unity in confronting conspiracies 
shavan chubin a genevabased specialist on iranian affairs 
said khomeini if he wants to avoid change at this critical time 
could simply tell the majlis to vote for musavi for now that 
meeting intially set for tuesday was rescheduled for sunday 
chubin said in a telephone interview that the passing of the 
war was bound to reopen old schisms there were bound to be 
difficulties as iran moved into the postwar era 
chubin and other analysts who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said musavi has been at odds over postwar reconstruction and 
economic development with khamenei and hashemi rafsanjani irans 
military commander and powerful parliament speaker the 
portfolios musavi mentioned indicate that the problem lies 
primarily in the economic sector chubin said 
musavi has long advocated greater state control of the economy 
he was opposed by khamenei who has close links with the 
bazaaris the wealthy merchant class and by conservative 
clerics 
that split which has intensified political uncertainty 
sharpened when the fighting stopped irans leaders announced they 
had begun planning the massive task of postwar reconstruction 
including to what extent iran should call in foreign companies to 
help it rebuild 
musavi is not keen on getting involved with foreign companies 
and having iran go into debt chubin said khamenei and 
rafsanjani take a more practical approach

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen foraged for southern votes on tuesday by emphasizing 
education and training to help meet foreign competition and 
chiding republican george bush for a late conversion to the cause 
if we want to retain our position of world leadership america 
must be able to compete for world markets bentsen said we 
must have the besttrained most highly motivated workforce the 
best universities and the best teachers 
and unlike bush bentsen said in a speech at the virginia 
polytechnic institute democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis has been on the education bandwagon from the start 
mike dukakis didnt just suddenly wake up one morning and 
decide he wanted to be the education president bentsen said 
alluding to bushs claim to the description mike dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen have accepted a lifelong commitment to education 
for eight years now weve watched the reaganbush 
administration trash educational opportunity across this country 
bentsen told a rowdy student audience packed into the college 
auditorium 
following the speech bentsen moved outside for a rally before 
several hundred more students including a strongvoiced contingent 
for bush and some carrying signs that read duke buster and 
avoid the lloyd 
bentsen interrupted in his remarks looked at that group and 
said i met george bush once before alluding to his defeat of 
bush in a 1970 texas senate race and i think quayle season is 
starting early this year 
bentsen said college alone does not provide all of the nations 
important education as he started his day visiting a technical 
training center in the atlanta suburb of lawrenceville 
bentsen handled a soldering iron and other tools including a 
microscope to inspect the work afterward he told reporters the 
federal government could do more to provide seed money to 
expand technical training 
the reagan administration has put all kinds of speed bumps in 
the way to achieving education bentsen said a democratic 
administration he said would promote programs such as the one at 
the gwinnett technical institute where he attended the class with 
nine women learning to make electronic circuit boards 
bentsen also said he personally favored a longer school year for 
us children citing figures from europe and japan but he said 
that issue would be decided at the state and local level not by 
the federal government 
polls show the republican ticket leading in both georgia and 
virginia but bentsen said he considered both states within range 
for the democrats especially since they were receiving support 
from locallyelected officials 
rep ed jenkins dga attended the session at gwinnett with 
bentsen and virginia gov gerald baliles and former gov charles 
robb now a senate candidate were awaiting bentsen at the college 
in blacksburg va 
i think well get those democrats who voted for reagan coming 
back to us bentsen told reporters adding that polls backed up 
his statement to the extend we can bring them back were going 
to do it 
dukakis support of gun control laws is one of the obstacles in 
that effort bentsen who usually opposes such measures said he 
had not yet decided whether to support an amendment now before the 
congress 
bentsen said the underlying concept in the amendment of a 
waiting period for handgun purchases was appealing since it would 
provide a cooling off period for people wanting a gun for 
emotional reasons it also would give officials time to determine 
if the purchaser was a criminal he said 
however he said he had not studied how far the amendment 
extended beyond that and was withholding any endorsement 
the texas senator was returning to washington for a vote 
wednesday on a bill to help the textile industry also an 
important issue in the south where many factories have been hurt by 
foreign competition 
bentsen planned to resume campaigning thursday beginning in new 
york and finishing the week in california with a stop in iowa en 
route

many hispanics contend bullfighting is an 
important part of their culture but animal welfare officials said 
tuesday they dont want any repeats of the citys first bloodless 
bullfight 
peter poholik executive director of the citys commission on 
animal care and control said he already has received and will 
reject a request for a permit for another bullfight on sept 18 
he said he was asking the mayor and city council to move as soon as 
possible to specifically ban the bloodless fights 
matadors in the bullfights use the traditional cape to taunt the 
bull but instead of the death in the afternoon immortalized by 
author ernest hemingway the bull is tagged with velcrotipped 
darts aimed at velcro patches glued to his back the coup de grace 
administered with a velcrotipped sword 
its a bullfight where they dont poke any holes in the 
animal poholik said 
nevertheless he believes the fights violate a city ordinance 
that forbids torture tortment or baiting of animals 
the bull is not of a good temperament to begin with and all 
of the teasing gets him really enraged its just another 
example of mans cruelty to animals 
about 1100 people watched as three 1000pound bulls charged 
matadors capes occasionally flipping one of the men in 
bullfights saturday and sunday 
while poholik initially denied bullfight promoters a permit 
cook county circuit judge albert green ordered it granted on 
grounds the confrontations were no more cruel than rodeos which 
the city allows 
what do you do at a rodeo the guy gets on the bull and kicks 
it with his spurs to incite it green said tuesday some people 
consider a bullfight a ballet 
it was beautiful said bella jonas who attended saturdays 
fight nobody even hurt the bull and now they want to stop 
because of cruelty it was just plain art 
all these people they dont want the spanish people to have 
whats theirs said homer alvarado leader of meda a charity 
that helps the poor and received meat from the bulls which were 
slaughtered after the weekend fights staged and promoted by jaass 
productions 
theyre discriminating against us they have a rodeo why 
dont they stop it 
but state rep ben martinez said that as far as im concerned 
im born in this country and its not a sport im interested in 
poholik says that while he is not all that happy about 
rodeo it is a recognized sporting event in the united states and 
as such is allowed 
were trying to limit the long list of animal exploitation 
going on he said how far do we let this cultural tradition 
go in korea they eat dogs in puerto rico cockfighting is 
legal 
bullfighting originated in crete about 2000 bc and was 
popular for centuries among the wealthy until pope pius v 
concerned about numerous deaths threatened to excommunicate 
practitioners in 1567 the ban did not curb the sports popularity 
in spain however and the prohibition was lifted 
it remains popular in spain portugal and latin america the 
bloodless velcro version has been allowed in three other us 
states kansas oklahoma and texas 
poholik said he plans to deny another permit to the bullfight 
promoters alvarado says promoters will appeal that ruling 
chicago mayor eugene sawyer is backing poholiks effort 
i certainly respect the culture and traditions of the hispanic 
community sawyer said in a statement but i also respect the 
feelings of many chicagoans who believe that a bullfight 
constitutes cruelty to animals 
poholik said that despite his effort to prevent future 
bullfights which probably will take at least a month he was 
impressed by the care of the bulls before and after the weekend 
contests 
ill give the people credit for keeping the animals well he 
said they appeared to be in excellent condition

lottery winner remained a mystery tuesday but state officials 
announced one sure victor schoolchildren 
florida puts 35 percent of lottery sales to education which now 
equals 350 million in the lotterys first eight months officials 
said the total is twice as much as earlier projections 
gov bob martinez who opposes the lottery said tuesday the 
state broke 1 billion in sales during last weeks record number of 
ticket purchases which contributed to the worlds largest single 
lottery jackpot 
this recordbreaking pace is exciting both for the players 
and public education in florida martinez said while the 
lottery was never envisioned to meet all the funding needs of 
education its good to know that the games are doing so much to 
enhance our basic school program 
meanwhile lottery officials say they have heard from several 
people who claim to have the winning ticket 
the six winning numbers were picked in a drawing saturday night 
and lottery officials determined by computer the next day that only

a person claiming to represent charles hill a school janitor in 
the panhandle town of bristol called the lottery department on 
tuesday and said hill would come to tallahassee wednesday with the 
winning ticket said lottery secretary rebecca paul 
we have no reason to believe that he does or that he doesnt 
until he comes forward with the actual ticket and it goes through 
our validation process we really dont know mrs paul said 
weve talked to a whole bunch of people who say they have the 
winning ticket she said 
at least three other people have called the department claiming 
to have the winning ticket according to bernard edwards deputy 
secretary of operations mrs paul said one of the callers 
identified himself as a resident of minnesota and another caller 
came from central florida

the soviet union the first country to put a man 
in space has helped make manned space flight routine giving 
officials confidence to televise launches and landings live and 
invite foreigners to climb aboard for a ride 
but like the explosion of the space shuttle challenger 
tuesdays aborted landing of an afghansoviet space crew again 
pointed up the dangers of space flight 
we are already used to everything going smoothly in space 
commentator alexander tikhomirov told millions of soviets in a 
prime time television newscast and some forget about the danger 
which space research entails and here this once more convinces us 
how complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal 
situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit 
the landing abort threatened to strand two cosmonauts in space 
with rapidly diminishing supplies of oxygen and food it came 
during a busy year in the soviet manned space program and at a time 
when the american space shuttle still is grounded because of the 
jan 28 1986 challenger disaster in which all seven crew died 
the most enduring symbol of soviet commitment to manned 
spaceflight has been the orbiting mir space station the research 
complex launched in february 1986 is planned as a permanently 
manned fixture in space 
two cosmonauts have been aboard mir since last dec 21 and plan 
to break the 326day space endurance record set by yuri romanenko 
aboard mir last year in june a sovietbulgarian crew spent 10 
days in space including a visit to mir a sovietfrench crew is to 
blast off nov 21 for a monthlong mission 
whether the problems with the afghansoviet mission will delay 
the sovietfrench flight is not yet clear other scheduled flights 
include a 1990 voyage by an austrian cosmonaut and a malaysian 
cosmonaut later 
soviet officials also have indicated they will launch their own 
space shuttle unmanned by years end they have emphasized the 
shuttle will not be flown manned until it is proven safe 
the soviet space program long veiled in secrecy since it began 
with the oct 4 1957 launch of the first satellite sputnik has 
benefited from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness 
since yuri gagarin blasted off as the first man in space in 
1961 manned launches have become routine 
soviet officials gained confidence to show launches and in some 
cases landings on live television and to invite foreigners to watch 
the blastoffs the first live tv coverage of a soviet manned space 
launch was the apollosoyuz mission in 1975 the first launch to be 
shown live of an allrussian crew was in 1984 
space has also served political purposes for the soviet union 
prior to the afghan mission the soviets had 13 guest 
cosmonauts aboard their spacecraft in flights that serve to show 
off their scientific prowess and promote friendly ties with other 
countries 
soviets have to think back 17 years to find their last fatal 
space disaster 
three cosmonauts docked with the salyut1 space station and 
then during reentry on june 30 1971 air leaked out of their 
capsule and they suffocated

jesse jackson denied on tuesday that he was 
angry that democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis excluded 
him from a meeting with illinois party leaders he said he hoped by 
the end of the week to work out his role in the fall campaign 
jackson in a telephone interview from his home in chicago 
contradicted associates who charecterized him as upset by the 
omission including one who said he was seething 
i just hate for people to be allowed to put words in my mouth 
or give some adjective description of what my emotions are he 
said of the associates who commented only on condition they not be 
named 
he said he spoke by telephone to dukakis campaign vice chairman 
and confidant john sasso monday night and tuesday morning and 
they arranged to meet later this week to discuss jacksons 
participation in the campaign and the relationship and message of 
the campaign to targeted groups such as jacksons constituents 
in the primary season 
asked if he would get a schedule of campaign appearances at this 
meeting the democratic presidential runnerup said i certainly 
hope so 
he said they did not discuss the meeting dukakis held outside 
jacksons home base of chicago on tuesday with state party leaders 
including sen paul simon rep dan rostenkowski and others 
i didnt know anything about it other than the press 
inquiries so i have no comment to make said jackson 
im working im hopeful im registering voters he said 
dukakis state press secretary judy erwin said the tuesday 
meeting was more for state leaders and that jackson was considered 
a national leader 
jackson indicated he is anxious to get under way with his part 
of the fall campaign as he agreed to do just before the democrats 
nominated dukakis at their atlanta convention this summer 
he declined to criticize dukakis despite a series of omissions 
that some jackson supporters have perceived as slights 
if they dont want his help they ought to tell him said one 
top jackson adviser who asked not to be identified by name 
asked about the appearance that dukakis has been slow to involve 
him in the campaign jackson said there are some decisions the 
campaign has to make about how it will employ its volunteers 
including people such as new york gov mario cuomo sen edward 
kennedy of massachusetts and himself 
i assume thats the kind of thing sasso will be doing he 
added 
the plans are incomplete i hope they will be complete soon 
hese areas dealing with campaign direction and priorities still 
have to be worked out i hope before this week is out that all of 
the remaining areas will be resolved and well be on our way 
dukakis campaign spokesman leslie dach denied any attempt to 
slight jackson and said the meeting with sasso this week will 
include discussion of how we can best work together places 
details themes 
he said jackson regularly talks to dukakis and campaign 
officials 
jackson said he wants to talk to dukakis officials about 
involving some of his supporters at the national policy level of 
the campaign and about targeting the democratic message and 
priorities 
the most recently reported tension involved reports that the 
dukakis camp had conducted polling that found jackson had high 
negative ratings in some states where he beat dukakis in the 
primaries and that the dukakis officials had indicated they did not 
want jackson campaigning in those states 
while these reports came from sources close to jackson and the 
national democratic party jackson himself said he had received no 
such direction 
asked if the subject of states he should stay away from was 
discussed in a meeting he had with dukakis campaign chairman paul 
brountas and democratic national committee chairman paul kirk two 
weeks ago jackson said i was not in any such meetings when 
there was discussion over where and what the priority areas ought 
to be 
asked if the information was imparted through aides as one 
source stated he said i dont have anything in writing on 
that 
i dont want to discuss it because i dont know very much 
about it but obvously im free to travel all over the country and 
i will he added 
while some around jackson have described him as annoyed and 
upset at how the dukakis campaign has treated him and his 
constituents jackson publicly continues to tout the dukakis ticket 
in his speeches and refused to make negative comments under 
questioning

our orders were not to kill we were told to hijack the plane 
to force it to land and to state our demands but not to kill he

police came to archbishop 
desmond tutus residence tuesday and seized a tape of a sermon in 
which the clergyman defied a government ban and called for an 
election boycott tutus spokesman said 
meanwhile the countrys largest blackoriented daily newspaper 
said tuesday it will no longer carry government advertisements 
promoting the local elections 
the sowetan in a notice on its front page said it has 
become impossible to justify carrying these advertisements when the 
community we serve is barred from expressing its sentiments on the 
elections 
many blacks oppose participation in any local or regional 
elections until the black majority is allowed to vote in national 
elections 
tutu whose sermon sunday defied the government ban on calls for 
an election boycott had offered to provide police with a 
transcript of his remarks 
however two plainclothes officers came to the anglican 
archbishops official residence outside cape town produced a 
warrant and demanded a recording which tutus press aide john 
allen had made of the sermon 
allen after consulting the churchs legal advisers gave police 
the tape and a statement confirming the contents of the recording 
but allen said he would not be prepared to give evidence if the 
state tried to call him as a witness against tutu 
allen in a telephone interview said police had called in 
advance to say they were coming and did not ask to see tutu who 
was meeting with church members 
in his sermon at st georges cathedral in cape town tutu 
deliberately defied stateofemergency regulations by urging both 
whites and blacks to boycott nationwide municipal elections 
scheduled for oct 26 
a progovernment newspaper the citizen tuesday quoted 
unidentified government sources as saying action against tutu was 
likely it quoted one source as saying failure to act against the 
black archbishop would encourage other people to join in calling 
for a boycott 
violation of the emergency regulations is punishable by up to 10 
years in prison 
the oct 26 elections will mark the first time that voters of 
all races go to the polls on the same day the whitecontrolled 
government is depicting the elections as a major step toward 
democracy and is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on 
advertising to encourage a large turnout 
tutus comments angered cape towns mayor peter muller who 
said they could jeopardize the election prospects of liberal 
candidates 
because of mullers criticism tutu decided not to attend a 
ceremony monday night at which a prominent mixedrace academic dr 
richard van der ross become the first nonwhite to be awarded the 
freedom of the city

hundreds of israeli troops sealed off a west 
bank town tuesday cutting telephone lines arresting more than 150 
palestinians and assembling makeshift army bases in a new tactic 
aimed at crushing the uprising 
underground leaders distributed a leaflet in the occupied 
territories calling on palestinians to attack israeli targets with 
more firebombs and more stones everywhere and anywhere 
a 17yearold palestinian shot in the eye on sunday during 
clashes with troops died of his wounds tuesday relatives said an 
israeli soldier was hurt slightly when he kicked an old pipe that 
contained explosives the army said 
the death brought to 259 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising began dec 8 four israelis have also died 
brig gen gabi ofir a west bank army commander said tuesdays 
predawn raid on qalqilya backed by helicopters was the largest 
army operation in nine months of unrest 
the army imposed a curfew on qalqilya before dawn and soldiers 
moved in through outlying orchards and fields forming a human 
chain around the town of 25000 troops closed all roads leading to 
the city 
soldiers carried lists of suspected stonethrowers and arrested 
more than 150 palestinians the army said 
israel television showed dozens of palestinians their hands 
tied behind their backs sitting in large opensided tents troops 
herded dozens of blindfolded detainees through a major street 
reporters in qalqilya saw dozens of troops patrolling streets 
and three palestinian youths being held in a jeep with their hands 
tied behind them 
singling out qalqilya which lies just inside the west bank and 
only three minutes by car from tel avivs northern suburbs 
appeared to be the armys latest tactic for cracking down on 
activist palestinian towns the move prompted concern among 
palestinians that other villages would be targeted 
west bank commander maj gen amram mitzna said the operation 
was planned for weeks and targeted qalqilya because its residents 
include key instigators of firebomb and stonethrowing attacks on 
jewish settlers and israeli troops 
mitzna told israel radio that the situation had become 
intolerable therefore we decided to act now 
palestinian taxi drivers turned back at army roadblocks reported 
seeing four helicopters flying overhead and dozens of army 
vehicles some pulling mobile homes normally used in makeshift army 
bases 
the witnesses said troops knocked down a wall separating a 
playground and high school and were pitching tents on the grounds 
it is the first time ive seen such activity it is really 
strange and we are worried other villages will be next one arab 
taxi driver told the associated press on condition of anonymity 
an army spokesman said troops discovered stashes of knives 
hatchets and clubs as well as outlawed underground leaflets in 
qalqilya 
in the latest leaflet underground leaders also called for three 
general strikes in two weeks including a strike thursday to mark 
the ninth month of the palestinian uprising 
the leaflet also highlighted a deepening split between moslem 
fundamentalists and uprising leaders who support the palestine 
liberation organization it criticized the fundamentalists for 
declaring alternative strike days and attacking shopkeepers who did 
not comply 
abdel karim mahmoud barud 17 from the gaza strip refugee camp 
rafah who was shot in the eye sunday died tuesday at tel hashomer 
hospital near tel aviv his relatives said 
hospital officials could not be reached for comment the army 
said it had no information on the death 
also tuesday troops shot and wounded four palestinian 
teenagers while confronting stonethrowers in the west bank town 
of nablus and the gaza strips nuseirat refugee camp hospital 
officials said the army said it was checking the report 
near nablus an israeli soldier was treated at the scene for 
minor injuries and returned to his unit after a pipe bomb exploded 
newly released israeli figures indicated the palestinian 
population growth in the gaza strip was fulfilling predictions that 
arabs could outnumber jews in israel and its occupied territories 
by the year 2000 
the figures put the annual population growth in the gaza strip 
at 34 percent in 1986 one of the highest rates in the world this 
compares with an annual population growth of 13 percent inside 
israel

javier perez de cuellar the un 
secretarygeneral asked the permanent security council members 
tuesday to unequivocally accept compulsory jurisdiction of the 
world court 
of the five only britain accepts the courts jurisdiction as 
compulsory 
france china and the soviet union have filed no formal 
declarations of acceptance although that does not bar them from 
appearing before the court 
the united states severely curtailed its acceptance of court 
jurisdiction in 1984 just before nicaragua filed a complaint 
against the reagan administration accusing it of aiding rebels 
fighting the managua government 
perez de cuellar said tuesday widespread acceptance of the 
jurisdiction of the court as compulsory would particularly if 
taken by the permanent members of the security council put to 
maximum use the role of the court as a stabilizing factor in 
international relations 
the un chief spoke at a ceremony celebrating the 75th 
anniversary of the peace palace of which the world court is the 
major tenant the court officially known as the international 
court of justice is the un judicial branch 
dutch queen beatrix premier ruud lubbers and world court 
president josemaria ruda of argentina were among the dignitaries 
attending 
the us government boycotted the last 17 months of nicaraguas 
case against it the court ultimately condemned american support 
for the rebels known as contras and ordered an immediate halt to 
such aid 
in an apparent reference to that us move perez de cuellar 
said other nations have when their interests were at stake 
chosen not to take part in the courts proceedings or to ignore its 
decisions a development that gives rise to considerable concern 
only 49 nations now accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the 
world court which has no enforcement powers and depends on 
voluntary adherence to its rulings by nations not recognizing its 
authority unequivocally

a scandal involving citizens paying thousands 
of dollars to avoid military service has shaken israel where the 
army is considered a sacred institution and most believe their 
nation is surrounded by arab enemies 
the story of israelis paying up to 10000 in bribes to avoid 
serving has been frontpage news and dominated radio broadcasts 
tuesday 
shock waves swept through the idf israeli defense force or 
army following the disclosure that a network of army personnel 
and civilians had been arranging exemptions from military service 
in return for bribes the englishlanguage daily jerusalem post 
said 
renaan gissin the deputy spokesman for the army said the 
scheme that was revealed monday with the arrest of 16 people 
including highranking officers and doctors and touches on the 
very essence of the israeli defense forces the sacred principle 
here is to do military service 
israel is a nation of 41 million residents where both men and 
women are drafted at age 18 and men do reserve service of up to 62 
days a year until age 55 many job advertisements ask that 
applicants to prove they served in the army avoiding service has 
long been a social taboo 
there are virtually no conscientious draft resisters in israel 
and fewer than 300 people have refused service during the last 
decade in controversial military operations in places such as 
lebanon and the occupied territories 
but after the scandal broke monday reports surfaced that about 
60 people had paid thousands of dollars to escape the draft or 
reserve service newspapers reported tuesday that several hundred 
people may be involved 
the army said dozens more arrests are expected 
gissin called the number of people involved unprecedented 
saying this is just the tip of the iceberg the last word has 
not been said 
the scheme which investigators say started in november 
reportedly involved falsified medical statements and tampering with 
army computers to show men excused from reserve duty those 
arrested include two lieutenant colonels two majors and an 
orthopedic surgeon 
defense minister yitzhak rabin described the scheme as an 
aberration but said he would order a full investigation of the 
medical exemption system 
we have to remove this disease from the healthy body of the 
army with all means available he said on israel television 
parallel to that we have to examine our means of supervision in 
the defense system 
politicians of both the right and left went farther urging 
reevaluation of israeli society and saying the values of its 
pioneer days were being lost 
geula cohen of the rightist tehiya party said such corruption is 
rooted in an atmosphere of materialism and abandonment of the 
ideals of national responsibility 
we must all do a selfevaluation about the type of society 
were building here a society where everything can be bought with 
power or money said gad yatsiv of the leftwing mapam party 
the hadashot newspaper editorialized a terrible tragedy has 
befallen the army a mafia has overtaken one of its most sensitive 
nerve centers these actions are as bad as selling secrets to the 
enemy 
the masscirculation daily maariv said this is not just fraud 
but making profit from bloodshed 
gissin said the army view was that the draftdodging scheme 
permeated from corruption in israeli society you cannot open 
the newspaper without seeing such affairs of bribery and fraud 
he said but it is inconceivable to have it in the idf because it 
is a unique institution 
dan horowitz a sociologist at jerusalems hebrew university 
said israel shared like other societies the problem of 
corruption 
but he expressed surprise the scheme had not been uncovered 
sooner because of israelis special attitude to the military 
what amazes me is the number of people involved and nobody 
informed the authorities he said it means there are no more 
taboos in israeli society people dont want to be involved

convicted murderer who escaped from a us prison where he was 
awaiting execution 
police inspector vic hawkins said joseph kindler 27 who beat a 
man to death in philadelphia in 1984 was arrested at work by saint 
john police 
hawkins would not say where kindler worked because the people 
there are terrified 
police said they received a tip monday from a local resident 
that kindler was in the city he was arrested tuesday morning 
without incident and was remanded to the saint john jail at an 
afternoon court appearance 
he will be held in saint john until quebec police take him back 
on an outstanding warrant according to hawkins 
he said kindler was convicted of firstdegree murder in 1984 but 
escaped from a maximumsecurity prison 
in 1986 he was arrested in quebec and was being held for a 
deportation hearing in montreal when he escaped again 
kindler who faces execution in the united states slid down 
bedsheets to get away from his 13thfloor cell in a detention 
centre at quebecs provincial police headquarters in montreal 
he had been living in the area of stjovite quebec before he 
disappeared last spring hawkins said 
he said that in the 1984 murder kindler bludgeoned a man to 
death with a baseball bat 
hawkins said an fbi report stated kindler has been armed with 
a handgun in the past and has stated he will never be taken alive 
it had been reported here that kindler was on the fbis list of 
10 most wanted criminals but fbi spokeswoman melanie mcelhinney 
said in washington that was not correct 
she said kindler was what we call an identification order 
fugitive and that classification is a step below the top 10 
most wanted people 
criminals in that classificiation are considered to be very 
dangerous individuals usually wanted for murder things like that 
very serious crimes she added 
kindler had been the subject in one of the programs of the 
television show americas most wanted

the nations roads killed more than 400 people which is slightly 
lower than the death toll a year ago 
by midnight monday state and local police in the 50 states had 
recorded 422 deaths since the holiday period began at 6 pm local 
time friday 
were making some progress said richard tippie director of 
traffic safety for the national safety council of chicago during 
the 1987 labor day weekend authorities reported 453 traffic deaths 
nationwide 
tippie attributed the lower figures to fewer travelers and 
greater safety awareness 
people are cutting back and not taking as many trips as they 
used to take and when they do they buckle up or make sure not to 
drink and drive he said 
california the most populous state had the highest number of 
traffic fatalities at 45 followed by texas with 30 and florida at 
27 
delaware north dakota rhode island and south dakota each 
reported no fatal accidents 
the council had estimated that 420 to 520 people could lose 
their lives in highway accidents during the holiday period 
safetycouncil statisticians say 410 traffic deaths could be 
expected during a nonholiday threeday weekend at this time of 
the year 
the highest toll for the labor day holiday was logged in 1968

the nations three mightiest rivers 
began receding tuesday but the most urgent problem grew how to 
provide food shelter and clean water to at least 21 million 
homeless people and prevent an epidemic 
this is the worst flood in the history of bangladesh 
president hussain mohammed ershad said to about 300 men women and 
children huddled in front of him on a narrow embankment surrounded 
by brown water 
a soldier doled out scoops of uncooked rice and ershad told the 
people more food would be found 
floods have submerged threefourths of the country in the past 
10 days and 12 smaller rivers were reported still rising tuesday 
although the ganges brahmaputra and meghna receded the flooding 
began in june with the monsoon season then abated and resumed last 
month 
at least 412 people have been killed since june according to 
government figures but that number is considered too low daily 
death reports in dhaka newspapers including 32 people who drowned 
when a ferry sank in the pabna district 75 miles west of the 
capital put the total at 1154 
illness from floodpolluted water is increasing the government 
health control center reported 10000 new cases of diarrhea 
tuesday bringing the total to 102000 and said 79 people had died 
of it those totals include only cases in areas that still can 
communicate with dacca 
information minister mahbubur rahman said sunday that 21 million 
people were homeless 
the united states has committed nearly 36 million to 
bangladesh flood relief the us agency for international 
development said tuesdaydisaster management experts will be sent 
to dhaka to help assess the situation and advise on further 
assistance the agency said 
ataul karim ambassador to the united states said tuesday in an 
interview with cbs its totally unprecedented its an 
aberration of nature in 24 hours the whole country went under 
water there is hardly any high ground anywhere he said 28 
million people were homeless 
bangladesh is a region of deltas for rivers that rush down from 
the himalayas during the annual monsoon rains erling dessau head 
of the un development program said there should not be 110 
million people living here i think nature should have been left to 
itself 
the government says it is too early to assess total damage or 
how much money will be needed for food supplies and reconstruction 
ershad said during a tour of flooded areas by helicopter and motor 
launch however that the cost of restoring roads and rail lines 
alone will be 156 million 
he and other government officials have said bangladesh needs 3 
million tons of grain from abroad we will have to feed the 
people for two months at least ershad said in a brief chat with 
reporters during the tour tuesday 
floods came at the worst time for food production in bangladesh 
which was east pakistan until 1971 it became independent after a 
civil war in which india supported the rebels half its annual 
production of 165 million tons of rice was in the ground when rice 
paddies across the country were inundated 
bangladesh has three ricegrowing seasons each year but the 
current one normally produces the most and the projected yield had 
been 8 million tons the government says at least 2 million tons 
will be lost 
an old farmer who approached ershad during a stop at bailtali 
55 miles southwest of dhaka said we may save part of the crop 
if the water is gone soon but if the water stays more than seven 
days it is all lost 
government warehouses held about 13 million tons of rice when 
the floods began a military officer familiar with the storage 
facilities said water had seeped into many warehouses but the 
extent of damage was not known 
when a helicopter following ershads flew over a rice warehouse 
at takerhat 75 miles southwest of dhaka water covered the four 
long sheds up to their roofs 
it was evident water was draining from some areas bright green 
blades of rice plants poked above the surface in paddies that had 
been submerged 24 hours earlier 
at rajbari a town of 50000 people 45 miles west of dhaka men 
and women stood in chestdeep water as ershad arrived in a motor 
launch 
rice paddies on the edge of town were under even deeper water a 
boatman used his bamboo pole to measure the depth and it showed 
about 8 feet 
three miles away 2000 people took refuge on a road embankment 
when their villages were flooded 
shamsul haq a 35yearold weaver from bagmara a village half a 
mile away said he built a raft of bamboo poles to take his wife 
and two children to the embankment 
he said his mud and straw house was under water but he would 
rebuild it he said the loom with which he earns his living also 
was under water but it would dry 
haq said he had nowhere else to go even though his house also

the dukakisbentsen campaign on tuesday 
gave a preview of of a television ad touting the democrats efforts 
to win a plant closing notification law 
tom cosgrove texas campaign director for the presidential 
ticket of michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen said the democrats 
commercial reflects an emphasis on the future of the economy in 
this country 
the commercial which starts airing wednesday in dallas houston 
and san antonio said that bentsen won the fight in the senate 
as sponsor of the law requiring 60 days notice of a plant closing 
a fact sheet handed out at the screening said gop vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle an indiana senator had opposed 
the plant closing notification bill 
president reagan first vetoed a trade bill that contained the 
measure then allowed a separate bill to become law without his 
signature the democrats said vice president george bush also 
opposed the legislation 
charlie black a senior adviser to the national gop presidential 
campaign and texasspecific consultant said the plantclosing 
law is a phony issue 
plant closing is a way of them continuing to duck the issues 
because they havent presented anything about the economy that 
would give people any hope that they could improve on the reagan 
performance or the future bush performance black said

the drug enforcement administrations chief 
administrative law judge tuesday recommended legalizing marijuana 
as a prescription drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis and 
nausea suffered by cancer patients in chemotherapy 
the judge francis l young found that marijuana in its 
natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active 
substances known to man 
by any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely 
used within a supervised routine of medical care young said in a 
68page set of recommendations and findings 
the judge realizes that strong emotions are aroused on both 
sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana he said 
nonetheless it is essential for this agency and its 
administrator calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of 
record correctly to apply the law and act accordingly 
the recommendation is not binding on the deas administrator 
john lawn who must make a final decision on whether to place 
marijuana on schedule ii the list of drugs that can be given to 
patients with a doctors prescription 
young rejected as specious the argument that medicinal use 
of marijuana would encourage its use as a recreational drug 
the fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to 
override the legitimate need amply demonstrated in this record of 
countless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when 
prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case 
marijuana can be harmful young said marijuana is abused 
but the same is true of dozens of drugs or substances which are 
listed in schedule ii so that they can be employed in treatment by 
physicians in proper cases despite their abuse potential 
kevin zeese an attorney for the national organization for the 
reform of marijuana laws which has sued to have marijuana placed 
on schedule ii called the decision a very important step in the 
process 
while it is not binding we hope that the dea will look at it 
fresh and take the facts and reach a sensible conclusion zeese 
said 
the decision by lawn or his successor will be reviewed by the 
us circuit court of appeals here which in 1980 ordered dea to 
conduct hearings 
the appellate court which had twice previously remanded the 
issue to dea has been critical of the agencys handling of the 
16yearold case zeese said 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty said lawn wont have any 
comment until he has had a chance to look at youngs report 
dougherty said both sides have 20 days to file exceptions to 
youngs findings before making a final decision on the case lawn 
could opt to hold additional hearings he said 
young cited the testimony of doctors and patients during 11 days 
of hearings as evidence to conclude that marijuana is a medically 
accepted treatment for multiple sclerosis hyperparathyroidism and 
the nausea suffered by some cancer patients who undergo 
chemotherapy 
young found that marijuana cigarettes were more effective at 
controlling nausea than capsules containing synthetic 
tetrahydrocannabinol or thc the chemically active ingredient of 
cannabis 
when smoked natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes 
effect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested 
and must be processed through the digestive system before it takes 
effect young said 
the opinion also cited efforts by several states including new 
mexico louisiana and georgia to experiment with marijuana as 
medicine 
between 1979 and 1986 patients in at least 10 new mexico 
hospitals smoked marijuana cigarettes supplied by the federal 
government under an experimental state program that showed it was 
highly effective in controlling nausea he said 
louisianas effort to make marijuana available to cancer 
patients was frustrated by federal insistence that doctors use the 
drug only in a research program young said 
the administrative law judge made no recommendation for 
marijuanas use to treat glaucoma saying the petitioners had 
failed to produce sufficient evidence that a respectable minority 
of physicians supported their view that marijuana is an effective 
treatment for glaucoma a disease that attacks the optic nerve and 
eventually causes blindness 
but young noted that two highly qualified and experienced 
ophthalmologists have accepted marijuana as a drug to treat 
glaucoma he also noted that there are only a limited number of 
drugs available to treat the disease and all produce side effects 
many of them serious 
the placement of marijuana on schedule ii wouldnt automatically 
make it available as a prescription drug young noted that state 
and federal agencies such as the food and drug administration 
would have to pass further judgment 
marijuana is currently a schedule i drug along with heroin pcp 
and lsd its possession carries federal and state criminal 
penalties 
under federal law simple possession of small amounts of 
marijuana carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a 5000 
fine the law carries stiffer penalties for possession of larger 
quantities where prosecutors can prove there was an intent to sell 
the drug

the government said tuesday the promised 
round table talks with workers will begin this month but gave 
no indication it would grant the main demand legalizing solidarity 
government spokesman jerzy urban said supporters of the outlawed 
free trade union movement should join existing official unions and 
try to reshape them from within the official union federation 
called opzz said it would oppose allowing new unions into plants 
where it is established 
solidarity founder lech walesa who persuaded workers to stop 
striking in return for the negotiations declared let them 
talk but also said such statements could destroy the round 
table 
an opzz resolution said premier zbigniew messners government 
should resign its leaders have said government officials should be 
held personally accountable for economic problems that led to a 
nationwide wave of strikes last month 
numerous signs in the official press and in speeches at a party 
conference last month have pointed to changes in the government at 
the next parliament session which is expected this month such a 
shakeup would not affect the communist party leadership which 
holds the real power 
urban said at his first news conference since the strikes ended 
saturday that talks with walesa and other worker delegates will 
start this month and include several dozen people 
he said the government wants the meetings to begin as soon as 
possible after preparatory work is finished but also said they 
will be canceled automatically if any more political strikes 
occur 
talks will cover speeding economic reform reaching a national 
consensus for reform improving living standards and democratizing 
poland he said 
walesa talked supporters into ending the strikes last week after 
getting a commitment from interior minister czeslaw kiszczak for 
negotiations whose topics would include solidarity 
the first independent trade union in the soviet bloc was born in 
the labor turmoil of 1980 at the lenin shipyard in gdansk where 
walesa works as an electrician gen wojciech jaruzelskis 
government imposed martial law in december 1981 to suppress 
solidarity and outlawed it the next year 
asked about solidaritys demand for a return to legal status 
urban said that allowing two trade unions in one plant was 
unacceptable 
if followers of some tendency connected in the past with 
solidarity are a majority in a given plant then they can either 
join the official trade union outnumbering it and directing it 
where they wish or form a coalition a compromise body with the 
official union 
the existing legal rules offer a broad scope of 
possibilities he said and solidarity activists made a 
historical mistake in boycotting the new government unions 
created in 1982 after solidarity was outlawed 
urban said a prosolidarity union could be formed in a plant 
where no union existed but would not be permitted to use the name 
solidarity in the present legal situation 
reached at home in gdansk after urbans news conference walesa 
said let them talk but they should remember that they could 
destroy the round table by such irresponsible statements this is 
all i can say 
solidarity activists say they want their own union not 
membership in the unions established by the government under 
martial law

vice president george bush declaring 
republicans have provided good jobs at good wages was angrily 
booed and jeered tuesday by hardhat shipyard workers chanting 
union buster union buster and go home george 
bush encountered the hostile reaction from boilermakers 
pipefitters laborers and electricians during a speech at the 
northwest marine iron works 
trying to win votes in a state where he acknowledged he trailed 
democratic rival michael dukakis bush said do not gamble on 
another liberal democrat coming out of nowhere 
he told the crowd of several hundred dont listen to all this 
dukakis stuff theyre on the ropes and theyve got to make all 
this noise 
bush appeared to have a smattering of support in the audience 
and was able to win a few cheers when he said he supported the 
death penalty for drug kingpins and for criminals who kill police 
officers 
the workers also applauded when bush declared his opposition to 
furlough programs for prison inmates 
however the audience was largely unfriendly one prominent sign 
read union busting scabloving bush several people shouted 
obscenities at bush during his speech 
the vice president said the reagan administration had brought 
the prime interest rate down from 21 percent and had slashed 
inflation he said were making progress for the working man and 
women in this country 
he pledged anew never to raise taxes drawing some applause 
and urged the crowd to get that same pledge out of the 
democrats 
opening a twostate swing taking him later to everett in 
washington another state where bush said he was trailing he said 
his goal was to provide a good job at a good wage for everyone who 
wanted one 
good jobs at good wages is a main dukakis campaign theme 
when bush credited the reagan administration with providing 18 
million new jobs over the past six years the audience booed 
i know the truth sometimes hurts bush said 
at times he appeared combative and did not flinch from the 
heated encounter when tensions seemed high at one point bush said 
little drama and pulled out a 1950 union card showing that he 
was a duespaying member of the steelworkers then 
the democrats are trying to mislead you predicting gloom and 
doom bush said 
its quite simple the other party wont get elected unless 
things get worse and things arent going to get worse unless they 
get elected 
bush said dukakis was looking for problems in americas 
newfound american strength the ice president also said of 
dukakis its all a mistake hell tell you quick before its 
too late wed better get serious hell tell you and return to 
the policies of jimmy carter 
we just cannot go back and lose the progress that weve made 
in this country 
after his speech bush bought a sandwich from a lunch truck and 
ate it during a meeting with some of the workers one of them 
challenged him to explain why his wages have gone from 1336 to 
950 per hour during the reagan administration 
youre going through a competitive change bush said 
referring to the foreign challenge to us shipyards 
over lunch bush appeared unperturbed by the crowds reaction 
all i need is 51 percent of the vote he said 
dukakis en route from a campaign appearance in chicago to 
boston said bushs comments reflected an inability to comprehend 
the needs of the average american 
george bush made it clear today that he really does not 
understand the hopes and dreams and aspiration of millions and 
millions of american workers across this country dukakis said 
thats not an adequate answer to american workers 
later in the day bush got a decidedly different welcome from an 
audience at a nonunion manufacturing plant in washington 
a crowd of about 500 people at the fluke manufacturing co 
which specializes in electronic instruments gave the vice 
president a warm polite reception as he spoke about jobs and the 
economy 
incomes are rising unemployment is falling and ill tell ya 
things are on the move in this country he said 
some dont want us to believe that things are getting better 
in this country the vice president said my opponent is one of 
them frankly 
bush and his staff said they were not upset by the reception 
earlier in portland 
youre talking to people youve got to convert i think we 
converted a few said craig fuller bushs chief of staff 
for his part bush told the lunchroom crowd of workers earlier 
you dont let them rattle you its like being a baseball player 
when youre out there 3and2 the bases loaded two runs behind 
and somebody begins yelling out you cant stop concentrating on 
what youre doing 
in everett bush used an interview with newspaper and broadcast 
correspondents to urge both side in the race not to disrupt the 
campaign 
id like to use this forum right here to appeal to my 
supporters and his to at least let people speak without harassing 
but when it happens you dont need to get all uptight about it and 
act like youre being put upon because this is the way it works at 
this level of politics bush said 
on air force two carrying him to portland from los angeles 
bush accused dukakis of running a negative campaign 
he has to tear down he has to make everything negative to be 
elected i dont have to be responding to him 
bush said dukakis contention tuesday that the reagan 
administration has been antiunion was a stupid charge 
even though polls show that bush has largely erased dukakis 
oncelarge lead bush said im campaigning as the underdog 
being even is like being the underdog as far as im concerned 
bush was next flying to louisville ky to make a speech 
wednesday before the american legion

un secretarygeneral javier perez de

visit south africa the united nations said tuesday 
a mutually convenient time for the visit is being discussed 
said un spokeswoman nadia younes when the visit materializes 
the secretarygeneral will use the opportunity to visit certain 
other countries in the region 
botha extended the invitation aug 1 
the un security council frequently condemns south africa 
because of its system of apartheid under which the nations 5 
million whites control the country and the 26 million blacks have 
no vote in national affairs 
the announcement comes as south africa is discussing plans for 
withdrawal from neighboring southwest africa also known as 
namibia in conjunction with cubas withdrawing its troops from 
angola

where they had been supporting the guerrillas of the national union

south africa has said it will withdraw its troops from namibia 
on nov 1 as a first step of a security council plan for namibias 
independence

cubans leave angola as quickly as south africa withdraws from 
namibia 
a new round of peace talks among south africa cuba angola and 
us mediators is to be held this week in brazzaville congo

antiabortion demonstrators disrupted a 
speech tuesday by democrat michael dukakis to polishamerican 
supporters some of whom physically ejected a few of the protesters 
in a melee of pushing and shoving 
some punches were thrown but police said there were no arrests 
in the incident the most serious in a series of antiabortion 
protests at appearances by the democratic presidential nominee in 
recent weeks 
dukakis after the interruption at the start of his speech at a 
banquet hall in this chicago suburb delivered his prepared remarks 
in which he emphasized economic themes and said his republican 
rivals love to blame american workers first 
he ridiculed republican presidential nominee george bush for 
saying last fall that detroit automakers could use the abilities of 
soviet tank mechanics 
he said the american auto industry could use a few good 
mechanics from the soviet union who could teach our workers 
something about quality dukakis said do you really believe we 
in america have anything to learn from a society where workers have 
no rights consumers have no choices and even mr gorbachev admits 
their economy is a shambles 
those republicans in washington love to blame american workers 
first he said 
last fall during a trip to europe bush said hed been told in 
a meeting of nato ministers that 350 soviet tanks had completed 
maneuvers without a breakdown 
hey when the mechanics who keep those tanks running run out 
of work in the soviet union send them to detroit because we could 
use that kind of ability bush said at the time later he 
apologized to us autoworkers adding hey give me a break i 
didnt mean anything by it 
following his appearance dukakis told reporters that protests 
such as the one he faced were to be expected 
its a democracy and those of us in public life know from time 
to time that there are going to be people who may tend to be a 
little loud and disruptive he said 
i just hope as the campaign goes on we can address the real 
issues that face the campaign and that face the country and do so 
in a way thats respectful of each other 
dukakis repeated his position that he opposes abortion but that 
in the last analysis its up to the woman in the exercise of her 
own conscience and religious beliefs to make that decision 
dukakis ran into trouble of a different sort when he tried to 
leave illinois for a campaign event in columbus ohio federal 
aviation administration officials pulled a surprise safety 
inspection of his chartered presidential airways boeing 737 
grounding him in chicago 
he canceled the columbus appearance and flew back to boston on 
his backup plane accompanied by as many news people as the plane 
could hold 
after landing in boston dukakis told reporters that the timing 
of the faas spot inspection was very curious but declined to 
comment further 
campaign spokesman dayton duncan said the inspection could have 
been performed overnight not 15 minutes before we were supposed 
to leave later he added were looking forward to the moment 
in january when he gets to name the faa administrator 
stan rivers acting administrator for the faa regional office in 
chicago said its not a new policy it goes on in every 
campaign 
during the speech disruption earlier dukakis told the 
protesters i respect your right to disagree with me thats what 
a democracy is all about i would hope you would respect my 
right to speak 
when the demonstrators refused to quiet down a half dozen or so 
were forced out of the crowd of some 1000 people in the back of 
the room protesters and others in the crowd scuffled several 
punches were thrown at the protesters 
the people who evicted the protesters did not appear to be 
security personnel and campaign spokeman dayton duncan said they 
were not campaign workers secret service agents protecting dukakis 
did not move toward the protests 
just as dukakis was about to begin the protesters had shouted 
what about abortion the crowd tried to drown them out by 
chanting we want mike as dukakis tried to proceed other 
protesters shouted youre a baby killer 
one protester richard freeman 46 of chicago said members of 
several area antiabortion groups met a week ago to plan protests 
of any dukakis events if dukakis is within 300 miles of a 
prolife activist theyre going to go out and greet him he said 
joseph m scheidler executive director of the prolife action 
league said the group obtained tickets to the event from the 
democrats and we decided we were going to inject the issue of 
abortion whenever it seemed relevant 
one spectator obviously upset by the demonstators marion reis 
said he opposes abortion and has donated money to prolife groups 
he said he would make no further donations adding i think 
theyre full of hate not full of love 
there seemed to be only a handful of protesters inside the hall 
and perhaps 20 or 30 outside 
one day earlier more than 100 demonstrators chanted as dukakis 
met outdoors with residents of a south philadelphia neighborhood 
other groups of similar protesters have shown up to heckle him but 
previously had not delayed him from speaking 
on tuesday dukakis also met in private with illinois democratic 
leaders not including jesse jackson who was said to be upset about 
that omission 
dukakis state press secretary judy erwin said jackson was not 
included in the meetings because he is regarded as a national 
leader and tuesdays meetings were to focus on the illinois state 
campaign 
in niles dukakis paid tribute to the polish trade movement 
solidarity and its leader lech walesa saying the polish 
government must engage in a productive dialogue with the union 
solidarity must be recognized dukakis said 
dukakis repeated his economic themes that contend the american 
middle class has been caught in an economic squeeze with declining 
buying power and stagnant wages during the reagan administration

yes it comes down to this after eight hard years of

lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own

reagan said the democrats were promoting a hit list of 
cancellations and delays for the mx missile the b1 bomber the 
trident submarine missile and two proposed carrier battle groups 
for the navy 
to that theyve added nearly every major new weapons system to 
become prominent on the scene since the last liberal administration 
went to its reward including the midgetman missile the stealth 
bomber and our strategic defense initiative he said

been parked here since last night and surely if our plane needed 
to be inspected it would have been convenient for us to have it 
done last night not 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave 
after landing in boston dukakis told reporters that the timing 
of the faas spot inspection was very curious but declined to 
comment further 
stan rivers acting administrator for the faa regional office 
based in chicago said its not a new policy it goes on in 
every campaign 
meanwhile agreement appeared set for three debates this fall 
two between the presidential candidates and one between the vice 
presidential nominees 
agreement still had not been reached on timing and format said 
dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas after a telephone 
conversation with bush campaign chairman james a baker iii 
brountas said he and baker would talk again wednesday 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen ran into some 
partisan heckling from bush supporters at virginia polytechnic 
institute 
the hecklers confronted bentsen at an outdoor rally at the 
college after the texas senator delivered an education speech they 
carried signs that read duke buster and avoid the lloyd 
at the portland shipyard bush was booed when he said 18 million 
new jobs were created during the past six years of the reagan 
administration i know the truth sometimes hurts he said 
the crowd chanted union buster but bush contined to speak 
in a loud voice telling the workers the democrats are trying to 
mislead you things arent going to get worse unless they get 
elected 
many of the workers carried antibush signs that accused him of 
being antiunion one read union busting scabloving bush 
later in the day bush got a decidedly different welcome from an 
audience at a nonunion manufacturing plant in everett wash 
a crowd of about 500 people at the fluke manufacturing co 
which specializes in electronic instruments gave the vice 
president a warm polite reception as he spoke about jobs and the 
economy 
dukakis was speaking to a polishamerican audience when 
protesters shouted what about abortion the crowd tried to 
drown them out by chanting we want mike as dukakis tried to 
proceed other protesters shouted youre a baby killer 
i respect your right to disagree with me said dukakis 
thats what a democracy is all about i would hope you would 
respect my right to speak 
when the demonstrators refused to quiet down a half dozen or so 
were forced out of the crowd of some 1000 people in the back of 
the room people scuffled and several punches were thrown 
dukakis repeated his position that he opposes abortion but that 
in the last analysis its up to the woman in the exercise of her 
own conscience and religious beliefs to make that decision 
he said a woman who has an abortion should not be branded a 
criminal for making that decision 
the dukakis campaign was beginning its first nationwide 
advertising with a new television ad beginning tuesday night or 
wednesday said duncan the dukakis spokesman duncan said he 
didnt know how much was spent on ads 
the new era ad includes footage of dukakis at the democratic 
convention and cites his record as governor of massachusetts it 
has aired previously in california and texas 
another set of ads sponsored by the democratic national 
committee will begin airing wenesday or thursday hammering at the 
theme that america cannot afford four more years of a republican 
administration and stressing the dukakis campaign theme of 
extending economic prosperity to the middle class the campaign 
also is beginning an advertisement in texas on plantclosing 
legislation

dictator josef stalin went unattended by doctors 
for at least 14 hours after he suffered a fatal stroke in 1953 
because his security chief refused to let anyone summon physicians 
according to an estonian newspaper 
sovietskaya estonia said in an edition that arrived in moscow 
tuesday that stalins bodyguards found him incapacitated on the 
floor of his country residence but lavrenti beria insisted stalin 
was sleeping 
no one dared contradict beria and stalin was left unattended 
until the next day the newspaper reported in its sunday edition 
beria became head of the secret police in 1938 and carried out 
bloody purges during the stalin era 
the newspaper said its report was based partly on an account 
recently given to it by a retired security officer a t rykov 
who claimed he was present at stalins dacha or country home when 
stalin died 
stalin had ruled since 1924 little official information was 
given about his death in march 1953 and his final days have been a 
mystery to historians 
sovietskaya estonia gave this version 
stalin probably died several days before march 5 1953 the day 
his death was announced and that given officially as the date of 
death 
stalin died at his dacha and not in the kremlin as official 
reports said 
an autopsy showed stalin suffered a series of small strokes in 
his final years that affected parts of the brain responsible for 
psychotic activities 
it took more than six months to embalm and preserve the body 
before it was put on public display 
the newspaper said rykov who retired as a major served as a 
guard at stalins dacha and recently entered the papers editorial 
department and offered to tell his story 
he could talk for hours about the leader of the people 
saving every little fact in his memory the report said 
it quoted rykov was as saying stalin went to bed at 4 am on 
march 1 1953 after guests had left 
in the afternoon guards noticed there was no movement in 
stalins study or other rooms but at 630 pm a light was turned 
on in the study and in the hall rykov said according to the 
newspaper 
it quoted him as saying no one summoned the guards who became 
concerned when one went in to deliver a letter stalin was lying on 
the carpet in the dining room having obvious difficulties in 
saying anything other guards came into the room and carried stalin 
into the largest hall it could be seen that he was cold and he 
probably was on the floor three to four hours without any help 
the account said beria and georgi m malenkov a close aide who 
briefly succeeded stalin as top leader arrived at 3 am on march 
2 after beria telephoned instructions that no one was to say 
anything about stalins condition 
after seeing the unconscious leader beria insisted the guards 
had panicked and that stalin was simply sleeping according to 
the report 
doctors finally were summoned apparently by nikita s 
khrushchev who won a power struggle to become communist party chief 
later in 1953 and they arrived between 9 am and 10 am 
the doctors were so nervous they could not even take off 
stalins shirt rykov was quoted as saying it had to be cut 
through with scissors the diagnosis was brain hemorrhage 
treatment was attempted but it was not surgical what surgeon 
could take responsibility for stalins life especially when beria 
frightened everybody asking whether they could guarantee that 
stalins life could be preserved 
beria was arrested in july 1953 and charged with conspiracy 
against the state after a secret trial he and six alleged 
accomplices where shot in december 1953 
the newspaper article described the evening of march 5 1953 
when ss debov who had embalmed the body of soviet founder 
vladimir lenin was summoned 
one of stalins cars took debov to stalins postmortem 
examination which showed some irreversible changes localized in 
parts of the brain responsible for psychotic activities which were 
caused by a number of small hemorrhages rykov said 
stalins funeral was held on march 9 and the body carried to the 
tomb the mausoleum was closed for more than eight months for a 
more permanent embalming procedure 
on nov 17 1953 the mausoleum was opened for the people with 
lenin and stalin lying together the newspaper said 
it reported the identical coffins remained side by side until 
825 pm on oct 31 1961 when soldiers took stalins remains to 
a plain gravesite nearby but outside the kremlin wall 
khrushchev had begun his campaign against what he called the 
cult of stalin

foreign ministers of nations that profess 
nonalignment welcomed the worlds improved political climate but 
were less optimistic tuesday about its economic prospects 
the international crisis still persists and a number of 
economic and financial problems remain unresolved with prospects of 
progress gloomy spokesman nicos agathocleous said 
a draft statement on the international economy will be presented 
for approval to the fourday ministers conference which president 
george vassiliou of cyprus will open wednesday 
agathocleous said the draft statement emphasized that though 
there are political developments particularly between the two 
superpowers offering new possibilities of strengthening 
international cooperation regrettably the same is not true about 
the world economic situation 
a copy obtained by the associated press deals in detail with 30 
issues ranging from establishment of a new economic order to 
foreign debt world hunger relations between rich and poor nations 
and global economic cooperation 
the draft expresses profound concern about lack of progress 
on almost all issues covered 
it says problems in the world economy and links between nations 
make it all the more urgent that both the developed and the 
developing countries engage in construtive dialogue 
this should be aimed at finding common solutions to the 
problems currently confronting the international economy including 
the reform of the international monetary financial and trading 
systems in the interest of both the developed and the developing 
countries the draft declares 
another committee is considering a statement on 39 international 
political issues with emphasis on the palestinian and south 
african problems 
agathocleous said the 60page political document prepared by 
cyprus as the host country is much shorter than drafts submitted 
to previous conferences delegations from 92 out of nonaligned 
movements 101 members are to attend the fourday meting including 
70 foreign ministers 
the palestine liberation organization which seeks to turn 
sympathy for the 9monthold palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied lands to its political advantage is expected to 
win wide support and possibly financial backing 
that would give a significant boost to plo chairman yasser 
arafats effort to form a provisional government for an independent 
palestinian state

president reagan accused the democratic 
white house ticket tuesday of harboring a disneyland defense 
policy that would strip the nation of its military strength and 
threaten the advances he has made in arms control 
acting as george bushs chief surrogate on the campaign trail 
reagan used some of his harshest rhetoric in weeks to lambast the 
vice presidents opponents in an address to the 70th national 
convention of the american legion 
the president entered the postlabor day election fray during a 
stop en route to washington following a threeweek california 
vacation 
reagan never mentioned democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis by name but he made clear he thinks the massachusetts 
governor embodies the liberal ideology of decline and retreat 
and leads a party that has shown remarkable passivity and 
unbelievable indecision in defense matters while it controlled 
the white house 
in doing so the president attempted to paint dukakis as 
inexperienced in world and military affairs while hoping to woo 
into bushs corner those conservative democrats who twice had voted 
for his own peace through strength stand 
using a comicbook analogy to make his point reagan quipped 
when it comes to defense the liberal agenda hides behind heroic 
rhetoric but this liberal agenda is no superman its no clark 
kent its jimmy olson trying to impress his date 
he charged the democrats with promoting a hit list of 
cancellations and delays for the mx missile the b1 bomber the 
trident submarine missile and two proposed carrier battle groups 
for the navy 
to that theyve added nearly every major new weapons system to 
become prominent on the scene since the last liberal administration 
went to its reward including the midgetman missile the stealth 
bomber and our strategic defense initiative reagan said 
dukakis however has said he supports the advanced d5 trident 
missile and continued development of the stealth bomber socalled 
because of its ability to escape radar detection 
the president accused the democrats of planning to start a 
unilateral us moratorium on underground nuclear testing and a ban 
on flight testing of missiles 
reagan said that while bushs opponents have praised him for 
reaching a treaty with the soviets banning intermediaterange 
nuclear weapons in europe they also opposed deploying the 
missiles that made that treaty possible 
they want to conclude more arms reduction treaties but would 
cancel or delay the weapons systems on which successful 
negotiations will depend they profess their devotion to nato 
but would diminish the role of the very nuclear forces that nato 
needs to deter the soviets does that make any sense as military 
strategy reagan asked 
yes it comes down to this after eight hard years of 
rebuilding americas strength do we really want to return to a 
disneyland defense policy with mickey mouse treatment of our men 
and women in uniform goofy strategic plans and donald ducklike 
lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own 
blanketyblank fault reagan asked 
reagan contended that even the soviets might prefer his own 
approach to that of any democrat 
again and again around the world our predecessors had shown 
not the slightest grasp of the fundamentals of strategy and 
national interest and it even came to be said that the soviets 
longed for strong consistent leadership in the united states 
capable of making a deal and sticking to it reagan said 
he derided dukakis proposals for boosting conventional forces 
which he has dubbed a conventional defense initiative in 
contrast to the presidents antimissile strategic defense program 
reagan contended a buildup of conventional forces is well 
under way and that without the recent achievement of laserguided 
munitions we would not have been able to stage our successful 
strike against moammar gadhafis libya 
the president went on to boast how successful his policies have 
been and our reward is that from afghanistan to the persian gulf 
to southern africa we are bringing peace to longraging conflicts 
even as we frustrate soviet aims he contended 
reagan repeated his oftused claim that hes not given up one 
square inch of land to communism and yet today relations 
between the united states and the soviet union are the best theyve 
been in decades 
he told his audience composed of some 7000 veterans and their 
families that he was proud of the military buildup hed pledged to 
achieve eight years ago 
today i stand before you to report mission accomplished 
he said 
the legionnaires interrupted the president frequently with 
applause however on the sidewalk outside the convention hall 
about two dozen demonstrators held up signs urging support for the 
equal rights amendment and opposing the presidents policy of aid 
to nicaraguas contra rebels 
before addressing the legion reagan stopped briefing at 
nebraskas hastings college where he participated in dedication 
ceremonies of a communications arts center 
the center is named for the parents of public relations 
executive robert t gray a former resident of hastings and 
longtime reagan acquaintance who had served as the communications 
director on the the presidents 1980 white house campaign

president saddam hussein on tuesday accused 
iran of starting the persian gulf war and stalling the ceasefire 
talks in geneva 
also tuesday the iraqi government declared an amnesty for 
antigovernment kurds and gave those outside the country 30 days to 
return 
the amnesty decree by the revolutionary command council covered 
all iraqi kurds who have committed any crime punishable by law 
whether they are outside or inside the country 
but a spokesman for the kurdish democratic party the main 
guerrilla group said it will not use the amnesty without 
guarantees that prisoners will be released and returnees will be 
allowed to resettle in their original villages 
this amnesty has come too late said the spokesman in a 
telephone interview with the associated press in cyprus when 
people have lost their homes or their villages or their sons in 
these chemical bombardments what would they accept an amnesty 
for 
kurdish rebels have charged that iraq after the start of the 
aug 20 ceasefire with iran launched a massive assault on the 
kurdish population in northern iraq using chemical weapons and 
60000 troops the kurds backed by iran have been seeking an 
autonomous homeland that area of iraq 
hussein referred briefly to the offensive saying the operation 
was over 
in his first major public speech since the aug 20 ceasefire in 
the gulf hussein said iraq has proof that iran started the 
hostilities his address to a conference of arab information 
ministers was broadcast on staterun television 
now i can reveal for the first time that we have iranian 
pilots who were downed by iraq before september 4 1980 he said 
iran claims the war began on september 22 of that year when iraq 
launched a massive invasion iraq claims the war began on sept 4 
when iran shelled iraqi towns and attacked iraqi ships in the 
shattalarab waterway 
unmediated peace talks in geneva have stalled in part over 
iraqs demand the waterway its only outlet to the sea be opened 
and cleared of sunken tankers hussein insisted that iran is 
preventing progress at the talks 
we did not ask for something unrealistic he said what we 
asked for is free navigation in the gulf and shattalarab 
the shattalarab waterway formed by the convergence of the 
tigris and euphrates rivers is located on the southern border 
between the two nations and is the the source of a 400yearold 
dispute between iran and iraq 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
on tuesday the united states is very concerned about the human 
rights implications of iraqs conduct toward civilians and its 
campaign to suppress longstanding kurdish rebellions he said 
however america had no evidence iraq was engaged in chemical 
warfare against the kurds

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
was grounded tuesday and had to cancel an ohio campaign stop after 
the federal aviation administration sprung a surprise inspection of 
his chartered airplane and found safety problems with it 
dukakis spent much of tuesday afternoon at chicagos ohare 
international airport he canceled a trip to columbus ohio and 
returned to boston on the press plane that accompanies his campaign 
after landing in boston dukakis told reporters that the timing 
of the faas spot inspection was very curious but declined to 
comment further 
campaign press secretary dayton duncan said the inspection could 
have been performed overnight and added were looking forward to 
the moment in january when he gets to name the faa administrator 
the misfortunes with campaign aircraft continued despite the 
grounding as s reporters and staff disembarked from the media 
plane a coneshaped section at the rear fell to the ground 
exposing the open cabin inside 
the planes pilot who had invited dukakis to sit in the jump 
seat of the cockpit during the landing blamed the mishap on 
someone inside the plane who he said pulled a cable jettisoning the 
tail cone 
the pilot who declined to give his name said the tail cone 
could not have come off during an actual flight 
the boeing 737 that the candidate and his campaign staff had 
been using was taken out of service by presidential airways after 
an faa inspector cited at least four problems with it 
joan fudala a spokeswoman for presidential airways called the 
problems a couple of minor items that were corrected during the 
day she said the plane was expected to fly to boston and rejoin 
the dukakis campaign 
the faa said it did not actually ground the jet but pointed out 
the problems including eight inches of peeling metal skin on a 
wing flap and a cabin door that would not seal properly 
the captain elected to delay the flight so those could be 
fixed said ms fudala from the airlines headquarters in 
herndon va 
the faa called the inspection routine but duncan questioned why 
the aircraft which had been at ohare since monday could not have 
been examined earlier 
our plane has been parked here since last night and surely if 
our plane needed to be inspected it would have been more convenient 
for us to have it done last night not 15 minutes before we were 
supposed to leave he said 
he said the campaign had been told that the order to inspect the 
plane came from officials at the faas regional office in chicago 
mort edelstein a spokesman at the regional faa office said the 
agency is inspecting all candidate and press planes once every 
two weeks on average 
in washington faa spokesman fred farrar said the ramp 
inspection which consists of close visual inspection of the 
exterior and interior of the aircraft was similar to those 
conducted in recent weeks on other planes chartered by the two 
presidential candidates 
he said that between aug 23 and aug 26 the faa inspected two 
aircraft belonging to the dukakis campaign and three hired by the 
bush campaign including one carrying gop vice presidential 
candidate dan quayle bush travels on air force two which is 
closely inspected by the military 
these were all ramp inspections it is part of a deliberate 
program to keep close tabs on the safety of aircraft used by the 
political candidates said farrar 
according to the faa the problems found on the presidential 
airways jet were a delamination of metal skin on a wing flap a 
bent stallwarning vane the device that measures wind flow and 
triggers a warning if the aircraft is about to stall 
pressurization problems with the leftfront cabin door and 
improperly working floor proximity lights

eastern airlines unions will argue their case 
against the carriers elimination of 4000 jobs in federal court 
this month but employees tuesday began receiving pink slips 
an eastern spokeswoman said the postlabor day layoffs arent as 
dramatic as portrayed by union leaders karen ceremsak said many 
employees already have taken leaves of absences early retirement 
or quit 
attorneys for the machinists union and air line pilots 
association decided to first present their case against the layoffs 
in the appellate court 
the us court of appeals in washington on tuesday told eastern 
to submit legal briefs on its position by sept 12 a union 
response is due by sept 16 a reply from eastern is due three days 
later and oral arguments in the case were scheduled for the 
morning of sept 26 ms ceremsak said 
the same court last friday night dissolved an order by us 
district judge barrington parker in washington dc parker had 
allowed eastern to cut 12 percent of its flights including all 
service for 14 cities but not lay off the workers 
the appellate court allowed eastern to make the layoffs after 
posting a 47 million bond to pay the employees if their jobs are 
reinstated after the court holds a full hearing the company says 
the layoffs take effect sept 10 
charles bryan president of easterns machinists union has 
blasted the timing of the layoffs 
it is typical of texas air chairman frank lorenzos style 
bryan said its tragic for the employees to be faced with this 
kind of uncertainty on labor day and at the start of the school 
year 
but ceremsak said theres no good time for a furlough we had 
previously announced the furloughs july 22 it was the unions 
court action that delayed them 
she said of 1000 flight attendant positions eliminated nearly 
400 flight attendants had taken leaves of absences that would last 
from one to six months about 100 had taken early retirement or 
quit and some 530 were furloughed 
of the 4000 positions eliminated 1500 were nonunion 
employees including management and clerical workers some 1000 
machinists workers which include mechanics baggage handlers and 
ramp agents will be laid off some of those workers will take 
early retirement eastern officials expected 
the layoffs also called for elimination of 500 pilots 
positions but alpa spokesman ron cole said no pilot layoffs were 
expected because of tremendous backlogs of vacation time 
the miamibased carrier has said cutting labor costs is 
necessary to make the company profitable again but unions have 
criticized the idea that scaling back will make the airline more 
money 
eastern officials say they want to concentrate on their 
traditionally strong northeastern markets but the unions contend 
that texas air corp easterns parent company is stripping the 
miamibased carriers assets in favor of its nonunion sister 
carrier continental airlines

city officials paid a 192000 fine tuesday 
and faced with milliondollar fines by the end of the week 
pressed their efforts to end an impasse over courtordered housing 
desegregation 
mayor nicholas wasicsko told reporters it was possible that at 
least one of the four city councilmen blocking the housing plan may 
be near backing down 
but later he said the prospects for a quick settlement did not 
appear good 
im sorry to report that there hasnt been any significant 
movement he said the court is standing firm but the 
councilmen say they want some concessions before they comply the 
two sides are considerably far apart 
wasicsko said councilmen nicholas longo and peter chema met with 
him and the city manager for 7 hours monday talking about services 
that would have to be cut to meet mounting fines 
he noted that chema represents an area of the city that is 
going to feel the brunt of the service cuts and tax increases very 
acutely and yet that is an area where no housing is to be built 
it is the proposed placement of subsidized housing in middleclass 
areas that fueled opposition to the plan 
no meetings were scheduled tuesday but key figures in the 
crisis of the states fourthlargest city were in touch by 
telephone 
the mayor said he was in contact most of the day with city 
council members with the federal judge in the case and aides to 
gov mario cuomo in albany 
no breakthrough was reported from mondays meetings 
according to city corporation counsel paul pickelle us 
district judge leonard sand had said that if the city council 
approved a housing plan tuesday he would forgive the 192000 in 
fines accumulated over the weekend 
pickelle said there was a real financial incentive to reach a 
compromise today 
but yonkers spokesman eric schoen said 12 hours notice is 
required before a legal meeting and none was scheduled as of 
tuesday morning 
at issue is sands order that the council approve measures to 
promote the construction of 800 units of subsidized housing 
sand ruled in 1985 that the city was guilty of decades of 
intentional segregation of its schools and public housing 
the schools were desegregated under a plan approved by sand and 
the city council agreed in january to develop 1000 units of 
housing 
but under pressure from people who dont want subsidized housing 
in their middleclass neighborhoods four councilmen recanted and 
vowed to block the plan from going forward 
sand levied escalating fines against the city 100 for the 
first day and doubling every day after that he also fined the 
recalcitrant councilmen 
the penalties were stayed pending appeal last week the us 
supreme court reinstated the fines against the city but continued 
the stay against any punishment of the councilmen 
if the fines continue mounting through the week yonkers would 
owe 204800 wednesday by friday the fines would reach 1 million 
a day the city would be bankrupt by nov 12 according to city 
officials 
meanwhile tuesday the city announced details of a doomsday 
budget made necessary by the fines 
the plan forsees a gradual reduction in city services such as 
garbage collection park maintenance and programs for senior 
citizens youths and the handicapped cuts would continue until 
thanksgiving when all fire and police personnel would have been 
laid off garbage collection would end and the city would cease to 
function 
the mayor said that although formal cuts had not begun 25 
percent of yonkers scheduled garbage pickups were canceled tuesday 
because of a lack of diesel fuel as the city limits fuel purchases 
the garbage is piling up today the libraries will be closed 
next week the mayor said it may take deep cuts in city 
services to get the people of yonkers to tell their councilmen that 
they want this matter settled

with the intent of staging a coup and killing doe 
williams wife gwendolyn said her husband was in the business 
of importing cement to liberia and planned no wrongdoing when he 
traveled to the country 
i feel that hes innocent because when he left here he left 
on business mrs williams 30 told the associated press in a 
telephone interview from her home in jersey city they happened 
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time 
williams name was given as william elmer curtis but mrs

five members of the purported coup plot were killed in a july 13 
clash with liberian security men including liberian maj gen j 
nicholas podier does former deputy and the plots reported

a judge tuesday acquitted a teenager who 
was in a fatal car accident during a driver education course and 
criticized her instruction which included the showing of a richard 
pryor movie 
lorain county juvenile court judge henry webber said michelle 
moore 18 of elyria was innocent of vehicular homicide he said 
she was poorly trained and did not receive proper instruction at 
the time of the accident 
miss moore was 17 at the time of the jan 23 accident that 
killed donald mussey 75 of elyria she was taking a class from 
the pro driving school of elyria 
she was in tears when the verdict was announced and hugged her 
parents oliver and arlene weve been living with this for nine 
months oliver moore said im so relieved its hard to have 
any words to say 
in his decision webber said i find it sad that young people 
paying good money to learn to drive would get to see a movie such 
as jo jo dancer your life is calling instead of instruction on 
driving 
the judge said ms moore hadnt been prepared to drive in poor 
road conditions when her drivers education car slid on a snowy 
road and crossed into the opposite lane striking the car in which 
mussey was riding 
miss moore had testified during her trial last month that the 
movie was shown during her first driver education class the movie 
was inspired by the comedians life particularly events that 
followed a 1980 incident in which he set himself on fire while 
smoking cocaine 
classroom instructor james myrick testified during the trial 
that about 15 minutes of the pryor movie was shown but miss moore 
said she saw about 45 minutes of the film before being pulled out 
of class to practice maneuverability skills in a parking lot 
witnesses for pro driving school never explained why the movie 
was shown 
paul st marie the teenagers attorney said the movie had no 
place in a drivers training class it has no redeeming value 
whatsoever as far as safe driving is concerned he said it was 
clearly meant as entertainment 
pro driving school referred a call to attorney gerald smith of 
elyria who said the accident wasnt the schools fault 
youre going to have to learn to drive and youre going to 
have to do it on the highway smith said so its not a matter 
of inadequate training 
lorain county prosecutor greg white said he would review the 
trial transcript and evidence to determine whether the drivers 
education school or instructor would be criminally liable in 
musseys death

three unarmed ira guerrillas who were killed by 
british soldiers in gibraltar six months ago were shot at least 
eight times each a police photographer testified at an inquest 
tuesday 
the testimony came at the opening of the inquest which will 
determine whether the deaths can be legally justified 
coroner felix pizzarello began the session by denying a motion 
to eliminate the 11member jury from the inquest on the grounds 
that publicity about the killings had favored the british soldiers 
who fired on the guerrillas 
mairead farrell sean savage and daniel mccann who the ira has 
admitted were on a mission at the time of their deaths were shot 
and killed by seven soldiers near a gas station in the british 
colony of gibraltar on march 6 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
claim the killings were part of an unofficial shoottokill 
policy against members of the irish republican army british 
authorities said the three men were planning a car bomb attack at 
the site where the royal anglian regiment band accompanies a weekly 
changing of the guard ceremony 
the police photographer who testified tuesday brian reyes said 
that farrell savage and mcmann were each shot at least eight 
times he identified blackandwhite photographs he took showing 
the bullet entry and exit wounds 
reyes said savage was hit with bullets in the head hand arms 
side and chest mccann in the head torso thigh stomach and 
chest and farrell in the face side and chest just below the heart 
patrick mcgrory a belfast lawyer representing the families of 
the dead argued that the jurors should not participate in the 
hearings because they would be influenced by british press coverage 
of the shootings he said reports favored the members of the 
special air service unit who did the shooting 
the day after the slayings british foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe told parliament in london that the three ira suspects 
were unarmed 
mcgrory is expected to question witnesses who say the three men 
were given no chance to surrender before the soldiers shot them 
after the shooting police found a rented car parked near the 
area where the ceremony of the guards took place authorities said 
they first believed it had been rigged as a car bomb a second 
rented car containing timing devices and wire was found on the 
spanish side of the border from gibraltar 
two days after the shootings spanish police found a third car 
packed with explosives in a garage in marbella on the spanish coast 
if the inquests jury decides the british soldiers acted in an 
unlawful manner the soldiers may be criminally indicted under 
british law 
michael hucker who represents the soldiers referred to only as 
soldiers a to g said his clients were prepared to testify at 
the hearing but only if reporters and the public are excluded and 
their voices electronically altered pizzarello said the inquest 
which is taking place in the supreme court building would last 
about four weeks 
the overwhelmingly roman catholic ira seeks to oust british 
troops from mainly protestant northern ireland and to unite it with 
the predominantly catholic republic of ireland

west german officials want to 
take over part of a key us air base near frankfurt to enlarge the 
citys commercial airport a newspaper said tuesday 
the report added to growing speculation about the future of the 
rheinmain air base that adjoins frankfurt international airport 
hesse state wants 20 percent of the 776acre air force base to 
enlarge passenger facilities at the frankfurt airport according to 
the bonnbased die welt newspaper it quoted hesse economics 
minister alfred schmidt 
the rheinmain base which us forces in germany refer to as 
the gateway to europe has been the site of historic events 
in january 1981 the 52 americans who had been held hostage in 
the us embassy in iran arrived at the base and in 1985 vice 
president george bush greeted the 39 americans flown there after 
they were released by the hijackers of a twa jetliner 
rhinemain was a major base for the berlin airlift in 1948 when 
planes delivered thousands of tons of food fuel and clothing to 
west berlin after soviet forces blockaded the city 
there have been heated discussions in west germany in recent 
months about how to cope with overcrowded skies and airports that 
are causing flight delays and cancellations 
a large number of air corridors over west germany and numerous 
air bases are reserved for north atlantic treaty organization 
forces 
the us military took over the rheinmain base after world war 
ii 
hesse gov walter wallmann on tuesday denied reports that the 
state is planning to buy and take over all of the air base 
hessischer rundfunk radio last friday reported that west german 
officials had offered about 128 million for the entire rhinemain 
site 
these reports come out of thin air wallmann told reporters 
in the state capital of wiesbaden we are speaking with us 
armed forces about how to ensure the position of the frankfurt 
airport in the face of increasing air travel 
frankfurts commercial airport and the us air force share use 
of the runways at the site six miles south of frankfurt 
us air force spokesman lt col pat maloney contacted by the 
associated press by telephone at at his rheinmain office said 
there is nothing being discussed at this level us embassy 
spokesman robert heath would say only that the reports about the 
base were hypothetical 
the rheinmain base has been used mainly by the us air forces 
military airlift command to transport military personnel to and 
from europe

defense minister willem van 
eekelen announced his resignation tuesday after allegations that he 
bungled the introduction of a new passport system 
i have asked her majesty the queen beatrix to allow me to 
resign van eekelen told parliament his action marked the first 
such resignation from premier ruud lubbers coalition government of 
centrist christian democrats and rightist liberals since it came to 
power in 1982 
van eekelens decision came after a parliamentary inquiry 
committee said earlier this month that he had mismanaged the 
passport project during his 19821986 tenure as a deputy foreign 
minister 
a minister of defense should defend himself to the utmost but 
also limit casualties he told parliament 
there was no immediate indication who would succeed the 
57yearold defense minister 
the overhaul of the passport system has been beset by 
controversy since its announcement in 1982 the new document was 
supposed to be more forgery proof than the current passport and 
bring this nation into line with passport requirements set by the 
european economic community 
the parliamentary report said van eekelen had granted the 
documents to develop and produce new passports to a newly formed 
conglomerate without seriously considering rival bids from other 
companies 
it contained no charges of corruption against van eekelen who 
was appointed defense minister after the 1986 general elections

police who had been held at bay for nine hours 
tuesday by a rain of shotgun pellets returned fire and mortally 
wounded the sniper through his door then found his two children 
dead in their highrise apartment 
the siege left 14 officers injured but all were treated and 
released officials at two hospitals said 
cho mun chu 45 who was removed from his citysubsidized lower 
east side apartment on a stretcher died later at bellevue 
hospital said sgt john clifford a police spokesman 
the bodies of 8yearold helen chu and her 9yearold brother 
warren chu were found with wounds to the head covered with 
blankets and pillows in the hallway of apartment police said 
they were shot with what was believed to be a longbarrel 
shotgun filled with bird shot said police spokesman lt steven 
davis 
the girls death was believed to be the first time in the 
15year history of the elite police hostage negotiating unit that a 
hostage was lost during negotiations said another police 
spokesman sgt raymond odonnell 
police believe the boy was already dead when they arrived but 
the girl was seen alive by a police camara commissioner benjamin 
ward said 
chus wife hui choy chu who also used the name angela was 
believed to be in taiwan said odonnell 
ward said police were forced to shoot chu in selfdefense after 
removing the door to his 11thfloor apartment from its hinges in an 
attempt to bring the girl to safety 
we waited until he fired pointblank one captain was hit 
four lieutenants were hit and one police officer was hit by 
pellets and he was now firing point blank at the door the 
commissioner said 
the officers returned two shots hitting chu twice in the chest 
ward said 
first deputy police commissioner richard condon said earlier 
that a rain of pellets descended on officers who arrived about 
6 am to investigate a report of shots fired 
scores of police then cordoned off a fourblock area around the 
building the fdr drive a main highway along the east river into 
manhattan was closed in both directions near the brooklyn bridge 
creating enormous traffic jams 
for about a halfhour as the incident ended shortly after 3 
pm the east river was closed to marine traffic between the 
williamsburg and brooklyn bridges said a coast guard spokesman 
petty officer randy midgett 
police attempts to communicate with the suspected sniper were 
unsuccessful until a cantonesespeaking detective was brought in to 
act as interpreter 
condon said negotiations were difficult because the interpreter 
and suspect were shouting through a door which was locked and 
barricaded by furniture 
police had said the man had made no threats against his family 
and in the course of negotiations had made no demands 
he seems to have some kind of financial problems and family 
problems and that seems to be what has set him off condon said 
victoria parker who lives on the 18th floor of the building 
said the man recently moved in and quickly gained a reputation for 
having a bad temper he gets into it with management and the 
tenants she said 
davis said housing authority police had been called to the 
25story building before because of problems with the man

windwhipped forest blazes across montana 
prompted a ban tuesday on all outdoor recreation on state and 
federal lands outside cities and towns gov ted schwinden and 
federal agencies said 
the ban imposed by schwinden the us forest service and the 
bureau of land management applies to all state and federal land 
including all rivers and streams outside cities towns and 
national parks the governor said 
it affects all nonessential activities such as sightseeing 
hunting fishing boating rafting camping hiking picnicking and 
woodgathering 
farm work livestock herding housebuilding mining and logging 
are allowed however schwinden warned that these activities could 
be banned unless the fire danger wanes 
schwinden said the ban will remain until weather conditions ease 
the fire danger and that probably will require a substantial amount 
of rain 
the ban came less than a week after the state fish and game 
commission delayed start of the 1988 hunting season followed by a 
plea from schwinden for montanans to stay out of the forests over 
the labor day weekend 
for the most part schwinden said his request worked although 
there were 58 new fires started in the state since his aug 31 
statement none developed into a major blaze he said 
the ban on recreation will be enforced by personnel from the 
forest service blm state wildlife agency and the state lands 
department 
schwinden said violators probably will be warned first before 
being cited 
brubaker said the bureau of indian affairs has endorsed the ban 
and it may be extended to montanas seven indian reservations after 
the various tribal councils are consulted 
glacier and yellowstone national parks were excluded from the 
ban because the park service has its own restrictions on recreation 
already in place said john north attorney for schwinden 
fishing guides in ennis helena and great falls complained that 
the ban on floating and angling puts them out of business 
banning fishing is ridiculous said joel weimer owner of 
helenas montana fly goods it makes sense to ban fires smoking 
and offroad driving but fishing all i do is put a raft in the 
missouri river from a blacktopped road

two cosmonauts returned safely to earth early 
wednesday after their descent was aborted twice because of a system 
malfunction and their food and oxygen began to run out the 
official soviet news agency reported 
tass reported that abdul ahad mohmand the first afghan in 
space and his soviet crewmate vladimir lyakhov touched down at 
450 am moscow time 850 pm edt tuesday in soviet central 
asia 
both cosmonauts feel fine after the landing tass said 
the agency said their soyuz tm5 space capsule landed 99 miles 
southeast of dzhezkazgan a town on the steppes of the republic of 
kazakhstan in soviet central asia the town is about 1365 miles 
southeast of moscow 
soviet news reports earlier had said neither cosmonaut was in 
immediate danger but that the situation soon could become critical 
accident the engine worked 60 seconds and shut off a 
violation of the stabilization regime lyakhov told mission 
control in an exchange reported by the government newspaper 
izvestia 
lyakhov 47 is a military pilot who has flown in space twice 
before and mohmand 29 is an afghan air force pilot 
lyakhov mohmand and soviet doctor valery polyakov were launched 
into space aug 29 and boarded the orbiting mir space station two 
days later polyakov remained aboard but lyakhov and mohmand 
undocked the soyuz at 255 am moscow time 655 pm monday edt 
for the trip home 
polyakov stayed on the mir to monitor the health of two other 
cosmonauts who have been in space for more than eight months 
james oberg a us expert on the soviet space program who is 
familiar with the soyuz tm5 design had said tuesday that time was 
running out 
if they cannot make the burn tonight to push them back into 
the atmosphere they will probably only live another 24 to 48 hours 
before the carbon dioxide building in the capsule will kill them 
oberg said in an interview with the associated press in houston 
officials of the us national aeronautics and space 
administration said nasa volunteered help but the soviets declined 
saying they had a technical problem but that no assistance was 
needed 
the north american aerospace defense command in colorado said 
the soyuz had split into at least two parts a normal procedure for 
reentry 
we are tracking two pieces associated with tm5 said maj 
alex mondragon a norad spokesman the capsule was in an orbit 226 
miles by 206 miles and the ships living compartment was circling 
earth 234 miles at the highest point and 155 miles at the lowest 
the soyuz capsule is designed for trips to and from space not 
for long flights 
izvestia and tass earlier reported that life support systems on 
the globeshaped capsule were designed to last two days meaning 
that had the cosmonauts not been able to descend they would have 
been in jeopardy by thursday morning 
according to the soviet space official however the cosmonauts 
could have stretched supplies of oxygen water and food for up to a 
week after that the capsule would be like a lone boat in the 
ocean he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
he did not explain how the air supply could be extended 
the capsule would have landed in china had the descent not been 
aborted the space official said contingency landing sites in 
general were not desirable because no proper ground crews would be 
there 
an izvestia article under the headline anxious hours in 
space reported this exchange between mission control and the 
cosmonauts 
how are things with food a mission controller asked 
there is no food said lyakhov 
but in the accident reserves the controller asked 
there is some but why touch it we will endure lyakhov 
said 
tass said the cosmonauts are in for difficult hours in orbit 
until the designated time of landing 
soviet television showed blackandwhite videotape taken from 
the soyuz in which the mir station whose extended solar panels 
gave it the shape of a t grew steadily smaller as the capsule 
pulled away 
television commentator alexander tikhomirov said later in a 
somber voice 
we are already used to everything going smoothly in space and 
some forget about the danger which space research entails and here 
this once more convinces us how complex a matter it is and what a 
huge amount of abnormal situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit 
trouble began soon after the soyuz left its dock on the mir 
an engine used to slow the capsule for entering earths 
atmosphere fired automatically while the vehicle was out of radio 
contact with ground control izvestia said 
when contact was restored lyakhov gave his report that the 
engine stopped after 60 seconds far short of the 230 seconds 
needed to brake the capsule for a safe reentry soviet media said 
controllers decided to delay another attempt for three hours 
izvestia reported during that time scientists found that sunlight 
had interfered with a sensor in an infrared guidance system and a 
computer automatically terminated the engine burn 
seven minutes later the sensor locked onto its correct target 
and the guidance system worked properly the engine fired again 
but because the onboard computer had not been reprogrammed the 
capsule was sent on a trajectory for a landing in china the 
reports said 
the cosmonauts stopped the engine manually after three seconds 
and tried again but that time the engine stopped after six seconds 
and the decision was made to wait until wednesday 
valery ryumin a cosmonaut and the mission chief told izvestia 
dont worry nothing terrible has happened yet the life 
support system will last for two days

the program quoted john edwards whom the program identified as 
an adviser for palme on disarmament as saying palme asked gandhi 
to buy 400 longrange howitzers from bofors ab swedens largest 
arms maker 
gandhi rejected advice from indian military experts to purchase 
rival frenchmanufactured cannon and awarded a 136 billion 
contract to bofors which had been experiencing financial troubles 
the program said 
it was swedens largestever export contract the program said 
i think he palme obviously used that opportunity the 
conference to discuss the boforsindia deal edwards said 
a swedish government investigation concluded in june that bofors 
paid unspecified commissions in the deal but did not say whether 
those payments violated the agreement 
first tuesday said gandhi supported the deal because of 
guarantees it would be free of middlemen and commissions which 
usually raise the cost 
palme was shot in downtown stockholm on feb 28 1986 while 
walking home from a movie police have failed to establish a motive 
or prosecute any suspect 
the program also alleged that palme allowed swedish 
manufacturers to skirt laws banning arms exports to warring 
countries making it possible for swedish arms to reach iran during 
its eightyear war with iraq 
the united nations had appointed palme to mediate in the war 
but first tuesday said swedish companies supplied iran with 
trucks and patrol boats and helped the iranians build an explosives 
factory 
last month the swedish magazine z claimed that palme was 
assassinated in revenge for stopping the sale by bofors of 18 
cannon to iran in late 1985

pope john paul iis customary message 
of peace and reconciliation could be a controversial one when he 
visits mozambique a southern african nation wracked by 12 years of 
civil war drought and systematic destruction of public facilities 
a newsletter issued last year by frelimo the governing marxist 
party called the former portuguese colonys roman catholic bishops 
enemies of the people after they suggested the government meet 
with guerrillas of the mozambican national resistance 
but cardinal alexandre dos santos says he hopes the pope will 
call for reconciliation when he visits the country sept 1619 
president joaquim chissano who was visiting the pope in the 
vatican when the bishops made their plea said it was impossible to 
negotiate with the guerrillas who he charged mutilate children 
burn schools and hospitals and massacre villagers 
the guerrilla movement known as renamo denies such charges and 
says it is fighting to replace the marxist government with a 
democratic one 
we hope the pope will say something about peace since we are 
in this situation of war said dos santos who became a cardinal 
in june we dont see how we can end this struggle without 
reconciliation it is necessary to have dialogue with these 
people 
foreign minister pascoal mocumbi said the government hopes the 
pope will not appeal for negotiations with renamo he said no one 
had the right to suggest that the government should talk with 
terrorists with those who commit massacres those who have 
been roundly condemned not only by mozambique but by the 
international community 
job chambal director of the governments department of 
religious affairs is overseeing the return of some church property 
confiscated when frelimo came to power at independence from 
portugal in 1975 
he said of the bishops our quarrel with them is not the fact 
that they called for negotiations any mozambican is free to think 
that the one thing that worried the government was to say that 
the government as well as renamo are responsible for the war 
chambal said the plan to return all confiscated church property 
used for worship came coincidentally three months before the popes 
visit 
we were not trying to please the pope he said its a way 
of showing we dont belong to an evil empire 
since 1982 when the late president samora machel held meetings 
with church leaders the government has sought to ease tension 
between the churches and frelimo 
the government invited the pope to visit mozambique in his 
capacity as head of the vatican state and it is sharing expenses 
with the local church 
its very expensive but its very important chambal said 
the willingness of the pope to come to mozambique means theres 
been a very big improvement because people have understood what it 
means when we say we have a socialist state 
we are marxists but all of us in government have some 
religious background said chambal who was reared a 
presbyterian we still have some religious feeling even our 
revolutionary songs have a religious taste but our children will 
be more marxist and teach their children to be marxists 
he said the government wants children to be influenced only by 
the state until they are 18 when they can choose whether to go to 
church but this policy is not enforced in the years immediately 
after independence some churches were closed services were 
interrupted and religious activity was officially discouraged 
now churches operate freely both cathedral services and prayer 
meetings in the bush are packed on sundays 
the frelimo revolutionaries accused roman catholic bishops and 
priests of cooperating with the portuguese colonial government and 
opposing independence in return for a favored position as a state 
church 
the cardinal says some portuguese clergymen supported 
colonialism but denies the mozambican roman catholic church as a 
whole was against independence 
all churchstate problems are not resolved cardinal dos santos 
said but he maintained the government does not understand the 
churchs goals 
they suppose we want only to teach those who want to be 
religious leaders he said we also want to prepare the people 
for running the country 
dos santos said that of mozambiques 145 million people 2 
million are catholics

the fatal crash landing of a chinese jetliner 
has fired up debate on replacing hong kongs airport known for its 
harrowing flight path that skims the rooftops of crowded kowloon 
peninsula 
the britishbuilt trident jetliner skidded off hong kong 
international airports sole runway into the sea in a torrential 
downpour aug 31 killing seven people in hong kongs worst air 
accident in 21 years 
the accident came at a time when the british colony is 
considering construction of a new airport away from congested urban 
areas the government is funding three surveys to evaluate various 
proposals 
the colonys governor sir david wilson said immediately 
following the crash that it should have no bearing on the future of 
the existing airport which is known as kai tak 
the englishlanguage south china morning post newspaper agreed 
but noted in an editorial that there is no doubt that the crash 
will focus renewed attention on the apparently neverending saga of 
hong kongs need for expanded aviation facilities 
kai tak is squeezed between the sea and the impossibly crowded 
neighborhoods of kowloon one of the colonys major urban areas 
the runway juts into hong kongs famed harbor and is surrounded on 
three sides by water 
use of the airport has expanded rapidly last year 127 million 
passengers were handled an increase of 20 percent from the year 
before and nearly 50 percent from 1982 movement of aircraft 
reached 73370 planes in 1986 an increase of 132 percent from the 
previous year 
the single runway required to handle an aircraft every 180 
seconds during peak hours has exhausted its possibilities the 
morning post said the government says the runway can handle up to 
30 planes an hour 
victor sit a university of hong kong professor who studies 
urban problems expressed concern that the airports enviable 
safety record may run into trouble as traffic increases 
weve been lucky he said so far the accidents all 
happened on the harbor side of the airport not on the landward 
side although the chinese jetliner crashed while approaching the 
runway from the harbor flights typically make their final approach 
over kowloon 
the approach of the airport obviously requires very careful 
maneuvering by the pilots concerned and very precise control by 
the airport sit said passengers rarely forget the final moments 
before touchdown when planes come breathtakingly close to kowloons 
buildings 
kai tak critics note the airport becomes paralyzed whenever the 
runway is disrupted cutting the colonys main transportation link 
to the outside world the chinese jetliner crash stopped traffic 
for about six hours 
they also argue that the airports urban location makes life 
miserable for many local residents a recent study estimated 1 
million people suffer unacceptable noise from kai tak 
government officials have been considering replacement 
possibilities for years and are actively looking at two sites near 
outlying lantau island for a new airport a final decision has been 
promised by the end of 1989 
the most ambitious proposal is from a group led by hopewell 
holdings ltd the massive 308 billionplan would include an 
airport seaport road and railway complex on reclaimed land off 
the islands east coast near hong kong island 
the tiny portuguese territory of macao 40 miles southwest of 
hong kong also has proposed building its own international airport 
and china which regains sovereignty over hong kong in 1997 
plans to construct an airport in its shenzhen special economic zone 
just over the hong kong border sit said that airport would only 
help to ease our trouble a little bit 
he believes kai tak will reach capacity in three to five years 
around the time construction could be starting on a new airport 
unless the government bows to pressure to act faster 
that would mean they only start construction when the airport 
itself has exceeded capacity sit said it would be fairly 
difficult for hong kong to operate as an international financial 
trading and tourist center unless we have some other arrangement

oblivious to a pouring rain lokmaya 
crouches beside a muddy rivulet and scrubs her childrens clothes 
with a bar of pink soap 
her two little girls at her side appear to be about 4 and 8 
years old but lokmaya doesnt know their ages or even her own 
i dont keep track of such things she says but with a 
proud smile she adds that she also has a son and he is 6 
lokmaya gave birth to three other children but they did not 
survive infancy she doesnt know why and says her surviving 
children are often sick with fevers 
health care is a battle of mountainous proportions in nepal 
where both man and nature are the enemy creating what health 
workers call the silent emergency 
an earthquake rumbled through the himalayan mountains foothills 
and valleys aug 21 killing more than 700 people in nepal and at 
least 300 in neighboring india 
however nepals biggest killer is far less dramatic and strikes 
every day it is diarrhea and it claims 45000 lives a year 
according to figures compiled by the united nations childrens fund 
unicef and the nepalese government nearly all the victims are 
children 
eleven percent of all babies die before the age of a year two 
out of three children under 5 suffer from malnutrition further 
decreasing their chances of avoiding or surviving diarrhea and 
the six other most prevalent diseases diphtheria whooping cough 
tetanus measles tuberculosis and polio 
nearly 50 percent of the diseases could be controlled easily 
if you could provide potable water to the people said shreebatsa 
prasad shrestha an undersecretary in the ministry of health 
nepal the fabled kingdom in the sky is a land of beauty and 
mystery luring adventurers to conquer the majestic heights of 
mount everest to search for the abominable snowman to explore the 
pagodalike temples where buddhism met hinduism and spawned the 
kind of architecture that belongs in fairy tales 
it is a country where tourists are warned not to drink the 
water where western embassies have their own doctors and are 
poised to fly their citizens to bangkok in thailand new york or 
london for hospital treatment 
the nepalese have little choice but to drink the water and only 
25 percent of them get it from a tap or well shrestha said the 
rest fetch water from open streams where livestock wallow and 
people bathe 
the country has one doctor for every 26000 people in contrast 
to one doctor per 5000 people in india and one per 780 in the 
united states 
lokmayas village of balambhu has better health care than most 
in this nation of 17 million people people can walk to the local 
health post in a few minutes and the village of 1000 is less than 
6 miles from katmandu the capital where there are free doctors 
in more remote areas people must walk for days to reach a 
health post which may have up to four staffers a midwife and as 
many as three health assistants with firstaid kits 
even in balambhu the concept of waterborne diseases such as 
diarrhea is rudimentary 
down the road from where lokmaya was doing her laundry women 
washed their families breakfast dishes their children and 
themselves in another tiny rivulet of water coursing through the 
mud 
a few yards away a teenage boy scrubbed a water buffalo a 
smaller boy wearing only a tattered brown shirt squatted nearby 
for the ground along the rivulet serves as a latrine 
plans for development in nepal where the per capita annual 
income is 160 a year anticipate that 18 percent of all homes will 
have toilets by the year 2000 compared to an estimated 3 percent 
now television which started in nepal only two years ago has 
already reached 13 percent of the people and is expected to reach 
60 percent by the year 2000 
foreign health workers said they have found people quick to 
learn health and hygiene precautions once they understand why they 
must change their habits 
joann duffy katmandu director of dooley intermed a new york 
citybased foundation said her staff is training nepalese nurses 
to conduct classes for menial workers in hospitals 
we demonstrate how to sweep we show them how to clean a 
latrine we show them how to dig a pit for trash we show them how 
to wash their hands said ms duffy an infection control 
practitioner from torrance calif 
the nepalese terrain is harder to conquer many areas even 
those at lower altitudes are far from roads that motor vehicles 
can travel 
under a nationwide vaccination campaign aimed at combating 
tuberculosis measles and other diseases unicef workers are hiking 
up to four days to reach remote villages 
the serum they carry in specially designed cold packs must 
be kept below certain temperatures and the packs can only maintain 
that temperature for 48 hours according to unicefs chief 
representative in katmandu lay maung a burmese doctor 
to maintain the correct temperature relays of runners follow 
them with blocks of ice to keep the serum cool

as an authority on economic and business 
productivity c jackson grayson jr watches in amazement as one 
legislator after another thinks government has the answers 
having served in three administrations grayson knows how 
limited are governments abilities to intervene in the marketplace 
and correct its problems specifically when they involve global 
competitiveness 
in that area he says there are important things that 
government should not do no matter how insistent and intense the 
pressure in keeping with that belief he and associate carla 
odell have issued some cautionary advice 
their views are in the form of a book titled american 
business a twominute warning although it would take even the 
most efficient and productive reader a lot longer than that to 
digest their advice 
grayson chairman of the american productivity center in 
houston is wellgrounded in his subject having been president 
nixons price commissioner and a member of president carters 
commission on the agenda for the 80s and president reagans 
national productivity advisory council 
from such vantage points says grayson he has observed growing 
pressure on government to do something about americas 
competitive posture which is reflected in the balance of payments 
deficit and other problems 
over the past five years he says there have been 112 
recommendations for government action by 21 councils commissions 
congressional hearings and study groups on productivity and 
competitiveness 
it is frightening say grayson and odell that the 99th 
congress had 108 committees and subcommittees in the senate and 178 
in the house with 3000 staffers feeling they must do something 
to help american competitiveness 
stating that such determination by washington to do something 
keeps us awake at night the authors name five things they feel 
government must not do to help american competitiveness 
1 the single worst thing is to increase protection say grayson 
and odell they say it invites reciprocity lowers efficiency and 
shrinks exportrelated jobs 
granting protection they say is like putting an industry on 
a lifesupport system it may prolong life for a while but it 
cant restore health 
2 government should not establish industrial policies 
industrial policies are in effect attempts at centrally 
directing the economy to specific national goals call it 
national planning and you might get an argument but you would 
also have material to defend yourself 
industrial policies have been resurrected under the labels of 
trade policies or competitiveness policies or living 
standards acts 
grayson and odell maintain that government personnel are not 
by instinct or background entrepreneurs or managers and that 
their allocation decisions would be worse than those of the private 
sector 
furthermore they observe authors and administrators of 
policies and laws tend to be lawyers or economists with little 
knowledge of business operations and they ask arent we aware 
that government cannot plan long range and cannot stay atop the 
rapid continuous adjustments of a dynamic market 
3 the country should avoid currency devaluation as a 
competitiveness strategy 
among other things they argue devaluing the dollar makes the 
united states compete on the basis of a lower standard of living 
devaluation keeps knocking the dollar down until american wages 
are cheap enough to compete 
4 capital investment shouldnt be overemphasized 
we stress that capital investment is not only important for 
productivity improvement it is essential they say what we 
argue against is the overemphasis and wrong emphasis on capital 
investment 
one of their reasons for so thinking is that merely calling 
for more capital investment confuses the volume of capital 
investment with the productivity of that investment 
5 more research and development is not necessarily better 
the biggest competitive problem is not the amount spent on 
rampd but on what is spent and what is done with the ideas and 
techniques after discovery 
the united states they point out is still the world leader in 
originating new ideas but while that is great for the good of 
the world what counts in competitiveness is rapid 
commercialization of new knowledge

willem dafoe is a modest man but he couldnt 
help thinking the time was right to play the title role in the 
last temptation of christ 
it made all the sense in the world he said i thought 
yes of course perfect its a good role i feel right for it 
right now im just at the point in my life where im concerned 
with some of the things hes speaking about the struggle between 
the body and the spirit is something im interested in 
few films have generated as much controversy as martin 
scorseses the last temptation of christ based on the novel by 
nikos kazantzakis it depicts an angstridden jesus torn between 
desires of the mind and body in a dream sequence he is spared the 
cross sleeps with mary magdalene and has children the movie has 
drawn fierce protests from some religious groups 
i was a little surprised dafoe said i knew there was 
some resistance i never thought it would be to this extent and 
take this kind of shape 
however the publicity generated from the protests has helped 
the movie at the box office 
its always a terrific thing for a publicity campaign dafoe 
said but it colors everything in a negative light maybe thats 
a tradeoff to the publicity 
dafoe was eager to work with scorsese the director of mean 
streets taxi driver and raging bull 
he just gave me a certain kind of confidence and authority he 
kept me on the track he makes you feel comfortable he gives you 
that room you feel totally unencumbered free yet you feel a 
guiding hand 
dafoe also enjoyed working with the cast which included barbara 
hershey as mary magdalene and david bowie as pontius pilate 
there was a real sense of purpose he said marty commands 
a lot of respect there was very little money and the actors were 
doing it for scale everyone wanted to be there a real ensemble 
feel 
although dafoe had seen other biblical movies he had no 
interest in repeating others performances 
i really didnt concern myself with what kind of jesus i was 
going to be the responsibility of playing that role all the 
associations all the information i thought i would find a place 
to scrub myself clean of all that and really start out from a 
wonderfully innocent place 
dafoes confidence was helped by his faith in scorsese i 
would not be cowed by the role it was a very risky thing if 
youre going to be in a situation like that you might as well be 
with martin scorsese 
the intensity of his performance in last temptation can be 
measured by his eyes which rarely blink on camera 
no matter what you do it has mythic proportions he said 
when youre speaking no matter the context there is some kind 
of concentration thats not of this world 
the general tendency is to look as deeply as you can into the 
back of someones brain and deeply understand with every cell in 
your body what youre saying 
the 33yearold actor talked about his career at the performing 
garage home of the wooster group an experimental theater company 
dafoe is a member and does business there 
he was born july 22 1955 in appleton wis and was early 
attracted to the stage simply moronic reasons he said 
smiling its fun its enjoyable i like pretending 
as he grew older his feelings for acting deepened 
in the end its for its own sake for beautys sake a lot 
of professions youre tracked you do this you get that in 
acting you become the canvas it totally goes back to you he 
said 
youre constantly questioning why you do what you do youre 
constantly evolving its a healthy way to live but very 
difficult 
he became a fulltime actor at 18 and in 1977 he saw the 
wooster group give a performance of rumstick road 
it was just unlike anything id ever seen he said the 
event was so extraordinary it touched my heart theres no 
accounting for it i couldnt identify it it had that kind of 
maniac energy and this really fluid transformation 
dafoe joined the wooster group but also pursued a career in 
film after appearing in a few minor films in 1983 he began to 
attract attention with streets of fire in 1984 and to live 
and die in la in 1985 
his big breakthrough came the following year with platoon 
oliver stones academy awardwinning film about the vietnam war 
dafoes portrayal of the sympathetic sergeant elias earned him an 
oscar nomination for supporting actor 
despite film work he has continued his involvement with the 
wooster group the whole desire to play around with forms is a 
liberating thing for an actor he said

republican presidential nominee george poppy 
bush went off to phillips academy in andover mass at age 13 
before the word preppy had been invented and later attended 
yale a reporter looking into the school days of both bush and his 
democratic opponent michael dukakis talked with former classmates 
and teachers who generally remember him as a real nice guy and 
a good athlete dukakis schoolmates will get their say in the next

george bush has shed the ben franklin 
glasses dropped his twangy voice a note or two and now eschews 
buttondown shirts anything to get rid of the preppy image that 
dogs his run for president against michael dukakis 
theres a tendency to have you fit into a mold the 
republican vice president complained recently the mold for me is 
a kind of ivy league elitist and i resist it 
alas bush might have avoided the whole eastern establishment 
wasp wimp caricature had he been born in columbus ohio like his 
father or in st louis like his mothers clan or in kingsport 
tenn like older brother prescott jr 
well almost prescott sr did go to yale as did george his 
three brothers four uncles and cousins by the halfdozens 
still dad was a midwest hardware salesman before us rubber 
absorbed his small firm and transferred him to braintree mass 
where george was born on june 12 1924 in nearby milton 
a transfer to the new york office relocated the family in the 
affluent commuter town of greenwich conn but they werent 
established easterners until dad turned to investment banking 
bought that 11room victorian house with a huge rolling lawn on 
grove lane and became moderator of the town meeting 
later years later when george was out of yale and wildcatting 
for oil in texas his father twice won election to the us senate 
and became a golfing partner of dwight eisenhower 
george at age 5 went off to the greenwich country day school 
from the start he was a good athlete thanks to mom dorothy 
walker bush who had made it to the finals of the girls national 
tennis championship and is still going strong riding her bike at 
86 handing out campaign literature 
physically she is a small woman but she is made of mighty 
stuff george wrote in a mothers day salute three years ago for 
the greenwich time newspaper nine months into her first 
pregnancy she played baseball her last time up she hit a home run 
and without missing a base continued right off the field to the 
hospital to deliver pres 
sundays after episcopal services at christ church there was 
always a baseball game on the bush lawn with george being 
lefthanded holding down first base a position he excelled at 
when he captained the yale nine into the national collegiate finals 
and got to meet babe ruth 
poppy as we called him had good handtoeye coordination 
recalls retired timelife executive evan ingels a classmate at the 
country day school he was a running back on our football team 
good also at soccer tennis and wrestling we were both a year 
younger than the others and rivals for head of the class 
george was nicknamed little pop then poppy for his 
hero worship of his maternal grandfather george pop walker a

shirley flower sedgewick who married howard sedgewick georges 
classmate at country day recalls the strong patriarchal presence 
of prescott sr when the dating game began for the bush boys 
now dont you think its time to take this young lady home he 
would say and immediately the family chauffeur alex would be 
called into action 
the word preppy had not been invented when 13yearold 
george went off to phillips academy here in andover and became a 
prep the campus word for newcomer he wore a little blue 
rowing cap topped with a white button carried the luggage of the 
lordly seniors to their dorms on the upper hill burst immediately 
into any song they commanded could not venture near the flag staff 
where upperclassmen were allowed to smoke and was not to be seen 
on main street until the football team beat exeter the hated 
redmen from the north 
in those days andover consciously imitated the english public 
schools like eton and rugby so a little hazing was in order 
said retired english master hart leavitt he remembers george as an 
indifferent scholar in my class he was a nonentity just sat 
there and didnt contribute much a nice guy but thats about all 
he looked like the cover on the preppy handbook that came out 
awhile ago i didnt have much contact with him outside class but 
i must say wimp is the last word i would apply to him 
chemistry tutor and basketball coach frank diclementi who knew 
george better back then has different memories from the first 
day i saw him i knew he was something special he came from a 
family with the right priorities some kids arent ready to come 
here he was i never saw him down always hustling but a good 
loser although you couldnt be jolly about the damn thing 
wearing the bow tie that is his trademark deak as decades 
of old grads call him sat on the porch of the andover inn 
summoning up the past from the background shouts of the playing 
fields 
poppy was captain of baseball and soccer played every minute 
of every game but i had to talk him into going out for basketball 
he was afraid of denying another kid a place on the team he was a 
good hacker as we called regular fellows always thinking of 
others 
there was a jewish kid nicknamed ovie dead now who left 
school when he didnt get tapped for any of the greek societies 
they talked him into coming back and poppy was the first to 
befriend him got him to come out for baseball one day a fly ball 
bounced off ovies head into the leftfielders glove and poppy 
congratulated him on an assist 
george and his schoolmates trod the leafy walks in fear of the 
righteous wrath of the bald one headmaster claude fuess who 
could ring down the thunder for violating 9 pm lightsout curfew 
or after a bun fight in the beanery as the dining rooms in the 
student commons were called 
the boys often had a tough time keeping a straight face when

on a recent visit to his alma mater bush remembered pearl 
harbor day 1941 slouching across campus with my roommate we 
kept it on our minds that the germans were invading europe we knew 
exactly what we had to do we had to beat exeter at football 
which they did 1413 with the whole school singing and shouting 
through the snowy night on that special train back from new 
hampshire 
war was almost a curriculum elective by then the boys sold war 
bonds donated their downtown treats money to the uso gathered 
up magazines in the dorms every thursday for the soldiers at nearby 
fort devens and pot pourri lost its slick cover to the wartime 
paper shortage 
the class historian noted that the whole school thrilled to an 
address at morning chapel by col henry l stimson the secretary 
of war and an andover trustee george as chairman of the student 
deacons got to escort the secretary to the podium in addition to 
his regular duties of checking attendance and taking up the 
collection 
caught up in the patriotic fervor george on his 18th birthday 
just a few days after graduation took the train to boston to 
enlist in the navy in the yearbook poll of 193 graduates he 
ranked third behind varsity quarterback elliott vose as most 
popular handsomest most respected and best allaround 
fellow he rated second in most faculty drag and was out of 
the running as most intelligent most likely to succeed and 
ladies man 
his name was read out in chapel on a september morning in 1944 
when his carrierbased torpedo bomber was reported shot down in 
flames in a raid on the japanese airstrips on chichi jima and again 
when word came that he had been plucked from a rubber raft in the 
pacific by a surfacing submarine the uss finback 
for george herbert walker bush the preppy years were 
essentially over when he entered yale in november l945 he was 
hardly your peter arno cartoon caricature of a yalie although 
typical of that first postwar term when three out of five were 
veterans and gray flannels were beginning to replace officer pink 
on the old campus 
bush was already married and soon to start a family he and 
barbara first lived in a quonset hut near the payne whitney gym 
then in a series of apartments the last one as he adlibbed after 
a recent campus speech so close to president charles seymours 
house you could look in the window and see his wife taking a 
bath 
poppy as he was still called sailed though an accelerated 
economics program in 2 years won the francis gordon brown prize 
as the outstanding junior and went on to earn phi beta kappa he 
also found time to burp baby george play three years of varsity 
baseball letter in soccer and take part in an occcasional 
fraternity beer bust at the delta kappa epsilon house 
his name didnt make the new haven police blotter for that riot 
after the pep rally on the eve of the cornell football game his 
l948 classbook supplied some vivid details just how many heads 
collided with billy sticks cannot accurately be counted nor how 
many rolls of toilet paper flew out of dormitory windows but there 
is someone who claims he personally stopped 31 trolley cars 
like his father before him and such diverse luminaries as 
william howard taft averell harriman henry luce archibald

the oldest and most secret of the societies anchoring yales old 
boy network he went through the rumored bonesmen never tell 
initiation of climbing into a coffin to confess his sins 
preferably erotic in the tomb the windowless brown 
sandstone club house 
although bush went 3 for 5 the big disappointment in his senior 
year was the baseball teams loss to the university of california 
in the national collegiate finals 
as one who knew him well in the preppy days has kept in touch 
since the college years and will be rooting for him in the 
electoral college old coach deke diclementi has a word of

about 25 million americans have left the land 
since 1930 as industry turned out larger tractors and combines and 
more effective chemical fertilizers and pesticides smallscale 
farmers simply couldnt match the costperbushel efficiency of the 
big operators but some neighborly farmers in one kansas community 
figure america needs the family farm for more than just food 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jack greeps wheat got cut bundled 
shocked racked hauled and threshed this year even though jack 
was not there to help 
nothing unusual about that in this northeastern kansas community 
of 109 friendly souls or for that matter in any other farming 
community in the land it is an axiom of rural living if a 
neighbor needs help you help 
jack greep a man with a mission died just after planting time 
his death may explain why his neighbors seemed to go at this years 
harvest of his wheat with a special fervor 
for the last 13 years of jack greeps life that would be from 
about the time the agricultural experts began predicting seriously 
the inevitable extinction of the american family farm jack had 
set aside each year two acres of wheat for the sole purpose of 
celebrating the values that the family farm represents 
the two acres survived the drought whether the values will 
survive is a question 
jack had the feeling said his widow jo greep sitting 
under a shade tree taking in the ageless scene of a wheat harvest 
in progress that all of what this means to all of us and 
really to the country would be lost if family farms vanished 
he started doing it i guess just for sentimental reasons what 
youre looking at is an oldfashioned threshing bee 
indeed and the labor involved just for old times sake 
demonstrated why the agricultural experts are likely right 
all that cutting bundling shocking racking hauling and 
threshing by all those sweating men and straining animals on jack 
greeps two acres now is done in one operation by one man in one 
airconditioned combine moving through miles of ripe wheat as 
effortlessly as a paddlewheel steamboat on a still lake but 
nowhere near as romantic 
what may be lost with the chaff of efficiency are those 
bedrock american values that norman rockwell celebrated and jack 
greep cherished and his willing neighbors still cling to 
well the family farm has been selfdestructing since long 
before combines came on the scene and not always because of world 
economics and drought the epitaphs of the 80s good old american 
knowhow was an earlier culprit 
about 25 million americans have left the land since 1930 at 
that time farm families represented onefourth of the nations 
population after world war ii as industry turned out larger 
tractors and combines and more effective chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides smallscale farmers simply couldnt match the 
costperbushel efficiency of the big operators 
now of the nations 22 million farmers fewer than 380000 are 
family farmers those whose only livelihood is farming they must 
compete against 130000 big operators who produce 75 percent of the 
nations food the federal office of technology assessment figures 
that by the year 2000 as few as 50000 largescale farmers could 
get the job done 
obviously says jo greepit isnt for food production that 
america needs family farms 
its for the spirit of neighborliness and fellowship youre 
seeing right out there in that field i dont say those qualities 
exist only in rural america not at all but i do think that if 
there is such a thing as a national character rural america has 
had a lot to do with shaping it symbolically 
if family farms were to vanish yes i feel it would be a 
national loss 
for one thing there would be no further reason for towns like 
longford to exist 
longford has one street a post office a store a grain 
elevator and an establishment called slims place where the 
handlettered sign out front advertises hamburgers amp ammunition 
and the handlettered sign inside says this is not burger king 
you get it my way or you dont get it at all 
if those fellows doing the threshing want something a little 
stronger than iced tea said slim patterson the proprietor 
this is where they will find it 
there is no question the men in the field were working up a 
thirst 
they took their turns pitching wheat bundles onto a flat wagon 
a rack they called it drawn by a team of belgian draft horses 
wide in the beam and docile 
they climbed atop the rack proving they still could and 
pitched the wheat onto the throbbing conveyor belt of the thresher 
old guys showing off for their wives who were frying chickens and 
mixing potato salad drought or not farmers never seem underfed 
a thresher this one of 1925 vintage is a marvelous contraption 
of a dozen belts and gears and wheels and levers a tractor as 
determined to keep going at age 52 as the men on the rack provides 
power for the thresher together they appear to get the job done 
to separate the wheat from the chaff 
and the men from the boys 
some of the youngsters wonder how we know how to work this 
thing matthew heigele shouted above the clatter of the belts and 
the wheels 
heigele explained how jack greep had acquired the thresher when 
a 90yearold neighbor died some years back an old tractor turned 
up in another barn harness in another wagons here and there and 
a tradition was born of tradition 
i dont think anybody would want to go back to this kind of 
threshing heigele said but i think its important to show 
this generation how we used to do it we helped one another farm 
by farm because there were only a handful of threshers in the 
whole county and that was the only way to get it done 
it got people together it reminded us how much we depend on 
one another thats a good lesson for everybody not just farmers 
i guess thats why ive been out here every year for the past 
13 its not only fun its important

they are the blue canoes the ships of the 
alaska marine highway system that serve as lifelines to waterbound 
towns in the states island regions but the ferries are also 
becoming more popular with tourists an inexpensive alternative to 
the cruise ships on the same scenic runs and therein lies the rub

the tugboat man is in the aft bar 
telling tales of giant waves and rolling barges 
families are homesteading the port side passenger lounge 
staking out seats with backpacks and grocery sacks sleeping on 
blankets spread in the aisle 
up on deck a tourist aims her videocam at sea otters splashing 
in the kelp as the ferry thrums past them at a steady 14 knots 
toward the rocklined passage of sergius narrows 
its another night on the mv leconte one of the nine blue 
canoes of the alaska marine highway system for 25 years the 
blueandwhite ships have served as taxis and tour boats to the 
waterbound towns of alaskas island regions 
but the system is struggling with increasing demand at all 
points car decks are filling more quickly as passengers come 
aboard in larger cars campers trucks and buses and the increase 
in walkon passengers is even greater 
george davidson director of the marine highway since 1986 
hopes to persuade the federal government to pay for several 
highspeed ferries at a cost of 5 million to 15 million each a 
longterm plan for the ferry system is being drafted as part of 
that campaign 
the ferries sail around the clock along a 3500mile route from 
seattle up alaskas inside passage and out a separate run across 
prince william sound and along the aleutian islands chain 
they carry more than 370000 people a year and 96000 vehicles 
from tractortrailer rigs to grocery vans and motorcycles kayaks 
and bicycles 
they keep many towns in milk meat fresh lettuce and fruit 
they carry villagers to their doctors in larger towns high 
school athletes to their rivals gyms winterbound residents on 
weekend joy rides 
babies have been born on board people have died 
you never really know what will happen says bill unkel the 
leconte purser its basically the same things you have anywhere 
else its just concentrated on a ferry 
the 235foot leconte is one of five village boats that serve 
as lifelines to the smaller logging and fishing towns and carry 
mostly local residents 
four larger sister ships the mainliners make the longest 
runs to and from seattle and prince rupert british columbia 
together theyre one of alaskas biggest tourist attractions a 
moneysaving alternative to the cruise ships that share their 
scenic routes the longest trip a 63hour voyage from seattle to 
haines costs 200 for an adult a 1hour run from homer to 
seldovia the shortest costs 12 
on the 408foot matanuska 112 staterooms and hundreds of 
tourists create the atmosphere of a floating hotel outfitted with 
binoculars passengers line the windows to scan for humpback and 
killer whales 
but their holiday enthusiasm doesnt disguise the nononsense 
nature of this public transportation ferry life is one part 
whalewatching cruise and one part city bus 
passengers seeking the gourmet buffets of cruise ships find 
instead cafeterias reminiscent of school lunch lines sailors 
double as parking attendants when the ferries are in port 
and amid the stern safety warnings on the car deck a sign 
instructs passengers they shouldnt wear their sheath knives on 
board 
some of our backtothefuture gentlemen come aboard with big 
bowie knives says matanuska purser charles bredehoft we do 
have a dress code 
the ferries stop at 31 communities visiting most of them at 
least every few days 
they run according to the tides and politics 
what town gets which ferry and when is a perennial battle at 
marine highway headquarters and within the alaska legislature 
lawmakers control the ferry budget and thus can sway its 
management 
as the system celebrates 25 years of service the state also 
faces longrange questions about the future of its aging fleet 
some want to replace the slowbutsteady diesel ships with 
speedier catamarans others say the fleet should be trimmed that 
the state cant keep a 64 millionayear ferry system afloat 
boosters argue that the states subsidy about half the total 
cost is small change compared to tourist business generated by 
the ferries 
and yet others say tourism is overshadowing the ferries first 
purpose providing a highway where roads cant be built 
davidson says basic transportation is the systems most 
important service 
it is understandable people would peg tourism development on the 
ferry schedule but they stand the risk of losing a crucial ferry 
if theres more demand elsewhere for local residents use he says 
skagway learned that lesson last year the tourist town has been 
trying to build its winter business but was foiled when a weekend 
ferry from juneau was canceled so residents on prince of wales 
island could get to ketchikan more often 
some ferry workers question the life span of the current fleet 
three ships the malaspina matanuska and taku have been in 
service since the marine highways first year of operation 1963 
the chilkat is even older the territorial government bought it 
in 1957 to replace the areas first ferry a war surplus navy 
landing craft that was privately run beginning in 1949 
the youngest ferry is the aurora built in 1977 
ferry officials also are considering changing the systems 
southern terminus alaska ferries now dock in downtown seattle but 
bellingham and tacoma are vying for a new contract to be signed 
next year 
one of the big complaints of the systems 850 employees is the 
lack of doctors on board pursers trained as emergency trauma 
technicians have to handle whatever injuries occur until the 
ferries can get to port 
bill unkel the leconte purser says his biggest hassle is 
calming tourists when a ferry is delayed by loading problems or 
weather 
the tourists think theyre on a tour boat they dont 
understand our main job is to get from point a to point b 
unkel says 
no 2 on his headache list are the ferry runs crowded with 
children the ferries sell 10000 tickets a year to alaska students 
bound for little league games swim meets music competitions and 
other activities in their neighboring towns 
most passengers say it is the pleasure of a ferry ride that 
makes them take the marine highway instead of an airplane 
weve seen glaciers and weve seen bald eagles and weve seen 
whales and a lot of things weve never seen before says lynette 
smith a texan traveling on the leconte with her mother its so 
easy

a new survey suggests there may be more giant 
pandas in the wilds of china than previously thought but wildlife 
experts say they are becoming increasingly endangered by humans 
encroaching on their turf an international debate is also raging 
over chinas practice of loaning the animals to american zoos 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
scientists and conservationists who rallied 
to save the rare giant panda when its favorite food ran out are 
sharply divided over what to do next 
the world wildlife fund a conservation group and chinas main 
foreign partner in panda research recently turned to the us 
courts to determine if chinese panda loans to american zoos are 
exploitative as it says or educational as china says 
some chinese and western experts say china should do more to 
breed captive pandas while others say the only solution is to move 
humans from panda reserves 
even the size of the panda population is under debate the world 
wildlife fund is preparing to release survey results that put the 
number of pandas in the wild at 1100 to 1500 startlingly higher 
than previous estimates 
a 1977 chinese survey put the figure at 1000 and the 
population is known to have dropped since then due to poaching and 
a shortage of the pandas favorite food bamboo 
ken johnson a university of tennessee zoologist who led the 
survey says the earlier count was sloppy and too conservative 
but zhou shoude the deputy director of chinas largest panda 
reserve the 800squaremile wolong nature reserve near chengdu in 
southwestern china discounted johnsons figures which were based 
largely on a count of panda nesting areas and droppings 
the experts agree however that the panda is steadily 
decreasing in number and that five years after an international 
alert went out to save it the outlook is grim 
there are more pandas than we expected johnson says but 
they are more critically endangered than we expected 
pandas blackandwhite bearlike animals that some say are 
related to the bear and some say to the raccoon are native only to 
china experts believe their ancestors lived 20 million years ago 
contemporaries of the mastodon and other extinct species 
a few hundred years ago pandas still roamed the lowlands but 
humans gradually pushed them into the mountains of western chinas 
sichuan gansu and shaanxi provinces the only places they now live 
in the wild 
world attention was drawn to their plight in 1983 when their 
dietary staple arrow bamboo flowered and died as it does every 40 
or more years the world wildlife fund collected more than 41 
million toward saving the animal and the chinese government and 
citizens contributed millions more 
more than 62 animals starved before the bamboo began growing 
again a few years later 
that crisis over experts are looking more critically at chinas 
conservation program they acknowledge chinas limited resources 
praise its good intentions and press for more action without 
agreeing on the best course 
except for the pandas theres not a lot thats black and 
white about it ken cook a spokesman for the world wildlife 
fund said in a telephone interview from washington 
china is dealing sternly with one obvious problem poaching 
its highest court last year ordered panda killers be given long 
prison terms or even the death sentence 
china has been less decisive however in dealing with another 
human problem ordinary peasants their encroachment on the rare 
animals turf including inside chinas 12 panda reserves advances 
steadily 
more than 4000 peasants live in wolong which became a showcase 
for panda conservation in 1980 when the world wildlife fund helped 
build a breeding center there the peasants terraced corn and 
potato crops climb high up the slopes of mountains roamed by pandas 
johnson believes the peasants must be moved if not from 
wolong then from other reserves 
theyve already destroyed wolong essentially he says 
human settlements have marooned the pandas in small groups on 
mountain tops preventing them from mingling in the mating season 
and creating the danger of localized inbreeding he says 
johnsons solution is to move humans from critical areas and 
plant corridors of trees and bamboo between panda habitats so they 
can roam freely and mate naturally something he said pandas have 
no trouble doing in the wild

chinese officials while agreeing in theory show no signs of 
acting wolongs deputy director zhou says he tries to 
educate the peasants in the hope they will leave voluntarily 
but he has no fallback plan if they dont 
johnson dismissed breeding centers artificial reproduction and 
chinese efforts to develop testtube pandas saying we dont 
have that much time 
however other scientists believe wild pandas cannot be saved in 
adequate numbers and that breeding centers are needed to 
repopulate the forests here too chinas program falls short 
you need one person who knows exactly where all the pandas are 
and their histories says devra kleiman assistant director of 
research at washingtons national zoo 
captive pandas kept mainly in pairs in zoos should instead be 
kept in large breeding centers where they would have greater 
chances of finding compatible mates she says at a minimum she 
adds zoos should cooperate in breeding their pandas 
william conway director of the new york zoological society and 
designer of the wolong breeding center agreed on the need for two 
or three national breeding centers where pandas could be carefully 
managed in an accelerated propagation program 
but chinese zoos cooperate little the forestry ministry in 
charge of conservation said it does not even keep count of how 
many pandas are in captivity in china official media reports say 
there are more than 80 
wolong with eight captive pandas puts males and females 
together only for the brief spring mating season as do many zoos 
then relative strangers and unable to act out their elaborate 
mating rituals of the wild the pandas are notoriously uninterested 
in romance 
according to chinese count captive pandas worldwide have 
produced fewer than three dozen surviving cubs 
i dont think anyone is pleased with the progress that has 
been made in captive breeding cook says he said the fund was 
disappointed that the breeding facility it helped build in wolong 
had only produced one panda born in 1986 
wang menghu of the forestry ministry says breeding has suffered 
from too little equipment and trained staff 
but he says chinas efforts compared well with other countries 
noting that few western zoos with pandas have been able to produce 
surviving offspring 
it was breeding and money that dragged the panda into the us 
courts 
in a suit still pending the world wildlife fund and american 
association of zoological parks and museums accused the us fish 
and wildlife service of allowing commercial exploitation of pandas 
on loan to us zoos from china 
six us zoos have borrowed separate pairs of pandas for short 
periods paying china up to 500000 and in turn reaping millions 
in ticket and concession sales dozens of other zoos are hotly 
competing for pandas 
our concern was that the number of loans was increasing 
sharply cook says 
the lawsuit failed to stop the loan of two wolong pandas to the 
toledo ohio zoo in may however the fish and wildlife service 
refused to let another panda pair be shown at the michigan state 
fair saying it would disrupt their breeding in china 
it also suspended consideration of future panda loans including 
one planned for the atlanta zoo for september while it works out a 
new policy among other things the service said it wants proof 
china uses the fees it gets for conservation 
chinas government has not responded but its association of 
zoological gardens announced a ban on panda loans where foreign 
organizations might profit implying the commercialism was on the 
other side 
wang of the forestry ministry said the halt in panda loans was 
americas loss it makes no difference to us he says its 
not as if china goes around saying will you take a panda 
but cook says he hopes the suit will make a difference by 
ending chinas loans of breedingage pandas and requiring us zoos 
to use panda revenues for conservation 
we are not optimistic about the species right now he says

in a pioneering program begun a year ago at a 
cleveland clinic doctors are making infertile women pregnant by 
taking eggs from a volunteer donor fertilizing them with the sperm 
of the recipients husband and implanting the eggs in the 
recipients uterus there have been some successes and some 
failures but the director of the program says were on the 
right track 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
two women told repeatedly they were hopelessly 
infertile because they lack ovaries have become pregnant through an 
anonymous egg donor program 
to protect their privacy the cleveland clinic has closely 
guarded the identities of the two women describing them only as in 
their early 20s one a housewife and another a farm wife one lives 
in ohio the other in another state 
these are women who have been told for years and years they 
would never get pregnant says dr martin m quigley who directs 
the program at the clinic they were as sterile as you could 
get 
the two women are the first successes in a program that involves 
taking eggs from a volunteer fertilizing the eggs with the sperm 
of the recipients husband and implanting the fertilized egg in the 
recipients uterus 
as far as we know we are the only people in the world that 
have a voluntary anonymous egg donor program quigley says 
since the program began a year ago eight women have undergone 
fertilized egg implants in addition to the two pregnancies four 
women have failed to become pregnant so far and two are awaiting 
pregnancy tests 
were on track quigley says 
when the program was announced the cleveland clinic received 
500 inquiries in the first week more than 90 percent of them from 
women interested in donating eggs to infertile women 
unlike sperm donors for artificial insemination womens eggs 
are a heck of a lot more difficult to come by than mens sperm 
quigley says 
the clinic invited 68 women to go through a rigorous donor 
screening program which includes a medical history psychological 
evaluation detailed briefing on the procedure and the possible 
risk and a review by an ethical expert who makes sure the donor 
understands everything 
a key part of the program quigley says involves matching egg 
donors and recipients to try to provide women with babies similar 
in physical appearance to what they might have expected if they had 
become pregnant naturally 
the matching has been incredible quigley says 
he recalls that one day one of his aides familiar with one of 
the women in the matchup was able to pick out the other woman as 
she waited in a cafeteria line because they looked so much alike 
he says the screening also weeds out donors who might have 
sexually or genetically transmitted diseases 
the clinic and its staff make no promises about the type baby 
that might result a recipient consent document also warns that 
there is no guarantee the recipient will become pregnant 
the procedure usually takes about 20 minutes and can be 
uncomfortable quigley says donors are offered a painkiller 
the eggs are combined with the sperm and up to three of the 
fertilized eggs are inserted into the wouldbe mother using more 
than three at a time would increase the chances of a multiple 
birth quigley says 
donors are paid 900 to 1200 for their time involved in the 
screening subsequent blood testing and the actual egg collection 
were certainly not paying for eggs quigley says 
if the recipients become pregnant they face up to 12 weeks of 
hormone treatments because they lack the ovaries needed to control 
the hormonal body changes required to maintain a pregnancywe 
have to maintain the pregnancy artificially quigley says 
lori andrews an expert on reproductive law with the american 
bar foundation in chicago says we could see a case in which a 
woman who donated eggs as part of her own attempt to become 
pregnant through in vitro fertilization might sue for visitation 
rights with a baby created with her donor eggs 
but quigleys program faces less risk of such legal problems 
she says because donors are volunteers who are paid only for their 
time and effort he said they have no hope themselves of becoming 
pregnant through in vitro fertilization 
the only law in the nation regulating egg donations was enacted 
in louisiana to prohibit payments to a donor ms andrews says

gary cole about to make his tv series debut 
admits he still harbors some of the stage actors prejudice against 
television 
cole who lives in chicago where hes a member of the 
steppenwolf theater stars in nbcs new midnight caller which 
will makes its bow in november he plays a former san francisco 
police officer who continues to fight crime as host of a latenight 
callin radio show 
hell also be seen this fall in the nbc movie tentatively called 
daddy as a new father suddenly faced with raising his newborn 
son alone after his wife dies in childbirth 
cole is perhaps best known to television viewers for his 
performance as green beret doctor jeffrey macdonald who was 
convicted of killing his wife and two daughters in the 1984 
miniseries fatal vision 
sure ive had prejudices against television he says i 
still do 
but he adds there is quality television around 
as for his new series he says i hope that it relies on 
character as well as on how it looks i want it to have quality and 
be gripping 
so far coles only work on the series has been the pilot 
during the writers strike he went back to chcago but recently 
returned here for daddy work on the movie was completed in 
early september and he was off to san francisco to start midnight 
caller 
im grateful for the opportunity to do a series he says 
but its hard to know how to feel until it becomes a reality 
cole was doing landscape of the body at the goodman theater 
in chicago when he was signed for midnight caller 
the play was winding up a fourweek run and i pulled out the 
last week he says but i got a few days off from the pilot and 
flew back to chicago to finish the plays run 
cole plays jack killian in midnight caller he is still a 
san francisco plainclothes inspector nicknamed the mouth as the 
pilot opens 
what happens is that he accidentally kills his partner during 
a shootout he says by his own choice he decides to stop 
being a policeman then hes offered this callin radio show about 
crime prevention its people calling in about drugselling in 
their neighborhood battered wives even a guy i busted as a 
policeman who calls in to harass me over the air 
the pilots about finding a female serial killer she kills 
men married blond men then she begins to call the station we try 
to trace the call she winds up contacting me at home and we set up 
a meeting 
other regulars in the series are wendy kilbourne as the station 
owner dennis dun as the producerengineer and arthur taxier as his 
former boss and now his conduit to the police 
cole cant yet pin down killians character but the fact that 
hes called the mouth suggests to me hes outspoken and 
aggressive he says i think hes a little offcenter hes got 
a good sense of humor and hes outrageous on radio when we filmed 
the radio scenes some of the questions were just thrown at me and i 
adlibbed the answers 
cole grew up in the chicago area and for as long as he 
remembers wanted to be an actor as an 8yearold he lipsynced 
bill cosbys comedy albums he studied acting at illinois state 
university but left after three years to return to chicago to work 
as a bartender house painter and occasional actor at the 
steppenwolf theater he joined the remains theater in 1979 and then 
became an ensemble player with steppenwolf in 1986 
steppenwolf has a company of 21 actors he says some of 
the people have been working together since 1976 i knew most of 
them in college 
his first film work was as peter strauss younger brother in the 
tv movie heart of steel which told of the effect the closing a 
steel mill had on a community 
the turning point was his appearance in fatal vision i 
was doing sam shepards play true west in new york and some nbc 
people saw it he says nbc talent reps came to chicago looking 
for people for pilots and i talked to them i talked to them again 
when i did miami vice about three months later i got the role in 
fatal vision it turned out well it got me in places i might not 
have gotten into before 
last year he starred in joseph wambaughs echoes in the 
darkness based on a murder case in pennsylvania he played a 
state police homicide investigator whose dogged work over seven 
years helped solve the case 
hes also appeared on abcs moonlighting and on the 
twilight zone

julie harris who has spent much of the last 
seven years in television has come home to the theater and a 
yearlong tour in driving miss daisy 
not that she had deserted the stage completely while toiling on 
the cbs nighttime soap opera knots landing between seasons as 
the vulnerable often silly and very southern lilimae clements on 
television miss harris found time for short theater engagements 
particularly in her onewoman shows based on the lives of emily 
dickinson and charlotte bronte 
but knots landing occupied most of her career until she was 
written out of the show last fall when last seen on the program 
she and red buttons were riding off into the sunset in a motor home 
now the actress is on the road for real this time in a tour 
that began in detroit after labor day and will end next summer in 
los angeles why submit to the rigors of touring 
its a perfect play miss harris says in describing 
driving miss daisy which chronicles the 25year relationship 
between an elderly atlanta widow and her black chauffeur 
theres an absolute truth about it she adds its 
wellconceived and wellconstructed its like when you look in one 
of those small boxes and there are colors changing all the time 
thats the way working on something like this is its 
neverending the little feelings that eddy out from all the scenes 
go into the next scene 
the play still running offbroadway at the john houseman 
theater was a first effort by alfred uhry and won the 1988 
pulitzer prize for drama touring with miss harris are brock peters 
as the chauffeur and stephen root as her exasperated son 
uhry modeled the woman after his grandmother an elementary 
school teacher he and miss harris talked at length about the woman 
who died in 1973 at the age of 95 he relayed bits and pieces of 
the womans life to give the actress a better understanding of her 
character 
for instance he told me that his grandmothers curiosity was 
such that when she was reading she always had the dictionary beside 
her miss harris recalls she would look up words she didnt 
know be carried away by what she was reading in the dictionary and 
would end up reading that 
miss daisy is only the latest in a long parade of characters 
that the actress has brought to life on stage she has won five 
tony awards for her efforts 
she found small jobs in the theater when she first moved to new 
york in the mid1940s 
i was sort of a young character actress so there was a niche 
for me the oddball girl she recalls 
miss harris astonished broadway in 1950 when she played the 
lonely 12yearold tomboy frankie addams in carson mccullers the 
member of the wedding she was 24 at the time her costar was 
ethel waters in what many consider her greatest role 
ethel waters was a phenomenon of nature miss harris 
recalls she was like the force of niagara falls ive never 
experienced that same power from any other actress 
the next year she won her first tony award as the amoral 
hedonist sally bowles in i am a camera adapted from 
christopher isherwoods berlin stories other tonys arrived for 
her portrayals of joan of ark in the lark a 40yearold 
divorcee falling for a younger man in forty carats mary todd 
lincoln in the last of mrs lincoln and poet emily dickinson in 
the belle of amherst 
miss harris carries on in the old tradition of such acting 
greats as katharine cornell and alfred lunt and lynn fontanne 
performers who go out on the road with their shows 
i guess nothing could intimidate me anymore because i did the 
belle of amherst for so long in huge barns in tiny theaters in 
middlesize theaters and on basketball floors she adds 
i even did six weeks of onenight stands miss harris says 
there was no time to adjust you just slap the makeup on and do 
it some antenna tells you too much voice or too little 
voice 
that instinct for acting was born early 
i once heard an interview with laurence olivier who said both 
his parents loved the theater and so he inherited the wish she 
says that was his expression i think i did too because both 
my parents adored the theater and took us to the theater and talked 
about the theater 
by the time she was 14 she knew she wanted to be an actress 
my parents were very tolerant she says i dont think 
they took it seriously although i did 
miss harris still does even after more than four decades of 
acting 
i try to be adventurous especially in rehearsal she says 
i must try it and something will happen from trying it even if 
what im doing doesnt succeed ive learned the value in saying 
yes to everything eventually you may have to say no but say 
yes first 
that sense of adventure extends to looking for new works too 
today she spends a lot of time reading scripts 
now ive taken an idea for a play to the long wharf theater 
in new haven conn and theyve commissioned it to be written for 
jason robards and me miss harris says the plays about james 
joyce and his wife donald freed will write it but i wont be able 
to do it until late next summer at the very earliest but then 
part of the excitement of life is to work on something new

the diamond trap which leads off the 
season for the cbs sunday movie on sept 25 has career risks 
corporate intrigue tragedy and triumph and a lot of it took place 
before the cameras rolled 
the movie stars brooke shields twiggy howard hesseman and ed 
marinaro but the gold stars for putting it all together go to the 
executive producer jay bernstein 
bernstein a former publicist and top hollywood agent who 
boosted the careers of such performers as linda evans and farrah 
fawcett is not likely to produce the mother teresa story 
it would be too easy big script big stars lots of easy 
production money 
instead bernstein took a regulation thriller based on the novel 
the great diamond robbery from mystery novelist john minahan 
and insisted on miss shields and twiggy as the female leads for the 
script which had been revised eight times over 2 years by writer 
david peckinpah 
bernstein claims one of the best industry records for television 
movies with the seven he has done so far averaging a 33 share and 
none lower than a 31 share the term used by ac nielsen to 
describe the percentage of the overall tv audience viewing a 
particular show 
he knows how to hit the right audience buttons or in his words 
put the sizzle in the steak but wanting miss shields for the 
part and getting her were two different things 
he made a point of going to this years peoples choice 
awards to put the script in her hand the role for miss shields was 
that of a gallery employee who is part of a plot to steal 12 
million in jewels but the police including twiggy as a scotland 
yard detective persuade her to help them foil the crime 
the part of the sophisticated 30yearold would be the first 
adult role for shields a 23yearold princeton honors graduate 
she wanted it 
but not everyone wanted her she had to read for the role for 
bernstein for director don taylor for cbs and for columbia an 
unusual demand on someone who has already commanded major film 
roles 
certain people involved in the production were so worried 
about how to deal with a quote movie star on a 22day shooting 
schedule that the final compromise was to put part of my salary in 
escrow said bernstein in an interview if there was a problem 
the first money to be lost would be mine 
i told brooke i was going to do this and she said dont 
worry i wont let you down he said 
not only did she not let me down she made me very proud she 
is one of those people who everybody waits for to fail and 
shes succeeded said bernstein he called miss shields easy to 
work with and able to turn in a fine performance even with all 
this pressure on her 
there were other perils the project came to cbs just as the 
network leadership was going through a shakeup with cbs 
entertainment president donald grant leaving the network and kim 
lemasters replacing him 
it was about to be caught between the switches said 
bernstein there was something cbs wanted from me and it was 
hard to give but i went in and gave it to them said bernstein 
he didnt identify the sacrifice but most likely it was a 
different movie or series project 
and then i asked them for a favor afterward please let me do 
this and i wont let you down and now its their leadoff movie 
bernstein said 
but even after getting a green light there was the matter of 
financing 
the problem was the picture was too expensive to make 
bernstein said this picture was filmed in los angeles new york 
bristol bath wales and london with four major stars each of 
whom could be star of their own tv movie 
in the midst of grappling with finances bernsteins father 
jerome died of complications from a heart condition april 17 
bernstein has dedicated the movie to his father 
at the time my father died the picture was falling apart 
bernstein recalled on the day of my fathers funeral a person 
from cbs said to me dont worry its going to work out and 
another person from columbia said the same thing and they did it 
that means there are people functioning in these corporations 
they dont get an opportunity very often to express their emotions 
because everything is the bottom line but ive seen cbs and 
columbia come through big twice said bernstein he also got the 
studio and the network to restore the mike hammer series to the 
air after star stacy keach was imprisoned in england on cocaine 
charges 
the diamond trap faces the olympics on nbc and probably a 
broadcast of the movie romancing the stone on abc so bernstein 
knows he will not match the previous shares he has gained for 
television movies 
whatever i get in ratings share i would have gotten only 
half of it without these two women bernstein said

it seems unthinkable today that a major league baseball team 
could conspire to throw the world series but it happened in 1919 
say it aint so joe were the words that echoed through 
history when the infamous black sox scandal was mentioned 
writerdirector john sayles takes his cue from that line spoken 
by a young boy in fashioning eight men out a movie that is 
incisive touching and instructive without appearing to be a 
history lesson 
as the tragedy of the scandal unfolds two young boys who 
idolized the players and cadged dimes to buy tickets to games 
become symbolic of the baseball fans whose dreams were tied to the 
champion chicago white sox team that seemed a shooin to beat the 
cincinnati reds in the world series 
we meet the players at the height of their success a team with 
the grace of ballet dancers the naivete of children and the 
winning force of a steamroller hailed by the media and worshiped 
by fans they are in constant conflict with the teams stingy 
owner charles comiskey a fine bad guy portrayal by clifton james 
when sleazy gamblers including the infamous arnold rothstein 
michael lerner propose fixing the world series most team 
members are vulnerable david strathairn is a memorable example as 
eddie cicotte the aging pitcher who is denied a bonus and agonizes 
over selling out for his familys sake 
in true ensemble form all of the performances are top rate 
db sweeney is touching as the talented country boy shoeless joe 
jackson whose inability to read or write makes him prey to 
corrupting pressures it is he who turns away sadly from the 
childs plaint say it aint so joe 
as the fix sets in we see the expert players expertly losing 
game after game in the press box journalist ring lardner coolly 
portrayed by john sayles himself and hugh fullerton adeptly 
played by chicago writer studs terkel become sadly aware that the 
team soon to be derisively tagged the black sox has been 
corrupted 
the case leads to formation of the baseball commission and 
appointment of the first commissioner judge kenesaw mountain 
landis john anderson who punished all involved team members 
even those who didnt actively participate in the scam by barring 
them from professional baseball forever 
this is a mustsee film for baseball fans and an instructive 
entertainment for the rest of us as writer director and actor 
sayles hits three home runs

just before the bullets fly epic the gregg allman band 
 
fans of the allman brothers wont be disappointed with founding 
brother greggs latest solo effort which echoes the patented 
southern sound of the original group and paints a lyrical portrait 
of a rocker who has survived 
allmans bouts with various chemicals are wellknown and on 
just before the bullets fly he deals with that image right off 
the bat the first cut demons has him singing but oh hes 
got his demonsand they stay right by his sidethrough his everyday 
hell yeah 
later on oceans awash the gunwale he credits the music 
itself for saving him once more were cheating on the 
reaperwith all the gypsy still in our soulscause i know theres a 
god up there somewherewho must love rock and roll 
and its the music particularly allmans throaty blues vocals 
that keeps just before the bullets fly interesting 
guitarist dan toler formerly of dicky betts great southern 
band is the other major creative force here his bluesrock licks 
are predictable lots of long ringing guitar solos that recall 
greggs late brother duane allman but its become a classic sound 
and toler pays homage well 
the title song demons cant get over you and a new 
version of every hungry woman are vintage allmanstyle blues 
and gregg sings with a power and range you wont find on anything 
hes done since eat a peach 
a couple of other songs fail an attempt at jazzrock thorn 
and a wild rose sinks beneath the weight of its wash of 
synthesizers and mushy metaphorical lyrics and a pop song night 
games forces allman to try to sing bouncily and thats not his 
strength 
but the rollicking guitarpianoandorgan sound that fans of 
the original allmans know by heart is alive and kicking on just 
before the bullets fly and so is a rock n roll warrior gregg 
allman

big dreams in a small town rca restless heart 
 
the problem with this kind of countrybycommittee approach is 
that by the time everyone gets through the result is much like a 
modernday political platform it sounds nice enough and it wont 
offend anybody but its nothing to inspire the masses 
with big dreams in a small town restless heart gives us an 
album with 12 songwriters seven producers five vocalists nine 
songs and as a result no focus 
these five former nashville session players have lodged 
themselves firmly in the alabamaoak ridge boys league with mellow 
harmonies and professional musicianship but while those groups 
have managed to meld into a distinctive identity restless heart 
too often sounds like that staple of oldstyle country music shows 
the band playing a couple of tunes before the star takes the 
stage 
the bluest eyes in texas the current hit off this 
collection is as good an example as any what begins with a nice 
piano introduction from the classically trained david innis soon 
enough settles into nice harmonies that eventually pull lead singer 
larry stewart who really can sing into a nice vanilla morass 
the first half has its moments innis with some crafty pop piano 
on say whats in your heart reminiscent of the early billy 
joel and a solid group effort on the title cut a quintessential 
example of country pop 
but things start to get a little adventurous in the second half 
and not to good effect either a crowded swampwesternindian 
airofmystery motif for eldorado and an unfortunate try at 
funkiness in this time 
with so many talented singers running around restless heart 
still needs to find its voice or at least a chairman of the board

the hits epic reo speedwagon 
 
reo speedwagon has several strikes against it banal lyrics 
bland musicianship the lack of a distinctive band personality 
but they are unpretentious about their abilities no concept 
albums no save the world singles no 20minute guitar solos 
they just try to make hit singles and have often succeeded 
the songs on greatest hits are at worst uninteresting and 
at best instantly hummable reo speedwagon has lasted 20 years 
with only a couple of personnel changes and the songs on 
greatest hits date from 1973 to the present 
the bands limitations and strengths are typified by lead singer 
kevin cronin he isnt terribly soulful but cronin doesnt pretend 
to have a great voice and he handles fast songs and ballads equally 
well 
the three best songs come from 1980s bestselling hi 
infidelity keep on loving you take it on the run and 
dont let him go all have strong melodies and plenty of 
harmonies they dont hold up under close listening but sound good 
on the radio and the beach 
also included are the earlier singles time for me to fly 
and roll with the changes and their most recent hits cant 
fight this feeling and that aint love

oh hes a television actor is a common 
hollywood put down that michael j fox tom selleck bruce willis 
and ted danson have managed to overcome now mark harmon faces the 
same sneer 
the former dr bobby caldwell of st elsewhere has broken 
through with two major films this summer the presidio 
costarring sean connery and stealing home with jodie foster 
the presidio a bigbudget production that basically bombed 
at the box office featured harmon as a san francisco police 
officer investigating a murder on an army base in the more modest 
stealing home he is a minorleague ballplayer on the skids 
returning to his boyhood roots much of the film is told in 
flashbacks and harmon estimates he appears in only 3035 minutes 
of the 93minute running time 
id like to think that being a part of bigger pictures gives 
you the opportunity to be a part of ones you feel more passionately 
about he said theyre the ones that almost didnt get made 
for a lot of reasons 
stealing home is a project that has been around for seven or 
eight years long before i heard of it its a project that was the 
passionate consideration and concern of steve kampmann and will 
aldis who wrote and ended up directing the piece as firsttime 
directors 
last summer harmon made his movie debut as a star in the 
raucous comedy summer school directed by carl reiner he 
called it a turning point 
before summer school nobody was knocking on my door and 
saying hey we want mark harmon to star in a major motion picture 
for a film company he said it was carl reiner who actually 
took that by the horn and said this is the guy i want to play the 
role the fact that carl reiner had that belief in me and was 
indeed directing this summer fun movie made me willing to throw my 
hat in the ring and say ok lets try to make this thing work 
harmon was born into show business his father is tom harmon 
1940 heisman trophy winner at the university of michigan and a 
prominent sportscaster his mother is elyse knox actress in such 
1940s movies as abbott and costellos hit the ice and a wave 
a wac and a marine 
still he resists the notion that he grew up in hollywood 
its safe to say that i grew up in california he said 
certainly not hollywood hollywood seems to me very mainstream 
something im not too attuned to and never have been my folks sure 
werent im much better staying on the edge of it i begrudgingly 
come into town when i have to and yet i know this is where i work 
right now 
my mother had stopped being an actress by the time i was born 
i didnt even know much about my mom being an actress until i read 
about it in film books i was 7 years old before some kid in the 
park told me that my dad was a worldclass athlete and a great 
football player i went home and asked him thats the reality of 
how i was raised 
harmon first achieved prominence as star quarterback for the 
university of california at los angeles football team in 1972 and 
1973 he was asked if there is any correlation between playing 
football and acting 
theres some he said i know as an athlete i never played 
what i conceived as the perfect game where everything went the way 
it was drawn on the chalkboard thats the reason i played it 
loved it it was beautiful to watch when it all worked well 
as an actor i dont see ever doing a role that you cant make 
better or change somehow i like the fact that i can get up in the 
morning and hopefully grow and be better than when i started in the 
morning 
those are the same lessons i learned as an athlete i dont 
think it hurts to be competitive in this business its best to 
work hard at what you do and try not to let the effort show 
underneath it all im pretty tough and that comes from being an 
athlete 
harmon made his acting debut in an episode of ozzies girls 
and played 22 other tv roles before breaking into features with the 
1979 comes a horseman his greatest exposure came as the 
aidsdoomed doctor in st elsewhere and in the coors beer 
commercials a marketeer for the company once claimed that marks 
credibility is right up there with god and walter cronkite 
harmon 37 is unswayed by such comments or his selection by 
people magazine as the sexiest man alive of his profession he 
remarked 
this is what i do its a job and i respect it as that its 
also about all i do i have a family and i used to be a 
carpenter said harmon who is building a family home at big 
bear a mountain resort about 90 miles east of los angeles 
if this all disappears tomorrow i know i can still build 
houses

harlem street artist franco the great 
bebops a bit as he daubs the finishing touches on the belt of a 
dancing woman gyrating across a construction site fence 
as he brings his own brand of harlem to japan franco gaskin is 
completely oblivious to the trucks roaring past the summer sun and 
the sweat beads streaking the lenses of his glasses 
nothing you do for love or beauty gonna die he says his 
arms spreading wide to take in a 100foot mural of black men and 
women caught in the motions of the samba the jitterbug and the 
bump 
i know the japanese have a different picture of blacks i want 
them to understand the black people and their world 
its an intoxicating vision for a selftaught artist a sailors 
son who spent his boyhood in silence after a fall rendered him mute 
for 12 years 
to fill the void gaskin turned to art after he recovered his 
speech he moved to harlem where a decade ago he decorated his 
first storefront riot grate the depiction of a magnolia his 
japanese blossom tree was the germination of the kind of 
greatness to which a lonely boy aspired 
the work led to calls from other storekeepers more than 150 so 
far and a sort of international following after foreign travelers 
began touring harlems avenues gaskin has demonstrated his 
technique before african art classes and painted murals for french 
municipalities 
in july he arrived in this pacific port city summoned by 
japanese developers who liked his raw style le grand as his 
paintspattered coveralls proclaim was charged with injecting 
americanstyle verve into a neglected suburb selected as the site 
for an international shopping district 
we chose franco because hes very good for wall paintings 
said tatsuo nannichi a publicist for the honmoku development 
project he worked in france italy also africa and hes a very 
international person i think hes the symbol of new york 
the panamanianborn gaskin has a theme he calls harmony among 
the races it has been a dream to paint it in japan where he 
hopes to find sponsors who will provide a more permanent backdrop 
when we look at racism in my world im dealing with black and 
white but never with yellow never with brown people red 
people he says 
black and white is a contrast but it takes three or more 
colors to make harmony and since japan is a most powerful nation 
i figure it takes japan to link a lot of people around the world 
the project must wait until his next visit for now gaskin is 
happy that hes made a start 
i planted a seed in harlem and now the seed has grown into a 
beautiful tree he said i wanted japan to share a little bit 
of the black culture 
after two weeks work gaskins charcoal outlines were filled 
with browns oranges and magentas set off by a skyblue backdrop 
his section of corrugated steel canvas runs along a fourlane 
thoroughfare side by side with other temporary murals by japanese 
artists and art students 
in gaskins painted world everyone is smiling silver sparks 
fly from tambourines elbows jut hands clap a good bit of thigh 
shows as a chubby lady twirls her skirt 
i dont know art well but i feel this is live new york modern 
art fantastic said kazuhiko kitagawa a bank clerk and franco 
fan i saw his art in harlem last year and i met him he was 
wearing the same clothes 
on a recent sunday gaskin presented a franco award to one of 
the japanese art students standing on a clothcovered box in his 
coveralls his 6foot5 frame crowned by a colorful straw hat from 
a nearby festival gaskin read the proclamation in stumbling 
japanese to the student who shook his hand and scurried away 
japanese artists will get incentive from his art kitagawa 
said if japanese paint it becomes imitation he is real art

if the musical gods were to 
prophesize that a black woman who sang hearttugging folk ballads 
would top the charts in 1988 youd figure it would be a very good 
year for joan armatrading 
after all whoever heard of tracy chapman 
but no one ever said the gods were fair armatrading whose name 
frequently comes up when critics talk about chapmans work is 
still searching for that elusive hit 15 years and 13 albums into 
her recording career 
she quickly brushes off questions about the runaway success of 
chapmans debut record saying she hasnt heard her music 
aampm records doesnt shy away however in advertisements for 
armatradings new album the shouting stage the company says 
that while hundreds of singers are compared to her hundreds of 
thousands of her fans knew she was there first 
the company is banking on the current minirevival of the 
singersongwriter era to give armatrading a longsought boost to 
stardom 
personally i think its unfair that joan hasnt had the same 
breaks that tracy had said tom corson executive director of 
product development for aampm its more of a question of timing 
joan blazed the trails and tracys taken advantage of it 
actually there isnt much to the comparisons between 
armatrading and chapman beyond the superficial similarities 
chapman in her debut album features quiet introspective folk 
songs about love and societys treatment of the downtrodden 
armatrading sticks to personal politics her emotionally intense 
music an often exuberant mixture of rock reggae jazz and folk 
the songs are so achingly personal that people often assume 
theyre all autobiographical which would have given armatrading a 
pretty full emotional life over the past decade and a half 
i think of it as a compliment because the songs are written 
to be believed she said before one of the early dates in her 
current us tour theyre generally from something thats 
happened its just that its not necessarily from my things 
but i write it as if its about me 
the new albums title cut comes from a magazine article that 
theorizes every couple must go through a period of fighting to 
achieve true intimacy she said 
the song is written in the voice of a woman addressing her lover 
in the wake of this shouting stage her tone veering between 
resignation and vulnerability 
more controversial is the devil i know a searing indictment 
of a wandering man from a woman trying to keep him close to 
home thats already been taken to heart by many feminists 
one chap said to me that the difference between men and women 
is that men can distinguish between lust and love she said a 
man can have a onenight stand or an affair that lasts a couple of 
years and feel that hes being quite faithful to his real partner 
because its a purely sexual thing 
its women who have trouble thinking that if you go to bed 
with someone you dont love them she said wed like the two 
to go together 
the song she said is about the ageold double standard that 
seems to accept this behavior from men and condemn it from women 
if someone thinks theyve happened upon an album of menbashing 
the devil i know is immediately followed by the cheery living 
for you about the happy side of being wrapped up in a 
relationship 
armatradings live show is packed with playful energy almost 
mocking the stereotypes of the singersongwriter genre she bounces 
across the stage and trades some slightly choreographed dance steps 
with saxophonist jim ross 
the highlights come when she straps on an acoustic guitar for a 
bluesy i love it when you call me names and a version of van 
morrisons moondance 
her albums have become progressively harderedged throughout the 
1980s but the shouting stage quiets things down a bit it has 
a highly produced jazzy sound benefitting from such studio stars 
as mark knopfler and alan clark of dire straits 
as much as she liked it at the time armatrading said she cant 
listen to her 2yearold album sleight of hand without pulling 
the needle from the vinyl some of the songs she admits she finds 
irritable 
i was trying to write an album that i hope in a couple of 
years time people can sit and listen to just as much as they do 
today she said 
her record company will settle for people listening to it now 
corson said hes encouraged by the companys sales performance in 
the first few weeks of its release though disappointed by radios 
continued reluctance 
i think its a time of opportunity for us he said

on the seventh floor of londons mayfair hotel 
actress lindsay wagner was preparing the climactic scene in the tv 
movie voice of the heart 
the onetime bionic woman faced a difficult moment she must 
persuade her onscreen lover nick neil dickson that her past 
actions are less hateful than they once seemed 
do you need holding asked director tony wharmby wagner 
nodded yes and wharmby walked over to bolster her confidence 
by hugging her 
the scene is a buildup to the confession on which hangs the plot 
of barbara taylor bradfords 1983 bestselling novel whose tv 
version will be aired in two 2hour segments this winter over 
britains independent television network and in the united states 
on a network that has not yet been announced 
the 8 million movie promises all the ingredients of highclass 
soap opera a web of romance and deception exotic foreign 
locations and an emotionally stormtossed heroine named katharine 
tempest played by wagner 
voice of the heart is the third bradford book to be adapted 
for the screen 
she began writing 40 years ago at the age of 12 when as a 
youngster in an upper middleclass family in leeds england she 
sold her first story about a girl and her horse to a childrens 
magazine 
i think my destiny was sealed she recalled in an interview 
 
however her writing was put on hold while she set out to 
experience life i dont think you can earn a living at the age 
of 16 writing novels 
in her eagerness to gain that knowledge she shunned college and 
became a typist at the yorkshire evening post she was promoted to 
cub reporter in six months a year later at age 18 she became 
womens page editor and by age 20 moved to londons renowned 
newspaper row fleet street she married american film producer 
robert bradford in 1963 and moved to new york at the time she was 
writing a syndicated column on interior design that ran in 185 us 
newspapers however the desire to write fiction began to nudge 
her she started her first novel in 1970 and had started three 
others by 1975 
then came a woman of substance which she called the story 
of a strong woman who makes it in a mans world when women were 
not doing that 
when i started to write those initial pages i really felt 
very excited because i somehow knew in my bones this was the 
book i was going to finish and the book that would be right she 
said 
the hardcover version has sold more than 11 million copies since 
1979 and the paperback topped the new york times bestseller list 
for 43 weeks it also was made into an acclaimed syndicated tv 
miniseries 
her second voice of the heart sold 25 million copies in 
the united states her third hold the dream was also a best 
seller 
voice of the heart costars james brolin as the dashing 
actordirector victor mason and victoria tennant as francesca 
cunningham avery the historical biographer who vies with actress 
katharine for victors affections 
theres a whole person in there and the persons hurting 
said the 39yearold wagner in an interview halfway through the 
10week shooting schedule 
ive got to humanize her to make her emotionally accessible 
to people she said looking sleeker and more composed than she 
would later that afternoon when she donned a bathrobe to play the 
frazzled katharine 
shes a very exaggerated kind of character in the fact that 
shes eccentric and neurotic in the story if we dont 
sympathize with her then theres no payoff at the end 
victoria tennant said she was drawn to the premise of the film 
the drama pivots on a white lie that is told that seems 
harmless to the liar and yet devastates the lives of everyone 
involved said the softspoken english actress 
i think its quite telling she said of the plot idea 
when you think of all the information that is being thrown at you 
and how you deal with it you think thats not impossible you 
could hear something and it could change your life 
voice of the heart is a contemporary drama said the 
elegantly coiffed bradford whose a woman of substance and 
hold the dream also were made into tv movies they dealt with 
the department store dynasty of emma harte and starred deborah 
kerr 
its very uptodate its got a touch of the present she 
said katharine is one of those strange mixedup weird women 
like wagner bradford insisted that katharine arouse sympathy 
shes not a bitch the writer said shes a complex and 
complicated woman and a marvelous actress who has this frigidity 
which all goes back to the time when she was molested as a child 
although her novels have been filmed and a fourth act of 
will is to follow bradford said if i wrote a book with the 
ultimate goal of a tv or movie screen i think id be cheating the 
reader 
im actually competing with tv because i want to hold the 
reader i dont want the reader saying oh this is just a lot of 
dialogue i cant visualize any of it im going to turn on war 
and remembrance 
she insists on having her husband as executive producer on all 
her tv adaptations 
a lot of hollywood producers buy a best seller keep the title 
and throw the contents away she said bob believes you put 
onscreen the story thats in between those two covers

two russian gospel singers are spreading a 
message of christianity and speaking out against communism which 
they say drove them from the soviet union 
nikolai pankratz and his brother peter are leaders of the 
sixmember gospelrock band ruscha the slick harddriving group 
is on the road doing 150 concerts a year playing mainly for 
youngsters who hear 90 minutes of rousing music and then 15 minutes 
of religious and patriotic messages 
we are cruising across america grabbing people by the neck 
and saying wake up youve got it good but you are taking your 
freedom for granted and you shouldnt do that one day you may wake 
up and be under persecution yourself said 31yearold nikolai 
people dont believe that will happen he said but we 
grew up under communism and we have a very great fear of it 
spreading across the world 
the brothers said their family was persecuted in the soviet 
union for being christians and attending underground churches in 
1963 they said the soviet secret police came to their house and 
took their grandfather away 
he was dragged out in the deep snow in his pajamas said 
29yearold peter he pointed toward heaven meaning hed see us 
again thats the last time we saw him he arrived in a casket two 
months later he had frozen to death in siberia 
the two said their family of eight after four years of 
negotiation paid 3000 a person to leave the country in 1974 and 
relocate in bonn west germany where an aunt lived 
theres no way to leave unless you sell everything you have 
peter said we sold the only cow we had the chickens we had the 
pigs we had we sold our house and other people pitched in and 
helped us financially 
from germany the brothers came to the united states on student 
visas nikolai in 1978 peter a year later learning english 
without formal lessons they studied at the word of life bible 
institute in upstate new york for a year they then enrolled at 
jerry falwells liberty university in lynchburg va where they 
received undergraduate degrees 
he really helped us out nikolai said about falwell we 
didnt know anything about america he kind of took us under his 
wing our whole life in this country started right there we sang 
in his church and on his tv show he financed an album and got us 
into his school 
the two have since decided to make their home in dickson about 
40 miles west of nashville 
they first began performing under the name russia but learned 
that the name had a bad connotation in the united states because 
of the name their touring bus was vandalized several times 
we got fed up and did something about it peter said 
americans dont realize there could be good russians 
they changed the spelling to ruscha 
the twoyearold band now consists of the brothers plus 
americans andy denton michael jackson billy williams and scott 
beck 
their debut album come alive was released earlier this 
year their first single is come home which has been no 1 on 
the gospelrock charts in many cities 
their concerts are mostly in auditoriums and some in churches 
we play some places no one else goes nikolai said people 
are getting to know us thats pretty good 
we want to get a message across through our music its a 
vehicle we try to tell the american people that people dont know 
what its like under communism also wed like to educate them 
that its a dangerous thing and that there is an answer to life 
god 
what we are trying to do is what a lot of people of america 
are failing to do be able to grab kids attention and say dont 
be a lazy bum support your government support your country stand 
up for the rights of america 
if were able to change the young peoples attitude toward the 
country change their lifestyle away from drugs and alcohol and sex 
and homosexuality then i think weve done a whole lot more good 
than 99 percent of the churches in america 
the brothers are not us citizens but this is a goal 
wed love that more than anything else peter said

dont expect the tower of babel to tumble but 
computer scientists are breaking down language barriers with 
machines that can translate languages in seconds and recognize 
speech regardless of accent 
where can it lead to said national science foundation 
assistant director bill wulf how big is your imagination 
need to call tokyo hotel switchboards within a few years will 
be able to connect englishspeaking callers to a special computer 
that translates their words into japanese then responds by machine 
in english 
stuck in a foreign hospital patients and doctors who speak 
different languages will be able to communicate via computer in 
about a decade 
traveling abroad and cant speak the language forget a 
dictionary plan on packing a pocket translator 
too busy to type information into the computer just dictate 
the list goes on and on including eyeglasses for the deaf with 
screens that provide transcripts of conversation and the ability 
to order merchandise like plane tickets by talking on the phone to 
computers 
one of the most distinguishing characteristics of human beings 
is our ability to communicate wulf said what youre seeing 
here are techniques that improve that ability 
companies are beginning to cash in on voice recognition programs 
even while experts are trying to make the computers capable of 
dealing with the ambiguity of human language bad grammar and 
different accents among other things 
we need to reduce the costs and increase the size of the 
vocabulary and increase the capabilities said raj reddy 
director of carnegie mellons robotics institute all of those 
are yet to be solved 
what is there is obviously a very significant improvement over 
what we used to know how to do even six months ago 
dragon systems inc of newton mass developed a program xerox 
corp used in 1986 to save nearly 10 million by inventorying all 
22 million of its parts for the first time said dragon assistant 
marketing manager jonathan robbins 
the 100000 system recognized 1000 words a 5000word program 
is out and a 20000word version is expected by early 1989 said 
robbins dragon also is working with the federal defense advanced 
research projects agency to develop a voicecontrolled jet fighter 
cockpit 
kurzweil applied intelligence inc of waltham mass has 
developed voice recognition systems for radiologists and emergency 
rooms doctors dictate their reports to a computer and the reports 
are printed the programs originally recognized 1000 words but 
the vocabulary has been expanded to 5000 
more than 100 us hospitals use the radiology system voicerad 
and about a dozen have voiceem for emergency rooms said spokesman 
martin schneider 
both dragon and kurzweils systems require brief pauses between 
words and must be trained to recognize each speaker 
most of us dont speak properly most of the time said 
reddy president of the american association for artificial 
intelligence if you transcribe anybodys voice there are all 
types of pauses and repetition hums and haws which we know how to 
ignore computers dont know that yet 
either we have to come up with ways to deal with this or we 
have to teach people to speak right said kaifu lee a carnegie 
mellon researcher who has developed a speech recognition system 
known as sphinx 
its a slow complex task because human language is rife with 
ambiguity unlike mathematical scientific or computer language 
take for example this sentence the box is in the pen 
for humans its obvious because we all know that the box 
cannot be in the writing pen through our unconscious kind of 
common sense said masaru tomita associate director of the 
carnegie mellon university center for machine translation 
if you want computers to do this its going to be very 
difficult tomita said the computers have to know the typical 
size of a box and the typical size of a pen one thing we can do 
very quickly is that whenever the word pen appears we can assume 
its a writing pen but on the other hand then the system will 
make mistakes 
a classic example of machine misinterpretation involves the 
epigram the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak early 
translating systems turned that into the vodka is good but the 
meat is rotten 
lees sphinx unlike earlier systems can identify english words 
spoken continuously it boasts up to 96 percent accuracy 
identifying 997 words people dont have to spend hours training it 
to recognize their speech patterns and minor variations in accent 
pose little problem 
its the first system that has all these capabilities said 
lee 26 who has been working on sphinx for 1 years funded by the 
defense advanced research projects agency 
sphinx transforms spoken words from changes in air pressure into 
changes in voltage each 10millisecond slice of sound is assigned 
a string of digits and through a mathematical process matched 
with other sequences to yield the word with the best possible 
meaning so time isnt wasted searching the entire vocabulary 
sphinx takes syntax into account 
tomita 30 who plans to work this fall with lee has developed 
a system capable of recognizing 100 words of doctorpatient 
dialogue in japanese then translating the japanese into english 
uttered by a computers speaker 
the computer transforms the spoken japanese into its written 
equivalent which is translated into written english and sent to 
another part of the computer that generates english speech 
tomita also has devised a program that translates written 
english or japanese into written english japanese or german a 
hypothetical exchange between a doctor and patient i have a 
headache or take two aspirin is typed into the computer and 
the translation appears within seconds 
like sphinx tomitas 1000word systems consider context 
he hopes to increase the programs vocabularies and eventually 
expand them to conversation used in making hotel reservations and 
registering for conferences his work is funded in part by ibm 
corp of tokyo 
we need to pick some domain where its very very defined 
always clear what youre talking about he said 
the need for translating systems is considerable especially for 
those not fluent in english according to tomita who counts 
himself in that category 
there are more than 3000 world languages and dialects said 
jaime carbonell director of the center for machine translation 
americans dont seem to be aware of the fact that maybe 90 
percent of the world population doesnt speak english at all 
said tomita but everywhere you go there is somebody who can 
speak english 
because of that smugness and sense of superiority as well as 
insufficient funding machine translation has received scant 
attention in the united states since the 1960s experts say most 
work has been in europe and japan 
the man on the street may or may not directly benefit from a 
machine translation system wulf said on the other hand he 
may benefit indirectly from american scientists being able to 
interact better with the russian or the japanese or the french 
scientists

computer scientists have machines talking but 
linguists and philosophers are in demand to help put the words in 
their mouths 
the last few decades have really seen a kind of merger of a 
technical tradition in the humanities that merger has created a 
lot of opportunities said clark glymour head of carnegie mellon 
universitys philosophy department more people are being drawn 
into it and not for the traditional reasons 
in general programmers are a dime a dozen glymour said 
what is needed are people who can take vaguely formed problems 
and find ways to make them precise enough to be programmed 
american colleges and universities conferred 41889 bachelors 
degrees in computer science and 40521 in psychology during the 
198586 academic year the latest figures available from the 
national center for education statistics that compares to 3265 in 
philosophy and 470 in linguistics 
to help meet the demand for computerconscious philosophers and 
linguists carnegie mellon and the university of pittsburghs 
linguistics department have developed a doctorate program in 
computational linguistics 
the goal is to produce people who can do more than merely write 
computer programs based on others ideas who can in fact develop 
programs that better understand and emulate how humans talk and 
think 
you cant have really robust healthy technology without a 
science behind it and we dont yet have the science said 
richmond thomason professor of linguistics and philosophy at the 
university of pittsburgh so what we have to do is learn enough 
about human language and reasoning to understand what it is were 
trying to do once we get these machines to do something 
sixteen students have been accepted into the program one of 
only a few in the world in its two years of existence those 
skilled in the area have landed highpaying highpowered jobs 
unlike many of their more traditional brethren 
there is a certain kind of stereotype about philosophy thats 
quite popular glymour said think about what would distress a 
parent more than to pay a hefty tuition and discover sammy or 
samantha is going to study philosophy the stereotype is a 
completely impractical and perhaps an even selfindulgent endeavor 
the fact of the matter is 20th century philosophy has 
created through various pieces of work all kinds of technical 
traditions

a 70foot dinosaur known as happy stood 
prominently on display at the cleveland museum of natural history 
for nearly 25 years before researchers discovered it was a new 
species 
four months before it announced that finding in july the museum 
said it had discovered a new dinosaur nanotyrannus based on a 
skull that had been in the basement for decades 
this spring a california researcher found the fossil remains of 
a marine reptile called a masasaur so wellpreserved that the 75 
millionyearold animal still had scales on its skin and food in 
its stomach it was in a natural history museum of los angeles 
county warehouse 
paleontologists say the finds arent surprising museum 
storerooms have become rich hunting grounds for new species because 
a lack of money and staff has delayed the identification of bones 
excavated up to 60 years ago 
in general paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it 
can be prepared said michael e williams who helped identify 
happy a 140millionyearold relative of the brontosaurus 
there are museums which have skeletons still in plaster 
jackets going back to the turn of the century 
researchers at the cleveland museum had determined that 
happy was a haplocanthosaurus but didnt realize it 
represented a new and larger species and named it delfsi 
after the researcher who found the bones 30 years ago until they 
recently had time to study it more closely 
literally there is so much material to collect and save from 
weathering and erosion that we are just decades behind said 
lawrence g barnes curator of vertebrate paleontology at the 
natural history museum of los angeles county i could walk in to 
the smithsonian or any museum and find 80 or 90 new species of 
whales or dolphins which is my specialty 
barnes estimated that the museum had 300 to 400 plaster jackets 
in storage encasing everything from dinosaurs to mammoths and 
that 75 percent of the museums collection has not been examined 
closely 
even at the wellfunded smithsonian institution it took half a 
century to study and identify fossils excavated by 19th century 
dinosaur researcher oc marsh that form the bulk of the museums 
collection according to research curator nicholas hotton 
when marsh died we got seven big big train carloads of 
dinosaur bones hotton said researcher cw gilmor worked on 
marshs fossils for nearly 50 years and there is a bunch of 
stuff gilmor didnt get to 
fossils stored at the smithsonian have almost all been 
identified he said we dont anticipate any surprises but 
thats silly because we can always get surprised 
field museum of natural history researchers in chicago have 
spent 10 years working through the collection of unstudied fossils 
some of them in storage for decades said john bolt chairman of 
the geology department 
weve made quite a bit of progress at reducing that backlog 
bolt said 
mary dawson curator of the carnegie museum of natural history 
in pittsburgh said some of the fossils still stored in plaster 
jackets at the museum date to 1922 with only five paleontologists 
on the staff many of those blocks will have to remain in storage 
four years ago a national science foundation grant let carnegie 
researchers open an old plaster block they found the only known 
complete hind foot of a stegosaurus 
we liken our collection to an iceberg with onetenth above 
the surface and the rest waiting for study miss dawson said 
most of the work done at the museum is based on specimens the 
researchers collect themselves so much of the collection in 
storage will remain unstudied she said we know we should stay 
home and study the collections we already have but its such a 
challenge to get out in the field 
were really putting apples back on the tree when we do this

doctors may be too quick to prescribe powerful new 
cholesterolreducing drugs with unknown longterm effects when 
exercise change of diet or more proven drugs might do as well 
specialists say 
there is a general suspicion that some of the drugs that 
control cholesterol are overprescribed when diet and weight loss 
alone may suffice said dr james willerson professor of 
medicine and chief of cardiology at the university of texas 
southwestern medical school 
if exercise and diet dont work in four to six months drugs 
ranging from the proven like bile acid resins and niacin to the 
new like gemfibrozil and lovastatin can be useful said dr wayne 
peters an assistant professor at the university of colorado school 
of medicine 
lovastatin lowers the bloods lowdensity lipoprotein which 
delivers the cholesterol that builds up in the arteries 
gemfibrozil increases the levels of highdensity lipoprotein which 
carries cholesterol away to be destroyed 
the two drugs are so easy to take so impressive in their 
effects on lowering cholesterol that many physicians start out 
with them first which is not an nih recommendation peters said 
recently in dallas 
the national institutes of health has designated colestipol 
cholestyramine and nicotinic acid or niacin as drugs of first 
choice the first two are bile bile acid resins which have been 
been available for more than 20 years 
the two newer drugs can also be considered said peters an 
assistant professor of medicine and preventative medicine and 
biometrics who addresses doctors groups and consumers on 
cholesterollowering drugs 
but most cholesterol experts think they should only be 
considered after patients are using niacin and bile resins in small 
doses 
lovastatin is very effective in lowering the ldl component 
he said it is quite well tolerated a pill like gemfibrozil but 
the longest it was used in humans is five years we have really no 
idea what the longterm safety record will be 
practicing physicians are overprescribing that medicine 
without giving patients an informed choice do you want a little 
inconvenience but we know its safe or would you rather choose 
convenience and a question mark as far as lovastatin safety 
lovastatin was approved in 1987 by the food and drug 
administration 
it can be very effective willerson said lovastatin is a very 
important medication but the newer cholesterolfighting drugs are 
very powerful and it is important to be aware of what the options 
are 
i think there are some problems in that area said dr 
donald hunninghake director of the university of minnesota heart 
disease prevention clinic and author of the national cholesterol 
education programs adult drug therapy guidelines these come 
from many different areas 
one is patients are not given adequate time or instruction on 
diet that is related to the fact that physicians are not familiar 
with dietary therapy yet the other is that many physicians are not 
real familiar with the bile acid resins and nicotinic acid and do 
not have a true feel for incidence of side effects and the number 
of patients who can tolerate these drugs

the first human trials have begun to test 
the safety and proper dose of an experimental drug that may act as 
a decoy to attract the deadly aids virus and prevent it from 
invading human blood cells 
about 50 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or 
the less severe aidsrelated complex are participating in the 
sixmonth studies of the drug called rcd4 that began last month 
at san francisco general hospital new england deaconess hospital 
and the national cancer institute 
tests of the drugs effectiveness against aids will begin only 
after the safety and dosage trials are complete the researchers 
said 
the drug is a manufactured version of cd4 a protein on the 
surface of white blood cells the main targets of the aids virus 
the virus infects white blood cells by latching onto the cd4 
protein scientists hope injected rcd4 molecules might act as 
decoys so aids virus particles in a patients blood latch onto the 
rcd4 instead of real cd4 on white blood cells 
in that way the drug might slow the virus ability to spread 
from cell to cell thereby slowing or halting the progression of 
aids in an infected person it also might prevent white blood cells 
from being infected if it is given immediately after a person has 
gotten the virus in the bloodstream

satellite images and aerial 
photographs can provide a cheap way of finding south pacific 
islands suitable as new homes for endangered birds a researcher 
says 
janet franklin a graduate student in geography at the 
university of california santa barbara said by using aerial 
photos and computerprocessed satellite images of the cook islands 
she could distinguish tropical forest swamp brushland fern 
thickets and cultivated areas 
such information can be used to determine which isolated 
uninhabited islands are suitable for reintroduction and successful 
reproduction of endangered birds franklin said 
habitat information is prohibitvely expensive to obtain from 
field studies because because islands are spread over millions of 
square miles of the western pacific she said aerial photos of the 
cook islands can be bought for 2500 
where aerial photos dont exist satellite images can be bought 
for about 10 times that amount but thats still cheaper than 
conducting ontheground field studies or new aerial surveys she 
said 
in the past 2000 years polynesian hunters eliminated or 
sharply reduced populations of many land birds from many islands in 
the south pacific 
that is no longer a problem but the remaining birds are 
threatened by habitat destruction as well as introduced predators 
particularly cats rats and mongeese said franklin who hopes to 
protect endangered species by reintroducing them on uninhabited 
islands where they once thrived 
franklin outlined her study aug 16 at an american institute of 
biological sciences meeting

experiments on voice boxes removed from 
cadavers suggest that minor injuries to the larnyx may cause 
permanent damage to the voice if left untreated 
car crashes chokeholds strangleholds and other bluntforce 
injuries often cause minor fractures to the cartilage framework of 
the larynx or voice box which contains the vocal cords 
such fractures usually arent treated unless they interefere 
with breathing said dr robert stanley an assistant professor at 
the university of southern california school of medicine 
however stanley said his study suggests such fractures can 
cause longterm hoarseness or limit the range of pitch and pitch 
control 
the fractures while difficult to diagnose can be detected by 
cat scans and treated by intricate surgery in which wires are 
inserted into the voice box to restore proper alignment of 
cartilage stanley said 
in the usc study voice boxes were removed from five dead people 
and mounted on a special apparatus both in their normal condition 
and after minor injuries were simulated warm humid air was passed 
through the voice boxes in a manner similar to that in which a 
person speaks 
analysis showed that even minor fractures reduced the efficiency 
of each larynx in regulating air flow during the production of 
sound suggesting more laryngeal fractures should be treated than 
is customary stanley said

getting in touch with your feelings and 
thinking positively about yourself are fine but the best way to 
stave off the pangs of jealousy are to just get on with your life 
two psychologists say 
a positive attitude about yourself or selfbolstering seems to 
be the best way to prevent the depression that could follow 
jealousy but doesnt do much to much to keep away envy or jealousy 
itself the researchers say 
we like to think getting in touch with your feelings is a good 
thing that exploring how you feel will make you feel better 
said peter salovey a yale university assistant professor of 
psychology but we found that strategy actually made you feel 
worse in jealousyproducing situations 
those who are jealous of others success may long to curl up 
with a bowl of ice cream while recalling every word of praise ever 
uttered by family friends and acquaintances but that doesnt 
help said salovey who has studied jealousy for five years with 
yale professor judith rodin 
ignoring your feelings and getting on with your daily work and 
striving even harder for what you want works better salovey 
said 
a third coping strategy selective ignoring works in the short 
run by invoking the attitude its not so important to me 
anymore he said but i suppose there is a limit to how many 
times you can do that nothing is going to be important to you 
if you employ it all the time 
salovey and rodin asked 95 yale undergraduates in 198687 to 
rate the frequency of jealousyprovoking situations involving 
school family friends and romance how jealous they felt and how 
they coped their research will be published in the fall issue of 
the journal of social and clinical psychology 
jealousy is the worry that something you have will be lost to 
someone and envy is wanting something someone else has to the 
extent they do not run your life they may be healthy and 
helpful salovey said 
they are negative in what people is often a lot of anger 
sadness and occasionally fear but in the sense they can also help 
enrich our lives by letting us now what is important to us thats 
not so negative

thousands of jittery investors are jumping 
from the frying pan of a volatile stock market into the fire of 
gold swindles pushed by highpressure telephone sales operations 
state regulators said today 
the north american securities administrators association 
together with the council of better business bureaus issued an 
investor alert warning of a rash of highpressure boilerroom 
telephone scams promoting various schemes to buy gold at 
belowmarket prices 
we hope to alert the public to what is clearly the fraud du 
jour one that has earned the title the fools gold rush of 
1988 said james c meyer president of the regulators group and 
director of the tennessee division of securities 
project goldbrick a new mexicobased task force established by 
the regulators began tracking eight scams in the spring of 1987 
since then meyer said the number of known operations has 
mushroomed to 52 
he estimated tens of thousands of americans in all 50 states 
will lose 250 million this year 
it seems clear that the success of the new breed of gold 
swindle is attributable in large part to the decline in investor 
confidence since the black monday stock market crash of october 
1987 meyer said in a statement 
thousands of individuals fled the markets he said the 
result a huge pool of potential cashrich victims ripe for 
exploitation 
the typical scheme known as a dirt pile works like this 
a caller working from a boiler room telephone operation in 
another state offers to sell for instance 100 tons of dirt for 
5000 the con artist guarantees the aggregate ore will yield 
at least 20 ounces of gold an effective price of 250 an ounce vs 
current spot market prices of about 430 an ounce 
the problem is the gold doesnt exist beyond microscopic 
economically unrecoverable levels meyer said the mine 
probably is nothing more than a godforsaken patch of desert 
scrubland 
the regulators organization tested the ore in one new mexico 
mine billed by salesmen as the richest mineral deposit on earth 
it turned out to have no more gold than is found in sea water 
meyer said 
in another case cited by the group a wyoming inmate already 
jailed on a fraud charge used prison telephones to bilk investors 
in minnesota and wyoming into paying 6250 each for worthless dirt 
from an inactive utah mine when he was caught the second time 
prison authorities moved him to solitary confinement 
james h mcilhenny president of the council of better business 
bureaus said virtually all of the swindlers operate by telephone 
its easy to start just rent a cheap office install banks of 
phones hire salespeople and start calling from sucker lists 
if things get too hot they simply close up shop move to another 
town and start running a new scam he said 
the two groups offered tips for avoiding a gold swindle 
hang up on highpressure telephone sales tactics 
beware of vague promises about delayed delivery of gold 
remember that there is no such thing as a guaranteed 
investment in gold 
ignore such terms as secret special or 
cantbeduplicated methods for mineral testing 
dont be swayed if a mine is supposedly on federal land it 
costs only a few dollars to establish such a claim 
gold and platinum dont mix so reject assertions that a mine 
has high levels of platinum along with gold or silver 
take time to make your decision and get everything in writing 
officiallooking mineral content analyses known as assays 
mean little assayers can be crooked or they can be duped by a 
sample that has been salted or comes from another mine 
be suspicious of companies insisting on special arrangements 
for receipt of investments some con artists try to evade mail 
fraud penalties by sending a courier to pick up an investment check 
or sending a prepaid envelope from an overnight mail service 
before investing check out a promoter with your state 
securities office or with one of the 174 better business bureaus 
around the country 
why people will commit their life savings over the phone when 
they wouldnt think of buying a car or a house sightunseen in the 
same way is a continuing and troubling mystery to those of us 
whose job it is to promote investor protection meyer said 
investors are going to have to learn that when someone offers 
to sell them a dollar bill for 60 cents the correct response is to 
just say no he said

carlo de benedetti the italian 
financier who earlier this year tried to take over belgiums 
largest holding company was one of 20 new board members elected to 
the companys board tuesday 
shareholders of societe generale de belgique sa endorsed the new 
board during a special meeting called to set up a new management 
structure for the company following its bitter takeover battle 
earlier this year 
in addition to de benedetti three of his allies were named to 
the board peter cohen chairman of shearson lehman hutton inc of 
the united states rene thomas chairman of banque nationale de 
paris and alain minc the chief of cerus sa de benedettis french 
holding company 
societe generales chairman rene lamy said he would remain until 
the spring shareholders meeting he will be succeeded by etienne 
davignon a former european economic community commissioner who is 
expected to play a major role in the companys restructuring 
the new board met after the vote to set in motion a major 
restructuring of the giant company that has stakes in some 1300 
companies worldwide involved in among others things mining 
energy financial services chemicals and engineering 
analysts have said societe generale badly needed to be shaken 
up they said its status as belgiums largest holding company had 
allowed it to retain an antiquated management structure that had 
changed little since its founding in 1822 
the 166yearold company was the target of a highly public 
takeover battle earlier this year between de benedetti and a 
consortium of belgian and french companies led by compagnie 
financiere de suez financiere a french financial group and the 
single largest societe generale stockholder had joined with groupe 
ag a belgian insurance group to oppose de benedettis takeover 
bid 
in the end the two camps struck a compromise power sharing deal 
after neither could gain an outright majority stake 
as part of the deal de benedetti was to be named vice chairman 
of societe generale de belgique and given control of three other 
board seats 
shearson had played a major role in de benedettis attempt to 
take over societe generale 
the 203 shareholders at tuesdays meeting represented some 405 
million of societe generales 427 million shares cohens shearson 
lehman became an investor last spring in europe 1992 a company set 
up and controlled by de benedetti to hold shares in societe 
generale 
the new board said 1988 dividend should at least equal the 
1987 payout of 115 belgian francs per ordinary share 290 
it said it would raise 1988 dividends on afv shares a special 
type of share issued under a belgian tax plan that allows higher 
dividends 
the 1987 payout for societe generale afv stock was 14365 francs 
360 a share down from 18755 francs 469 in 1986 
societe generales net profit fell 22 percent in 1987 to 414 
billion francs 1035 million from 1986

the acquisition of american savings and 
loan association by the robert m bass group is the latest in a 
flurry of activity this year by a billionaire whose family fortune 
traces back to texas oil money 
bass 40 has agreed to put up 550 million in cash to acquire 
the stockton califbased thrift the nations largest insolvent 
savings and loan while the federal home loan bank board will 
provide 2 billion in assitance over the next 10 years 
this is obviously one of the biggest deals that theyve 
done said bruce benteman a research analyst for wealth 
monitors an investment advice firm in kansas city mo it shows 
the pockets of bob bass and his affiliates it shows how deep they 
are 
basss personal wealth is estimated at more than 1 billion the 
wealth of the bass family including roberts brothers sid r lee 
m and edward p is estimated at 5 billion to 6 billion 
the family has a history of buying troubled businesses and then 
waiting for a turnaround and the profit that follows 
their fortune dates back to texas wildcatter sid richardson who 
made a series of successful oil strikes richardson never married 
and left some of his millions to his partner and nephew perry bass 
perrys four sons each inherited 28 million and they combined 
assets to form bass brothers enterprises which built up the family 
wealth through shrewd investments in 1968 perry a competitive 
sailor handed over the business to son sid 
all educated at yale university the bass brothers have been 
described as atypical texas tycoons with a conservative style and 
quiet manner 
after starting his business career with wells fargo bank robert 
m bass returned to texas in 1974 to a spot at bass brothers 
enterprises 
tales of rivalries among the four brothers surfaced in recent 
years and in 1983 robert broke away and formed robert m bass 
group to pursue deals on his own 
the savings and loan deal announced monday is just the latest in 
a series for bass in recent months 
he bought the westin hotel chain from allegis corp for 153 
billion then in march sold the plaza hotel in manhattan for 410 
million to developer donald trump 
on may 17 bass reached an agreement to pay 702 million to 
acquire bell amp howell co the publishing and information services 
company in skokie ill 
in a further foray into the publishing field bass has been 
pursuing a 19 billion takeover bid for macmillan inc another 
publishing and information company macmillan is negotiating a 
possible deal with maxwell communication corp of britain which 
has made a rival 23 billion tender offer 
benteman the analyst predicts that consistent with past 
involvement in acquired companies the bass group will not become 
heavily involved in managing the newly acquired savings and loan 
hes not a handson manager benteman said he hires the 
people to do it and he gives them the direction 
although this is the first time bass has acquired a savings and 
loan the move was not unexpected we know theyve looked before 
at other sampls in the texas area benteman said 
i think they see a situation where they get a lot of assets 
and lot of potential assets at bargainbasement prices he added 
aside from their financial coups bass and his brothers are 
wellknown in fort worth for civic activities 
they have provided money for schoolteacher improvement projects 
established a main street beautification project paid for a study 
of the needs of a minority neighborhood renovated buildings 
contributed to hospitals and clinics financed museums and given to 
local high schools and universities

compares with the us agriculture departments latest estimate 
that the canadians would harvest 18 million bushels of wheat this 
year the report prompted concerns that canada may be forced to 
reduce its wheat exports

new demand from other countries including the soviet union also 
supported wheat futures said katharina zimmer a grain analyst 
with merrill lynch capital markets in new york

the stock market strengthened slightly today 
because of postlabor day buying interest in the aftermath of the 
big runup during the previous session although trading remained 
slow 
brokers said many of the large institutional investors that are 
crucial for substantial rallies remained out of the market 
reflecting an underlying caution about committing money to stocks 
without more information on the direction of the economy and 
interest rates 
a lot of guys are sitting with flat positions because taking 
positions could kill you in this market said robert otoole 
manager of overthecounter trading at shearson lehman hutton inc 
but he said that if the institutions come in this market will 
roar on the upside 
the markets strong gains on friday stemmed largely from 
increased optimism about stocks and bonds based on evidence that 
the economy is slowing down easing upward pressure on interest 
rates the most potent evidence was a rise in august unemployment 
reported by the labor department 
while some stock strategists were disappointed by the markets 
weak volume today others said they were encouraged because prices 
didnt retreat on profittaking regarded as a sign of increased 
confidence 
despite the fact that volume hasnt accelerated dramatically 
the underlining bias is distinctly positive said eugene peroni 
a technical analyst at the philadelphia investment firm janney 
montgomery scott inc most stocks are behaving well

ibms top rivals in personal computers have 
called a news conference for next tuesday at which they are 
expected to announce an alternative design for the way information 
flows inside a personal computer 
the new design would make it possible for the companies to build 
personal computers that rival ibms 1yearold personal system2 
line without departing so far from the older standard analysts 
said tuesday 
compaq computer corp of houston is leading the challenge which 
may eventually include as many as 30 companies that make personal 
computers or related products said jim weil an analyst for 
gartner securities corp 
calling the news conference for tuesday in new york are compaq 
japaneseowned epson america and nec corp hewlettpackard co 
nec corp italys ing c olivetti tandy corp wyse technology 
and zenith data systems 
the joint project could put additional competitive pressure on 
ibm but it might also help ibm by serving as an acknowledgement 
that its new personal system2 line has features that are worth 
duplicating weil said 
ibm could benefit if the delay in bringing the new computers to 
market gives ibm a chance to get its line better established said 
george colony president of forrester research inc in cambridge 
mass 
colony said he thought creating a new standard was a bad idea 
because there would be further confusion on the part of the 
users and that would translate into slower sales 
the new standard is for a bus something which controls the 
way information flows through a computer the more advanced models 
of ibms personal system2 line use a new bus called micro channel 
ibms rivals use the older bus that was used in ibms pc at 
weil said ibms rivals will claim that their new bus offers all 
the power of ibms micro channel but allows people to continue 
using their older addon equipment such as circuit cards ibms 
micro channel requires users to buy all new addon equipment 
compaq declined comment on the reports weil said that in 
addition to the companies calling the news conference intel corp 
and microsoft corp have played a role in developing the new 
standard 
the story was broken by pc week a trade newspaper in this

quicker buying decisions by consumers the automakers and analysts 
said tuesday 
foreign and domestic vehicle makers except japans toyota motor 
sales usa inc and south koreas hyundai motor co said they sold 
125 million cars and trucks last month compared with 135 million 
during the same month last year 
for the 10day period ending aug 31 chrysler corp said its 
sales of usmade cars inched up 26 percent compared with the 
same period last year ford motor co meantime said its car sales 
for the period fell 14 percent and general motors corp reported a 
139 percent drop 
each of the big three reported increases in car sales so far 
this calendar year 
toyota spokesman edd snyder said a dealer incentive program that 
stretched through the labor day weekend delayed computation of the 
companys monthly figures hyundais ted kade said tuesday that 
figures for the month hadnt been calculated 
both automakers said their sales figures would be announced 
wednesday 
the kinds of incentives that are on this year are normal 
runofthemill incentives that have been on the cars for a long 
time said auto analyst donald descenza of nomura securities inc 
of new york city 
theres no incentive to buy now to take advantage of current 
incentives he said 
a year ago car makers offered attractive incentives including 
cutrate financing as low as 19 percent for gm vehicles to lure 
customers into showrooms and shrink inventories with just one month 
left in the model year 
those incentives frequently involved shortterm offers such as 
low financing and cashback deals this year the incentives are 
different 
the incentives are sustainable kinds of things descenza 
said incentives have a big impact when its clear to the car 
buyer that they are not going to be around very long 
everybody knew last year they were temporary he added 
that they wouldnt last forever everybody knew that the models 
that qualified for them were in limited supply and dwindling 
rapidly 
tom ogrady president of integrated automotive resources inc 
of wayne pa agreed saying last years incentives colored the 
sales figures this year 
certainly were going to be down in sales from last year 
he said these are certainly very strong sales 
gm and ford showed declines in lateaugust and monthly sales 
while chrysler showed increases during the two periods there were 
nine selling days in both lateaugust periods and 27 sales days in 
august of this year compared with 26 in august of 1987 
for the aug 2131 period this year chrysler said it sold 
32214 cars made in the united states 26 percent higher than the 
31388 it sold during the same period last year ford sold 65600 
usmade cars during the period a 14 percent decrease from the 
66515 cars it sold during the same time last year 
gms lateaugust sales fell from 126629 last year to 108986 
this year a drop of 139 percent 
for the month the no 1 automaker sold 284056 cars off 207 
percent from 345098 in august 1987 fords monthly sales dropped 
62 percent from 182824 in august 1987 to 178023 last month 
chrysler showed the only monthly gain among the big three 
rising from 75156 usmade cars in august of last year to 82366 
cars last month a 55 percent increase 
chrysler has been more aggressive than the other two in using 
incentives to stimulate sales descenza said theres an 
implication that theyre buying the sales with incentives

a multimilliondollar merger battle over the 
whiskey giant irish distillers group plc was in the balance 
tuesday night after a watchdog body for londons city financial 
district rejected an appeal by european bidders 
the british panel on takeovers and mergers threw out an appeal 
by frances pernod ricard sa against a panel decision allowing 
british rival hotel and leisure group grand metropolitan plc to 
sweeten its hostile bid by launching a knockout bid offer 
the fight is threecornered as british brewers watney mann and 
truman holdings are also seeking to control the irish company 
on wednesday the legal battle shifts to dublin where pernod is 
trying to stop a key shareholder selling its stake to grand met 
after days of suspense pernod formally made a 244 million 
pounds sterling 415 million bid for irish distillers on monday 
but grand met raised its original 180 million pounds 306 million 
offer to 284 million pounds 483 million 
the grand met offer amounts to 525 irish pence a share from an 
earlier 400 irish pence a share the pernod bid is worth only 450 
irish pence a share 
on sunday the executive of the takeover panel ruled that was 
acceptable for grand met because it gave shareholders the 
opportunity to decide the best offer this was despite an earlier 
pledge from grand met not to change its offer in the absence of a 
rival bid 
the full panel on tuesday ended a day of deliberation by backing 
the executives decision and rejecting the pernod appeal 
meanwhile pernod had said it would not be prepared to act as a 
white knight to save irish distillers from grand met unless it 
was pledged the support of 50 percent of irish distillers shares 
at the weekend it believed it had this support holding pledges 
that included one from fruit and vegetable group fii fyffes plc a 
dublin fruit and vegetable merchant which holds 20 percent of 
irish distillers 
but fears that fyffes was about to change its mind and go for 
the higher english offer led pernod to seek a temporary injunction 
from the dublin high court preventing fyffes from selling to grand 
met 
a full hearing of the case will take place wednesday pernod 
says it admits the fyffes promise was not in writing but believes 
it to be legally enforceable 
irish distillers products include irish whiskey brands jamesons 
powers paddy and tullamore
