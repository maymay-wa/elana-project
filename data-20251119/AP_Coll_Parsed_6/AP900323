us secretary of state james a 
baker iii toured this huge black township friday and decried the 
contrast with the wealth of the countrys whites 
he said the comparison is quite distressing and thats why i 
said the system of apartheid should be abolished as soon as 
possible 
a day after giving south africas white minority government a 
pat on the back baker met with antiapartheid activist walter 
sisulu at his home here in a neighborhood of small brick houses 
near johannesburg africas wealthiest city sisulu is a leader of 
the african national congress the leading antiapartheid group 
the secretary also visited community centers a daycare center 
across the street from sisulus house and drove past a squatter 
camp that has risen up on an old golf course 
later friday baker flew to kinshasa zaire for meetings with 
president mobutu sese seko and angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi baker already has met president jose eduardo dos santos of 
angola as part of us efforts to negotiate an end to the civil war 
in that country 
moments before baker arrived at sisulus home some children 
perched on a jungle gym shouted anc slogans and sang songs 
honoring anc deputy president nelson mandela but baker didnt see 
or hear the children and when he visited their daycare center a 
baker aide lined them up to shake hands with him 
sisulu said i told the secretary of state we are very 
grateful to the people of america for the support they gave us over 
the years and that we are hopeful but we are only making a 
beginning and we will expect more support as the day goes by he 
said the talks had been very fruitful 
the anc openly opposed bakers meeting on thursday with 
president fw de klerk but the subject wasnt mentioned friday 
until reporters pressed 
sisulu said the united states realizes no fundamental change 
has been made but that some encouragement should be made 
the anc position had been that the baker visit the first by a 
us secretary of state in 12 years would suggest de klerk has 
made fundamental reforms of the apartheid system of racial 
segregation and white domination 
despite this difference anc leaders greeted baker warmly at 
meetings in soweto cape town and windhoek namibia where he 
attended independence celebrations 
sisulu said de klerk has not yet met the ancs conditions for 
negotiations though the two sides are to hold preliminary talks

negotiators on friday reported the first 
breakthrough in a host of contentious trade disputes with japan 
an agreement designed to open the japanese market to americanmade 
supercomputers 
officials at the us trade office said they had achieved major 
concessions that should boost supercomputer sales in the important 
japanese government market estimated to total about 130 million 
annually 
terms of the agreement were hammered out late thursday following 
a twoday bargaining session the us side had demanded that the 
japanese remove various restrictions that effectively barred us 
companies from selling supercomputers to japanese universities and 
other government agencies 
we believe the results reached last night when finalized 
should give us full and effective access to the japanese 
government market said us trade representative carla hills 
the accord reached on supercomputers marked the first resolution 
of a variety of trade disputes straining relations between the two 
economic giants it gave us officials hope that progress will be 
made in other areas in coming weeks 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in los angeles for talks with 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said the agreement 
showed we can make some progress 
are they supercomputer concessions all we want no are we 
going to get more yes when i cant say i hope soon brady 
said 
brady called the session just a meeting to talk asked about 
a report that japan might issue bonds denominated in dollars to 
support the sagging yen brady said the matter never came up 
the discussions were a followup to a hastily arranged summit 
meeting earlier this month between president bush and japanese 
prime minister toshiki kaifu 
bush pressed the japanese government to do more to open their 
markets to us products as a way of reducing americas 49 billion 
trade deficit with japan accounting for almost half of the us 
deficit 
a us trade official said the japanese exhibited a new sense of 
urgency in the latest round of computer talks this week 
their negotiators came with instructions to make a deal there 
has been a lot of highlevel political pressure said the 
official who spoke on condition that his name not be used we 
hope the japanese will perceive the same kind of guidance in the 
other issues 
in addition to supercomputers the administration is holding 
talks on japanese purchases of satellites and lumber products 
negotiators in these areas however have reported little progress 
thus far 
the japanese are facing a june 19 deadline to show a willingness 
to open their markets or face the prospect that the administration 
will retaliate by raising tariffs on japanese products sold in 
america 
members of congress said the supercomputer agreement which 
could be signed formally as soon as next month was encouraging but 
would need to be followed by concrete results 
japan must recognize that promises without performance are 
simply unacceptable said sen john danforth rmo 
sen max baucus dmont noted that a 1987 agreement by the 
japanese to buy more american supercomputers had not produced 
results he said it would be a mistake for us negotiators to 
declare victory too soon 
nonetheless progress is always encouraging i hope this is a 
sign that the united states and japan can jointly work out their 
trade frictions said baucus who is chairman of the senate trade 
subcommittee 
the talks on specific industries are being conducted under a 
section of the 1988 trade law known as super 301 the 
administration also is conducting separate discussions aimed at 
eliminating broader structural impediments to trade that make it 
difficult for us firms to get their products to japanese 
consumers 
negotiators on these issues met at a remote hideaway in the 
virginia countryside earlier this week in advance of more formal 
discussions in washington on april 2 and 3 however us officials 
said the discussions near warrenton va had failed to make any 
progress 
but there have been reports from tokyo that kaifu is preparing 
an array of trade concessions in these areas in an effort to dampen 
growing protectionist sentiment in congress 
under the computer agreement announced friday the japanese 
promised to open the procurement process for supercomputers to 
foreign firms and to base government purchase decisions on quality 
as well as price 
access to the government supercomputer market has long been a 
point of contention between the two countries 
us firms in particular cray research inc have dominated the 
global market for the sophisticated machines but have been unable 
to sell their products to the japanese government 
dennis mcgrath a spokesman for the minneapolisbased cray said 
his company would withhold comment until it reviews the agreements 
details 
we hope this is more than just a process thing but something 
that will translate into sales in the marketplace mcgrath said

it was to be a videotape of robert and christine 
petittis best day the joyful tolling of wedding bells the solemn 
exchange of vows a closeup of the maid of honor but her face 
not her derriere 
newlywed petitti and his wife are vexed over a videotape he says 
is a cross between fellini and americas funniest home videos 
the suburban chemist sued fred fox studios ltd and settled 
wednesday for an undisclosed sum 
a gag order prevented both sides from talking thursday about the 
tape of the may wedding but fox has said he stands by his 
companys work and whats more its the first time the family 
business set up by his father in 1919 has been sued 
wedding videomakers be warned as more and more weddings go 
video so grow the hazards 
people really get bent out of shape on this stuff said paul 
seitz whose arlington heights company design videotaping filmed 
more than 100 weddings last year 
it is a very emotional day probably the most emotional day 
of anyones life seitz said you cant explain to them there 
are certain things that we just cant do they are so used to 
seeing tv and movies where it looks like magic real life 
situations arent like that 
one bride he recalled was upset because the doors at the back 
of the church were left open during the ceremony and appear that 
way in the film 
she felt that was our responsibility but were already 
rolling the cameras as she walks down the aisle what are we 
supposed to do put the cameras down and close the doors 
seitz said good camera operators know when to film and when not 
to capturing a wedding fist fight for posterity is a nono as is 
including footage of guests fainting at a hot summer wedding 
you kind of make sure the camera moves away when the 
bridesmaids start to sway he said 
petitti 37 has said fred fox studios was lax on precautions 
in fact he said the tape of his wedding is not to be believed 
superimposed titles on the film provide the wrong name of the 
church he complained the cameraman caught only the last three 
seconds of the processional petitti said the angle is such that 
petittis 27yearold bride the former christine beauchamp can 
barely be seen during the ceremony he said 
you get the back of my bald head saying the vows petitti 
said 
then theres what petitti described as a blatant advertisement 
in the middle of my wedding tape a camera shot of an easel 
holding a sign for fred fox studios 
worst of all he said was the tendency of the cameraman to 
focus on the guests posteriors while filming the dancers those 
shots since replayed several times to guests have gotten 
lessthanfavorable reactions 
twenty years from now i wont know whose rear ends those 
are petitti moaned

through half a century of international 
oblivion lithuania has maintained a diplomatic presence in the 
united states through a legation headquartered about 15 blocks up 
the street from the soviet embassy 
the legation is headed by dr stasys lozoraitis jr the son of 
the man who took up the lonely post of keeping alive the diplomatic 
flame of a nation that ceased to exist independently 
it is here that the lithuanian parliament voted friday to 
transfer its power in the event of an emergency there was no 
asnwer at the legation friday night and there is no telephone 
listed in the washington area for lozoraitis 
in a profile of the legation this month the wall street journal 
quoted a message lithuanias last foreign minister sent to his 
diplomats 50 years ago if catastrophe strikes please consider 
stasys lozoraitis chief of our nations diplomatic corps 
the senior lozoraitis held that post until he died four years 
ago at 88 
on top of having to function in a world that extends it no 
formal diplomatic recognition the lithuanian legation has had to 
pay its bills without a government to bankroll the operation this 
has been done from the gold reserves transferred out of lithuania 
to sweden when the soviet union took over in 1940 the journal

capt grant phifer said thursday he flew for about 15 minutes at 
1500 feet while on a coasttocoast trip wednesday so that he 
could see pine bluff high school the towns airport and his

can come to seeing me phifer told the pine bluff commercial in a 
telephone interview from california 
sgt jim harper a public information officer at little rock air 
force base said phifers flight from andrews air force base md 
to mcclellan air force base at sacramento calif was dangerous 
and under investigation by personnel at mcclellan 
he knows better especially at that level harper said 
any pilot is risking revocation of his license and possible jail 
time by doing what he did 
the air force said it was looking into the matter but phifer 
said his conscience is clear 
i violated no air force regulations and i wouldnt have done

former president reagan says he cant remember 
details of the irancontra affair because he met with so many 
people during his eight years in office 
in boston on thursday to raise money for a cancer institute 
reagan said his meetings with more than 400 heads of state 
contributed to his memory lapses in his videotaped testimony in the 
irancontra trial of john poindexter 
i had to say i dont remember so many times reagan told 
reporters how do you go back and remember who you met on a 
certain day 
responding to the trial judges ruling thursday that he did not 
have to turn over parts of his personal diaries as evidence reagan 
said taking away the tradition of executive privilege might 
invade the presidency 
lawyers for poindexter the former national security adviser 
had argued they needed the diaries because reagan could not recall 
many details of irancontra including when he learned of a 
november 1985 shipment of missiles to iran 
on thursday during the trial in washington poindexters lawyers 
finished showing nearly eight hours of reagans videotaped 
testimony 
reagan was in boston to visit the danafarber cancer institute 
and attend a fundraiser for the institutes jimmy fund 
during a ceremony at the institute the former president was 
presented with a glass sculpture and a baseball cap by cancer 
patients ashley fitzgerald 5 and julie green 15 
other children suffering from cancer also gave the reagan a 
poster with all their names emblazoned on it 
i was able to tell them its going to be hung in the 
presidential library reagan told reporters after his tour 
green a straighta high school sophomore who has hodgkins 
disease said she just found out a week ago that she was going to 
meet reagan so she didnt have time to get excited 
im really amazed they called me she said i really like 
president reagan i feel very lucky 
after meeting the children reagan was whisked to a jimmy fund 
benefit 
at the banquet boston mayor raymond flynn presented the former 
president with jellybeans on behalf of the city forsaking the 
traditional revere bowl or lantern of liberty 
we just knew that wouldnt be appropriate enough flynn said

helicopters carrying waterfilled bambi 
buckets have helped officials control a fire that threatened to 
destroy the worlds first project to restore rare captive monkeys 
to the wild in brazil 
we were probably days away from the extinction of a species 
said benjamin beck associate director of the national zoo in 
washington dc 
the fire was fought with two helicopters belonging to the 
brazilian federal police when a call came to washington alerting 
beck to the fire the friends of the national zoo and wildlife 
preservation trust of philadelphia immediately raised 6000 to 
send two bambi buckets to the reserve beck said thursday 
from the time the request came to me until they were in use 
in brazil was less than 72 hours he said 
a bambi bucket beck explained is a large vessel that hangs 
beneath the helicopter and allows the aircraft to dip into bodies 
of water without landing and drop the water on the fire 
the fire is we feel under control but its still burning 
deep in turf in the swamps beck said 
enough organic matter and oxygen are available to keep the fire 
smouldering he said adding 
if it gets dry and windy it can break out at any time 
the national zoo has been coordinating a project to breed the 
highly endangered golden lion tamarins and return them to the poco 
das antas reserve in brazil about 75 miles northeast of rio de 
janeiro 
the fire broke out about feb 2 at poco das antas home to about 
400 tamarins they make up about 80 percent of the remaining wild 
population beck said 
sonia rigueira of conservation international in washington said 
the fire burned about a week they lost control for a while and 
then they got the helicopters she said in a telephone interview 
from brazil 
the fire was confined to the grassy areas that make up about 
half of the reserve she said the other half mature forest where 
the tamarins live was undisturbed she said 
had the fire progressed into the mature forest we would have 
seen this species come to extinction said beck 
the golden lion tamarin is a catsize primate with a leonine 
mane and bright burntorange fur it is native to brazils 
atlantic coastal forest which once covered brazils eastern flank 
but is now reduced to patches comprising only a few percent of its 
original size 
it is a beautiful and interesting primate beck said but 
probably more important is if it can survive virtually the entire 
ecosystem can survive 
the golden lion tamarin is what biologists call a flagship 
species its survival depends on the health of the ecosystem it 
lives in 
saving the golden lion tamarin is inextricably linked with 
saving what remains of the atlantic coastal forest a unique region 
brimming with plants and animals that live nowhere else on earth 
beck said 
the animals and the reserve could not have been saved without 
the effort by brazil beck said 
we ought to give credit to a tremendous response by brazilian 
authorities he said

a new migration of the damned has begun in 
the horn of africa 
once again as so often in the past drought and war have forced 
tens of thousands of innocent men women and children from their 
homes in ethiopia and sudan in a desperate search for food 
many will not find it 
as the united nations and private agencies struggle to begin 
longdelayed relief operations more and more people are joining 
the exodus from wartorn villages and parched farms 
the united nations says more than 4 million people are at risk 
of starvation in northern ethiopia alone at least half a million 
more face the same fate in southern sudan 
those figures far exceed the nearly 1 million who perished in 
ethiopias famine of 198485 
we could be looking at a repeat of that said a relief 
agency official in addis ababa ethiopias capital if we cant 
break the logjam soon people are going to start dying in numbers 
the official like many others involved in negotiations to move 
food through government and insurgent military lines would not 
speak for attribution 
the crisis is getting highlevel attention 
in washington it was disclosed recently that secretary of state 
james a baker iii had written soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze about the problem 
baker sought a joint ussoviet effort to obtain a ceasefire 
between the addis ababa government and two insurgent armies 
many aid officials see that as an essential first step in 
ensuring the free passage of food to the needy in northern ethiopia 
and ending the recurrent problem of famine 
on wednesday ethiopia renewed preliminary talks with one of the 
rebel groups in rome and said it would meet with the other 
insurgent group in nairobi next month 
meanwhile a truck convoy carrying 110 tons of food was allowed 
to pass safely through the contested area between a governmentheld 
provincial capital and a rebelcontrolled town in northern ethiopia 
at midweek 
the first convoy in the relief operation managed by a 
consortium of ethiopian church groups and supplied by american and 
western european donors was described as a trial run but 
officials were elated 
still they acknowledged they would at best be able to reach no 
more than 1 million people in tigre and wollo provinces and 
possibly the extreme southern part of eritrea or about a fourth 
of those in need 
the tigre peoples liberation front with whom the government 
reopened talks in rome this week has controlled tigre and much of 
neighboring wollo and gondor provinces since last year 
the united nations began appealing last year for 11 million 
tons of food most of which it hoped to ship to ethiopias red sea 
port of massawa for further distribution inland 
but just as the first shipments were arriving in february the 
largest of the two insurgent groups the eritrean peoples 
liberation front broke a nearly yearlong ceasefire and attacked 
government troops along a 200mile front within three days the 
rebels claimed the capture of massawa 
the government which has never acknowledged massawas fall is 
reliably reported to have retaliated with aerial and artillery 
bombardments that destroyed tons of donated grain killed dozens of 
civilians and may have ruined port facilities 
the fighting has effectively closed the port and the only road 
inland to the provincial capital of asmara which is still held by 
the government 
un and other aid officials say more than 30000 people already 
have made the long dangerous trek from their homes in northern 
ethiopia into neighboring sudan or to governmentheld areas in 
ethiopias eritrea province 
we cant really count all those already on the move because 
we dont have access to many areas the relief official in addis 
ababa said we do know this its bad and getting worse 
it was hoped that adequate food distribution throughout the 
region this year would prevent the mass migrations that occurred in 
198485 when hundreds of thousands of people trekked to 
illprepared feeding centers malnourished and weak many died en 
route of those who made it more died of disease caused by 
overcrowding than starvation 
to the west of ethiopia in sudan a similar situation exists 
there additional tens of thousands have been displaced in 
recent months by a 7yearold civil war that already has killed an 
estimated 500000 unarmed civilians 
a unsponsored relief effort was credited with savings 
thousands of people from starvation in southern sudan last year 
and a second phase of the project known as operation lifeline 
sudan is scheduled to start next month 
but on tuesday the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
objected to the un operation saying its plan for distributing 
food favored the government without specifically saying so the 
rebels indicated they may try to halt the operation unless the plan 
is altered

after receiving reports of more than 1400 
cases of a rare and sometimes fatal blood disorder federal health 
officials are still puzzled by its connection to the dietary 
supplement ltryptophan 
they have found no contaminant or bad batch of raw material no 
single brand that seems to be the culprit 
we have analyzed hundreds of products but we have not been 
able to single out any brand manufacturer or supplier that would 
explain why people are getting sick from taking this stuff said 
chris lecos a spokesman for the food and drug administration 
even so the fda announced thursday that it was expanding its 
recall of ltryptophan supplements to include products that contain 
even small amounts of it 
the initial recall announced last nov 17 was for supplements 
in which ltryptophan was the sole or major component and would 
provide a daily intake of more than 100 milligrams 
but now at least one case has been reported in which the person 
developed the newly recognized blood disorder after taking less 
than 100 milligrams a day 
the disorder is called eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or ems so 
far 1411 cases have been reported in all states including 19 
deaths 
ems is marked by severe muscle and joint pain breathing 
difficulties swelling of the arms and legs skin rash fatigue 
cough and sometimes fever in some cases victims show signs of 
congestive heart failure or develop a condition that causes 
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis 
ltryptophan an amino acid has been around for many years and 
occurs naturally in some foods including milk beef turkey and 
beans 
ltryptophan supplements are usually sold over the counter in 
health food drug and grocery stores under different brand names 
they are taken for insomnia appetite control depression 
premenstrual syndrome stress reduction and other problems 
there are literally hundreds of brands involved here with 
various levels of ltryptophan in them the fdas lecos said 
in a typical recall the fda knows who made the product how 
much was produced and where and when it was distributed 
but heres a situation where the only unequivocal fact is that 
people who come down with ems are people taking ltryptophan before 
they became ill he said as our investigation has continued 
we have discovered that many of these people were taking not just 
one brand but six or more brands 
the expanded recall applies to all ltryptophan products in 
tablet capsule caplet powdered or liquid form as well 
multiingredient nonprotein supplements that contain 
ltryptophan the fda said 
the only products containing ltryptophan not being recalled are 
some protein supplements infant formulas and special dietary 
foods intravenous and oral solutions in which small amounts of 
ltryptophan are needed for nutrition fortification the fda said 
no cases of ems have been linked to any of those uses the 
agency said 
however it was not clear whether certain products like diet and 
bodybuilding supplements containing ltryptophan would have to be

auctioneers say the italian government has stopped 
them from selling papers connected with dictator benito mussolini 
the italian government told us that under a law of 1943 all 
material owned by mussolinis national fascist party belonged to 
the government so we withdrew the 10 lots of mussolini papers 
from a sale thursday said nina drummond a spokeswoman for the 
phillips auction house 
the most important of the documents was the original telegram 
summoning mussolini to rome to form a government in 1922 the 
telegram signed by an aide of king victor emmanuel iii had been 
expected to sell for up to 15900 
the telegram gave mussolini power that he retained until his 
support dwindled during world war ii and he was overthrown in july 
1943 resistance fighters killed him in april 1945 
what puzzled us was that some of the material was sold at 
sothebys in 1982 and apparently the italian authorities took no 
action at that time ms drummond said 
leonardo visconti press attache at the italian embassy said 
authorities in rome were able to act because of the publicity 
surrounding the phillips sale 
we are taking legal steps to reclaim this material from 
phillips he said 
other material withdrawn from the sale included the autographed 
draft of a speech by mussolini in 1925 and his identity card from 
1913 
phillips did not identify the owners nor discuss how the 
material ended in private hands i think some or all of it was 
gathered up in the chaos of the last months of the war ms 
drummond said

disabilityrights groups are praising a bush 
administration decision to require federally aided bus lines to buy 
only buses accessible to wheelchairs and provide doortodoor 
service for the handicapped 
the transportation department announced a tentative rule 
thursday that matches key provisions of legislation that the 
advocacy groups have been trying to urge through congress with 
protest action 
more than 150 people were arrested in washington during 
demonstrations for the bill last week 
dennis kouba a spokesman for the american public transit 
association said most bus operators already are purchasing only 
vehicles equipped with lifts or other devices but he said 
officials were assessing other provisions of the proposed rule 
operators currently have a choice of either accessible buses or 
special doortodoor service to serve hundreds of thousands of 
people who have difficulty taking ordinary buses nearly all public 
transit systems receive some federal funding 
timothy cook spokesman for the national disability action 
center said the rule would give handicapped americans everything 
they have been fighting for 
my clients are very very pleased they will finally get 
access to services they need to get going said cook whose 
organization has been involved in litigation on behalf of the 
handicapped 
wade blank head of americans disabled for accessible public 
transportation said he was delighted that the administration 
finally has followed through on its commitment to persons with 
disabilities 
the rule is expected to become law in september after a period 
for public comment that could lead to some changes in its 
provisions 
requiring both access and special services for all systems is 
expected to increase significantly the amount and quality of 
service available to persons with disabilities the 
transportation department announcement said 
the bush administration is committed to policies that will 
ensure that people with disabilities have the opportunities 
available to other persons to use our mass transit system said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner 
announcement of the proposed rule met the requirements of a 
philadelphia federal court order that required the department to 
examine and change existing regulations but did not mandate what 
the changes should be the order came in a suit by more than a 
dozen disabilityrights groups 
the department is asking for comment on several options for 
exempting transit companies that would find it too costly to 
provide special services for the handicapped but no exemptions 
would be allowed for accessibility equipment on all new buses 
the rule does not require that wheelchair lifts or other devices 
be retrofitted onto existing buses but it would apply to all new 
and refurbished buses and require operators to attempt to buy only 
used buses with such equipment if available 
estimates of the number of americans who use wheelchairs range 
from 750000 to 15 million

president bush is refusing to give poland a 
greater voice in talks on the reunification of germany or to 
endorse warsaws demands for an early treaty guaranteeing its 
borders 
i think we may have a nuance of difference here bush said 
thursday after concluding talks with polish prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki 
after three days in washington mazowiecki was heading to 
chicago today after a speech at the national press club 
bush gave an upbeat assessment of their meeting saying he 
assured mazowiecki we see an important role for a free 
democratic and independent poland as a factor for stability in 
europe in the future 
speaking at a news conference the president said he sees no 
need for soviet troops to be stationed in poland or anywhere else 
in eastern europe and the sooner they get out of there the 
better 
mazowiecki however has said he wants the soviet troops to stay 
until issues of german reunification and the polish border are 
resolved 
bush said mazowiecki had not given him any assurances on the 
soviet troop issue separately mazowiecki told reporters that his 
government is prepared to start talks that will eventually lead 
to total withdrawal of soviet forces in poland 
poland fearing a reunified germany might try to reclaim 
territory ceded to poland wants the united states to back its 
request that east and west germany sign a treaty recognizing the 
current polish borders before reunification talks get under way 
bush said such a treaty is a matter for the polish prime 
minister to discuss with the leaders of germany 
they are very very close now he added so let them sort 
it out 
the president also praised west german chancellor helmut kohl 
for recent statements supporting the current polish border he said 
kohl had come a long way in his view since earlier remarks that 
the border question should be decided by a reunified germany 
bush said poland will have a voice at the reunification talks 
among the two germanys and the four chief world war ii victors 
the united states the soviet union france and britain whenever 
issues related to polish borders are raised 
poland wants a greater role in the talks asking to be present 
whenever issues affecting its security were discussed but bush 
reiterated the limited role for poland in the discussions saying 
we dont see this as the group that is going to determine the 
fate of all of europe 
mazowiecki said that he was very pleased with his meeting 
with the president and that there are no problems between us on 
bushs desire to see soviet troops out of eastern europe 
the only problem is to persuade both our german partners that 
it needs to be done swiftly and finally mazowiecki said

conservative robert sweets fight for 
confirmation as head of the governments juvenile justice program 
is headed for senate action 
three of the eight democrats on the senate judiciary committee 
joined six republicans as the panel voted 95 to send sweets 
nomination to the senate floor for a final vote on confirmation 
objectivity won out over partisan politics sen gordon 
humphrey rnh said following approval of the 52yearold sweet 
a veteran of political turmoil at the education department in the 
reagan administration 
humphrey said the margin in committee makes it likely the 
nomination will be confirmed on the floor though im sure we can 
count on further opposition from leftwing groups like the 
national teachers unions 
one of sweets chief senate critics sen john f kerry 
dmass wrote committee members on wednesday urging a vote 
against sweet 
he said a confirmation hearing three weeks ago showed the 
nominees relative indifference to the programs and policies that 
are at the heart of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention 
kerry said sweets approach to juvenile justice is naive at 
best and in any case not congruent with the statutory requirements 
of the position to which he has been nominated 
by law the administrator of the office of juvenile justice and 
delinquency prevention in the justice department must have 
experience in the juvenile justice field the 70 million program 
distributes grants to state and local governments to help combat 
delinquency 
sweet says his background in education fulfills the requirement 
he is a former high school teacher and textbook salesman and served 
as an education department official and white house education 
adviser 
he also headed the new hampshire affiliate of the moral 
majority founded by the rev jerry falwell 
bob sweet has devoted his entire life to working with youth 
and is well qualified to serve humphrey said 
some criticism appears to stem from fierce political infighting 
at the education department former education secretary terrel bell 
said in his memoirs the thirteenth man that conservative 
activists sought to control the department he cited sweet as one 
of them 
democrats who voted to send the nomination to the floor were 
sens dennis deconcini dariz howell heflin dala and herb 
kohl dwis they joined sens strom thurmond rsc orrin hatch 
rutah alan simpson rwyo charles grassley riowa arlen

the maryland senate early friday approved 
an agreement to end an eightday antiabortion filibuster by 
turning the emotional issue over to voters come november 
under the compromise the senate approved two bills an abortion 
rights measure ratified by a 2918 margin and a more restrictive 
bill favored by abortion opponents which won 2423 approval 
both measures now go to the house of delegates where they are 
expected to receive quick attention 
it is anticipated that at least one of the bills will be 
petitioned to referendum giving voters the opportunity in november 
to select which they prefer 
the abortion rights bill would become law unless rejected by 
voters in that case the restrictive law would become law unless 
it also was rejected by voters 
house speaker clay mitchell has said he would bring the house in 
on saturday if the senate passed a bill by friday 
the two measures senate president mike miller told the senate 
would present voters with a very very clear choice this is 
participatory democracy at its very best 
but some abortionrights supporters were not pleased 
the compromise was merely a facesaving device to end the 
filibuster said sen f vernon boozer a prochoice republican 
and i dont think its a good idea 
i think the concept is ridiculous agreed patricia r sher 
a democrat 
democratic sen c bernard fowler who opposes abortion 
characterized the agreement as a long roll of the dice 
antiabortion forces took the gamble because we feel we may 
never have this opportunity again fowler said we dont know 
that we can hold a filibuster together again next year 
abortion rights forces had been trying for a week to muster the 
32 votes they needed to shut off the debate 
they moved to within a vote of ending the debate tuesday when 
they lost a cloture vote by a 3116 margin thirtytwo votes or 
twothirds of the 47member senate are required to shut off debate 
at stake in the battle was a measure that would allow 
unrestricted access to abortions until the point in a pregnancy 
when a fetus is able to survive outside the womb after fetal 
viability abortions could be performed to save the life of the 
mother or to protect her health 
the prochoice bill also also would require doctors to notify 
parents when their unmarried teenage daughters seek an abortion 
antiabortion forces thought the bill was too liberal they 
insist that abortions after the fetus becomes viable should be 
restricted to those needed to save the life of the mother 
the antiabortion forces also wanted to limit abortions before 
fetal viability to cases of rape or incest or to protect the 
womans health

even a small reduction in a persons dietary fat 
intake can mean a sharp drop in the risk of developing new clogs in 
the heart arteries a study released today shows 
dr david h blankenhorn director of the atheroslerosis 
research institute at the university of southern california school 
of medicine in los angeles said the 82 middleaged male heart 
bypass patients who were studied were all freeliving citizens 
who selected their own diet 
these were not really austere diets he went on the idea 
may be out there that youve really got to eat a restricted diet or 
lose weight these guys didnt lose weight 
he said all had diet counseling adding but some of them 
listened a little harder than others the ones who reduced highfat 
meats and milk and substituted lowfat meat and lowfat milk were 
the ones who didnt get new lesions 
the twoyear study was of men who had undergone heart bypass 
surgery and had been advised to reduce their total fat consumption 
to 26 percent of total calories including specified reductions in 
saturated fats polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats 
in the typical american diet fat accounts for 40 percent of 
total calories consumed 
the results of the study were reported in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
subjects underwent angiograms dyeenhanced xrays of the heart 
before and after the twoyear period during which they were 
quizzed semimonthly about all the food theyd eaten in the 
previous 24 hours 
after two years 18 of the men had developed new fatty deposits 
in their coronary arteries and 64 men had not 
the question is why whats the difference between these two 
groups said dr linda cashinhemphill an assistant usc 
professor and a colleague of blankenhorns 
dietary analysis revealed that men who were free of new fatty 
deposits or lesions had reduced their total fat consumption 
while the men who had developed new lesions had increased total fat 
consumption 
knowing that polyunsaturated fats decrease cholesterol 
instead of decreasing total fat they men with new lesions 
increased polyunsaturated fats not a good idea ms 
cashinhemphill said in a telephone interview 
excess blood cholesterol is one of the three main modifiable 
traits associated with increased risk of developing heart disease 
the others are high blood pressure and smoking 
the bottom line of the study is that total fats should be 
reduced ms hemphill said 
the men who were free of new lesions at the studys end had 
begun with a mean total fat intake of 329 percent of calories 
consumed they lowered their total fat to 275 percent of calories 
consumed the researchers said 
in contrast the men who developed new lesions had started at a 
fat intake of 311 percent of calories consumed and went up to 341 
percent the researchers reported 
consumption of saturated fats found in highfat meats and 
dairy products as well as in tropical oils had gone down in both 
groups but was reduced more in the group with no new lesions the 
researchers found 
consumption of polyunsaturated fats in both groups had gone up 
but consumption in the group with new lesions had gone up more than 
twice as much as the other group 
dr dean ornish director of the preventive medicine research 
institute at the university of california at san francisco school 
of medicine said this is an important study because it 
demonstrates that even moderate changes in diet can help prevent 
the formation of coronary artery blockages 
previous research has shown that cholesterollowering drugs are 
effective in preventing existing lesions from growing but this is 
the first study showing that diet alone can prevent formation of 
new lesions the authors said

high blood pressure patients taking medications 
known as beta blockers temporarily increase their risk of suffering 
heart pain or heart attack if they abruptly stop taking the 
medication a study says 
the research published in todays edition of the journal of the 
american medical association said the increased risk extends even 
to patients with no history of heart disease 
patients who suddenly withdrew from the beta blockers showed a 
temporary fourfold increase in risk according to the study by dr 
bruce m psaty and colleagues at the university of washington in 
seattle 
if patients need to withdraw from use of beta blockers they 
should probably taper the dosage gradually over a period of several 
weeks the authors said 
beta blockers act to relieve stress on the heart lungs and 
blood vessels by blocking adrenaline from overstimulated nerves 
supplying those tissues 
beta blockers are prescribed for problems with a wide range of 
severity they are given to relieve high blood pressure in patients 
with no history of heart trouble to ease problems linked to 
definite heart disease such as heart pain and abnormal rhythms 
and to ward off second heart attacks 
though it was known that patients who abruptly stop taking beta 
blockers could experience a sudden return of their symptoms 
patients who take the drugs only for high blood pressure and who 
have no known heart disease had been considered at low risk for 
heart problems the authors said 
they based their conclusion on a study of 248 cases of new heart 
problems from 1982 through 1984 among people enrolled in a 
washington state healthmaintenance organization 
records on more than 700 other enrollees without heart problems 
but with high blood pressure were used for comparison 
all of the patients had been taking beta blockers propranolol 
hydrochloride marketed generically and as inderal nadolol 
marketed as corgard and corzide metoprolol tartrate marketed as 
lopressor and atenolol marketed as tenoretic and tenormin 
the report focused on recent stoppers defined by the 
authors as regular betablocker users who did not fill their 
prescriptions soon enough to be regarded as complying with dosage 
instructions to an 80 percent level 
eleven patients were identified as recent stoppers based on 
pharmacy records of the 11 four were from the group with no heart 
problems and seven from the group with new heart problems 
one of the seven suffered from heart pain three had nonfatal 
heart attacks and three had fatal heart attacks the researchers 
said 
the eleven had taken beta blockers for an average of 29 years 
they said 
researchers estimated that the 11 patients stopped taking their 
medication about 12 days before they were admitted to the hospital 
or died

president bushs 307 billion defense budget 
contains several major gaps in assessing the overall threat to the 
west and shaping military strategy says the chairman of the senate 
armed services committee 
but defense secretary dick cheney urged critics to examine what 
the pentagon is doing to restructure us forces contending that 
his department had done a complete rethinking of missions and 
strategy 
in a rhetorical skirmish between two of the leading players in 
the battle over the defense budget sen sam nunn dga said 
thursday that if the pentagon wants to stay credible it must fill 
the large holes in the spending blueprint 
i hope these blanks will be filled in by the defense 
department but the congress will have to act if the defense 
department doesnt the armed services chairman said in a speech 
on the senate floor 
nunn cited at least five big blanks in bushs budget the 
absence of an assessment of the threat to us national security a 
military strategy in response to the threat the future size of the 
armed forces how to meet required budget cuts and the need for 
major weapons 
bushs budget he said is based on a 1988 threat and a 1988 
strategy 
essentially the administration took the level of spending and 
programs for fiscal year 1991 that was developed back in 1988 and 
reduced it for fiscal reasons nunn said they have not 
adjusted the underlying assumptions about threat and strategy 
but in a speech to the national press club cheney accused 
lawmakers of offering complaints instead of solutions 
cheney prefaced his speech by noting that nunn had just spoken 
on capitol hill but said his comments should not be construed as 
being directed at the senator 
the defense secretary said he has told the military to take into 
account the assumptions that soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
will be at least partially successful in domestic reforms 
in addition he said planners should assume that the 
superpowers will implement successful arms control agreements in 
conventional and strategic forces that all soviet forces have 
withdrawn from eastern europe and that democratically elected 
noncommunist governments are in their place 
while such assumptions are a rosy scenario cheney said he 
has used them to design the defense budget from now through 1997 
and to help the service chiefs plan for the mid1990s 
nunn said he found fragmentary answers from the 
administration to the question of what effect the push for 
democracy in eastern europe and the changes in the soviet union 
will have on the traditional threats to us security 
we should expect that the changes in the threat would be more 
apparent in the defense departments budget request nunn said 
the budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 includes more 
than 16 billion for five major weapons programs the b2 stealth 
bomber the c17 transport plane the advanced tactical fighter 
the advanced tactical aircraft and the strategic defense initiative 
cheney said those programs are being reviewed and the results 
will be ready in time for congress budget process 
elsewhere on capitol hill a senior pentagon official refused to 
rule out a possible trade of the railgarrison mx nuclear missile 
for the soviets ss24 missile as part of the negotiations to 
reduce strategic weapons 
this is obviously a serious proposal advanced by serious 
people and needs to be given serious consideration stephen 
hadley assistant secretary of defense for international security 
policy told a house armed services committee policy panel 
rep les aspin dwis the committee chairman criticized the 
administrations current proposal in ussoviet talks to reduce 
strategic arms for legitimizing the b2 bomber and two landbased 
nuclear missile systems 
aspin and several other committee members said chances were slim 
that congress will approve the full fleet of 132 b2 bombers and 
future funds for the singlewarhead midgetman and the 
multiplewarhead mx missile 
were not going to buy 132 and i maintain its not a 
responsible position for the us government to pursue arms control 
based on buying 132 said rep john kasich rohio an opponent 
of the b2 bomber 
i cant tell you how many were going to buy i cant tell you 
the plans going to work

miles above the earth where it can provide scientists a clearer 
view of space because it will be unhindered by atmospheric 
distortion 
if all goes according to plan hubble will be deployed a day 
after discovery and its five crew members blast into space from 
cape canaveral fla on april 12 
were getting very excited discovery commander loren j 
shriver said thursday at the crews final news conference before 
the mission weve been training for a long time this is a major 
milestone were glad to be finally this close to launch 
the 25000pound 43footlong telescope originally was 
scheduled for launch in late 1983 but technical problems postponed 
liftoff until 1986 the challenger accident on jan 28 1986 
delayed the mission until 1989 and concern over the shuttles 
solid rocket boosters pushed it back yet again 
it has been a long wait for the scientists waiting to use the 
telescope 
theyre beaming with pride at the prospect of finally getting 
the space telescope that theyve worked with for so long to 
finally see it getting so close and producing results in the near 
future said shriver an air force colonel commanding his first 
shuttle flight 
hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so 
distant that their light has been traveling toward earth for 14 
billion years meaning that scientists will see what the objects 
looked like near the creation of the universe an estimated 15 
billion years ago 
the telescopes location above earths atmosphere will enable it 
to detect light of all wavelengths including ultraviolet before 
it is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere 
it will look seven times more deeply into space and detect 
objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the 
best groundbased observatory its eightfoot primary optical 
mirror is the most precise ever made 
such a view into space could explain how the universe was 
created 
i think theyre going to make some discoveries and answer some 
questions weve got now and probably raise a lot more than we know 
about right now shriver said 
using the shuttles 50foot robot arm mission specialist steven 
a hawley will maneuver the telescope out of the shuttles cargo 
bay and hoist it away from the shuttle before letting go of it 
shriver and the pilot marine col charles f bolden jr will then 
steer the shuttle away from hubble 
mission specialists kathryn d sullivan and bruce mccandless a 
navy captain will be prepared to perform spacewalks should a 
problem occur during the deployment 
the veteran crew also has trained to return discovery to the 
telescope during the mission should ground controllers have trouble 
making hubble operational

sentiment is growing among congressional 
democrats to cut aid to el salvador 
rep david obey dwis chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations became the latest lawmaker to 
complain that millions of dollars have done little to end the civil 
war or improve the central american countrys human rights record 
after 10 years and 38 billion in many ways we are pretty 
much at ground zero obey said thursday i dont want to be in 
the perpetual motion of throwing money down a rat hole 
obey said he sees little improvement in the country where 
between 40000 and 50000 people have been killed in the last 
decade 
i personally dont feel i can vote for salvador money he 
said 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs urged caution in testimony to obeys subcommittee he said 
prospects have never been better for a negotiated settlement 
between the salvadoran government and the leftwing rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front known as the fmln 
the two sides say they will begin negotiations next month as a 
first step toward ending the war 
moreover aronson said the ouster of the leftist sandinista 
government in nicaragua that supported the salvadoran rebels 
eventually should weaken the fmln 
lets not rush to do something that would screw this up he 
said i think we can end this war 
obey also questioned whether the government of president alfredo 
cristiani is able to exercise enough control over the salvadoran 
military to proceed with negotiations there is a high degree of 
dubiousness and i share it he said 
obey joins a number of house members and senators who have 
raised questions about the aid and suggested cutting it or making 
it conditional on a ceasefire or improvement in human rights 
heightened interest in the subject comes at the 10th anniversary 
of the slaying of archbishop oscar romero in san salvador his 
unsolved killing and the resurgence of rightwing death squads 
prompted the united states to throw its support behind the centrist 
government in 1980 
sens christopher dodd dconn and john kerry dmass have 
introduced different bills that would place new conditions on 
salvadoran aid 
rep joe moakley dmass head of a congressional task force on 
el salvador wants to cut aid by 50 percent based on a negotiated 
ceasefire if the government broke the ceasefire all aid would 
end if the rebels violated the agreement the government could 
realize 100 percent of its aid 
meantime moakleys task force interviewed a us army major 
about his knowledge of possible salvadoran military involvement in 
the killing of six jesuit priests in san salvador last nov 16 
moakley said details of the meeting were secret but lawmakers 
wanted to interview the man facetoface the task force plans to 
issue a report on the killings in a few weeks 
the united states is providing el salvador with about 315 
million in economic and military aid in the current fiscal year 
and the administration is seeking about 375 million for fiscal 
1991 which begins oct 1

congress is moving to tighten the screws on 
bankers who cooperate with moneylaundering operations of drug 
traffickers 
banks that knowingly handle dirty drug money should not be 
permitted to do business in this country sen john kerry 
dmass said thursday as he and other senators introduced 
moneylaundering legislation 
a similar bill won 480 approval from the house banking 
committee on thursday amid heightened concern over drug profits 
being laundered through caribbean tax havens and centers of bank 
secrecy and then returned to the united states 
the senate bill would require federal regulators to hold a 
hearing on whether to close any bank convicted of money laundering 
the house version would require such a hearing if the officers 
and directors of the bank were also convicted 
under both measures the banks charter could be revoked or 
regulators could appoint a conservator federal officials already 
have the power to shut down banks that are operated improperly 
hearings under the bill would specifically apply to money 
laundering and would be mandatory 
such hearings would have to consider the extent of management 
involvement in the offense whether the bank had the means to block 
money laundering the degree of cooperation with law enforcement 
and whether new procedures had been put in place to prevent a 
recurrence 
banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas described 
the house version as a compromise that would not only punish those 
who ignore money laundering but also provide due process for 
bankers 
he hailed reps frank annunzio dill thomas r carper 
ddel and bill mccollum rfla for working out a compromise 
version 
citing estimates of 300 billion in annual drug profits 
worldwide annunzio declared that the vast quantities of cash may 
provide drug dealers with their greatest vulnerability to 
detection 
the drug dealer is caught in a neverending blizzard of cash 
every day annunzio said 
the house bill also calls for removal of bank officials 
convicted of money laundering or structuring transactions to evade 
requirements of the bank secrecy act those found guilty would be 
prohibited from affiliating with other financial institutions 
it would require the treasury department to set forth 
regulations aimed at halting money laundering by wire transfer it 
would raise the fine for negligent noncompliance with 
moneylaundering reporting requirements from 500 to 5000

house speaker thomas s foley says he sought 
to delay supreme court review of the federal flagburning law so 
the house could better defend it not to deny republican candidates 
an issue this fall 
i emphatically state that there was no political motive in 
the filing of this brief other than to undertake the fullest 
defense of a statute of this house the washington democrat said 
thursday in an unusual speech on the house floor by a speaker 
foley spoke after an embarrassing loss to his chambers 
republican minority in a 309101 vote the house ordered its legal 
counsel to withdraw a foleysupported legal brief asking the high 
court to delay review of the flagburning law until october 
if successful that probably would take the flag issue a gop 
favorite out of the campaign leading up to the november elections 
house republican leader robert michel complained that he found 
out about the brief only after it was filed and said this is part 
of a pattern of insufficient consultation 
michel rill said the brief mispresented explicit language 
included in the legislation last year that calls for expedited 
review of any constitutional challenge he offered a resolution 
chastising the house counsel and calling for withdrawal of the 
brief 
and after other republicans cast the issue as one of which party 
is better at protecting the flag dozens of democrats deserted 
their leadership to hand foley his defeat 
after the vote foley and republican leaders met and agreed to 
submit a new brief that would not address the question of timing of 
the court review said house counsel steven ross 
the law against desecration of the flag recently was ruled 
unconstitutional in courts in washington state and the district of 
columbia 
the justice department appealed to the supreme court and asked 
for speedy consideration 
the court has asked the defendants in the flagburning cases to 
file their responses to the appeal by march 26 the defendants have 
already stated they believe expedited review was aimed at the 
political campaign and since there is no emergency they should 
have more time to prepare their side

senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine wants a final vote on a clean air bill within a week but 
fellow senators are refusing to be pinned to a specific deadline 
faced with scores of amendments not yet considered and several 
unresolved controversies mitchell said thursday that without an 
agreed deadline hes not sure when the bill will be finally acted 
upon 
late thursday night mitchell sought approval from fellow 
senators to establish a specific deadline for a final vote on the 
measure before 6 pm march 29 
but such a time deadline requires unanimous consent and several 
senators made clear their objections to being rushed to a final 
vote with many amendments still to be considered 
the legislation the first tightening of federal air pollution 
control in 13 years would impose tougher restrictions on 
automobiles industry and electric power plants 
mitchell who in february engineered a compromise agreement with 
the white house on the bill in hopes of assuring quick passage 
said he had hoped to tell president bush today that the end is in 
sight 
i obviously will have to call him with different news 
mitchell added 
in the house meanwhile the energy and commerce committee took 
another step thursday in crafting its own clean air legislation by 
reachng a compromise on tougher controls on smog in major cities 
by a 382 vote the committee approved provisions to 
expand controls on smogcausing pollutants to include smaller 
businesses in areas with the dirtiest air 
eliminate waivers that would exempt some states or cities from 
complying with pollution control measures if the cost of the 
controls exceed a certain amount 
preserve a requirement that the environmental protection agency 
impose an air pollution control plan in a city if local officials 
fail to act 
the senate had rejected similar measures earlier this week the 
tougher provisions likely will be one of many differences that 
eventually will have to be reconciled between the house and senate 
the house committee vote came after two days of negotiations 
involving chairman john dingell dmich and other senior members 
of the panel many members first saw the inchthick legislation 
only minutes before voting on it 
the house bill is not expected to reach the floor until may 
among the issues still confronting the senate is what to do 
about the appeal from sen robert byrd dva to provide financial 
assistance to coal miners who lose their jobs because of tougher 
sulfur dioxide emissions control on midwest utility plants 
mitchell had hoped to resolve the issue thursday but by days 
end byrd was reported to be considering a compromise proposal 
crafted by mitchells staff and was not expected to respond until 
next week according to aides 
byrd wants 500 million over three years to help the coal 
miners but the white house has said that is too expensive and 
violates the compromise agreement reached with senate leaders 
meanwhile mitchell said he will continue to do everything i 
can to push ahead with final action on the clean air bill by the 
end of next week although the prospects for keeping that deadline 
are uncertain 
the senate is scheduled to resume action on the legislation on 
monday and mitchell warned the senators to be prepared for 
latenight sessions perhaps even allnight sessions running 
into next weekend if necessary

a federal judges approval of the settlement of a 
lawsuit challenging state abortionclinic restrictions came under 
immediate attack from antiabortion groups 
it represents the absolute triumph of politics over law 
said victor rosenblum attorney for the illinois right to life 
committee when informed of thursdays decision by us district 
judge john nordberg 
nordberg approved a consent decree worked out between illinois 
attorney general neil hartigan and the american civil liberties 
union of illinois which represented the plaintiff dr richard 
ragsdale 
the court finds the proposed consent decree lawful fair 
reasonable and adequate nordberg said in his 13page opinion 
the consent decree eases state restrictions on abortion clinics 
that ragsdale had challenged as medically unnecessary for clinics 
serving women fewer than 18 weeks pregnant 
the decree establishes a new regulatory system mandating two 
distinct kinds of abortion facility 
for women fewer than 18 weeks pregnant abortions can be 
performed in clinic settings the original regulations which 
required full service surgical facilities like those in a hospital 
will still apply in pregnancies of more than 18 weeks 
i think its a good decision i think judge nordberg carefully 
conducted a fairness hearing said hartigan the democratic 
candidate for governor whose office represented the state in the 
case 
colleen k connell director of the aclu of illinois 
reproductive rights project said under the settlement women in 
all parts of illinois will have access to safe affordable abortion 
services 
but a coalition of antiabortion groups will appeal nordbergs 
decision possibly as early as today said joseph scheidler 
president of the prolife action league 
basically what we have is backalley abortion there is no 
regulation under the ruling scheidler said 
there is no evidence to support this contention nordberg 
wrote far from leaving women unprotected the settlement creates 
a network of statutes and rules regulating the provision of 
abortion services 
the settlement was reached nov 24 removing the case from the 
us supreme court docket only days before that court had been 
scheduled to hear it 
abortion opponents had wanted the case to go to the high court 
in hopes that it would lead to further tightening of federal 
restrictions on abortion 
in a telephone interview from his rockford clinic ragsdale said 
he was pleased with the ruling on his 1985 lawsuit 
the only reason for opposing the issue as a whole is ignorance 
of the facts he said anyone who would tamper or seek to 
further restrict abortion through legislation or intimidation is 
seeking to have many women impoverished and humiliated and some 
women maimed and dead 
the clinic restrictions which went into effect in 1978 were 
suspended after ragsdale won decisions in us district court and 
in the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
at issue were elaborate state requirements for nonhospital 
surgical centers clinics were required to provide inhouse 
counseling meet certain buildingcode specifications and prove 
they were not duplicating similar services in their areas 
ragsdale contended the requirements were medically unnecessary 
and discouraged abortion providers by forcing them to build the 
equivalent of a small hospital an expensive proposition that 
effectively hampered access to abortion

nasa is considering sending 
astronauts to repair a stranded satellite or to bring it back to 
earth but will meet with aerospace company officials again before 
making a decision 
those are the options theyre looking at either reboost to a 
higher useful orbit or retrieve said kyle herring a spokesman 
for the national aeronautics and space administration 
nasa officials met for about seven hours at johnson space center 
on thursday with representatives from intelsat the satellites 
owner and hughes aircraft co which built the spacecraft 
although no decision was made regarding a rescue attempt nasa 
officials are obviously showing some interest herring said 
the uninsured 150 million communications satellite was launched 
by a titan 3 booster rocket march 14 from cape canaveral fla but 
wound up in the wrong orbit after failing to separate properly from 
the second stage of the rocket 
intelsat engineers managed to separate the satellite and later 
boost it to a higher parking orbit using computer commands 
the intelsat vi satellite is whirling uselessly about 276 miles 
above earth 22000 miles lower than it should be 
theyre comfortable where it is at least for now herring 
said 
herring said nasa and officials from the two companies discussed 
the possibility of attaching a motor to the spacecraft that would 
boost it to where it should be such an attempt would require a 
spacewalk by astronauts to draw the satellite into the shuttles 
payload bay he said 
while the discussions were very preliminary no insurmountable 
technical issues were identified nasa said in a statement 
thursdays meeting was devoted to factfinding only and no 
decisions were made as to whether such a mission could be 
accomplished the space agency said additional meetings are 
being planned to further discuss aspects of the intelsat vi status 
and rescue options 
william reeves lead flight director for next months trip by 
the shuttle discovery to deploy the hubble space telescope said 
there were no plans to incorporate any rescue attempt in the 
fiveday mission 
martin marietta corp which launched the rocket and satellite 
at a cost of 270 million has blamed the failure on a design 
error it was martin mariettas second commercial launch of a 
payload into orbit and the fourth by an american company 
the intelsat vi satellite was intended to transmit three tv 
channels and up to 120000 telephone calls simultaneously for more 
than 13 years intelsat a notforprofit international consortium 
operates a global communications satellite system

the coroner called the young menominee 
indians death suicide tribal medicine men who invoked the 
victims spirit said it was accidental but a protracted fbi 
investigation has fueled rumors of foul play 
jeffery cloud 20 died of a pistol shot to the head nov 22 
his body was found in a pickup truck owned by apesanahkwat then 
tribal chairman the 357caliber pistol was taken from 
apesanahkwats home that day 
apesanahkwats teenage daughter who was clouds girlfriend and 
says she was the lone witness to the suicide has refused to take a 
liedetector test the tribal police chief says though her father 
denies that 
menominee county coroner rick herrera says he ruled clouds 
death a suicide without talking to apesanahkwats daughter 
because of evidence he found at the scene 
when it was obvious like that we dont do an autopsy 
herrera said 
apesanahkwat pronounced ahpehsahnehkwat said clouds 
spirits were contacted in an indian religious ceremony two weeks 
after his death and tribal medicine men are convinced the shooting 
was accidental not a suicide 
he didnt realize there were bullets in the gun that is 
almost a direct quote that was interpreted to me by the medicine 
men apesanahkwat said 
the fbi meanwhile says it is continuing its investigation but 
wont say why the agency has jurisdiction to investigate felonies 
on the reservation 
that has stirred questions on the menominee nations reservation 
of about 3000 people 45 miles northwest of green bay in 
eastcentral wisconsin 
apesanahkwat who decided two months after the death not to seek 
a fourth oneyear term as tribal chairman acknowledged he has 
heard rumors that he is a suspect and that cloud witnessed some 
kind of drug deal before dying 
he called the rumors totally groundless and ridiculous 
the former tribal chief known as melvin chevalier before he 
switched to his indian name several years ago is a 41yearold 
vietnam war veteran actor and indian lobbyist he says he has no 
idea why the fbi is keeping the case open 
tribal police chief kenneth paddo fish said the fbi continues 
investigating because 16yearold bernadette chevalier whose 
indian name is waupanoh has refused to take a liedetector test 
fbi agent tom martin of green bay would neither confirm nor deny 
that 
waupanoh pronounced waupahnah said in an interview last 
week i know what happened he cloud knows what happened the 
great spirit knows what happened 
but in a news conference thursday apesanahkwat disputed that 
his daughter refused to take the test he said the fbi had 
requested the test but a technician who was going to administer it 
told his wife that his daughter was too upset to take it 
apesanahkwat said there was no further need for her to take a 
test 
clouds mother isabel 47 refuses to believe her son committed 
suicide 
he had a lot of things going for him she said last week 
a high school dropout cloud was a happygolucky guy who 
would boogie to avoid trouble his mother said 
miss chevalier said that on the night he died cloud her 
boyfriend for nearly two years and she had argued and he went into 
the tribal chairmans home and grabbed a gun the gun belonged to 
one of apesanahkwats friends apesanahkwat said 
cloud started walking away alone and miss chevalier said she 
jumped into her fathers pickup after him crying and asking him to 
come back 
cloud got into the vehicle at some point she said he put the 
gun to the left side of his head she tried to pull it away and it 
went off frantic she drove back to her home where investigators 
found the body in the truck 
he had been depressed unhappy with his life and cried about it 
she said he had said one of these days i am going to take a 
walk and i am not going to come back 
ms cloud said her son loved waupanoh but had other girlfriends 
to kill himself over a girl why should he when he had all these 
other girls she said 
i just lay back and in my prayers for my son i tell him 
someone is going to get paid back for what they did to you if 
anybody did that to you that is what i keep telling myself she

he is not as notorious as captain bligh 
or captain ahab but captain joseph hazelwood former skipper of 
the exxon valdez has sailed unwillingly into americas lore of the 
sea 
while cartoonists sketched him as a liquorswigging villain and 
tv comics parodied the infamous grounding of his ship the 
passionately private hazelwood returned to alaska this winter 
nearly a year after the nations worst oil spill determined to 
clear his name 
id like to get rid of the misconception that i got drunk ran 
the ship aground and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away 
because thats just not what happened he said after the 
grounding of the exxon valdez had tarred his reputation along with 
hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
on thursday a jury found hazelwood innocent of the most serious 
charges against him convicting him only of a misdemeanor charge of 
negligent discharge of oil he faces up to 90 days in jail and a 
1000 fine 
he was acquitted of charges of seconddegree criminal mischief 
reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was the only person charged 
criminally in the environmental calamity he was accused of being 
drunk on duty and being away from the ships bridge when it rammed 
a charted reef 
he came back to alaska with some trepidation and kept a low 
profile outside court many nights he stayed in his hotel room 
watching old movies about sea captains rather than risk being 
recognized in public 
in court the balding bearded hazelwood sat mute watching in 
stoic silence as his crew members told their stories 
his demeanor was not unusual joe hazelwood had always been a 
man of few words 
his actions always spoke louder than his words because his 
words were not that many said attorney michael chalos 
hazelwoods former maritime college classmate who put together his 
defense team just days after the exxon valdez grounding made 
headlines 
in school says chalos the low key hazelwood was a natural 
leader very quiet but very determined 
he was captain of the lacrosse team and did well academically 
chalos recalls but was something of a rebel when it came to 
military authority his rebelliousness later would bring him into 
conflict with exxon executives over company policies 
when he graduated from new york state university maritime 
college at fort schyler hazelwood signed on with exxon shipping 
corp 
it was a plum appointment recalls chalos if you got a 
job with exxon youd made it 
he rose in the seagoing ranks obtained his masters license 
won the fleet award for efficiency in 1986 and in 1987 was given 
command of the brand new exxon valdez the most advanced hightech 
vessel in the exxon fleet 
he rarely spent more than three or four months at a time ashore 
but between voyages he returned to huntington where he and his 
wife suzanne live with their teenage daughter alison 
i get stark crazy when i am too far from the salt water he 
has said 
if there was a fatal flaw in hazelwoods smooth history of 
achievements it was his drinking he lost his new york motor 
vehicle drivers license after two drunken driving convictions and 
in 1985 with exxons knowledge he went through a 28day voluntary 
alcohol rehabilitation program 
was he drunk aboard the exxon valdez on the fateful night his 
crew members testified they saw no signs of intoxication although 
they had seen the captain put away a few drinks in town 
his blood alcohol reading was 061 in a test taken 10 hours 
after the grounding evidence was inconclusive on what his blood 
alcohol was earlier 
hazelwood true to his taciturn nature chose not to testify and 
never commented on the intoxication issue 
why didnt he testify attorneys said they were confident about 
their case and did not want to subject hazelwood to unnecessary 
grueling crossexamination they had another reason too 
sitting here at the defense table hes still the captain 
someone special said chalos if he had gotten up on the 
witness stand he wouldnt be special anymore hed be just another 
witness

jurors who acquitted tanker skipper 
joseph hazelwood of the most serious charges against him said there 
was no proof that alcohol played a role in the exxon valdez oil 
spill 
and while there was considerable debate about the maxim that a 
captain is responsible for his ship jurors said they were forced 
to recognize that the law doesnt say so 
in fact that caused some difficult times while we were in 
there said juror terrill smith we considered the fact that 
hazelwood was captain of his ship and the actions of his crew 
but when it come down to making a verdict we could not say 
that because that was not the law 
smith said he and the other jurors based their decision on the 
law and evidence and the state just didnt have the evidence 
asked who then was responsible for spilling nearly 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude oil into alaskas prince william sound 
last march smith said i dont know i cant answer that the 
only gentleman who was on trial was captain hazelwood 
hazelwood acquitted of charges of drunkenness and recklessness 
faces a possible fine of 1000 and 90 days in jail on the 
misdemeanor count of negligent discharge of oil 
smith and juror jeff sage said the state could not prove that 
alcohol played a role because authorities failed to give hazelwood 
a blood alcohol test until 10 hours after the grounding 
sage said he did not buy the prosecutions effort to prove 
hazelwood was intoxicated through backward calculations starting 
from his alcohol blood level when tested a level well below the 
alaska standard for drunken highway drivers 
we all agreed it was obvious in court that he had had 
something to drink prior to the grounding smith said but with 
the time involved it was not possible to determine beyond a 
reasonable doubt that alcohol played a role 
smith faulted the alaska laws under which hazelwood was 
prosecuted saying i think that there needs to be a long hard 
look taken at a lot of the laws pertaining to the navigational 
waters of our state 
he did not elaborate 
sage said he felt the jury rendered the only decision possible 
under the law 
its been a privilage im glad to stand here today and say 
that justice has been done sage said 
smith and sage said the jury believed that hazelwoods decision 
to leave the bridge shortly before the tanker hit a charted reef 
was not reckless as the state contended but only negligent 
thus the jury had no problem convicting him on the misdemeanor 
charge of negligent discharge of oil smith said 
sage he said he thought third mate gregory cousins and helmsman 
robert kagan probably were not the right team to leave on the 
bridge when hazelwood went below 
but smith noted that hazelwood apparently felt the ship was in 
competent hands 
sage also criticized the coast guard monitoring system for 
failing to warn the exxon valdez that it was nearing a reef after 
it changed course to avoid floating ice 
its a joke sage said seventy million bucks what did 
they spend it on theyre there to avoid collisions and 
groundings 
according to testimony the coast guard radar monitor said the 
exxon valdez disappeared from radar at some point before the 
disaster 
the jury did not feel hazelwood was a scapegoat for exxon and 
political forces as the defense argued smith said 
however he added personally i felt there was a possibility 
that may have been happening

the maryland senate today approved an unusual 
plan passing both an antiabortion bill and an abortion rights 
bill and giving the states voters a chance to decide which should 
become law 
acceptance of the twobill plan shortly after midnight broke an 
eightday filibuster in the senate where abortion rights forces 
had the 24 votes needed to pass a liberal abortion law but were one 
vote shy of the 32 required to end debate 
under the compromise that senate leaders worked out the 
abortion rights bill permitting unrestricted abortions during the 
early stages of pregnancy will become law unless it is petitioned 
to referendum and rejected by voters in november 
if that happens then the bill sponsored by antiabortion 
senators will become law unless it also is defeated by voters 
leaders on both sides of the issue in the house said after the 
compromise was revealed thursday that they would have to look at 
the two bills before deciding whether they could accept them 
the measures are structured so that both would have to be passed 
by the house of delegates and signed by the governor if one of the 
measures is rejected the other one dies 
gov william donald schaefers spokeswoman louise hayman said 
the governor would not comment on whether he would sign or veto the 
bills 
it is paternalistic patronizing demeaning and degrading to 
women sen barbara hoffman said of the antiabortion bill 
sen vernon boozer said if the antiabortion bill becomes law 
it would seriously impair the health and welfare of the women of 
this state 
the only response from antiabortion senators came from norman 
stone who said he considered the abortion rights bill the worst 
bill that has ever come before this body 
under the antiabortion bill before the fetus is viable or 
capable of living outside the womb abortions could be performed in 
cases of rape or incest to protect the mothers life or if the 
pregnancy would produce serious and adverse effects on the womans 
health after viability abortions could be performed only to save 
the mothers life 
the abortion rights bill would allow unrestricted access to 
abortions until viability after that it would permit abortions to 
protect the mothers life or health 
antiabortion groups have already formed a committee to collect 
signatures to put an abortion rights bill on the ballot if one is 
passed and signed by the governor in hopes of defeating it in a 
referendum 
prochoice lobbyists said they were unsure what they would do if 
the twobill package is accepted by the house and signed by the 
governor

president bushs budget chief is appealing to 
21 mostly junior senators for help in finding a way to get 
deficitreduction talks started between the white house and 
congressional leaders 
the bipartisan group of lawmakers gave a favorable reception to 
budget director richard darmans plea thursday but senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn dismissed the meeting 
sasser who did not attend predicted there would be no serious 
talks unless the administration expressed willingness to make deep 
cuts in the budget 
darman has been trying unsuccessfully to persuade congressional 
leaders to begin deficitreduction talks since bush released his 
fiscal 1991 budget proposal in january he launched his latest 
offensive two weeks ago after rep dan rostenkowski dill 
unveiled a plan to raise taxes and cut spending to save 512 
billion over the next five years 
sasser is one of several top senators including majority leader 
george mitchell of maine who have had poor relations with the 
budget director since last fall when disagreements over 
deficitcutting erupted 
sasser said he has not had a conversation with darman since 
various congressional budget writers regarded darmans visit as 
an attempt to mend fences or to pressure senate leaders to come to 
the table 
the budget director said the lawmakers with whom he met 
expressed some sense of frustration with the deficitreduction 
efforts of the congressional budget committees 
its not clear they will be able to produce anything 
substantive he said 
darman came to capitol hill after being invited to appear before 
a bipartisan group of senators who meet informally to discuss 
budget problems 
there is an intense desire to do more about deficit 
reduction said the groups leader sen kent conrad dnd who 
when elected in 1986 promised to only seek a second term if the 
federal budget deficit were under control 
darman told lawmakers it will probably take 45 billion to 50 
billion in deficit reductions to reduce next years projected 
shortfall to 64 billion because the economy weakened late last 
year 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law requires the deficit be 
reduced to 64 billion next year 
sasser said that for serious deficitreduction talks to occur 
the administration would have to make a presentation that theyd 
be interested in getting 50 billion in hard deficit reduction that 
would persist

the hostages release the resolution said the measure now goes to

the federal government has ordered a ban on 
the capture of bottlenose dolphins in the gulf of mexico as 
scientists try to determine the reason for more than 190 dolphin 
deaths this year 
dozens of dolphins have been stranded and died since jan 1 in 
five gulf states according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 118 in texas 40 to 45 on the barrier islands of 
louisiana and mississippi 21 in the alabamaflorida panhandle and 
10 in floridas tampa bay 
the dolphins have been stranded at four to five times the usual 
rate for the time of year and the deaths are continuing a noaa 
spokesman said 
noaa announced a halt in dolphin captures late wednesday to 
remain in effect through at least june 15 
william w fox jr noaas assistant administrator for 
fisheries said the national marine fisheries service retains the 
option to extend the ban 
although cold weather is believed responsible for the deaths of 
26 dolphins in texas matagorda bay the noaa spokesman said this 
thing could involve a number of reasons 
adult dolphins have been the victims but scientists in the past 
week or so have begun watching to assess how the calving season 
which began during the second week of march and goes into april 
will be affected 
under the marine mammal protection act bottlenose dolphins are 
considered a protected but not endangered or threatened species 
according to noaa 11 organizations hold permits to collect live 
dolphins but only three do the actual collecting the dolphins can 
be taken for educational purposes such as aquariums or marinetype

ashland oil co wants its towboat 
crews free of alcohol so the company is checking them for 
drunkendriving arrests to help avert pollution and 
publicrelations disasters like the exxon valdez oil spill 
theres no place for alcohol on a boat its too dangerous 
said mary hale a cook aboard the ashland a towboat working the 
ohio and mississippi rivers 
for pilots and crew members alcohol is more dangerous than the 
eight barges of gasoline diesel and crude oil they were pushing on 
a recent ohio river run from kenova wva to louisville ky 
the only alcohol aboard is in medicine cabinets 
you have to recognize danger while you still have time to do 
something about it said skip muscovalley one of the ashlands 
captains 
if we have the tiniest mistake our jobs and lives are at 
stake muscovalley said if you sink a grain barge or a coal 
barge well it happens and you just go on sink one of these dudes 
and you make the news youre the new joe hazelwood 
hazelwood 43 a veteran mariner from huntington ny was 
captain of the exxon valdez when the tanker ran aground and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil into alaskas prince william sound 
a year ago saturday it was the nations worst oil spill 
a state jury in anchorage acquitted hazelwood on thursday of 
criminal mischief reckless endangerment and operating a vessel 
while intoxicated but the jury convicted him of negligent 
discharge of oil which carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in 
jail and a 1000 fine 
authorities said a review of hazelwoods driving record 
uncovered two drunkendriving arrests and three license suspensions 
ashland oil officials thought reviewing its pilots driving 
records might find trouble spots before the company suffers a 
waterborne accident of its own 
we found a few people with duis in their history said zane 
meek ashlands administrator of marine transportation we told 
them our side of the story and told them we didnt want to see any 
kind of habit like that 
no pattern of abuse has developed and no one has been 
disciplined meek said 
were not after someone who has one incident any of us could 
have that occur said john joeckel company manager of fleet 
operations we really are trying to keep this a nonpunitive type 
of program because we want people who think they have a problem to 
come forward 
skippers say crews welcome the checks and understand ashlands 
need to protect its investment on runs from pennsylvania to 
louisiana to texas 
the cost of equipment has gone up and theres so much money 
involved that they couldnt afford any problems on their boats 
said merle adams an ashland skipper the company is looking out 
for its own welfare as well as your own 
ashland crews have 30 days on and 30 days off the tugboats run 
24 hours a day and crew members alternate sixhour shifts grabbing 
sleep and meals in their time off 
i know what to look for any kind of strange behavior said 
david smith captain of the valvoline another vessel in ashlands 
fleet we have 10 men on the boat if you work with the same 
men for a month you know if theyre acting differently

environmentalists and public officials 
said they were disappointed a jury absolved joseph hazelwood of 
most charges in the nations worst oil spill and vowed not to let 
the oil industry off the hook 
the whole system is culpable and exxon and hazelwood are just 
two agents in a very complicated and very flawed system of 
extraction and transportation of petroleum said mei mei evans 
coordinator of the oil reform alliance a group of residents 
affected by the spill 
hazelwood was convicted thursday of a misdemeanor charge of 
negligent discharge of oil but acquitted of three other more 
serious counts including drunkenness and recklessness he faces a 
possible 90 days in jail and a 1000 fine 
exxon said the verdicts seemed to confirm the spill last year of 
almost 11 million gallons of crude from the companys exxon valdez 
tanker was an accident 
but former valdez mayor john devens said the issue never was 
hazelwood 
there will always be joe hazelwoods devens said the spill 
showed that industry does not have the technology to deal with oil 
spills of that magnitude and that prevention must be stressed he 
said 
the real issue confronting the state of alaska is whether 
industry is prepared to prevent another oil spill devens said 
the state filed a civil lawsuit against exxon on aug 15 
joining more than 150 other civil litigants 
the result bears out the fact that there are other people 
responsible for this other than capt hazelwood gov steve 
cowper said 
exxon officials in new york reacted with apparent optimism 
following the verdict 
we are pleased that the ordeal of the trial is over for capt 
hazelwood and his family the verdict would seem to confirm the 
view that the grounding of the exxon valdez was an accident said 
exxon spokesman jim morakis 
in light of pending litigation any other comment would be 
inappropriate the company said 
in juneau alaska attorney general douglas baily said that he 
was pleased with the verdict which he said should not have any 
major effect on pending civil and criminal cases against exxon 
i suppose in an ideal world we would have preferred to have 
been more successful on some of the other counts baily said 
but we certainly accept the jurys verdict 
but assistant district attorney brent cole who argued the case 
said he was disappointed and remains convinced that hazelwood was 
drunk when the ship ran aground 
defense attorney dick madson said the defense plans to appeal on 
grounds that federal law preempts state law concerning oil spills 
and that a person who reports an oil spill as hazelwood did is 
immune from prosecution 
marnie isaacs spokeswoman for alyeska pipeline service co the 
consortium of oil companies that run the transalaska pipeline 
said many many factors contributed to the grounding of the 
valdez in addition to the actions of the captain 
the hazelwood verdicts are only the beginning of determining 
responsibility for the disaster some environnmentalists said 
bruce manheim spokesman for the environmental defense fund in 
washington dc said were certainly disappointed with that 
result but nonetheless we believe the real trial has yet to 
begin

contractors are doing a booming business 
in fallout shelters but the influx of hundreds of members of a 
religious group preparing for nuclear armageddon is jamming 
telephone lines in this rural community 
we go through periods where the phone doesnt ring at all an 
hour two hours at a time tim barnes general manager of the 
chico hot springs resort said thursday then the phone might 
suddenly come open and well have a flood of calls 
the local population of members of the church universal and 
triumphant mushroomed this year after spirtual leader elizabeth 
clare prophet warned members that march and april are dangerous 
times and suggested they come to montana to make preparations for 
a possible nuclear war or accident 
the influx has meant a boom for area contractors building 
fallout shelters for church members in the scenic mountain valley 
just north of yellowstone national park 
but it also has led to an increased demand for telephone service 
that has overloaded the valleys antiquated central telephone 
system 
we have had in the last month some rapid and unexpected growth 
in the paradise valley said crystal shors spokeswoman for us 
west communications its basically exhausted the callswitching 
capability of the system 
the church sponsors two housing developments at emigrant in 
southwestern montana where park county officials say as many as 45 
private underground fallout shelters exist officials said in 
january that about 500 people lived at the developments and that 
the numbers have increased since then 
shors said new telephone equipment will be installed within two 
weeks to improve service but that a more complete system will not 
be ready until fall 
and while barnes worries about losing summer reservations 
because of problems with the telephone lines that doesnt mean his 
business has hard feelings for church universal members 
some are even staying at the resort while they try to find a 
place to live 
weve always had the policy that everyone is welcome here

prime minister margaret thatchers candidate 
suffered a spectacular defeat in a special parliamentary election 
losing a conservative party stronghold in a rebuke of a new tax and 
high interest rates 
the opposition labor party today rejoiced in seizing the 
prosperous central england district of midstaffordshire 
overturning a majority of more than 14000 for the conservatives 
worst loss in a special election in half a century 
the conservative loss thursday was likely to renew speculation 
that worried rankandfile legislators might try to dump mrs 
thatcher as leader before the next general election due by 
mid1992 
labor leader neil kinnock today called the victory 
monumental and said it marked a turning point for the 
conservatives who are going to have to make up their minds how 
quickly they get rid of mrs thatcher 
labor candidate sylvia heal a social worker more than doubled 
the partys votes from the last election in 1987 to win 49 percent 
and a 9449vote plurality 
there has been a significant change in attitude of the people 
of this constituency and i believe of the country mrs heal told 
cheering supporters 
the conservatives charles prior got 33 percent and the centrist 
social and liberal democratic party candidate 11 percent the 
remaining vote were scattered among the greens a splinter centrist 
party and fringe candidates 
the swing to labor from the conservatives was 2133 percent 
with 775 percent of eligible voters casting ballots mrs heal 
polled 27649 votes prior 18200 votes and social and liberal 
candidate tim jones 6315 votes eleven other candidates got a 
total of 4195 votes 
the previous conservative member of parliament who committed 
suicide in december won midstaffordshire with 50 percent of the 
vote in britains 1987 general election 
this is a bad result said conservative party chairman 
kenneth baker however the government has had to take difficult 
decisions over inflation and the economy 
baker blamed the loss on protest votes cast against mrs 
thatchers government and its new community charge tax 
the tax dubbed a poll tax and designed to replace property 
taxes in financing local government has caused temporary 
unpopularity he said under the tax each district charges a set 
amount per head regardless of income 
a bbc survey thursday night of the four latest opinion polls 
showed labor surged to a 21point lead nationally it was labors 
biggest lead since mrs thatcher came to power 11 years ago 
a year ago the tories had a 10point lead nationally 
this is a stunning victory for labor said jack cunningham 
the partys campaign manager it is a political landmark that 
proves that labor can win across britain 
thatcher aides had braced for defeat in midstaffordshire but 
labors victory margin was wider than expected 
exit polls by harris and national opinion poll said voters also 
showed antipathy toward mrs thatcher personally 
harris reported that 84 percent of defecting conservatives said 
mrs thatcher should resign before the next general election and 
national opinion poll said 38 percent wanted her to go 
cunningham said voters were absolutely fed up with mrs 
thatcher 
she is out of touch she doesnt seem to understand their 
problems and she doesnt seem to care he said 
the contest in the 71200voter constituency attracted national 
attention as the first since nationwide rallies erupted against the 
new tax 
in what labor party members called an ignominious retreat 
mrs thatcher on thursday extended poll tax rebates to scotland 
where the tax was introduced a year ago 
another campaign issue was interest rates which have doubled to 
15 percent in under two years the government is trying to curb 
inflation with high interest rates but with little success so far 
inflation runs at 77 percent 
the government is counting on a drop in inflation by early next 
year so it can lower interest rates in time for the general 
election 
the midstaffordshire district includes skilled bluecollar 
workers who voted conservative through the 80s and now have been 
hit hard by high home loan rates 
despite the loss mrs thatcher kept overwhelming control of the 
650member house of commons where she has 374 seats and labor has 
229 the social and liberal democrats have 19 seats and the rest 
are held by minority parties

respect for human rights in the 
warravaged nation has deteriorated to its lowest level since death 
squads killed thousands in the early 1980s a us monitoring 
organization reported 
americas watch said in a 272page report issued thursday that 
the deterioration underscores the failure of us human rights 
policy in el salvador throughout the decade 
washington has provided 38 billion in aid to el salvador since 
1980 but several us congressmen have expressed reluctance to 
continue the funding 
the report contends there has been an increase in torture by 
security forces escalation of deathsquad activity assassination 
of civilian officials by leftist rebels indiscriminate use of 
homemade guerrilla mortars and several instances of massacres by 
government troops 
the november offensive by fighters of the farabundo marti 
national liberation front of fmln signalled the worsening in 
human rights conditions according to the report 
the military crisis exacerbated tensions within the military 
and thrust extremist elements to the fore the rhetoric of high 
officials reflected the charged intensity of the moment and 
spurred some units to engage in lawless actions targeted killings 
by both the armed forces and the fmln increased it said 
the report cites the nov 16 murder by army troops of six jesuit 
educators their housekeeper and her daughter at central american 
university as cause to wonder at how little things have actually 
changed in el salvador 
a colonel three lieutenants and four soldiers have been 
arrested and charged in the jesuit massacre 
despite limited progress in the prosecuttion of the jesuit 
case there is a real danger that the true authors of crime may not 
have been identified and that the highest ranking officer 
implicated so far will not be convicted or punished said 
americas watch which is based in new york 
between 1980 and 1984 officially sponsored or tolerated 
rightwing death squads killed up to 30000 suspected leftists 
while the numbers of targeted killings in recent years do not 
approach the carnage of the early 1980s the trend has not been 
towards steady improvement the report said 
moreover declining numbers of political murders do not 
indicate greater respect for human rights within the armed forces 
or enhanced freedom to express political dissent the level of 
violence is still such that it is dangerous to express certain 
views or maintain certain associations 
the report recalls the march 24 1980 assassination of 
archbishop oscar arnulfo romero though evidence implicating 
extreme rightists was compiled by the 198489 christian democratic 
government no one has been charged with involvement in that murder 
the murder of archbishop romero in 1980 and the slaying of the 
jesuits in 1989 stand as bookends to the decade offering harsh 
testimony about who really rules el salvador and how little they 
have changed ten years later priestkilling is still a preferred 
option for those who simply will not hear the cries for change and 
justice in a society that has had too little of either the 
report said

federal health officials while characterizing 
alcohol abuse as a major health problem say its difficult to 
determine how many drinks it takes to cause such diseases as cancer 
or tuberculosis 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
its researchers used computer software to project how often various 
causes of death are related to drinking then they projected the 
loss of life and lost lifeyears from drinking 
in 1987 the latest year for which projections are available 
105095 americans died either from drunken injury or diseases 
linked to drinking 
when the victims life expectancy was figured in alcohol robbed 
them of more than 27 million years of life or about 26 years 
each 
the leading boozerelated cause of death injuries chiefly in 
drunkendriving crashes 
unintentional injuries related to alcohol killed 30205 
americans in 1987 29 percent of alcoholrelated deaths second 
were digestive diseases including alcoholic cirrhosis of the 
liver they killed 19556 
this does not mean a problem for everyone who drinks said 
dr james shultz of the university of miami school of medicine the 
lead researcher for the cdc report 
he noted that tens of millions of persons drink adding so a 
minority of those who drink have a fatal outcome 
but the deaths from booze nearly 300 a day mean that 
alcohol is a major problem shultz said now its for 
policymakers to assess that problem and make determinations on 
appropriate policy 
studies of alcoholrelated sickness and death are subject to 
much conjecture over whos in and whos out and just what 
alcoholrelated should mean binge drunkenness heavy drinking 
or even moderate lifelong drinking shultz said 
shultzs study used estimates from previous research for various 
conditions for example mouth cancer deaths are believed 
alcoholrelated 50 percent of the time and respiratory 
tuberculosis deaths are alcoholrelated 25 percent of the time 
even then researchers disagree over the question of how much 
drinking makes someones death alcoholrelated and not simply 
the natural death of someone who drank 
but shultz said most deaths from booze fall into two patterns 
sudden violent deaths from a dangerous drunken episode and 
longterm debilitating heavy drinking that brings on disease 
if we had everyone who drinks drinking very occasionally at 
levels not likely to produce injuryprone dangerous behavior 
youd have very few alcoholrelated deaths he said 
the costs of alcoholrelated deaths are high the cdc said in a 
related report from wisconsin health officials the cdc reported 
that 1949 alcoholrelated deaths occurred there in 1988 robbing 
victims of 46052 years of life and wreaking economic costs from 
health care police lost productivity and other factors of 147 
billion

attorney general jim mattox conceded he has 
no proof but said he still believes his opponent for the 
democratic gubernatorial nomination state treasurer ann richards 
has used illegal drugs 
in calls to several news organizations thursday mattox again 
raised the drug use question that ms richards refused to answer in 
the weeks before the march 13 primary 
i do not believe that a person who takes the fifth amendment 
can then go on and lead a war on drugs mattox said 
the richards campaign responded by producing the results of a 
blood test ms richards took last weekend in austin the results 
were negative 
ms richards gathered the most votes in the primary but not did 
not get a majority she will face mattox in a runoff april 10 
before the primary ms richards said she has not taken 
moodaltering substances since her release from a minnesota alcohol 
dependency program in 1980 she has said that to comment further 
would discourage people who have recovered from drug and alcohol 
problems from seeking office 
in his media blitz thursday mattox said of ms richards the 
only logical question that always must be asked is what kind of 
things did you use before 1980 and where did you get them how 
often did you use them who supplied them to you 
he told woai in san antonio that hes not in doubt that ms 
richards has used illegal drugs 
richards spokesman monte williams said the candidate took a 
drug test last weekend in response to questions about democratic 
candidates willingness to take such a test 
mattox has not taken a drug test but a spokeswoman said he 
would mattox has persistently said he has never taken illegal 
drugs

lebanons most influential shiite moslem 
cleric today spoke of a new situation regarding the fate of the 
western hostages held by proiranian underground factions in 
lebanon 
however sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah the reputed spiritual 
leader of the iranianbacked hezbollah group said he had no 
specific information about when any of the hostages might be freed 
most of the 18 westerners missing are believed held by shiite 
moslem groups loyal to iran 
a statement released by fadlallahs office said the clergyman 
asked about the possibility of a hostage release in a radio 
interview replied a new situation has emerged but i dont know 
when how and where 
no further remarks on the issue were included in the release 
also today the weekly magazine ashshiraa said fadlallah had 
replied through an intermediary to questions from former president 
jimmy carter on the issue 
the story dealt with the hostages whereabouts and the 
possibility of releasing them but gave no specific examples 
fadlallah visited damascus during carters visit to the syrian 
capital earlier this month diplomatic sources have said the two 
did not meet 
fadlallah said feb 23 that the issue of the western captives 
was being exploited to distort islams image and called for a 
humanitarian approach to free them 
his remarks echoed an earlier editorial in the englishlanguage 
tehran times newspaper in iran which often reflects the thinking 
of president hashemi rafsanjani 
the past month has seen a series of contradictory statements 
over the fate of the hostages indicating a fight over the issue 
within the tehran government 
moderates led by rafsanjani have said the hostage issue was 
moving toward a solution while radicals lead by parliament member 
ali mohammed mohtashemi have encouraged the captors to hold onto 
the hostages 
the radicals are believed to hold more sway over the factions in 
lebanon actually holding the westerners with hezbollah considered 
an umbrella group for them 
the revolutionary justice organization which holds two of the 
eight american hostages said in a statement march 7 no hostages 
will be freed 
addressing fadlallah without referring to him by name the 
statement expressed sorrow over irresponsible declarations by 
local friends to free the hostages 
we call upon them friends to concentrate their humanitarian 
attempts on areas that can be more positive the statement added 
most of the hostages have been held for more than three years 
the longestheld is american terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
in another report ashshiraa said alleged usiranian 
negotiations have reached their final stages after agreement was 
reached on almost all topics including the issue of the foreign 
hostages 
whats left is only carrying out the agreement according to 
acceptable scenarios that would save face for iran and guarantee 
for washingtonits return to strategically vital iran said the 
report which cited no sources 
ashshiraa gained international recognition in 1987 for breaking 
the story that the reagan administration was trading arms for us 
hostages however its frequent reports over the past two years 
that a hostage release was imminent have not proved accurate 
both iran and the united states have denied a spate of recent 
reports that they are negotiating directly on the hostage issue

an eighth member of prime minister toshiki kaifus 
new cabinet today acknowledged receiving donations from a company 
at the center of an influencebuying scandal 
i would like to make a sincere apology said takashi fukaya 
the post and telecommunications minister at a nationally televised 
meeting of the upper house budget committee 
fukaya said his support group received more than 5200 from 
recruit co over 3 years until july 1988 when the scandal 
surfaced he also said his support group mistakenly continued 
to receive recruit money until that november but returned all 
contributions made after august 
fukaya had earlier said he did not receive donations from 
recruit after july 1988 in a news conference last week he 
promised a further review of his records when asked about 
allegations he received money after that summer 
he said the inaccuracies resulted from my lack of 
explanation misunderstandings and insufficient communciation with 
my office staff 
twelve politicians public officials and recruit executives are 
facing charges of bribery in connection with the recruit stock 
deals former prime minister noboru takeshita resigned to take 
responsibility 
the scandal contributed to a major election loss and cleared the 
way for the rise of kaifu who took office with a clean image and 
promises of political reforms but has since acknowledged receiving 
102800 in recruit donations 
the information conglomerate offered thousands of cutrate stock 
shares to powerful lawmakers and business leaders before the shares 
were listed for public sale the company has also been criticized 
for doling out millions of dollars in political donations 
kaifu today promised he will investigate whether fukayas 
actions violated ethical guidelines and said he will announce by 
early april whether punishment is in order 
at a parliamentary session in early march kaifu said he and six 
other members of his new cabinet had received donations from 
recruit 
kaifu said all of these ministers had received donations before 
the recruit scandal had surfaced 
though the statement followed numerous comments by the prime 
minister that he would try to keep politicians tainted with recruit 
case or other scandals out of his administration he has taken no 
action against the ministers 
the prime minister said fukaya did not identify himself as a 
recipient of donations from recruit when he was choosing members of 
his second cabinet following a feb 18 election victory by the 
governing liberal democratic party 
meanwhile socialist ryosuke yasutsune demanded kaifu comment on 
a report by a masscirculation weekly magazine shukan bunshun that 
kaifu had received 170000 from recruit 
why dont you take action such as demanding bunshun publish a 
correction and apology to gain the public understanding if the 
story is false said yasutsune i also want to remind you that 
you should follow your predecessors and take responsibility in case 
any new facts about you are revealed

part of the berlin wall which was a symbol 
of socialism and a barrier to capitalism for nearly three decades 
could be turned into a giant billboard 
the east german advertising firm wuva has acquired local 
government rights to a 3300foot section of the berlin wall the 
newspaper neues deutschland said thursday 
company chief andreas dademasch wants to paint the wall white 
and recruit german companies to rent space on the structure huge 
sections of which already have been demolished by freedom lovers 
and souvenir seekers 
some of the money would go to the city and posters advertising 
such vices as cigarettes alcohol or sexrelated products would not 
be allowed he said 
the wall tightly guarded since east germany erected it in 1961 
was opened in november after huge demonstrations forced hardline 
communists from power 
dademasch said his plans for part of the wall would be 
consistent with the trumpeting of capitalism by christian 
democratic union chief lothar de maziere whose party leads an 
alliance that won sundays election in east germany

the hong kong government today proposed to 
outlaw trade in ivory in this british colony by july 
under legislation introduced today the import or export of 
ivory will be banned as part of an international agreement to save 
africas elephants whose population has dropped from 15 million 
in the 1970s to about 600000 
poachers kill the elephants for their tusks which are used here 
to make intricate ivory artwork 
the proposal is open for public and legislative comments if 
passed it will become law on july 17 said mary leung spokeswoman 
for the agricultural and fisheries department 
an international conference agreed in october to ban worldwide 
trade in ivory from january hong kongs ivory traders and carvers 
condemned the decision claiming it would destroy their livelihood 
hong kong was eventually allowed a sixmonth delay on the ban to 
allow it to eliminate a 670ton stockpile of ivory worth an 
estimated 128 million 
the bill fully demonstrates that hong kong has no intention 
whatsoever of extending ivory trade beyond the sixmonth 
reservation period the agricultural and fisheries department 
said in a statement

a man charged with possessing 20 
million worth of stolen rare books has a 20year history of arrests 
on theft charges but kept getting off lightly according to a 
police officer investigating thefts at a university library 
i know his measurements i know his mannerisms but ive never 
met him but id know him if he walked in the door cpl j steve 
huntsberry of the washington state university police department at 
pullman wash said thursday ive traced his trail throughout 
the united states 
stephen carrie blumberg 41 was arrested tuesday in ottumwa in 
southeastern iowa and charged with possessing stolen goods worth 
more than 5000 and knowingly taken across state lines the fbi 
said 11000 rare books and documents at his home in ottumwa were 
stolen from universities and private collections across the country 
the fbi began work wednesday trying to match the thousands of 
books with reports of stolen materials its going to take months 
it could stretch well over a year said fbi agent larry 
holmquist 
huntsberry said he was assigned fulltime in december 1987 to 
study the theft of 500000 worth of books from washington state 
universitys holland library he said he had not determined if any 
of the holland libarys books were seized in ottumwa 
he chronicled blumbergs arrests from riverside calif to 
dubuque iowa for an article in the february issue of library amp 
archival security magazine a trade journal published by haworth 
press of binghamton ny 
blumberg kept getting off with a slap on the wrist 
huntsberry said 
don nickerson an attorney representing blumberg said thursday 
as far as im concerned thats just unverified information 
officials in riverside calif greeley colo and dubuque 
iowa confirmed the arrests on charges of possessing burglary 
tools larceny and theft 
huntsberry said blumberg was first arrested at age 19 in dubuque 
on charges of stealing antique doorknobs dubuque police confirmed 
that warrants were issued for blumberg in december 1967 for 
carrying a concealed weapon and in february 1968 for larceny there 
was no word if the cases resulted in prosecution the dubuque 
county attorneys office said records that old were not available 
huntsberry said the first arrest linking blumberg to rare books 
was in 1974 in fort lupton colo near greeley where he had his 
car just stuffed from the rafters to the floor with books from 
universities in iowa nebraska minnesota and colorado 
tom quammen an assistant district attorney in the area said 
blumberg was charged with felony theft in april 1974 but a judge 
dismissed the case later that year 
huntsberry said he discovered that a man arrested at the 
university of californiariverside library on charges of possessing 
burglary tools and trespassing had the schedule for holland library 
in his briefcase 
the man gave the name matt mcgue but fingerprint comparisons 
identified the man as stephen carrie blumberg huntsberry said 
the district attorneys office in riverside county calif said

an opinion poll released today showed a 
lastminute swing toward the conservative opposition indicating 
prime minister bob hawke might be thwarted in his bid for a record 
fourth consecutive term 
hawke the labor party leader has said saturdays parliamentary 
election was the most important in more than 40 years 
he said the vote would set australias course into the 21st 
century 
hawke in office seven years is the most enduring and popular 
labor party leader and goes into the election on his record of 
economic reform 
his opponent liberal party leader andrew peacock 51 has 
hammered the government over high interest rates which at a record 
18 percent hurt home buyers and small businesses but few issues 
were discussed in the campaign 
the hawke government first elected in 1983 then again in 1984 
and 1987 faces other domestic problems as well the foreign debt 
stands at 100 billion and a lengthy pilots dispute has crippled 
tourism 
earlier polls indicated a close result but morgan gallup said 
today taht peacocks coalition of the liberal and national parties 
led the government 42 percent to 395 percent the poll results 
shown on national television did not say how many people were 
surveyed or give a margin of error 
australia has 106 million voters and voting is compulsory 
most major newspapers today threw their support behind the 
60yearold prime minister the sydney morning herald said the 
hawke government should be reelected not because its record of 
economic management is perfect but because it is more likely than 
mr peacock to solve economic problems 
editorial writers have called it an election without issues 
noting that foreign policy and defense have not been questions 
australia is a close us ally and president bush today said he 
wanted to visit australia soon but not before the election 
if there is any national mood overall it is that an angry 
electorate wants to kick hawke in the teeth to teach him a lesson 
but cannot quite bring itself to vote for peacock wrote the 
couriermail newspaper of brisbane 
campaigning has been muted the herald observed each party 
leader has the combined charisma of a wet salad sandwich 
peacock a former foreign minister is making his second attempt 
to become prime minister and is widely regarded as fighting his 
last political battle 
he drew charges of racism this week after saying his coalition 
would scrap a japanese proposal to build a multibilliondollar 
futuristic hightech city in australia peacock said he was 
opposed to ceating an enclave 
hawke responded that peacock was against immigrants a serious 
charge in a country whose first settlers were prisoners expelled 
from britain 
when the campaign began last month hawke said i believe the 
election is the most important one since 1949 referring to a 
labor loss that began 23 years in power for the liberals 
the election will essentially determine the character of the 
nation that we are going to have in the 21st century hawke said

the government ordered cubas 
ambassador to leave the country within five days because he refuses 
to recognize the new administration of president guillermo endara 
the cuban governments position has been one of harassment 
hostility and rejection foreign minister julio linares said 
thursday after telling cuban ambassador lazaro mora secades he had 
to leave by tuesday were not going to let a goverment that is 
saying it doesnt recognize president endara maintain accredited 
diplomatic missions in panama 
endara was installed at the beginning of the dec 20 us 
invasion that ousted panamas military leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega who maintained friendly relations with communist cuba and 
shared president fidel castros hostility toward the united states 
noriega took refuge at the vatican embassy before giving himself 
up to us authorities and was flown to florida to face federal 
drug trafficking and moneylaundering charges 
several members of noriegas family took refuge in the cuban 
embassy in panama city after the american invasion they have since 
been given safe conduct out of the country 
endara has a legitimacy that no other latin american 
government enjoys since no latin american leader has been elected 
with an overwhelming 31 mayority linares said referring to the 
may 1989 election noriega anulled 
the expulsion puts us on the edge of breaking of diplomatic 
relations with cuba linares said but he added cuba can 
answer by breaking off diplomacy thats its problem thats its 
decision 
panama maintains a diplomatic mission in cuba 
linares said that if diplomatic relations are broken cuban 
diplomats should take with them luis gomez a leader of the 
paramilitary dignity battalions and a former congressman who took 
refuge in the cuban embassy 
linares has said panama refuses to let gomez out of the country 
because two charges of assassination have been filed against him

an american who belonged to the irish republican 
army lost an appeal today of his conviction for the 1975 murder of 
a london policeman 
the court of appeal upheld the conviction of william quinn 42 
who was extradited to britain and sentenced to life in prison in 
february 1988 for shooting a 21yearold constable stephen tibble 
while fleeing arrest 
quinn had appealed claiming faulty identification by a 
policeman who saw the shooting it offended against almost all 
the rules designed to safeguard suspects from misidentification 
argued his attorney michael mansfield 
lord lane presiding over the threejudge panel conceded that 
it was very far from being the best sort of identification 
evidence 
but it was relevant evidence of significant weight and 
did not have such an adverse effect upon the fairness of the 
proceedings that it should have been disqualified he said 
after the shooting quinn went to ireland where he was jailed 
for 12 months for ira membership it was at that trial that he was 
secretly identified by a scotland yard detective adrian 
blackledge as tibbles killer 
mansfield argued that such an identification was inadmissible in 
court and that by failing to inform quinn of it the prosecution 
deprived him of an opportunity to establish an alibi 
after his release from irish prison quinn returned to the san 
francisco area britain requested his extradition and after a 
fiveyear legal fight he was flown to london by the fbi

pakistan showed off its military 
muscle today during celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of a 
decision to create a moslem nation from predominantly hindu india 
president ghulam ishaq khans speech at the pakistan day 
military parade was laced with warnings to india and promises that 
pakistan would stand behind freedom movements 
he referred specifically to the 2monthold uprising in the 
disputed state of jammukashmir where moslem militants are 
fighting for independence 
ishaq khan urged india to learn historys lesson that 
liberation movements cannot be suprressed or crushed with the use 
of might 
the former princely state of kashmir was divided between 
pakistan and india following the end to british colonial rule in 
1947 
the president who has been aligned with often hostile 
opposition parties smiled and chatted with prime minister benazir 
bhutto throughout the twohour parade an indication that the two 
had reached an amicable understanding 
since taking power on dec 2 1988 ms bhutto and her 
rightwing opposition have been at loggerheads and periodically 
engage in socalled war of rallies with each trying to eclipse the 
other in attendance 
ms bhuttos populist pakistan peoples party staged a rally 
tuesday in the eastern punjab capital of lahore her oppositions 
homeground hundreds of thousands attended today the opposition 
retaliated with its own rally local journalists said turnout was

residents of small towns that are losing 
business and population because there are fewer farms in the united 
states are closer to getting help from the federal government 
a rural development bill was approved 36045 by the house and 
sent on thursday to a conference committee for negotiators to work 
out differences with the senate version 
they can be meshed said rep glenn english dokla who 
wrote the house version with rep tom coleman rmo 
english said a key provision would establish state review panels 
to set priorities on how federal money should be used he said the 
experts on those 16member panels will represent many resources in 
the states and have access to money beyond that available in 
washington 
they probably are going to make the big difference when it is 
all said and done english said the concept of the panels is 
that it brings all the resources together 
representatives would come from government business and local 
community organizations 
the bill was hung up for a week because of a dispute over how 
states could use about 800 million in three separate funds in the 
bill 
rep charles rose dnc led a movement to stop the bills 
authors from pooling the funds 600 million in sewer and water 
100 million in community facilities and 100 million in business 
and industry development 
english and coleman wanted to let states decide for themselves 
how to use the money so they could direct funds from the overall 
pool to where local officials decided it is most needed 
but rose successfully argued that the sewer and water fund might 
be depleted leaving communities in worse shape than theyre in now 
on thursday the house reached a compromise that frees up 90 
million of about 450 million government loans that can be used for 
either sewer and water or community facilities 
it freezes all the grant money in the three categories as it is 
now and it allows the shifting of guaranteed loans among the 
three categories

in panama last year and nicaragua this year 
the demand from washington was unambiguous hold a free and fair 
election its hard to imagine elections anywhere that were 
scrutinized more closely 
now comes a book by robert caro suggesting one of the most 
important us elections of the postwar era was in fact rigged 
by lyndon johnson 
caro makes the case that the outcome of the 1948 senate 
democratic primary race in texas did not reflect the will of the 
voters because johnson stuffed ballot boxes with 35000 phony 
votes giving him an 87vote margin over coke stevenson 
johnson of course went on to become senate majority leader and 
president the course of history was altered by what happened in 
1948 assuming caro got his facts straight thus far credible 
evidence to refute him has not surfaced 
that election is not the only one about which questions have 
been raised the public probably will never know whether john f 
kennedy actually beat richard nixon in 1960 because of strange 
happenings on election night in illinois 
the furor over caros book arising as nicaraguans were 
preparing to vote raises the question does the us have the 
moral authority to demand purity in foreign elections in light of 
the spotty record at home 
the election run by daniel ortega was certainly more honest than 
the texas primary caro describes perhaps ortega soon to retire 
should offer to monitor us elections to ensure the will of the 
american people is not trampled on 
can you envision ortega paying a visit to sen phil gramm 
rtexas on election night next november and asking him to respect 
the outcome of his bid for another term 
to do otherwise would strike a blow at the democratic 
process statesman ortega might counsel gramm 
kidding aside the founding fathers got it right government 
cant be trusted there are pious moralisms in public statements 
and at times an anything goes attitude behind the scenes 
all governments for example are very selective about when to 
express indignation 
when an anticommunist is slain say in el salvador the us 
government is quick to blame leftist guerrillas when someone from 
the left is killed us officials invariably say they are puzzled 
about who did the deed 
for years the united states had been saying the big problem in 
afghanistan was the soviet military presence well the soviets 
have been gone for more than a year but the fighting persists 
partly because us weapons deliveries are still going to the 
afghan rebels 
john f burns a new york times reporter writes that rebel 
rocket attacks killed an estimated 1000 people in kabul the 
capital last year and several times that many across the country 
among afghans burns writes the damage to american prestige 
has been immense they now look on the united states as a distant 
power that sanctions the routine killing of civilians he says 
the state department attitude is to say as little as possible 
about the rebel abuses on the other hand virtually every election 
abuse committed by the sandinistas last winter was dealt with as a 
matter of utmost gravity 
the us government of course has no monopoly on hypocrisy and 
probably comes out better than most countries many latin american 
presidents who attended the recent presidential inaugural in chile 
took steps to avoid being photographed with the departing augusto 
pinochet a dictator is one thing but being associated with an 
unelected president was too much 
but that high principle was set aside last year when the same 
latin american presidents rallied behind cuba for one of the 
coveted hemispheric seats in the un security council there are 
almost 20 countries in spanishspeaking latin america cuba is now 
the only one without an elected president but now sits proudly in 
the security council 
of course cuba itself sometimes leaves itself open to 
allegations that it deviates from high principle government 
propagandists call cuba the first free country of the americas 
anyone who disputes that claim runs the risk of imprisonment

armored cars and jeeps mounted with 
machine guns patrolled the quiet capital today after the 
assassination of a leftwing presidential candidate caused fierce 
clashes between police and protesters 
the government blamed a drug baron for thursdays killing of 
patiotic union candidate bernardo jaramillo the second 
presidential contender slain in seven months it said the killing 
marked a new antigovernment offensive by drug traffickers 
the head of the medellin drug cartel pablo escobar sent a 
letter to a leftist leader denying any involvement in jaramillos 
death and suggesting that other drug traffickers were to blame 
according to the colombian radio networks rcn and caracol 
jaramillo was shot thursday morning at bogotas international 
airport by a a young man who reached out as if to greet the 
candidate then shot him with a submachine gun hidden in a 
newspaper 
his bodyguards shot and wounded the gunman a 16yearold boy 
who carried false identification papers before he was captured at 
least two other people were reported wounded 
jaramillo 38 was the 1044th patriotic union party member to 
be killed in the past six years many of the slayings have been 
attributed to rightwing death squads authorities say the squads 
are run by drug traffickers 
others say colombias army and police are involved in the squads 
to quell a leftist guerrilla insurgency 
jaramillos body lay in state in the capitol building 
his killing caused battles thursday between police and leftist 
protesters who burned five buses and shattered store windows in 
downtown bogota police said the fighting killed one soldier and 
wounded four policeman and a civilian 
armored cars with 20mm cannons and jeeps mounted with machine 
guns cruised the city of 6 million people this morning the 
government banned alcohol sales and closed all private schools in 
bogota the city was calm 
the patriotic union urged a national strike but president 
virgilio barco appealed to colombians to unite to confront the 
new offensive by the violent ones 
a communique from the national security council said escobar 
contracted jaramillos killer for about 750 police intercepted a 
communication between escobar to an associate in which they 
discussed the deal the communique said 
the head of the countrys intelligence police miguel maza 
marquez himself the target of attacks by drug traffickers said 
the young gunman told police the cartel was planning more attacks 
the commander of the army brigade in medellin gen harold 
bedoya said in an interview today with radio caracol that the army 
had irrefutable proof of escobars guilt in the killing he did not 
elaborate 
escobar this morning sent a letter to diego montana the 
president of the patriotic union according to the two radio 
networks both networks said they were sent copies of the letter 
written in longhand and bearing what appeared to be the authentic 
signature and a fingerprint of escobar 
escobars letter reportedly said that another medellin cartel 
leader gonzalo rodriguez gacha had ordered the killing of 
jaramillo last year escobar reportedly wrote that he intervened to 
stop the assassination 
rodriguez gacha was killed dec 15 in a gunbattle with police on 
colombias north coast but it is known that the head of his 
private army fidel castano has kept the rodriguez gacha faction 
together and wields great power among the traffickers 
a man claiming to represent the medellin cartel said in a 
telephone call to the caracol radio network that jaramillos 
killing was the beginning of a new terrorist offensive he said the 
next target would be cesar gaviria the governing liberal party 
candidate in the elections may 27 
he gaviria could have 100 bodyguards or wear a bulletproof 
vest including over his head but he will be the next one the 
caller said 
gaviria served as campaign chairman for sen luis carlos galan 
who was killed by traffickers at a political rally aug 18 
hours after galans death barco launched a crackdown on drug 
barons and began efforts to extradite them to the united states in 
colombia traffickers often intimidate or bribe judges to ensure 
light sentences or no sentences 
the medellin drug cartel responded to barcos crackdown with 
bombings that killed 209 colombians before the group announced a 
truce on jan 17 
the caller said the cartel renewed its attacks because barco 
rejected its offer to surrender in exchange for an end to 
extraditions the government has extradited 14 drug trafficking 
suspects to the united states 
barco has said the government will make no concessions to 
traffickers and that they should turn themselves in 
the caller responded yes we will turn ourselves in but 
dead before that this country is going to be half destroyed 
because tomorrow we are going to renew terrorist attacks 
especially against government and leftist objectives 
you journalists before you see our bodies will see the 
bodies of other distinguished people in this country like 
jaramillo

a filipino general who claimed a us 
intelligence agent offered weapons to mutineers in the december 
coup attempt said today he now thinks the man was an impostor 
brig gen alejandro galido who spied on coup plotters had 
said an american claiming to be a us air force colonel and 
representative of the us defense intelligence agency told him in 
july that the agency favors the overthrow of the president 
corazon aquino government 
galidos statement released wednesday said the man who 
identified himself as harold magleo promised to deliver weapons 
for the rebellion and that the us defense intelligence agency 
wanted ferdinand marcos returned to power 
but in a television interview today galido the former chief of 
the southern luzon command said he thought the man was posing as a 
us agent 
i really do not know his true identity he could be one of 
those impostors one who pretends to be an intelligence officer of 
the dia galido said in an interview with channel 2 
the chief of staff gen renato de villa described galido as a 
spy who infiltrated the ranks of the coup plotters and reported to 
him on the progress of the planned rebellion 
the dec 19 coup attempt which left at least 113 dead and 600 
wounded was sixth and most serious bid to topple mrs aquino who 
came to power after a popular uprising that ousted marcos in 1986 
marcos fled to hawaii where he died in september 
defense secretary fidel ramos also said he believed the man who 
spoke to galido was an impostor 
now i have a feeling that this magleo is an adventurer posing 
as a government agent or as a government official and we have all 
kinds of people like that whose services are for sale for a price 
willing to undergo any dirty job ramos said 
and so i think the best thing to do is look for this person 
mrs aquino said she was convinced galidos sworn statements 
were prompted by his sense of patriotism 
a us embassy spokeswoman victoria middleton said in a 
statement thursday that allegations of us government involvement 
in the coup attempt was totally false and without foundation 
us jet fighters provided air cover for loyal troops on the 
first day of the mutiny turning the tide of the rebellion in favor 
of the government

federal prosecutors are charging a long island 
village and some of its officials with defrauding the government by 
scheming to keep minorities out of federally subsidized housing 
the civil lawsuit which seeks at least 105 million in damages 
plus the forfeiture of six island park homes illegally obtained by 
the defendants was filed thursday in federal court in brooklyn 
it is the first government lawsuit naming a hud official since 
allegations of influencepeddling at the us department of housing 
and urban development surfaced in 1988 
island park officials including the mayor and a former top aide 
in the new york hud office were accused of manipulating the 
housing to favor relatives friends and associates and employees 
of the village of island park court papers said 
federal prosecutors also have been looking into reputed 
soliciting of political funds for sen alfonse m damato from 
builders who received hud funds but the long island republican is 
not named in the lawsuit 
andrew j maloney the us attorney for the eastern district of 
new york has removed himself from the investigation because of his 
close connections to the senator maloney was recommended for the 
position by damato 
according to the complaint island park mayor michael a parente 
and geraldine mcgann a hud official and village trustee harold 
scully the village clerk and others conspired to exclude blacks 
and hispanics from housing in island park 
parente who chose not to seek reelection will be replaced as 
mayor on april 2 he was in florida and no telephone number was 
available for him 
beginning in 1980 44 singlefamily homes ranging in price from 
40000 to 63700 were built in three phases under a hud program 
and federal officials had intended for at least 17 to go to 
minority families 
while the village agreed to advertise the availability of the 
subsidized housing in black and hispanic newspapers the eventual 
buyers of the homes had been selected before the ads appeared the 
lawsuit said 
ms mcganns son daniel and his wife purchased one of the 
subsidized homes even though they were not eligible to receive 
one according to the lawsuit which also names mcgann and his wife 
as defendants 
according to the complaint ms mcgann became a paid trustee of 
the village in august 1982 while serving simultaneously as the 
special assistant to joseph monticciolo the hud regional 
administrator for region ii 
in serving in the two roles ms mcgann on several occasions 
allegedly breached her fiduciary duty to hud by voting for land 
dealings that ultimately were not in the best interests of the 
agency the lawsuit maintains 
she also was allegedly aware of the other defendants 
manipulation of the husing program to the exclusion of blacks and 
other minorities 
ms mcgann now assigned to huds washington offices is on 
leave until next month and her office could not provide a telephone 
number where she could be reached for comment 
hud said in a statement thursday it began termination 
proceedings against ms mcgann

lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis today accused moscow of waging psychological 
warfare to force his baltic republic to renounce its declaration 
of independence 
and in a letter to the soviet parliament he said that any 
attempt by the soviet government or military to interfere with the 
enforcement of lithuanian law would be a violation of international 
law 
soviet armor rumbled through the lithuanian capitals streets on 
thursday prompting the republics leaders to issue a worldwide 
appeal for support and express concern that increasing kremlin 
pressure would lead to violence 
the appeal followed orders from soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev that lithuania stop signing up its own volunteer forces 
he gave landsbergis two days to reply and ordered citizens to 
surrender their firearms within a week 
at the same time soviet military authorities ordered lithuanian 
soldiers who deserted in the wake of independence to return to 
their units by saturday touching off fears that the rounding up of 
deserters would be used as a pretext to use military force 
landsbergis said he was concerned that both deadlines fell 
on saturday 
in moscow gorbachevs military adviser marshal sergei 
akhromeyev told reporters that the army would act in accordance 
with soviet laws in dealing with deserters 
asked if mass arrests might not cause disruption in lithuania 
and make moscow look bad akhromeyev said whether it looks good 
or looks bad theres an established order even if some people 
dont like it 
he said deserters would be detained and sent back to their 
units where their fate would be determined some lithuanians have 
deserted their units after complaining that fellow soldiers beat 
them in retaliation for their republics declaration of 
independence 
landsbergis said the kremlin was going from economic warfare 
to psychological warfare in its attempts to make lithuania 
renounce its march 11 declaration according to rita dapkus of the 
parliaments information center 
new troops and maneuvers suggest that this is a psychological 
war landsbergis told parliament today 
landsbergis attitude toward gorbachev appeared conciliatory 
perhaps he faces obstacles he said adding that he still 
believed in the soviet leader and hoped his good sense and 
moderation will lead a resolution of the problems 
landsbergis appealed directly to the soviet legislature for 
negotiations to solve the issues that gorbachev has raised a 
threepage letter was sent to the supreme soviet 
any attempt by the government or military organizations of the 
ussr to interfere in enforcement of lithuanian law in lithuania 
will be viewed as a violation of generally recognized principles of 
international law the letter said 
the letter added that in a 1920 treaty the soviet union 
recognized for all time the sovereign rights and independence 
of lithuania 
landsbergis opened the session with an account of the us 
senates resolution thursday night urging moscow to stop 
intimidating lithuania and asking president bush to consider 
granting the republic diplomatic recognition 
the reaction was applause dapkus said 
the kremlin has said it would not use force to bring lithuania 
back into the soviet union but lithuanians have become 
increasingly concerned by the growing soviet military presence in 
their baltic republic 
it is clear that another republic is going to use force 
against lithuania and its citizens said a lithuanian government 
appeal to the world issued late thursday we are asking people to 
prevent this by protesting the possible use of violence against a 
member of the world community against lithuania and its citizens 
a lithuanian journalist identified only as r valatka said 
thursday on latenight lithuanian television that kgb officials had 
been going around to police stations asking for counts of their 
weapons 
the republics police force has not been asked to turn in its 
arms but prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said the kgb might 
even try to take weapons from the police i dont know 
we need support we need help said ludwigas sabutis the 
republics parliamentary secretary 
landsbergis told the supreme council legislature thursday that 
the republic would not use weapons even if the soviet union 
crushed its drive for full independence 
if tanks are sent to take away shotguns and hunting rifles we 
wont shoot at the tanks he said our resistance will be 
nonviolence 
gorbachev in a telegram to landsbergis demanded a halt to 
formation of volunteer brigades in lithuania that he said were 
intended to replace soviet border guards and part of the uniformed 
police 
he gave landsbergis two days to repond 
although volunteers are signing up for the squads in lithuania 
no brigades have been formed and there are no indications they 
would be armed 
the official soviet news agency tass said border controls and 
exit and entry in lithuania were being tightened in keeping with a 
directive wednesday from gorbachev 
gorbachev has called lithuanias declaration of independence 
illegal but has also said he would not use force to keep it from 
seceding from the soviet union 
lithuania was independent from 1918 until 1940 when the soviet 
union forcibly annexed it along with latvia and estonia so far no 
foreign country has officially recognized lithuania as independent 
the republic of 38 million had rushed to declare its 
independence before gorbachev gained broad powers that include 
authority to impose direct presidential rule on areas of the soviet 
union

mayor tom bradley has ordered development of 
a stringent water rationing plan that could be carried out this 
summer during a fourth year of drought 
continued dry conditions could result in a 12 percent decline in 
southern californias water supplies affecting 13 million 
customers 
most of the agencies that distribute water for the giant 
metropolitan water district say they dont have the power to 
enforce water conservation programs they add that they must be 
backed by residents in the 300 communities across the sixcounty 
region the district serves 
we have to rely on the cooperation of our subagencies said 
tom salzano assistant general manager of the central basin water 
district in downey the district acts as a liaison between the 
metropolitan water district and more than two dozen small water 
districts 
council president john ferraro also put out a call to be water 
stingy 
now is the time for other southern california communities to 
join los angeles in enacting mandatory water conservation 
ordinances which can be easily implemented ferraro said thursday 
bradley last week without public announcement requested the 
citys department of water and power to develop a plan that 
includes large fines for violators 
this week the metropolitan water district ordered the los 
angeles water department and the other 27 agencies that are 
district members to draw up mandatory rationing plans 
its complicated said ronald palmer general manager of the 
foothill municipal water district in la canada which serves seven 
smaller agencies the district would have to rely on the county 
board of supervisors to enact water rationing laws palmer said 
robert bammes public works administrator and chief of water 
supplies for beverly hills said he was unaware of the metropolitan 
water districts request 
some southern california communities including santa monica 
already have conservation systems in place under a mandatory 
conservation law santa monica reduced its total water usage by 
nearly 10 percent in the past two years 
with voluntary programs youre only reaching those people who 
are already convinced said atossac soltani santa monicas water 
conservation chief for the rest you need mandatory programs 
ferraro said a 10 percent water use reduction looms for los 
angeles 
the nations secondlargest city has conserved water for the 
past two years by banning hosing down of driveways and sidewalks 
restaurant customers dont get water glasses filled unless they 
request it and showers and toilets that use less water have been 
installed throughout the city

a truck convoy of emergency food rolled 
through a war zone in northern ethiopia today but it carried less 
than half its planned load because of a damaged bridge 
eleven trucks each loaded with 10 tons of food left the 
provincial capital dessie on a 75mile journey over a mountainous 
road to kobo said yohannes abraham an official of the catholic 
relief services in addis ababa 
it was the second truck convoy this week an initial convoy of 
11 trucks covered the same route monday in what relief officials 
said was a trial run its drivers reported the damaged bridge 
until it can be repaired we cannot use trailers abraham 
said each truck with a trailer can carry up to 22 tons 
a consortium of ethiopian churches is taking the food into the 
area which is contested by government troops and the rebel tigre 
peoples liberation front 
the tigreans who control most of northern wollo and the whole 
of tigre provinces are fighting a 15yearold war to oust 
president mengistu haile mariam the rebels want a government 
patterned after that of albania the last hardline marxist state 
in eastern europe 
the emergency food comes largely from private donors in the 
united states and western europe 
the operation aims at feeding 1 million people a quarter of the 
number the united nations says is threatened this year with famine 
caused by war and drought in northern ethiopia 
the united nations has appealed for 11 million tons of 
emergency food 
although a formal ceasefire doesnt exist both the rebels and 
the government have promised safe passage for the convoys but wary 
relief officials say the first three drives north will be 
exploratory

the nations leading dairy state will 
temporarily ban the use of a synthetic milkproducing hormone in 
cattle if gov tommy g thompson approves a bill passed by the 
legislature 
sen russell feingold the bills sponsor said if thompson 
signs the bill wisconsin will become the first state to enact a 
ban on the genetically engineered bovine growth hormone or bgh 
that is injected in cows to make them give more milk 
this has been a long hard battle said feingold a democrat 
from middleton we won we are sending a loud and clear message 
to the governor that we dont want unlabeled bgh out there 
the governor said after the legislature adjourned its session 
thursday that i am not ready to say what i am going to veto or 
sign 
the temporary bgh ban approved by the senate thursday on a 2112 
vote would forbid farmers from using the substance until july 1 
1991 or six months after it is approved by the us food and drug 
administration whichever comes first 
the bill which was amended and passed by the assembly on 
wednesday would allow use of the synthetic hormone for research 
the food and drug administration has allowed private companies 
to run limited onfarm tests of bgh and the milk has been reaching 
consumers industry officials say supporters said the ban would 
allow for more research on the product answering questions of 
whether it could have harmful health effects 
industry officials also were concerned that by increasing milk 
production and milk supply the hormone could put some small 
farmers out of business 
critics of the ban said the hormone is safe and banning it will 
put dairy farmers in wisconsin by far the nations biggest milk 
producer at a competitive disadvantage 
the final passage in the senate was delayed when republican sen 
timothy weeden staged a twohour filibuster against the ban 
insisting the measure could someday change the state license plate 
motto of americas dairyland to read wisconsin the nations 
former dairyland 
jeffrey remsik a lobbyist for a group called the animal health 
institute that favors use of the hormone called the senate vote a 
real victory for food terrorists who scare people and the 
legislature into thinking there is something wrong with 
biotechnology 
remsik said the four companies that produce the hormone are 
likely to sue the state adding pressure on thompson to veto the 
bill 
bgh is an experimental hormone that is designed to boost cows 
production by as much as onethird

the metropolitan opera has a remarkably 
effective new production of mozarts don giovanni and for once 
franco zeffirellis design and direction doesnt look like cecil b 
de mille taking to the stage 
pillars and other reasonably sparse effects move in and out 
between every scene and backdrops change but the motion comes 
between scenes and doesnt distract the audience in the middle of 
glorious music the way some recent zeffirelli productions of 
puccini and verdi operas have done 
the cast at thursdays premiere was led by samuel ramey no one 
could be faulted it was a grand ensemble effort ramey has a 
beautiful and elegant tone his acting was assured as he strode 
around with youthful vigor arrogantly assuming that all women 
belonged to his harem his mop of hair single earring and costumes 
emphasizing his slim legs indeed made him the image of a rakish 
lover 
ferruccio furlanetto sang leporello in a richer but less 
beautiful voice that was at times rough itll be interesting to 
hear these two men when they trade parts later 
carol vaness sang donna anna with an exquisite pure small 
column of sound karita mattila made her met debut as donna elvira 
her soprano is of a different type than miss vaness with larger 
tones some rosy undertones and the ability to convey much emotion 
both sang wonderfully in quiet passages and both had plenty to give 
when volume was required 
dawn upshaw as zerlina the village bride displayed a more 
mellow and mature voice than the young country chirp sometimes 
heard it was a most attractive sound and her acting kept zerlina 
young 
kurt moll has the dark bass just right for the commendatore and 
jerry hadley has the right tenor for mozart good head tones and 
never spreading the tone as tenors must in some italian operas 
julien robbins did well with the thankless part of the bridegroom 
james levine and the orchestra played with spirited reverence 
zeffirelli did nothing eccentric he did not have long pleated 
pages fall out of leporellos book which audiences are thoroughly 
tired of seeing 
the commendatores statue is tall and golden sitting upstage 
center with other graveyard statues on each side when the 
commendatore walks forward in armor his statue remains in view 
when don giovanni goes to hell the statues slide in again with 
creatures writhing on them he may be getting a preview of hell as 
the commendatore drags him toward the back of the stage where a 
fiery pit has opened 
gil wechsler did lighting and anna anni did costumes however 
at one moment dawn looked like a sunset and miss vaness costume 
made the trim singer look fat 
this production reassures operagoers who loved the 1957 eugene 
berman one it replaced

nine crew members remained missing and 
were presumed drowned today after a fishing vessel capsized and 
quickly sank in the frigid bering sea the coast guard said 
twentytwo crew members were rescued thursday after the 162foot 
seattlebased aleutian enterprise sank about 60 miles south of the 
remote pribilof islands town of st paul coast guard spokesman 
christopher haley said in juneau 
the search for missing sailors was suspended late thursday 
coast guard lt brian flory said this morning that it was unlikely 
the coast guard would resume the search 
we had a very good search yesterday he said we think we 
would have found anyone who was afloat i dont think that of the 
nine missing that anyone got off the vessel 
the cause of the capsizing was not immediately known the site 
is north of the aleutian islands chain and southwest of the alaska 
mainland 
the coast guard had previously reported that 10 were missing 
the figure was revised to nine today without explanation 
haley said none of the crew was wearing wearing survival suits 
coast guard officials said a person probably couldnt survive more 
than 30 minutes in the frigid waters without such suits 
the survivors all in life rafts were picked up soon after the 
ship sank thursday afternoon by two sister ships the northern 
enterprise and the pacific enterprise a coast guard c130 
transport plane was on the scene to provide rescue communications 
and medical advice haley said 
about six fishing vessels were in the area and had assisted in 
the rescue and search said dan roberts executive vice president 
of arctic alaska fisheries corp which manages the aleutian 
enterprise for a partnership that owns it 
although haley had said late thursday he thought the survivors 
were taken to a st paul clinic flory said today they were still 
aboard a fishing vessel that was en route to dutch harbor on the 
aleutian island of unalaska the vessel the bristol enterprise 
was expected to arrive sometime during the afternoon 
the rescued crew members were in relatively good shape 
roberts said thursday night my understanding is only a couple of 
people have minor injuries 
he said 15 of those rescued including the captain are from the 
seattle area we are in the process of notifying the survivors 
and the other crew members families 
fair weather was reported in the area thursday with visibility 
to seven miles mild winds and seas to 6 feet haley said 
the aleutian enterprise is a factory trawler a large vessel 
that catches bottom fish processes and freezes them on board 
trawlers normally fish for cod and pollock in the bering sea in the 
early spring roberts said 
most of the crew members likely are from alaska washington and 
oregon he said 
the vessel about 10 years old and worth about 6 million is 
owned by aleutians enterprise ltd a californiabased partnership 
that contracts with arctic alaska for management and marketing 
services roberts said 
arctic alaskas 22 other vessels that operate in the bering sea 
comprise the largest trawler fleet in the region roberts said 
in december 1988 the company lost a trawler in rough weather in 
the bering sea two crew members died when the arctic ii sank 
roberts said

the man considered the father of modern 
environmentalism lives in a redwod house is fascinated by 
hightech equipment and admits hes no thoreau when it comes to 
living his conservationists vision 
david brower presents a large target for his wife anne who 
considers his two cars four color televisions two video cameras 
three video recorders and dozen tape recorders evidence of rampant 
consumerism 
he has been a tremendous consumer of late ive been 
strenuously objecting to that because it costs the earth she 
said but he rationalizes saying it ill help him in his work to 
save the earth 
at 77 the former executive director of the sierra club still 
lives in his native berkeley calif and has completed an 
autobiography to be published april 22 the 20th anniversary of 
earth day 
the life and times of david brower is dedicated to anne his 
wife of 46 years and mother of their four children two more he 
notes than the environmentally sound pair 
but if brower goodnaturedly concedes some personal 
inconsistencies he does so against the backdrop of a stormy 
halfcentury of environmentalism in which he tilted with colleagues 
as fiercely as he fought public apathy 
he has been without any question the most effective partisan 
in the environmental wars in the whole 20th century said author 
wallace stegner who joined the sierra club when brower held the 
reins in the early 1950s 
browers boundless energy compels him to attempt things that 
often are beyond the financial resources of the groups he supports 
stegner said 
nor is he an organization man stegner added its hard to 
deal with him because hes so far ahead stegner said im 
really all for dave except for in the organization hes sometimes 
uncontrollable 
brower knows hes difficult to please over the years hes 
started 30 environmental organizations that at the time best 
suited his ideals and methods now he seeks to shape the 
consciousness of a new generation 
theyre not too far gone to be bent he said during a recent 
interview in salt lake city where he spoke at the university of 
utah and met with his publisher when i talk to young audiences 
i feel euphoric 
i cant look at a small child and feel good about anything at 
all if i dont give that child a chance to grow up 
it was childhood expeditions to californias sierra nevada that 
kindled browers love of the outdoors it grew as his mothers 
blindness compelled him to describe the world she could no longer 
see 
browers early skirmishes with government and corporate giants 
were attempts to preserve wilderness national parks and endangered 
animals eventually his battlegrounds came to encompass global 
warming ozone depletion and acid rain 
active today as ever he sits on the boards of the sierra club 
and earth island institute which he founded 
he has come an elder statesmans full circle returning to the 
fight to preserve wilderness 
his suggested method is to start over restoring what has been 
damaged and protecting what has survived its thoreau 
thinking he said 
brower often is compared in print to the 19th century american 
philosopher henry david thoreau who championed wisdom through 
association with nature 
we must rise above the frailty and dammit it can be done 
he said we cant go on this way the resources arent there to 
ransack anymore were killing our planet 
for all his triumphs brower still regrets what he views as his 
one spectacular failure as sierra club director he failed to 
intervene in time to halt the damming of the colorado river at 
page ariz 
southern utahs glen canyon and several of its natural arches 
carved by water and wind were lost beneath glen canyon dams lake 
powell the water encroached on rainbow bridge national monument 
but spared the chief attraction 
brower wrote of his grief and guilt in a 1961 issue of the 
sierra club bulletin 
the future may not forgive or understand the citizen who not 
being able to care less is silent

the leader of the party that won east 
germanys first free elections today denied allegations that he was 
linked to the disbanded communist secret police and announced his 
candidacy for prime minister 
as recently as thursday lothar de maiziere of the christian 
democrats had said his candidacy for the top job depended on the 
outcome of talks between his party and others about forming a 
coalition government 
but today de maiziere whose party favors speedy german 
reunification and whose campaign was supported by west germanys 
governing conservatives said at a news conference that he is 
willing to head the government 
without prompting he also again denied he was an informer for 
the hated stasi secret police and said he never took money from 
them 
helmut lueck spokesman for de maizieres christian democrats 
told the news conferece the party leadership opposes a proposed 
investigation of legislators elected sunday to see if they are 
linked to the secret police 
lueck said such an investigation would not serve the interests 
of truth and would endanger the inner peace of our country 
an escalation of mistrust suspicions and slander is not in 
the interest of our young democracy he said 
earlier today east germanys chief prosecutor rejected a 
proposal by church leaders that the investigation be held 
dieter plath spokesman for chief prosecutor hansjuergen 
joseph said such a probe would be illegal before the new 
parliament is sworn in he said lawmakers are immune from such 
probes unless parliament decides otherwise 
although other candidates for prime minister had been mentioned 
it was widely expected that de maiziere would seek the post 
parliament must meet within 30 days of the election and vote for a 
prime minister 
de maizieres threeparty alliance for germany which also 
includes the democratic awakening and the german social union 
captured the largest share of seats in the 400member body but 
failed to clinch an absolute majority 
alliance officials said they were near an agreement with three 
parties close to west germanys free democrats a junior partner in 
the bonn government coalition talks were to continue next week 
according to democratic awakenings chairman rainer eppelmann 
eppelmann also renewed a coalition offer to the social 
democrats who finished second in the balloting the social 
democrats agreed to talks but said they would not cooperate with 
the german social union the most rightwing party in the alliance 
for germany 
final official election results published today gave the 
alliance for germany one less seat and one more to the social 
democrats the alliance now hold 192 seats and if they are able to 
add the 21 liberal seats they would have a majority of 213 seats in 
parliament 
but without the support of the 88 social democrats the ruling 
coalition would not have a twothird majority needed to push 
through laws that would speed unification 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who backs the alliance and 
wants quick unification on thursday reiterated calls for a grand 
coalition with the social democrats 
but concern that many newly elected lawmakers may have worked as 
informers for the former secret police overshadowed the political 
jockeying 
the government official overseeing the dismantling of the force 
werner fischer said there were suspicions de maiziere a lawyer 
collaborated with the stasi 
there are indications there is no proof fischer told west 
germanys zdf television 
he said citizens groups sifting through secret police files in 
east german cities made allegations against de maiziere asked 
whether he took the allegations seriously fischer said very 
during 40 years of rule the communists intimidated many people 
into collaborating until earlier this year the stasi had 85000 
agents and hundreds of thousands of informers 
by official count about one of every 80 east germans once 
either worked for or cooperated with the force but many people say 
even more were involved in helping longtime communist leader erich 
honecker keep the 163 million people under firm control 
honecker was ousted oct 18 following nationwide protests

a vaccine commonly administered to youngsters 
five times by their fifth birthday does not increase the risk for 
epilepsy and other neurological problems researchers say 
previous reports indicated a possible link between one component 
of diphtheriapertussistetanus vaccine and such disorders 
our study provides reassurance to parents that dpt vaccine 
does not cause serious diseases of the brain wayne ray an 
associate professor of preventive medicine at vanderbilt 
university said thursday 
dpt vaccine is given to tens of thousands of children each week 
children typically are immunized three times in their first year of 
life again at about 18 months and for the last time at around 5 
years of age 
the vaccine frequently causes low fevers and some swelling at 
the point of immunization 
earlier case reports and lawsuits filed by parents against 
pharmaceutical companies have alleged that the pertussis or 
whooping cough component of dpt vaccine has caused seizures and 
even death 
but the study reported in todays journal of the american 
medical association when seen in conjunction with other recent 
studies of the vaccine should provide great reassurance to parents 
that there is no such link ray said 
ray and the coauthors of his study examined the medicaid 
records of 38171 tennessee children who received more than 107000 
dpt immunizations in their first three years of life 
they compared the rate of neurological events such as seizures 
that occurred immediately following immunization with the rate of 
such events that occurred 30 or more days after inoculation 
no child who was previously normal without a prior history of 
seizures had a seizure in the zero to three days following 
immunization that marked the onset of either epilepsy or other 
neurological or developmental abnormality the authors wrote 
alec walker an associate professor of epidemiology at harvard 
school of public health in boston said the work appears to confirm 
research he has done on the vaccine 
walker studied 26000 children in the seattle area and found no 
increase in any serious neurological problems immediately following 
pertussis vaccination his results appeared in a 1988 issue of the 
journal pediatrics 
the only reasonable interpretation of the data is that theres 
an absence of evidence for any effect of dpt on serious 
neurological disease walker said in a telephone interview

secretary of state james a baker 
iii toured this sprawling black township today and blamed apartheid 
for its poverty 
baker said the contrast between soweto and the wealth of south 
africas whites in nearby johannesburg is quite distressing and 
thats why i said the system of apartheid should be abolished as 
soon as possible 
the visit came one day after he said the whiterun government 
was committed to ending the system of racial separation 
baker met with walter sisulu at the african national congress 
leaders home in a neighborhood of small brick houses visited 
community centers a daycare center and drove past a squatters 
camp erected on an old golf course 
baker then flew to kinshasa zaire for meetings with president 
mobutu sese seko and angolan guerrilla leader jonas savimbi 
baker already has met angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
as part of us efforts to negotiate an end to the angolan civil 
war 
on thursday baker met with south african president fw de 
klerk a senior us official said baker told him what he had 
done so far was courageous in light of the obvious political 
pressures and restraints he is subject to 
in february de klerk lifted a 30year ban on the anc released 
black nationalist leader nelson mandela from jail after 27 years 
and announced other reforms aimed at clearing the way for 
blackwhite negotiations 
moments before baker arrived at sisulus home children perched 
on a jungle gym shouted anc slogans and sang songs honoring 
mandela baker didnt see or hear the children 
sisulu said i told the secretary of state we are very 
grateful to the people of america for the support they gave us over 
the years and that we are hopeful but we are only making a 
beginning and we will expect more support as the day goes by 
sisulus organization publicly opposed bakers meeting with de 
klerk but the subject wasnt mentioned today until reporters 
questioned sisulu who appeared to put the issue behind him 
the united states realizes no fundamental change has been made 
but that some encouragement should be made weve had that 
sisulu said 
before bakers arrival the anc had said bakers visit the 
first by a us secretary of state in 12 years would suggest de 
klerk has made fundamental reforms of the apartheid system 
despite this difference anc leaders greeted baker warmly during 
meetings in soweto cape town and in the neighboring country of 
namibia where he attended independence celebrations 
asked about bakers praise of de klerk for moving to dismantle 
apartheid sisulu said mr de klerk is making an effort which 
we appreciate however we would like to urge him to a bit speedy 
about things 
sisulu said de klerk has not yet met the ancs conditions for 
negotiations although the two sides are to hold preliminary talks 
april 11 
the anc wants the state of emergency lifted and all political 
prisoners freed before negotiations begin with the de klerk 
government on sharing power with the nations disfranchised 28 
million black majority

democratic leaders took the offensive today 
against president bushs high approval ratings accusing the 
president of broken promises and timid leadership and vowing to end 
his free ride 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas the vice presidential nominee on 
the partys losing 1988 ticket told the democratic leadership 
council that bushs campaign pledge of no new taxes has become 
pure bushlips 
bentsen said the administration has proposed an array of 
cryptotaxes such as user fees surcharges and other levies he 
also accused bush of being too worried about public opinion to help 
emerging democracies around the globe 
can you imagine harry truman hesitating to unveil the truman 
doctrine or the marshall plan or the berlin airlift because he 
feared public opinion polls can you imagine john kennedy doing a 
poll before he dealt with the cuban missile crisis bentsen asked 
the same theme was sounded by sen sam nunn dga 
precisely as our principles and values are prevailing 
throughout the world americas trumpet is sounding an uncertain 
note nunn said 
the oftenfractious democrats were trying to play down their 
differences today as two major party groups met in separate cities 
to plot strategy for their next attempt to recapture the white 
house 
while the leadership council dominated by elected officials 
met in new orleans the democratic national committee was meeting 
in indianapolis 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown who was shuttling 
between the two meetings told the new orleans group that the 
democrats need not be intimidated by bushs popularity in the polls 
its time for us to point out that the bush administration has 
been getting a free ride that we hear a lot of sweet jargon but we 
dont see any action brown said 
brown has been one of the most aggressive democrats in attacking 
president bush despite the republican presidents high ratings in 
opinion polls 
bushs 80 percent approval marks are often cited as the reason 
few democrats are making any moves toward challenging him in 1992 
democrats have lost five of the last six presidential elections 
the dnc the partys governing body was expected to endorse 
sen daniel patrick moynihans call for a cut in the social 
security payroll tax 
in his speech to the leadership council brown called moynihans 
proposal a political stroke of genius substantively its a blow 
for fairness a triumph for honesty 
moynihan dny called for a cut in the payroll tax because 
the huge surplus that has been stockpiled in the retirement fund is 
being used to mask the true size of the federal deficit 
it just makes sense for us democrats to be on the side of 
cutting payroll taxes for working people said brown calling the 
social security tax one of the most regressive we have 
brown has expressed annoyance in the past with attacks the dlcs 
more conservative members have made on the national party 
the dlc was formed in 1985 with the avowed purpose of stopping 
what many of its founders considered the partys leftward drift 
as its members prepared to fly to new orleans the council 
issued a long statement outlining positions on a range of issues 
including the payroll tax 
although not specifically endorsing the moynihan proposal 
members said we cannot continue to allow the cynical use of the 
social security surplus raised from a regressive tax on labor to 
mask the true scope of americas fiscal crisis 
in a preamble to what they called the new orleans 
declaration the dlc said this is no time for caution and 
complacency from our leaders the measure of a president is not his 
standing in the polls but americas standing in the world 
the word abortion did not appear in the dlc statement but 
the document said government should respect individual liberty 
and stay out of our private lives and personal decisions 
that mirrored the strategy followed by wilder when he made 
abortion an issue in the virginia governors race last year wilder 
framed his prochoice position as support for a womans right to 
make the decision rather than leave it to government officials

it would seem an impossible task to adapt for 
the stage the grapes of wrath john steinbecks monumental 
story of 1930s dust bowl farmers and their journey from oklahoma to 
the promised land of california 
not only does the play have to compete with the powerful prose 
of steinbecks best novel but with the images of the john ford film 
version that starred henry fonda as tom joad 
yet the play which opened thursday at broadways cort theater 
can stand tall beside the book and the movie its an extraordinary 
piece of theater a stirring ensemble production by chicagos 
steppenwolf theater company that rises to and meets the challenge 
of steinbecks epic tale 
the hero of the evening is director and adapter frank galati who 
has fashioned a remarkably coherent version of the steinbeck story 
true some of the narrative has disappeared in order to keep the 
audience from sitting in the theater all night but galati has 
remained faithful to the mythic spirit of the novel 
the essentials are there the joad family anchors the play 
particularly the stoic ma joad played by lois smith as sort of a 
midwest mother courage she gives a beautiful heartbreaking 
performance watch her as she sees tom for the first time since he 
got out of prison or near the end of the play when he must flee 
for his life 
there are other wonderful portraits in the large 35member cast 
including gary sinises shrewd hotheaded tom robert breuler as 
the fatalistic pa jim true as toms lusty brother al and sally 
murphy as the lifegiving rose of sharon in the plays other major 
role terry kinney is fine as the grizzled cynical preacher turned 
labor organizer a man who may have deserted his church but not his 
flock 
steinbecks novel has a relentless rhythm as the okies push 
their way west galati and crew have captured that drive perfectly 
what gives the play so much atmosphere is the physical production 
the director receives from his design team especially kevin rigdon 
who did the evocative sets and lighting 
the story is played out on a set of weathered wooden planks but 
the setting is not as simple as it initially seems various trap 
doors are used for campfires at one point a trough near the rim 
of the stage becomes the colorado river and during the memorable 
scene in a railroad boxcar when rose of sharon gives birth to her 
stillborn baby rain pours from near the proscenium arch 
then there is the joad jalopy loaded down with passengers and 
possessions the old pickup maneuvers around the stage as easily as 
if it really were driving along route 66 the road the joads took 
to california their journey westward is accompanied by music 
composed and played by michael smith and a small band of musicians 
there is a wondrous moment at the end of act 1 when the joads 
reach california a golden glow floods the stage and the migrants 
stand there transfixed but unlike the movie which sinks into a 
gooey sentimentality about the nobility of the downtrodden the 
stage version quickly shows the reality of what the joads found in 
their new home they have traded one form of servitude for another 
galati is unstinting in his depiction of the desperation of 
these depressionera homeless the parallels to the present day are 
striking its almost uncomfortable to watch their hardships but 
more importantly its impossible to forget

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times the production at the cort an 
epic achievement for the director frank galati and the chicago 
theater ensemble at his disposal makes steinbeck live for a new 
generation not by updating his book but by digging into its 
timeless heart 
howard kissel the daily news there is something heartening 
about seeing such a large deeply committed company engaged in 
serious work but what they achieve is something far below 
steinbecks galvanizing vision 
clive barnes the new york post this is overall a thrilling 
theatrical achievement that gets its power from the still sharp 
relevance of its human message and its entertainment quality 
from the performance by an ensemble you should walk miles to see

ptl attorneys say former board members 
including actor efrem zimbalist jr are liable for the 50 
millionplus damages suffered by jim bakkers former television 
empire 
the board members failed to inquire much less make diligent 
inquiry into the business affairs of bakkers ptl television 
ministry the attorneys said in papers filed wednesday in us 
bankruptcy court without public announcement 
as a result of that wrongful misconduct conditions existed 
that caused the internal revenue service to revoke the ministrys 
taxexempt status and claim back taxes of more than 50 million 
the papers allege 
ptl attorneys are asking the court to force a pittsburgh 
insurance company to make good on its 10 million policy that 
covered the board members in the event of legal action against the 
ministry 
national union fire insurance company is refusing to pay 
claiming that bakker made a fraudulent misrepresentation when he 
took out the policy in 1984 
bakker stated at the time that he knew of no pending legal 
action against him or ptl the insurance company said bakker knew 
or should have known that jessica hahn was claiming damages from 
the minister because of his sexual liaison with her in 1980 
that incident led to bakkers resignation from ptl in march 
1987 he is serving a 45year sentence for defrauding his 
ministrys supporters out of millions of dollars 
zimbalist who starred in the fbi television series from 
1965 to 1974 was on the ptl board from 1981 to 1986 and testified 
at bakkers trial in september that the board was a sham 
it was called a board of directors but i never assumed i 
was responsible for anything because i wasnt he testified it 
wasnt that kind of board 
besides zimbalist other former ptl board members named in the 
action are charles cookman north carolina district superintendent 
of the assemblies of god aimee cortese a new york minister at 
lawing jr a retired charlotte nc businessman the rev don 
george a texas minister evelyn carter spencer a california 
minister and ernest franzone a retired florida businessman 
the claim filed in bankruptcy court said the board members 
failed to see that officers and directors were properly supervised 
failed to prevent depletion of corporate assets and allowed a 
situation to exist in which officers and directors were 
selfdealing with corporate assets

a former black panther party leader who served 
nearly 19 years for allegedly machinegunning two police officers 
has been freed without bail pending a new trial 
a manhattan courtroom broke out into shrieks and shouts of 
celebration as dhoruba binwahad formerly richard moore was 
released thursday 
he was convicted in the may 19 1971 wounding of two police 
officers who were guarding the home of thenmanhattan district 
attorney frank s hogan 
state supreme court justice peter mcquillan who reversed the 
1973 conviction last week said he was freeing binwahad in his own 
recognizance because the prosecutions case against him at this 
time appeared weak 
the judges decision surprised binwahad 45 and his lawyers 
defense attorney robert bloom said he had expected the judge to set 
bail at 50000 or more 
mcquillan said he overturned the conviction because the 
prosecution had withheld from the defense relevant information 
about prosecution witnesses 
after hearing the judges decision binwahads wife tanaquil 
jones screamed with joy and then burst into tears another one of 
his lawyers elizabeth fink also started to cry with joy 
counting the time he served in jail before he was convicted 
binwahad would have served 19 of the minimum 25 years this june 5 
outside the court binwahad told his supporters i would hope 
there is another trial to see exactly how little evidence they have 
against me 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau issued a statement 
saying he was displeased about binwahads release 
we are extremely distressed that the discovery of meaningless 
and inculpatory information has provided this defendant with a 
basis for overturning a conviction obtained after a fair trial we 
will of course press this position in our appeal the statement 
said 
assistant district attorney james kindler told the judge let 
us not forget the crimes which brought us to this courtroom the 
machinegunning of two police officers at pointblank range 
kindler told the judge that two weeks after the shooting 
binwahad was arrested with the machine gun in his possession 
fink disputed this and suggested that police fbi agents and 
other witnesses lied at binwahads trial with the prosecutions 
blessings 
binwahad maintained he was framed and now fears for his safety 
i dont think were going to live in the united states said 
his wife its not safe here for political activists

two leaders of a group of thrillseekers who 
jump from high places with elastic cords tied around their ankles 
were charged with involuntary homicide in connection with a 
jumpers death 
it was the first such court action in france resulting from the 
fad in which jumpers attach elastic cords to their ankles and to 
the base of the platform from which they leap 
the accident occurred during a festival in eastern france in 
june the government banned elasticband jumps a month later then 
legalized them again in october after implementing new safety rules 
the victim of the june 26 accident raymond saputa 24 was the 
72nd person that day to leap from a 180foothigh crane set up for 
jumpers saputas elastic gave way during his second bounce and he 
crashed to the ground 
a magistrate filed charges thursday against marc gapp director 
of the jumping club and bertrand blancher a club employee 
stationed at the top of the crane to assist jumpers 
there have been conflicting accounts of why the accident 
occurred according to blancher saputa jumped before he was 
supposed to and the elastic was in the wrong position according 
to a witness on the ground blancher detached the elastic 
prematurely after saputa jumped 
new safety rules were implemented after three jumping deaths in 
early 1989 they require all jumpers to undergo heart exams 
require the elastic bands to be changed after every 150 jumps and 
limit the number of jumps per hour from each set of elastic

the soviet union has proposed opening 
full consular ties with south korea as a prelude to establishing 
formal diplomatic relations south korean news reports said friday 
the reports said soviet officials made the proposal thursday to 
kim youngsam leader of south koreas governing party kim arrived 
in moscow on thursday for a nineday visit

oppose the soviet proposal 
kim said however that south koreas basic position is to move 
directly to formal diplomatic ties without going through an 
intermediary step the reports said 
in december the soviet union and south korea opened consular 
departments in their trade offices in each others capitals and 
began limited consular service 
the arrangement restricts the functions of the departments and 
the qualifications of officials working there the departments 
cannot fly national flags and officials working there are denied 
normal diplomatic privileges 
the soviet proposal would upgrade the consular departments to 
the level of general consulate this summer a step below full 
diplomatic relations the reports said 
the kremlin already has diplomatic relations with communist 
north korea south koreas rival 
in earlier dispatches reporters accompanying kim on the soviet 
trip said the south korean leader met secretly with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in the kremlin 
kim refused to confirm or deny the reports he said i met an 
important soviet figure but i cant disclose who because i 
promised soviet officials not to make it public now 
on friday foreign minister choi hojoong signed an agreement in 
prague establishing formal diplomatic relations with 
czechoslovakia bulgarias bta news agency said friday that south 
korea also established diplomatic ties this week with bulgaria

a convoy of trucks carried 110 tons of 
emergency food friday to a war zone in the northern part of 
ethiopia but a damaged bridge prevented it from carrying all its 
planned load 
the bridge was not strong enough to handle trucks with trailers 
attached so each truck carried just 10 tons of food instead of the 
22 tons that would have been possible with trailers said yohannes 
abraham abraham is an official of the catholic relief services in 
ethiopia 
eleven trucks made the 74mile journey from the provincial 
capital of dessie over a mountainous road to kobo 
another convoy of 11 trucks covered the same route monday in 
what relief officials said was a trial run its drivers reported 
the damaged bridge 
both trips went without a hitch 
a consortium of ethiopian churches is ferrying the food into the 
area which is caught in the conflict between government troops and 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation front 
the tigreans are fighting to oust president mengistu haile 
mariam and establish a government patterned after that of albania 
the last hardline marxist state in eastern europe 
the emergency food comes largely from private donors in the 
united states and western europe it is intended to feed 1 million 
people deprived because of the war and drought 
a formal ceasefire does not exist but the rebels and 
government have promised safe passage for convoys 
the church groups hope to extend their distribution network from 
the north to southern eritrea province where another war is under

mongolias communist legislators 
formally abolished their partys guaranteed monopoly on power 
friday and approved of elections with more than one candidate 
however the election law was drafted before mongolias recent 
prodemocracy protests and does not mention a role for opposition 
parties officials said 
the 370seat hural mongolias parliament voted 32410 in favor 
of amending two sections of the constitution that say the ruling 
mongolian peoples revolutionary party is the leading force in 
society and the state the other deputies abstained 
the changes are in keeping with mongolias tendency to follow 
the lead of the soviet union where the communist party recently 
gave up its monopoly on power mongolia is the worlds secondold 
communist state and is one of the soviet unions closest allies 
its constitution now says mongolians have the right to join 
parties whose platforms correspond to the genuine interests of 
the people in order to build up humane and democratic socialism 
the reference to socialism was added after a heated debate in 
which many delegates insisted special mention should still be given 
to socialism and the ruling party 
the mongolian peoples revolutionary party has existed nearly 
70 years and has a membership of 90000 one irate deputy said 
it cant be lumped with other parties 
television and radio broadcasts of the proceedings were abruptly 
cut off during the debate but radio broadcasts later resumed in 
time for the vote 
prodemocracy opposition groups said they would hold a 
demonstration sunday in front of the government palace to demand 
the hural resign more than 93 percent of the parliament belongs to 
the ruling party 
opposition groups want a proviional parliament set up with 
representation for all parties this body would amend the 
constitution and oversee multiparty elections according to their 
demands 
its just a joke ulanhu of the new social democratic 
movement said of the current hural 
opposition demonstrations began in mongolia in december as 
prodemocracy revolutions were bringing change to other soviet bloc 
countries the unrest led the communist party and government to 
shuffle their top ranks installing younger officials less closely 
tied to the past stalinist era 
however mongolian opposition groups say the changes are only 
cosmetic and intended to placate the public and preserve communism 
the hural which began its annual session two days ago accepted 
the resignation of three of mongolias five deputy prime ministers 
friday one of the replacements is kinyat zardykhan an economist 
who leads a prominent reform faction in the party 
fridays session also approved laws allowing appeals when 
government officials abuse citizens civil rights and providing 
for compensation for harm caused by investigatory organizations 
and public prosecutors 
details of the laws were not available 
the hural also passed mongolias first foreign investment law 
the law allows joint ventures with companies of any country 
without limit on the percentage owned by the foreign side 
as a soviet bloc state mongolias external investment has come 
mainly from moscow and east european countries

orders for bigticket durable goods rose 
33 percent last month the government said friday but analysts 
said the modest rebound from a record slide in january merely 
pointed to continued weakness in manufacturing 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill in lexinton 
mass noted that the february increase followed a 107 percent 
plunge and said consequently we didnt get back everything we 
lost 
its hard to find anything thats really encouraging except 
the fact that it didnt fall again she added the industrial 
sector doesnt seem to be falling into a deep recession its just 
far from booming 
robert g dederick chief economist of the northern trust co in 
chicago agreed saying the durable goods sector does not show 
any sign of sliding over any precipice its just in a sideways 
shuffle 
the commerce department said orders to us factories for 
durable goods items expected to last more than three years 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 1216 billion 
the january decline revised from the originally reported 105 
percent was the biggest since the government began keeping track 
of such orders 32 years ago and broke the record set in the 
recession month of february 1982 when orders plummeted 92 percent 
transportation orders which fell 294 percent in january and 
accounted for most of that months drop bounced back 112 percent 
last month to 302 billion 
motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding and tanks showed 
rebounds from last months sharp declines the department said 
while aircraft and parts declined for the second month in a row 
excluding transportation orders were up 10 percent 
unfilled orders declined 04 percent their first drop since 
august and only the second since early 1987 
the fact that its the first negative in seven months is 
another indication that things have slowed down said thomas 
runiewicz of the wefa group an economic forecasting firm in bala 
cynwyd pa 
runiewicz also pointed to a 57 percent decline in nondefense 
capital goods orders which came on the heels of a 137 percent 
drop in january 
it shows the investment structure is slowing also he said 
of that category of orders which often is a barometer of business 
investment plans 
electrical machinery orders rose 42 percent to 202 billion 
after falling 15 percent a month earlier orders for nonelectrical 
machinery including computers and a variety of industrial 
equipment dropped 11 percent to 222 billion after advancing 30 
percent in january 
primary metals orders slipped 36 percent to 107 billion after 
a 13 percent gain in the preceding month steel accounted for most 
of the loss 
the highly volatile orders for defense capital goods jumped 226 
percent to 795 billion after plummeting 336 percent in 
january virtually all of the increase came from shipbuilding and 
tanks 
excluding defense orders rose 22 percent 
shipments of durable goods in february increased 59 percent to 
1235 billion more than offsetting januarys 44 percent decline

not suffering from a heart problem the doctor said 
kaufmann said abernathys wife called him thursday night after 
abernathy became lethargic and not as alert as usual symptoms of a 
sodium imbalance called hyponatremia 
a sodium imbalance can be lifethreatening but abernathy was 
responding well to treatment kaufmann said 
i dont think hes in great danger at this point the doctor 
said adding that abernathy was alert this morning 
abernathy the 63yearold pastor of west hunter street baptist 
church in atlanta suffered a stroke in 1983 and again in 1986 
following the 1983 stroke he underwent brain surgery 
abernathy angered many movement veterans last year when his 
autobiography and the walls came tumbling down contained a 
section suggesting that king committed adultery the night before he 
was assassinated a memphis tenn woman last month sued abernathy 
for libel over the passage 
abernathy also drew criticism from some black leaders when he 
endorsed ronald reagan for president in 1980 
abernathy president emeritus of the southern christian 
leadership conference has called king the best friend a person 
ever had he succeeded king as the head of the sclc 
in recent years abernathy complained many of the top figures of 
the civil rights movement had lost touch with kings ideals he has 
talked about starting a new fight for civil rights

the pork people say their products are just as 
nutritious as chicken turkey and fish but a private group says 
thats hogwash and is asking the government to do something about 
it 
the center for science in the public interest says an 
advertising campaign by the national pork producers council it 
touts pork as the other white meat is deceptive and 
dangerously misleading 
the pork industry is trying to dupe consumers into thinking 
that pork is as healthful as chicken turkey and fish said bruce 
silverglade cspi legal director 
his group which also has criticized producers and sellers of 
other foods on nutrition issues filed a petition friday asking the 
federal trade commission to stop the pork councils claims and 
require advertising corrections 
but industry representatives say theres no problem to clean up 
were confident that our advertising is accurate and can be 
backed up by substantial scientific evidence said barry pfouts 
director of marketing for the council 
all we have said all along is that our products are 
nutritionally comparable to other accepted white meats pfouts 
added in defending the ad campaign 
the center says the industry has gone too far in claims that 
pork products are low in cholesterol low in calories and 
low in fat 
government data show that almost all cuts of pork are 
considerably higher in fat saturated fat and calories said 
silverglade 
but mike simpson executive vice president of the pork board 
said current nutritional assessments of pork are based on 
decadeold data that dont take into account recent research and 
improvements in breeding 
newer information does indicate the fat content in pork is 
getting smaller said ruth mathews who heads the agriculture 
departments nutrient data research division 
the department is examining updated nutrition research in an 
effort to revise its handbook and table of nutrient composition of 
foods mathews said final changes are expected by mid1991 
early data certainly shows there have been changes in pork 
over time since we published the handbook in the early 1980s she 
said 
it seems to show that pork is leaner that its lower in 
fat content from the early data that we have she added those 
figures are not publicly available yet 
the latest information shows the amount of cholesterol in a 
4ounce serving of cooked pork is about the same as for similar 
servings of chicken and turkey said charles mitchell cspi 
spokesman 
however mitchell said the amount and percentage of fat and the 
number of calories is substantially higher for pork 
mitchell said 4 ounces of pork trimmed of all visible fat 
averages 148 grams or 13 percent fat while a similar serving of 
skinless chicken averages 84 grams or 74 percent fat turkey 
weighs in at 29 grams or 26 percent fat per serving according to 
mitchell 
that information indicates the pork ads also violate agriculture 
department requirements that average servings of lowfat foods 
must be 10 percent or less fat to make the claim the center said 
we have fat measures of pork as low as 2 percent countered 
pfouts of the pork producers council 
the councils research indicates the average 3ounce serving of 
tenderloin the best cut of pork is between 3 percent and 4 
percent fat while white meat chicken is 35 percent 
pfouts said that serving of tenderloin has about the same 140 
calories as a similar serving of skinless whitemeat chicken 
mitchell contends similar servings of pork chicken and turkey 
contain 264 calories 215 calories and 171 calories respectively 
cspi said it would also ask congress to pressure the industry to 
increase its spending on research to reduce fat in pork 
money for the pork advertising comes primarily from about 25 
million collected annually from producers under the 1987 pork 
promotion and research act 
a house agriculture subcommittee has scheduled a hearing next 
week to review the law

a cia employee testified today that john 
poindexter may have withheld some facts from congress but didnt 
try to cover up a shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
the cia employee norman gardner appeared as a defense witness 
at the trial of poindexter the former national security adviser 
accused of obstructing congress conspiracy and making false 
statements in the irancontra affair 
to the best of your knowledge was admiral poindexter 
involved in obstructing or lying to congress about the hawk 
shipment asked defense attorney joseph small 
no replied gardner 
gardner acknowledged under questioning however that poindexter 
never told the house intelligence committee or sens david 
durenberger and patrick leahy on nov 21 1986 that president 
reagan had ratified the hawk shipment 
poindexter tore up the presidential document authorizing the 
delivery hours after meeting separately with the house committee 
and then the senators 
didnt you speak up when poindexter omitted some facts in 
his congressional meetings asked irancontra prosecutor christian 
mixter 
no i just dont do that replied gardner 
poindexter told the congressmen reagan didnt approve the hawk 
shipment according to gardners notes of the meeting 
gardner knew about the presidential authorization said mixter 
gardner recalled that durenberger was hostile to poindexter at 
the start of their nov 21 1986 meeting on the iran initiative 
john if you are not going to give us all the facts were 
going to get the hell out of here gardner quoted durenberger as 
saying 
on thursday former attorney general edwin meese iii said 
everything i know suggests poindexter tried to get the facts 
out about a shipment of missiles to iran 
testifying as a defense witness at poindexters trial meese 
said he never suspected the national security adviser might be 
concealing from congress the cias role in the arms shipment 
did admiral poindexter ever tell you a lie defense attorney 
richard beckler asked 
not to my knowledge meese replied 
asked whether poindexter tried to convey an accurate story 
on the missile shipment the former attorney general replied 
everything i know about it is he did 
did you know that admiral poindexter was involved in that 
hawks shipment prosecutor dan webb asked 
no i did not know that then and i do not know that today 
meese replied 
webb showed meese a copy of a nov 20 1985 computer message 
from white house aide oliver north to poindexter about the 
impending shipment meese responded by saying i dont know 
whether poindexter received it when north sent it to him 
meese attended a nov 20 1986 meeting in poindexters office 
where north adopted a cover story that no one in the us 
government knew at the time that hawk missiles were aboard an air 
shipment 
asked by beckler whether he had heard any discussion of a false 
cover story at the meeting the former attorney general replied 
no i did not i am sure nothing like that was ever said in my 
presence at that meeting 
meese said poindexter asked him to attend the meeting to ensure 
reagan administration officials could testify truthfully and 
accurately to congress about the iran initiative 
webb asked meese whether he wasnt suspicious about the 
assertions of lack of us knowledge after discovering two days 
after the meeting that the reagan document known as a finding had 
ratified the missile shipment 
no i was not suspicious of that said meese he explained 
that the cia said it had discovered that hawks were aboard only as 
the shipment was under way and the finding was signed by reagan a 
week and a half after the delivery 
when meese told reagan on nov 21 1986 a factfinding inquiry 
would be launched of the iran initiative did poindexter jump 
up and say he had a copy of the finding in his safe webb asked 
no he did not said meese 
during this time did john poindexter ever tell you he had 
destroyed this finding that had been signed by the president of the 
united states the prosecutor asked 
no meese replied

intrusive on the environment than the hot water and steamhose 
baths last year 
they include using oileating bacteria and removing the oiled 
sediment 
to dig it up is the most intrusive thing you can do 
harrison said we dont know if the benefits are worth it

recent straw polls have indicated a significant minority of the 
tory members of the house of commons who elect the party leader 
each fall want her to retire before the next election it must be

glasnost and perestroika may have brought change 
to much of the socialist world but at chinas annual peoples 
congress the magic word is wending stability 
it is repeated in speeches discussions and interviews at this 
years national peoples congress the communistdominated 
parliament 
premier li peng set the tone in his keynote address tuesday 
now as we confront pressure from abroad and difficulties at 
home preservation of the countrys stability is a matter of 
paramount importance he said 
each citizen he told the 2700 deputies should cherish the 
hardwon political stability and unity as he would treasure his own 
life 
song ping a member of the politburo standing committee told 
the lawmakers history has taught us that nothing can be achieved 
without a stable situation 
the spokesman for the congress yao guang said political 
reforms would be ruled out if they affect the stability of the 
situation 
the passion for stability reflects the insecurities of the 
aging unpopular chinese leadership they fear the disintegration 
of socialist values and institutions around the world they fear 
the reform movement crushed by tanks last june will revive and 
students will return to the streets with their prodemocracy 
demands they fear a populace made restless by poor working and 
living conditions and they remember chinas historical lessons 
that anarchy brings suffering 
common people truly want to see the country stable they have 
suffered enough from the turmoil and if the country is plagued 
with chaos it is the common people who will suffer one beijing 
delegate was quoted as saying 
his sentiments are shared by most chinese who have a cultural 
aversion to the privations brought on by thousands of years of 
internal upheavals many lived through the economic madness of mao 
tsetungs 1958 great leap forward and the hysteria of the 196676 
cultural revolution 
but the party is now preaching stability to further its own 
ends it is demanding unquestioned acceptance of the status quo 
with its ban on political opposition to oneparty rule and 
obedience to the leaders 
stability means forsaking new marketoriented reforms and 
clamping more state controls over the economy stability takes 
precedence over everything the beijing daily quoted deputy tao 
dayong a wellknown economist as saying 
otherwise the economy will not have the necessary environment 
to development he said 
stability also translates into crackdowns on the corrupt and 
criminal and suppression of labor unrest a byproduct of economic 
austerity measures that have led to plant closings and rising 
unemployment 
only with stability can the country preserve the results 
achieved through reforms in the past decade trade union official 
and shanghai deputy wu huifang told the xinhua news agency 
the official press has made certain no social group is left out 
it quoted li hong a law student at beijing university as saying 
almost every university student in china desires social and 
political stability 
doje cering government chief in tibet told the congress we 
tibetans who have suffered enough from the turmoil of the cultural 
revolution and riots in recent years understand the importance of 
political and social stability 
wu yuqian a deputy representing the peoples liberation army 
said last year some people talked a lot about new concepts and 
new thinking and they mocked those who talked marxism and leninism 
now things have changed people believe in marxism and leninism 
again 
thats the message premier li hammered home in his concluding 
remark to the congress foreign forces hostile to china that 
engage in subversive activities are bound to fail li said 
come what may socialist china will stand rock firm in the east

president bush today intensified his campaign 
for his stalled 800 million central american aid package saying 
with democracy at stake we really cannot afford delay 
bush prodded congress on the package both in opening remarks at 
a white house luncheon with outoftown newspaper editors and 
reporters and during an earlier meeting with panamanian vice 
president guillermo ford 
he told the news representatives it was a matter crucial to 
the future of democracy in this hemisphere 
panama and nicaragua stand in a historic moment on the 
threshold of democracy in both nations the people have spoken in 
favor of freedom but the difficult work of democracybuilding 
remains bush said 
he said the western hempisphere can become the first where 
democracy prevails from north to south but it cannot happen if we 
in the united states fail to add our strength and support to the 
forces of democracy with democracy at stake we really cannot 
afford delay 
earlier during a white house picturetaking session in the oval 
office with the panamanian vice president bush said well keep 
pushing from our end 
it is absolutely essential that the congress move to pass this 
legislation that will bring urgent needed help to panama bush 
said 
it was the second time in as many days bush has prodded congress 
on the package which he has said must be passed by the end of the 
month 
on thursday bush criticized congressional democrats who are 
seeking to shift some of the money to new democracies in eastern 
europe 
ford one of the leaders the united states installed in december 
after it invaded panama and toppled the government of manuel 
antonio noriega told bush we are liberated now were free and 
were ready to put our act together 
the panamanian official speaking in english said panamas 500 
million share of the aid package will allow us to put the show on 
the road and not have to come back every year knocking on doors 
asking for additional help 
ford said the package would jump start the panamanian 
economy 
the remaining 300 million of the package would go to nicaragua 
bush told his white house visitor i hope you will tell your 
colleagues when you go back that anything we can do to help we 
want to do it i want to assure you the priorioty is passage of 
this legislation 
he commended ford for his work in lobbying members of congress 
i understand you saw 102 senators which is pretty good since 
there are only 100 of them bush joked maybe it just felt like 
that 
ford responded it has been absolutely wonderful up on the 
hill i think all the congressmen and the senators have been just 
very understanding of our need we have expressed the necessity of 
doing it as rapidly as possible

it was not clear how many journalists would be affected whether 
the order applied to correspondents who have been in lithuania for 
some time or whether any deadline was imposed 
as the soviets tried over the last few days to maintain 
authority in the baltic republic the story of lithuanian defiance 
of moscow has attracted growing attention from the media 
president bush is expected to make a strong statement of protest 
shortly until now he has guided the administration through a 
period of admonitions to moscow not to use force but us rhetoric 
has been lowkeyed in an effort not to heighten tensions in a 
touchy situation

the world offered lithuania some cautious words of 
support this week but no formal recognition of its independence 
apparently wary of coming down too hard on soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
most governments urged moscow not to try to solve the problem by 
force or threats and appealed to it to negotiate with the 
lithuanians 
several said that since they had never accepted the soviet 
annexation of lithuania in 1940 there was no need for them to take 
action now 
for many countries especially western democracies the 
situation posed a quandary how to acknowledge the lithuanian 
peoples right to freedom without hurting gorbachev and his reform 
program 
the soviet republic declared independence from the soviet union 
on march 11 
on thursday it appealed for worldwide support after gorbachev 
ordered lithuanians to turn in their guns and disband their 
volunteer defense force soviet troop movements in recent days 
appeared to be a show of force 
sweden across the baltic sea put its military on a higher 
state of alert and said it was urging moscow to rule out military 
action 
lithuanias appeal drew a sympathetic response from the us 
senate it voted 930 thursday night for a resolution urging bush 
to consider the republics request for diplomatic relations 
while washington has not extended formal recognition it also 
never recognized the forced incorporation of lithuania into the 
soviet union 
bush on friday warned the soviet union that any attempt to 
intimidate or use force against the breakaway republic is bound 
to backfire that is inevitable 
he coupled his statement with a declaration that the united 
states stands with the people of lithuania and supports their 
right to selfdetermination 
in a statement late thursday norwegian foreign minister kjell 
magne bondevik expressed the nordic countries concern 
we urgently appeal to the soviet side to abstain from 
military political or economic pressure he said only patient 
negotiation and constructive dialogue will make it possible to 
solve the great challenge both parts are facing 
late thursday the danish foreign ministry appealed to the 
soviet union to ensure that negotiations with lithuania take 
place without pressure or threats 
belgian foreign minister mark eyskens said president 
gorbachev has a chance to show he is a true democrat and wants to 
take into account the will of the lithuanian people 
denmark norway britain belgium italy and switzerland are 
also among governments that said they had never recognized the 
soviet annexation of lithuania and neighboring estonia and latvia 
in 1940 
but all said it was too early to consider other official action 
such as sending ambassadors to vilnius swiss foreign minister rene 
felber said the declaration does not mean de facto independence 
us and swedish officials said independence implies control of 
territory which lithuania does not have 
british prime minister margaret thatcher told parliament on 
tuesday we recognize especially that lithuania has expressed a 
wish to determine her own future we hope that the position will be 
satisfactorily resolved between those who express that wish and 
president gorbachev 
on thursday the polish parliament passed a resolution 
expressing hope that the process of restoring lithuanias 
independence would progress quickly 
france which also never recognized lithuanias annexation 
hoped for new relations between the soviet union and lithuania 
it noted that the free choice by lithuanians was made 
possible by the democratization reforms undertaken by mr 
gorbachev 
the two german governments made no comment nor did yugoslavia 
which has its own problems with separatists 
spain and the netherlands noted that when they finally 
recognized the soviet union decades after the communist revolution 
lithuania was already annexed by moscow therefore they argued 
soviet consent would be a key factor in deciding whether to 
recognize lithuanian independence spain said it was a moment for 
caution and it was waiting for the 12nation european economic 
community to adopt a position 
we must try to help in any way possible so that the conflict 
over independence does not perturb the overall positive reforms 
initiated under mr gorbachevs perestroika policy of economic and 
political restructuring the spanish foreign ministry said 
philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus noted that many 
countries have separatist movements and a very cautious approach 
is needed 
thai government spokesman suvit yodmanee said lithuanian 
independence was a soviet internal affair government officials in 
conservative persian gulf arab states said it is their policy not 
to interfere in the internal affairs of any state

the idaho legislatures approval of the most 
restrictive state abortion law sets the stage for a possible test 
of the us supreme courts commitment to legalized abortion 
the people of idaho have said strongly what millions of 
americans believe that abortion is not an acceptable means of 
birth control said national right to life committee legislative 
director doug johnson 
but the american civil liberties union and planned parenthood 
announced they would challenge the measure if it becomes law 
its got a wideranging impact beyond the understanding of the 
people who voted for this here said jack van valkenburgh of the 
aclu 
the aclu sued today to challenge an even more restrictive law 
banning abortions in guam and a federal judge in the us 
territory agreed to block enforcement of the new law until a 
hearing monday 
in maryland meanwhile the senate approved an unusual 
compromise today to break an eightday filibuster an abortion 
rights bill permitting unrestricted abortions during the early 
stages of pregnancy will become law unless it is petitioned to 
referendum and rejected by voters in november 
if it is rejected then a bill sponsored by antiabortion 
senators will become law unless it also is defeated by voters 
under that bill abortions could be performed in cases of rape or 
incest to protect the mothers life or if the pregnancy would 
produce serious and adverse effects on the womans health 
the measures are structured so that both would have to be passed 
by the house and signed by the governor if one of the measures is 
rejected the other one dies 
the idaho bill was patterned on a national right to life 
committee model that has been rejected by other states as too 
restrictive but it is the version that abortion foes want for the 
test of the us supreme courts commitment to its 1973 roe vs 
wade decision that legalized abortion 
the law would make abortion illegal except in cases of 
nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if the victim 
is younger than 18 severe fetal deformity or a threat to the 
mothers life or physical health 
an abortion would be illegal in the case of statutory rape or 
sex with a minor on grounds that such behavior implies consent on 
the part of the female said democratic sen claire weatherell a 
supporter of the bill 
if it is signed by democratic gov cecil andrus the measure 
would take effect july 1 andrus has declined to announce his 
intentions on the bill but has reiterated his longheld 
antiabortion stand 
hundreds of telephone calls messages and letters flooded the 
governors office as lobbying by both camps in the abortion debate 
shifted to andrus after thursdays 2517 state senate vote 
approving the ban on abortion as a method of birth control the 
legislation cleared the house two weeks ago 
abortion rights advocates in the senate said the state was 
running up a futile legal bill of up to 1 million in passing a 
measure that would not withstand the high courts scrutiny 
they also labeled the bill a draconian product of an 
outofstate organization pushing its own agenda 
this bill challenges values ingrained in idahos tradition 
freedom of belief freedom of action freedom of privacy said 
democratic sen marti calabretta 
but the bills supporters said the only issue was whether the 
state would take the lead in protecting the lives of unborn 
children 
abortion is the destruction of life and what can we say about 
the future of our society when defenseless victims are destroyed 
for the convenience of personal choice republican sen roger 
madsen said 
the potential legal bill is a very very inexpensive cost for 
the life of a child said democratic sen jim christiansen 
andrus remained silent about his intentions on the abortion ban 
standing on his recent affirmation of his longheld opposition to 
abortion except in the case of rape incest or to save the life of 
the woman 
kerry uhlenkott of right to life of idaho said she was confident 
the governor would maintain his antiabortion credentials 
idaho is speaking out on this issue she said i dont 
think he will ignore it 
but leaders of the fledgling freedom means choice formed two 
months ago as the idaho debate was heating up refused to give up 
the battle against a bill that would ban more than 90 percent of 
the 1500 abortions performed in idaho each year 
the word is not dejected said sally trott the word is 
determined i dont believe anyone can state what the governor will 
do 
at the white house president bush said the vote was a state 
matter but added i have not changed my position at all bushs 
opposition to abortion mirrors that of the governors

world peace through bureaucracy its 
an idea whose time may have come after all the paperwork isnt 
ready says the president of the international association of 
professional bureaucrats 
think of the possibilities said james h boren we can 
move closer to preserving the red tape that binds the world 
together as one great harmonic unit 
if us and soviet military bureaucrats can be brought together 
well war couldnt possibily break out because there would be 
peace through inertia boren said 
his tongueincheek group known as inataprobu was formed 22 
years ago to poke fun at bureaucrats on thursday it honored 
president bush with its first bureaucrat of the decade award 
boren said 
in 33 years as an observer of presidents prime ministers and 
nondirective leaders around the world i have never seen 
bureaucratic excellence that would surpass that of president george 
bush he said 
as both the environmental president and the education 
president he has based his leadership on the same scientific 
principle which made the thermos bottle a commercial success 
boren read in a deep drawl 
boren a beefy oklahoman with a long list of government jobs 
behind him was a featured speaker at frontier thinking a 
threeday conference to find ways to reconcile industrial profits 
with the environment 
we believe that progress is our greatest mistake we believe 
that nothing should be done for the first time boren said we 
believe that the status quo is too progressive and thats why 
were here at this conference 
he expressed shock at the conferences agenda creativity 
he spat in a rare display of emotion we accept creativity as 
long as its creativity with narrowly established guidelines and 
it protects us 
but a lot of things weve been hearing at this conference is 
about changing things why thats shocking with change were 
liable to have movement and with movement were going to get 
mistakes 
doing nothing and doing it with style thats what were all 
about he said 
his entourage included a soviet protege leonid florentiev the 
international editor of the soviet humor magazine krokodil who 
would be establishing an affiliate office in moscow boren said 
it will be called the soviet academy of bureaucratic arts or 
akaburis florentiev said in a thick russian accent 
it is the most bureaucratic nation in the world florentiev 
said his face flushed with pride it goes back to ivan the 
terrible who got his name because he was a terribly good 
bureaucrat florentiev said 
there is much inataprobu can learn from akaburis once the latter 
gets going with florentiev at the helm as chief of protocol 
boren said 
with inataprobu members already at desks in 38 nations soviet 
involvement would permit preliminary orbital implementation of a 
bureaucratic apparatus that no system could crack and change 
florentiev said 
we could have bureaucrats moving from country to county a 
wellcoordinated bureaucratic exchange that would freeze the 
entire planet into a memowriting status quo boren observed 
akaburis like inataprobu will have powers to confer the order 
of the bird awards on good bureaucrats 
the award a sculpture of a naked potbellied bird is 
conferred to bureaucrats able to blotate with optimal pappetry 
fuzzify zichify respond with assentiality develop rationale for 
nonreccurrence innovate within established guidelines and delay

president bush warned the soviet union today 
that any attempt to intimidate or use force against the breakaway 
republic of lithuania is bound to backfire that is inevitable 
bush coupled his statement with a declaration that the united 
states stands with the people of lithuania and supports their 
right to selfdetermination 
administration officials said the soviet union today ordered 
foreign diplomats and at least some journalists to leave lithuania 
as tensions between moscow and the secessionminded republic 
mounted 
the two us diplomats in vilnius were given 12 hours to depart 
and will comply the officials said diplomats from other countries 
also were instructed to leave but the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said they did not know how many were 
involved 
soviet armor rumbled through the lithuanian capitals streets on 
thursday prompting concern that increasing kremlin pressure would 
lead to violence 
bush told a white house gathering any attempt to coerce or 
intimidate or forcibly intervene against the lithuanian people is 
bound to backfire that is inevitable 
bush spoke about lithuania as he opened a news conference with 
editors and reporters from outoftown news media 
declaring solidarity with lithuanians bush said this is a 
complex and sensitive time when realistic levelheaded leadership 
is required on all sides 
lithuanian leaders have consistently demonstrated their 
capacity in this rgard and the united states will do nothing that 
will make their task more difficult he said 
we know the soviet union has a longstanding interest in 
lithuania but those interests can only be addressed through 
dialogue and negotiations bush said 
responding to a question bush said he had not seen any 
intelligence suggesting some kind of conflagration over the 
weekend in lithuania 
nevertheless he said it is a matter of considerable tension 
i hope those tensions can be released through negotiation 
on other subjects the president 
said that i dont think this is the time to change the 
policy on sanctions on south africa even though he has been 
reviewing the sanction issue within his own administration and with 
congressional leaders he said dates have not yet been set on 
visits to the white house of south african president fw deklerk 
or black nationalist leader nelson mandela 
said his administration would be delighted to help a 
democratically elected government in cuba if one ever emerges 
however bush added castro has not changed indeed he is 
swimming against the tide 
defended spending money to aid new democracies instead of 
putting more into domestic programs saying it was important to 
help create stable democracies that will actively trade with the 
united states 
said the federal government should not set itself up as a 
censor of controversial art but declared i am deeply offended 
by some of the filth that i see and to which federal money has gone 
and some of the sacrilegious blasphemous depictions that are 
portrayed by some to be art 
he said he had seen two horrendous examples of what i would 
call blasphemous material that has no business of getting one cent 
of the taxpayers money bush did not identify the artists or 
their works 
said his administration is looking into ways of shifting 
shipping lanes off the coast of california to keep oil tankers 
further away from beaches he said it was impossible to deny access 
to tankers to west coast ports but said we can go the extra mile 
in terms of environmental protection 
declared himself opposed to statehood for the district of 
columbia this is a federal city and my view is it should remain 
that he said put me down as unsympathetic to that particular 
cause 
bush also discussed lithuania at a news conference thursday 
saying he was pleased soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
had said moscow would not use force 
please continue to exercise that kind of restraint and 
remember no use of force bush said 
he called on the kremlin and lithuanians to negotiate their 
differences 
they should talk about that bush said when asked about 
gorbachevs demand that the republics citizens surrender their 
personal firearms my appeal would again be peaceful resolution 
through discussion of this difficult question 
bush said it would be presumptuous and arrogant for him to 
get more detailed and say which side should initiate talks 
the state department was more critical of the soviet moves 
were concerned by the order to have internal security and 
secret police troops seize private sporting guns unless they are 
surrendered department spokesman richard boucher said

president bush stepped up pressure friday for 
congress to pass his 800 million aid package for panama and 
nicaragua stating we really cannot afford delay 
bushs campaign included an oval office meeting with panamanian 
vice president guillermo ford who has been lobbying congress to 
approve the aid the package includes 500 million for 
invasionwracked panama and 300 million for nicaraguas newly 
elected government 
panama and nicaragua stand at a historic moment on the 
threshhold of democracy bush told a luncheon of regional news 
editors in both nations the people have spoken in favor of 
freedom but the difficult work of democracy building remains 
in pushing publicly for the package for the second day in a row 
bush tried to counter sentiment among some congress members that 
the needs of two small countries should not get priority in light 
of us wishes to help the emerging democracies in eastern europe 
us aid to eastern europe is important bush said but he 
added there is work to be done work that i feel is every bit as 
important in support of democracy right here in our own 
hemisphere 
ford said he had met with sen patrick leahy dvt one of the 
leading critics of the latin ameria special assistance package 
leahy has said the money is too much for two small countries even 
though their dire economic straits are due in significant part to 
past us policies 
ford said leahy has his own views and i respect them i 
think he will be reviewing his own ideas and i sincerely hope that 
he will back up panama because we do need the assistance 
he also told reporters outside the white house that panama was 
not going to compete with the eastern european countries for aid 
but he noted that 14 billion in international aid is slated for 
poland and the 500 million bush is seeking for panama represents 
a matter of an inadequate proportion 
bush said during a photo session with ford that passage of the 
aid package is absolutely essential he is seeking passage by 
april 6 when congress leaves for its easter recess 
told that senate majority leader george mitchell had expressed 
doubts the package could pass by then state department spokesman 
richard boucher said the aid is an urgent need in panama its an 
important package a wellstudied package 
the president again stated that if congress cannot agree on 
places to cut the defense budget to pay for the aid package im 
ready to make the hard choices 
with congress authorization i am ready to select offsets 
from the defense budget break the logjam and get these much needed 
resources moving into the region with democracy at stake we 
really cannot afford delay 
ford said the aid would help panama jump start its economy 
and will allow us to put the show on the road and not have to 
come back every year knocking on doors asking for additional 
help 
the united states installed ford and president guillermo endara 
in december after bush sent invasion troops to topple dictator gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
we are liberated now were free and were ready to put our 
act together ford told bush in the photo session 
bush told his white house visitor anything we can do to help 
we want to do it i want to assure you the priority is passage of 
this legislation 
ford told bush he had received an absolutely wonderful 
response on capitol hill 
bushs military invasion of panama resulted in physical 
destruction and looting of stores in addition to economic damage 
left by us sanctions against the noriega regime 
nicaragua labored for several years under a us trade embargo 
against its leftist government which poured large parts of its 
national resources into fighting the usbacked contra rebels 
the nicaragua portion of the aid package includes 30 million to 
help demobilize and resettle the contras in their homeland it also 
includes assistance for the incoming government of violeta chamorro 
to get the nations agricultural economy back on a sure footing

the leader of east germanys christian 
democrats formally declared friday his intention to run for prime 
minister following his partys victory in national elections 
but lothar de maiziere continued to be dogged by allegations he 
collaborated with the disbanded communist secret police he again 
denied the accusations when he announced his candidacy at a news 
conference 
de maiziere 50 whose christian democrats head the threeparty 
alliance for germany had said thursday his candidacy for the top 
job depended on the outcome of talks between his party and others 
on forming a coalition government 
but west german chancellor helmut kohl had been pushing de 
maiziere to declare his intentions and start forming a government 
as soon as possible so bonn and east berlin can negotiate 
unification 
the alliance which also includes democratic awakening and the 
german social union supports speedy reunification in east 
germanys first free elections sunday it captured the largest 
share of seats in the 400member parliament but failed to clinch a 
majority 
it was widely expected de maiziere would seek the prime 
ministers post although other possible candidates have been 
mentioned parliament must meet within 30 days of the election and 
pick a prime minister on a simple majority vote 
the west german newspaper cologne express said friday that de 
maiziere had a code name scerny in the files of the secret 
police who for years enforced the repressive tactics of the 
hardline communist regime 
the newspaper cited as its source werner fischer an official in 
charge of dismantling the hated secret police or stasi 
fischer was quoted as saying he got the information from the same 
anonymous source who revealed that the former chairman of the 
democratic awakening party had links to the stasi 
the party official wolfgang schnur resigned as chairman after 
admitting he had been involved with the stasi 
fischer conceded he had no proof de maiziere was a secret police 
informer but that he took the allegations seriously 
the newspaper quoted fischer as saying it was possible de 
maiziere was the target of a campaign to discredit him 
in 40 years of communist rule the stasi helped run the country 
by controlling many aspects of daily and official life and many 
people had little choice but to collaborate the caretaker 
communist government began dissolving it after the fall 
prodemocracy movement that overthrew the hardline communist 
regime 
by official count about one of every 80 east germans once 
either worked for or cooperated with the secret police but many 
people say even more were involved in helping longtime communist 
leader erich honecker keep the 163 million people under firm 
control honecker was ousted oct 18 
in seeking a coalition government alliance officials said they 
were near an agreement with three parties close to west germanys 
free democrats a junior partner in the bonn government coalition 
talks were to continue next week according to democratic 
awakenings new chairman rainer eppelmann 
eppelmann also renewed a coalition offer to the social 
democrats who finished second in the balloting sunday the social 
democrats agreed to talks but said they would not cooperate with 
the german social union the most rightwing party in the alliance 
for germany 
final official election results published friday gave the 
alliance for germany one less seat in parliament and accorded one 
more to the social democrats the alliance now hold 192 seats and 
the social democrats 88

said

trump is seeking final license approval for the taj mahal his 
megacasino slated to open april 5 in atlantic city

he mumbles pulls at his tie looks uncomfortable 
when mobbed by celebrities and knows little about protocol this 
plus a simple moral message is what endears vaclav havel to a 
world weary of madetomeasure politicians 
when he made his first presidential journey abroad to east 
germany his aides had to scramble to get him his passport it had 
been confiscated by the ousted communist bosses 
now three months after his fairytale ascent from prisoner to 
president havel has visited 10 countries this week it was france 
and britain as usual he was watched with adoration 
havel is using his position as a platform to expound on a 
political philosophy developed over 20 years of writing 
his voice is gravelly from years of chainsmoking he sometimes 
mumbles or bumps into the microphone but his words are clear 
simple and direct totalitarianism deforms the human soul people 
in czechoslovakia are constantly asking me about ways to implement 
the new freedom and i tell them implement it in any way you 
wish

albee in new york in paris an allstar cast led by actor alain 
delon tom stoppard harold pinter and jeremy irons among the 
guests at a reception given by the royal shakespeare company in 
london 
in the united states we encountered almost embarrassing 
adulation said havels spokesman michael zantovsky they 
treated him as if he were some kind of modern prophet and he is 
not particularly eager to become one 
instead he is modest shy prone to blush he deflects attention 
with humor and irony he stands behind tables and against walls 
away from the center of the room at one point he even managed 
somehow to hunch his short frame under a loudspeaker 
except for the suit and tie there is little to distinguish 
havel the harassed dissident from havel the president 
the reception he gets is something we have been absolutely 
unprepared for zantovsky said it really is too much of a good 
thing 
at the london reception thursday night in his own milieu of 
theater and art havel looked relaxed 
with a cutcrystal glass of white wine and a cigarette in one 
hand gesticulating with the other he chatted with men in 
ponytails and earrings and women in mens suits 
havel clearly enjoys the drama of his situation and the 
theatricality of the presidency the new uniforms he picked to 
replace the drab khaki of communism on the palace honor guard for 
example were created by the costume designer for milos formans 
film amadeus 
but havels performance abroad is unrehearsed and improvisation 
is not without pitfalls 
at his paris news conference he kept tugging at his tie as if it 
were a noose around a neck more accustomed to opennecked shirts 
a british tv commentary described him as refreshingly naive 
after shaking hands with prince philip on the stately steps of 
buckingham palace he wiped his sweaty palm on his pants 
apparently unaware that the nation would see it on tv 
but if there were rough edges they were always softened by 
havels polished and thoughtful words like all the speeches he has 
given over the past three months they were a logical extension of 
the limpid essays he has written for 20 years 
introducing him to an audience of intellectuals on wednesday 
political commentator timothy gartonash called him an 
exceptional example of what i might call moral leadership through 
language 
from a moral base built on years of fighting tyranny havel 
preaches political morality at a time when old political blocs and 
policies are crumbling his watchwords are living in truth 
preserving the sanctity of words revering freedom 
he insists he will serve as president only until czechoslovakia 
has free elections and these are scheduled for june but already 
his impact looks permanent 
his words ash said have become letters to the world or 
as the times of london put it havel is an idea whose man has 
come

the food and drug administration on friday 
approved a drug officials say will dramatically improve the lives 
of children born with a rare disease that makes them unable to 
fight infections 
about 40 children worldwide are born each year with severe 
combined immunodeficiency disease or scid a genetic disorder also 
called boy in the bubble disease because some children have 
survived only by living in an enclosed sterile environment 
pegada was developed with a 169000 grant from the fda under 
the orphan drug program which is designed to give companies a 
financial incentive to develop products for an extremely small 
patient population 
children with scid lack adequate immune systems and therefore 
are unable to fight even common infections such as chicken pox or 
pneumonia most children with the disorder die before they are 2 
years old 
the only cure for the disease the cause of which is believed to 
be lack of an enzyme is a bone marrow transplant generally from a 
sibling 
pegada made by enzon inc of south plainfield nj will 
allow children for whom bone marrow transplant is not feasible or 
has failed to survive outside a sterile environment 
only about 20 percent of the children born with scid find a 
compatible bonemarrow donor and only about 30 percent to 40 
percent of those have successful transplants said donna chappina 
a spokeswoman for enzon 
it will have a dramatic effect on improving the quality of 
life for the patients and their families said dr james mason 
assistant secretary for health in the department of health and 
human services 
once the drug takes effect children who had been confined to 
sterile isolation would be able to live a normal life going to 
school and interacting with other people chappina said 
the company said the drug is the first treatment for directly 
correcting an inherited enzyme deficiency disease 
the drug is administered weekly by injection it is designed to 
replace the missing enzyme adenosine deaminase or ada because it 
does not prompt the body to produce the enzyme patients must take 
the injections for the rest of their lives 
the product will be marketed under the trade name adagen

a condominium owner who lost a legal war to 
keep his pickup truck in front of his home now parks a makebelieve 
tank complete with fake machine gun outside 
im standing up for the rights of condo owners who are afraid 
or intimidated andrew zuccala dressed in combat fatigues said 
thursday about his aesthetic battle 
zuccalas fight with his condo association at the fox hollow 
development began when the antitruck parking rule was passed two 
years after he purchased his condo the truck he owned then was 
permissible under a grandfather provision but a replacement was 
not 
after warning zuccala several times that his 1989 blue pickup 
was not allowed the association sued the palm beach county 
circuit court ruled in its favor monday 
zuccala 32 responded by painting a 1971 station wagon in 
camouflage colors installing black cannon turrets on the roof and 
hood and adorning it with such slogans as war wagon captain 
andrew and condo commando killer on it 
unlike his truck the war wagon conforms to condo rules 
zuccala said 
my blue truck isnt offensive but its banned he said 
this tank is all right because its a car and not a truck they 
have a choice its the tank or the truck 
michael gelfand the condominium association attorney has not 
seen the mock tank but said the group does have restrictions on 
nuisances and eyesores

nazlett elsamman egypt ap sewer workers have discovered 
remains of a temple that pharaoh cheops built for his funeral 4600 
years ago and egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more 
about the mysterious pharaoh of the great pyramid 
the discovery this month of cheops valley temple confirms 
theories about the layout of giza plateau for the 70year period in 
which the pharaoh his son and grandson built their three pyramids 
and monuments nearby 
nazlett elsamman lies at the foot of the plateau facing the 
sphinx and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause 
of the sphinxs dangerous deterioration a usfinanced sewage 
project began last year and egyptologists were assigned to monitor 
construction because of the probability of finding antiquities 
they were on hand in early march as diggers began uncovering 
mammoth granite and limestone blocks a flint knife roman brick 
walls and other relics 
by midmarch more remains were turning up and finally the main 
prize a 59footlong row of basalt rocks the experts identified 
it as the floor for cheops valley temple 
because basalt is difficult to carve and expensive the stone 
was reserved for royal use often as flooring for sacred places 
although his pyramid was the largest ever built cheops left few 
other glimpses of his life or his 23year reign which ended in 
2528 bc 
with what were finding now we can piece together cheops 
history and reconstruct how this part of the pyramids area would 
have looked said zahi hawass of the egyptian antiquities 
organization 
the newly found ruins lie 13 feet below street level partially 
covered with sewage 
getting to them will not be easy diggers already are excavating 
two romanera sites in a nazlett elsamman alley only a foot from 
village houses archaeologists have to contend with children at 
play donkeys and angry villagers worried that antiquities 
officials might invoke their legal authority to force them from 
their houses 
cheops valley temple is proving an even greater challenge 
engineers for the sewer project are pumping water from the drainage 
ditch where the basalt flooring was found 
the giza pyramids and the structures around them are thought by 
some egyptologists to be part of an elaborate blueprint for the 
dead precisely planned and executed but their exact roles in the 
death and resurrection of the pharaohs are debated 
burial was an elaborate ritual to ensure that neither the 
pharaoh nor egypt would ever die 
the journey to eternity began in the valley temple where the 
pharaohs body was taken for ritual purification perhaps 
embalming for the final rituals the body was carried up the long 
causeway to a mortuary temple next to the pyramid 
early travelers descriptions of the pyramids area had given 
modern egyptogists a good idea where cheops temple should be found 
in the fifth century bc the greek herodotus wrote that he saw 
cheops causeway covered and decorated with carved animal scenes 
the german scholar karl richard lepsius said only traces remained 
of the ruined causeway by the early 1840s

president bush is out of the mainstream when 
it comes to broccoli people love broccoli and government 
statistics prove it 
we called it the vegetable of the 80s said agriculture 
department economist gary lucier 
he said broccoli consumption more than doubled in the united 
states between 1980 and 1988 going from an annual average of 3 
pounds per person to 68 pounds 
back in 1970 americans on average were eating only 1 pounds of 
the vegetable each year 
both fresh and frozen versions move quickly off the supermarket 
shelves though most people prefer it fresh according to 
statistics 
lucier said health concerns played a major role in the big jump 
broccoli is high in vitamin c and has a substantial amount of 
vitamin a says a pamphlet from the united fresh fruit and 
vegetable association 
bushs distaste for the food was revealed last week when he 
banned it from air force ones galley it made headlines when he 
told questioning reporters on thursday 
i do not like broccoli and i havent liked it since i was a 
little kid and my mother made me eat it and im president of the 
united states and im not going to eat any more broccoli 
bush 65 clearly was one of the early eaters of broccoli 
though the vegetable was discovered thousands of years ago 
california farmers began growing it experimentally for the us 
market in the 1920s shipping just a few crates east 
its so perishable that it requires the quick transport of 
modern times to make it to stores any distance from the fields in 
edible condition 
the usda didnt even keep records of acreage planted in broccoli 
until 1946 when about 18700 acres were planted to the crop 
nationwide by 1989 the acreage had jumped to 121500 the amount 
of broccoli that could be grown on each acre more than doubled in 
those 45 years 
california fills 90 percent of the countrys demand for the 
plant but its also a significant cash crop for arizona texas and 
oregon and is produced in smaller quantities in other states 
maine for example where bush has been vacationing most of his 
life is the biggest supplier in new england 
weve gone from zero to about 3000 acres over the past six or 
seven years said russell libby director of the maine department 
of agriculture 
maine broccoli farmer lance smith said it was too bad the 
president didnt like broccoli but he was was entitled to his own 
opinion 
but you know he really hasnt looked good said smith 
weve noticed hes looked a little peaked that could be it

polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
reported some progress thursday in winning president bushs support 
for international guarantees of polands border with germany 
mazowiecki discussing separate tensions across polands eastern 
border also urged kremlin leaders to avoid any rash actions 
against the breakaway soviet republic of lithuania 
during a threeday visit to washington mazowiecki did not win a 
firm public pledge from bush that poland would play a greater role 
in talks expected to lead to the reununification of germany later 
this year but bush did agree that polands voice should be heard 
when issues vital to poland are on the table 
mazowiecki told reporters at the national press club that his 
delegation had achieved a greater understanding of our position 
among us leaders 
and he said bush had assured him that the united states 
recognized poland as a major player in the transformation of europe 
many elements of that transformation remain murky at the moment 
including whether west and east germany will guarantee the german 
border with poland one third of polands territory consists of 
lands that were german before world war ii 
at the close of the war the soviet union annexed the western 
third of poland and poland received german territory in return 
mazowiecki refrained from instructing the leaders of lithuania 
and the soviet union how to resolve their differences but offered 
them three bits of counsel 
first talk second talk and third talk said mazowiecki 
neither the polish nor the us government has recognized the 
independent government of lithuania although the united states 
never recognized the forced soviet annexation of lithuania and its 
sister baltic states of latvia and estonia during world war ii 
another murky subject in the transformation of europe is the 
role of the kremlinled warsaw pact and the continuing presence of 
soviet troops on the territory of pact members like poland 
bush after meeting with mazowiecki said thursday that he had 
not obtained from the polish prime minister a clear picture of when 
the estimated 58000 soviet troops stationed in poland would leave 
mazowiecki told the news conference friday that he expected 
soviet troops to be withdrawn from poland as part of multilateral 
negotiations on conventional force reductions throughout europe 
he declined to establish a direct link between polands 
aquiescence to the continued presence of soviet troops on its 
territory and german guarantees of polands western border 
but he said that it is crucial for us to have our our border 
reaffirmed by a treaty initialled by the two germanies before 
reunification of germany takes place 
by defending our western border we are defending the 
inviolability of all borders in europe he said 
in a separate speech at the us chamber of commerce mazowiecki 
urged the united states to maintain its political presence in 
europe and to invest in poland as a means of opening markets in 
eastern europe and the soviet union 
we have a rich record of working in the russian market in 
building railroads for example he told the us chamber of 
commerce we could renew that and carry the world of free 
enterprise into that market

as a military band played the ballad of the 
green berets the army conducted a group burial friday of remains 
thought to belong to seven army soldiers and two vietnamese pilots 
shot down over laos in 1968 
the burial which took place at arlington national cemetery had 
touched off complaints from some powmia representatives given 
that only one of the nine individuals had been positively 
identified from the bone shards and teeth recovered last year from 
the crash site 
but army officials said they were able to account for those 
aboard the ch34 helicopter that was shot down by antiaircraft 
fire over laos in 1968 because of other evidence recovered at the 
site and eyewitness accounts of the event 
although group burials are not commonplace they are used when 
individual bodies cant be accounted for from the forensic evidence 
available said army spokeswoman maj nancy burt 
it went very well either family members or representatives of 
the us soldiers families were there to accept the flags 
said another spokeswoman shari lawrence of the us total army 
personnel command 
the families need to have this time of emotion and grief 
said ms lawrence who attended the ceremony 
the remains of the one crew member who was identified staff 
sgt richard a fitts of abingdon mass were buried in his 
hometown earlier this year however his name is also listed with 
the other six green berets on the groups grave marker given the 
possibility that some of his other remains might be mixed with 
those buried on friday ms lawrence said 
she said all of the families of the late servicemen agreed to 
have their relatives names put on the group marker 
however the names of the two vietnamese were not included 
because the names werent released to us she said 
ms lawrence said she did not know why that was but that such a 
situation might occur if the families couldnt be located 
ms lawrence said the army is scheduled to conduct two more 
group burials next month one for soldiers from the vietnam war and 
another for remains from world war ii 
besides fitts the group interment included sgt 1st class

from shopkeepers to the president israelis are 
expressing growing anger over the latest and most entangled round 
of backroom deals by politicians struggling to form the next 
government 
the israeli political system has reached its lowest point 
liberal legislator amnon rubinstein said friday what we are 
dealing with is not a political process but a process of political 
bribery 
the political horsetrading is a product of israels electoral 
system which encourages tiny parties thats because the whole 
country is a single electoral district and the cutoff point for 
gaining a seat is less than 1 percent of the votes cast this has 
meant no party has ever gained enough votes to govern alone 
leading to coalitions with an array of small factions 
the two largest groups the centerleft labor party and the 
rightwing likud bloc have promised for years to push electoral 
reform such as direct voting for the prime minister but reform 
bills have always been quietly buried in parliament committees 
avi pazner a chief aide to caretaker prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of likud now says the two big parties should have tried 
harder to reform the system the past five years when they governed 
together in a coalition 
both parties were suspicious of one another both somehow were 
afraid that the other one might utilize the changes and thats why 
they neutralized each other said pazner 
it was a great mistake we should have pushed forward an 
electoral system that would put some order in our political life 
this is not a desirable system he told the associated press 
the latest chapter in topsyturvy israeli politics opened last 
week when labor brought down the likudled government with a 
noconfidence motion in parliament over shamirs refusal to accept 
us middle east peace proposal 
president chaim herzog who asked labor leader shimon peres to 
try to form a new coalition issued a warning to all parties this 
week that israelis were growing furious with the seemingly endless 
political maneuvering 
herzog was quoted as saying the israeli public is fed up with 
the politicians and that widespread disillusionment could pave 
the way for a demagogue to rise to power 
but herzogs warning was quickly forgotten in the rush by labor 
and likud to break the deadlock each side claims the backing of 60 
legislators in the 120member parliament 
the main partners in the game of political seduction are three 
ultraorthodox religious parties that together control 13 seats 
they have been offered key cabinet posts and funding for religious 
institutions in exchange for their support 
for example the small agudat israel party joined the labor camp 
after reportedly being promised the ministries of housing labor 
and social affairs 
agudat legislator rabbi menachem porush said likud upped the 
ante by dangling the valuable finance ministry in front of agudat 
if it switched affiliations 
many israelis are angered by the latest wheeling and dealing 
this is a terrible situation its like blackmail said dan 
ben moshe 30 who runs a jerusalem cigarette shop everybody 
wants something in exchange for their support mainly government 
jobs 
the conservative maariv daily was even more scathing in an 
editorial friday of all the democratic systems in the world 
israel has succeeded in finding the worst the politicians have no 
shame they use the weaknesses of the government to their 
advantage

the us bureau of land management and the 
private nature conservancy signed a historic agreement friday to 
combine their efforts to preserve wildlife and its habitat for 
future generations 
the agreement formalizes a publicprivate national partnership 
to save endangered and rare animals and plants on 40 percent of the 
countrys public lands encompassing 270 million acres the blms 
domain includes oneeighth of the land mass in the continental 
united states with more than 3000 species of fish and wildlife 
1000 of which are considered imperiled 
this is a policy statement down to our local folks that the 
green lights lit for a trendsetting relationship said blm 
director cy jamison 
the nonprofit nature conservancy is committed to preserving 
biology zoology and natural ecosystems 
started 36 years ago it has more than 500000 members in 
chapters across the country a 100 million annual budget and 
employs biologists lawyers and people with business degrees its 
goal is the acquisition of private lands to keep as wilderness 
preserves 
that can mean ownership or leasing alone or in concert with 
governmental agencies such as the blm us fish and wildlife 
service or state parks departments 
what were really trying to do is to protect our natural 
heritage said john sawhill the conservancys new president and 
former federal energy chief 
the rate of species extinction in this country is increasing 
dramatically and were trying to slow that down were trying to 
preserve species and important natural communities for future 
generations 
the nature conservancy has acquired more than 5 million acres as 
nature preserves in the united states and more in latin america it 
maintains a hefty national revolving fund for its state 
conservancies to tap into for acquisitions such as the kartchner 
caverns in southeastern arizona 
in all it owns and manages more than 900 nature preserves the 
worlds largest privately owned system 
jamison said he has no qualms and sees no conflicts about a 
private organization helping set government policy on land 
acquisition as long as it comes from the ground up 
he added that in an emergency the nature conservancy can act 
much more quickly than the federal government which can take one 
to three years they can move today and thats why the 
partnership is so important jamison said

buckley said a 1925 new york times article described the regimen 
this way he takes his first ride before breakfast indulges in a 
brief canter just after luncheon and by the shade of the moon an 
hour or so before retiring for the night he takes a sharp gallop 
that brings on the weariness that induces slumber 
while popular on ocean liners the mechanical horse was hardly 
the stationary bicycle of its time and was something of an 
anachronism in the jazz age buckley said 
he represented to the population a president from another era 
an era where we had a nation of producers he said 
coolidge the first president to speak on the radio earned the 
nickname silent cal because of his general reticence 
his ambiguous refusal to enter the 1928 election is commemorated 
in northampton annually with the i do not choose to run 10 
kilometer footrace 
coolidge retired to northampton with his wife grace he died in 
1933 
since then northampton has become a laidback liberal college 
town but coolidges legacy has been preserved at the museum said 
buckley visiting assistant professor at the university of 
massachusetts history department 
the mechanical horse was shipped out this week to the dwight d 
eisenhower library in abilene kan the fourth time it has been 
loaned out by the forbes it will be returned in december 
well be glad to get it back said buckley who views the 
castiron machine as an allegory for coolidges reign as a 
massachusetts yankee in the great gatsby era 
this is a mechanical horse buckley said what could be 
more symbolic of a horse and buggy society being kind of 
transformed electronically in the 20s

two women were sentenced friday to 40 
years in prison for lining up their children so men could pick them 
for sex they received the same sentence last week for forcing two 
children to have sex 
carolyn wilson and annette sanford each were sentenced in 
allegan county circuit court to 5 to 15 years for thirddegree 
criminal sexual conduct wilson got 20 to 40 years and sanford 10 
to 40 years for firstdegree criminal sexual conduct 
the victims had mixed feelings about their mothers going to 
prison said their foster mothers on friday 
no matter what happened shes still their mom said deb 
johnson who is caring for three of the children i think they do 
miss their mother even though they feel terrible about what 
was done to them 
dixie lumbard a foster mother to one of sanfords three 
daughters said the children are relieved but echoed johnsons 
sentiments no matter what happened theyre still their 
mothers she said 
the convictions came from the sexual abuse of wilsons 
now13yearold son and 15yearold daughter who testified their 
mother and sanford forced them their older sister and sanfords 
young daughters to line up several times a week so visiting men 
could select one for sex 
authorities believe drugs or money changed hands 
the children said hundreds of rapes and molestations occurred 
from 198588 while the two families lived together in plainwell 
you have violated societys trust and respect of these 
children in the most heinous way i can conceive of judge george 
corsiglia told wilson during sentencing 
the women were sentenced last week to up to 40 years for 
previous convictions of firstdegree criminal sexual conduct for 
forcing wilsons son and sanfords daughter then 11 and 9 
respectively to have sex while the women watched 
authorities say wilson 42 and sanford 34 are halfsisters 
and had a lesbian relationship 
with the sentences being served concurrently and credit given 
for time served in the county jail wilson could be eligible for 
parole in about 15 years and sanford could be eligible in about 14 
years 
the children ages 9 to 19 told of being beaten by their 
mothers and a social worker testified they ate from garbage cans 
because they were not given food 
the women have said they are innocent and will appeal the 
convictions their attorneys argued the children concocted the 
sexual abuse stories so they could stay with foster families after 
being removed in 1988 from an admittedly neglectful home

the senate has approved a resolution saying 
that an undivided jerusalem should remain the capital of israel 
the arab league on friday denounced the resolution which was 
viewed as a criticism of president bush for saying that jews should 
not settle in east jerusalem 
this irresponsible resolution forfeits any serious or 
constructive role the us senate can play in the search for a just 
peace in the middle east said arab league ambassador clovis 
maksoud who represents the 22member organization 
the senate measure adopted on a unanimous voice vote late 
thursday has no legal status and simply expresses the sense of the 
senate it said senators acknowledge that jerusalem is and should 
remain the capital of the state of israel 
jerusalem is revered by the arab world as one of islams holiest 
sites and the rightful capital of a palestinian state east 
jerusalem is the section of the city seized by israel in the 1967 
mideast war 
maksoud called the resolution a shocking development that 
demonstrates an incomprehensible and reckless defiance of the 
international community the arab and moslem worlds and the 
declared policy of the united states 
the united states and most other countries have not recognized 
jerusalem as the israeli capital maintaining their embassies in 
tel aviv 
us policy states that while jerusalem should not be divided 
again as it was until 1967 the question of sovereignty over the 
holy city should be determined in israeliarab negotiations 
the senate strongly believes that jerusalem must remain an 
undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic religious groups 
are protected the senate measure states 
sen patrick moynihan dny said the resolution represents 
a clear statement by the senate that president bushs statements on 
east jerusalem were unwise and untimely 
he said bushs ambiguous statements about the status of 
jerusalem are not helpful to the peace process 
responding to criticism bush has argued that he was merely 
stating existing policy when he made his remarks earlier this month 
our efforts in the peace process are in no way designed to 
promote the division of jerusalem bush said in a letter to sen 
rudy boschwitz dminn 
nonetheless analysts have suggested that his comments about the 
sensitive issue of jerusalem derailed attempts to bring israel and 
the palestinians to the negotiating table at a crucial point in 
the process 
outrage in israel over bushs comments eventually led to last 
weeks fall of the government led by rightwing prime minister 
yitzhak shamir

a cia employee testified friday that john 
poindexter left out important facts but didnt appear to be coveing 
up when he briefed congress about a 1985 missile shipment to iran 
testifying as a defense witness at poindexters trial norman 
gardner described how sen david durenberger charged right into 
poindexters office on nov 21 1986 to be briefed about the 
reagan administrations iran initiative 
durenberger told poindexter john if youre not going to give 
us all the facts were going to get the hell out of here said 
gardner who was at the meeting taking notes at the time 
durenberger was vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee 
to the best of your knowledge was admiral poindexter 
involved in obstructing or lying to congress about the missile 
shipment defense attorney joseph small asked gardner 
no replied gardner 
poindexter is accused of covering up the us role in the 
shipment of hawk missiles by telling the senate intelligence 
committee he didnt find out about it until january 1986 
poindexter told the house intelligence committee in a separate 
meeting on nov 21 1986 that thenpresident reagan did not 
approve the shipment 
but gardner knew a presidential document called a finding had 
been prepared that ratified the ciaassisted shipment and 
prosecutor christian mixter asked why gardner didnt speak out at 
the meeting 
the finding was not done before the shipment but rather was 
drafted a day or so after it occurred retorted gardner 
hours after meeting with the senators and house members 
poindexter tore up the politically embarrassing document which 
depicted us arms sales to iran as an armsforhostages deal a 
contradiction of what reagan was saying publicly 
poindexter told the house committee the us government may have 
had prior knowledge about the shipment 
but prosecutor mixter said as the poindexter jury listened that 
there was not just knowledge there was involvement by 
poindexter 
gardner has told the fbi that he reviewed cia cable traffic 
which said this operation is being conducted under instructions 
from admiral poindexter said mixter 
i dont recall making those statements to the fbi replied 
gardner who at one point called an fbi interview report about him 
totally inaccurate 
the same day poindexter briefed the congressmen thencia 
director william casey testified on capitol hill that the cia had 
been asked to assist a shipment of bulky cargo in november 
1985 casey gave no indication the cia knew the cargo was weapons 
gardner reported caseys testimony back to poindexter 
did you tell admiral poindexter that the cover story wasnt 
holding up very well mixter asked gardner 
no i didnt gardner responded the cia employee denied 
there was any cover story saying there was a great deal of 
confusion when the cia found out hawk missiles were aboard the 
plane heading for iran a cia proprietary airline moved the 
missiles from israel to iran 
the national security agencys deputy director for plans and 
policy ralph w adams also testified friday 
congress had intelligence from the agency in november 1985 
suggesting the us government might be directing the contras in 
nicaragua defense attorney richard beckler disclosed during adams 
testimony 
becklers point was that at least a house intelligence committee 
staff member richard giza had extensive information about the 
reagan administrations activities in central america in 1985 
during a congressional ban on us military aid to the rebels 
poindexter is accused of concealing from congress oliver norths 
secret military assistance to the contras

democrats launched a boisterous attack friday 
on president bushs tax and foreign policies as they tried to 
present a united front from competing conferences 750 miles apart 
in new orleans sen lloyd bentsen of texas told the democratic 
leadership council that bushs nonewtaxes pledge was pure 
bushlips accusing him of pushing cryptotaxes disguised as 
user fees and surcharges 
how in the world do you read somebodys lips when they keep 
talking out of both sides of their mouth party chairman ronald 
h brown asked sounding the same theme 
he tried to downplay bushs high ratings in the public opinion 
polls 
its time for us to point out that the bush administration has 
been getting a free ride that we hear a lot of sweet jargon but 
we dont see any action he said 
brown was shuttling between new orleans and indianapolis where 
the democratic national committee gathered for its spring meeting 
in indianapolis he reminded party leaders about their electoral 
successes last year 
i dont remember a single year in my lifetime where one party 
has been so dominant as we were in 1989 brown said he cited 
democratic victories in the years two gubernatorial races and in 
capturing the new jersey state senate and winning six of the eight 
special elections for us house seats 
brown also pledged that the party would become more aggressive 
in its opposition to republicans from the white house on down the 
ticket 
were going to be fair were going to be accurate but were 
going to be tough he said 
party leaders also criticized bush for what they characterized 
as a timid foreign policy bentsen accused bush of paying too much 
attention to public opinion polls and reacting too slowly to events 
in central america the soviet union and eastern europe 
can you imagine harry truman hesitating to unveil the truman 
doctrine or the marshall plan or the berlin airlift because of a 
public opinion poll he said can you imagine john kennedy 
doing a poll before dealing with the cuban missile crisis 
sen sam nunn dga echoed the criticism saying precisely 
as our principles and values are prevailing throughout the world 
americas trumpet is sounding an uncertain note 
bentsen and brown parted company over a proposal by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny to cut the social security payroll tax 
the dncs executive committee endorsed the moynihan proposal 
friday and the full committee was certain to follow up when it 
meets on saturday and make it party policy 
this is the right thing to do and the right time to do it 
said john marino new york democratic party chairman we have to 
say to middle class americans that we care about you 
brown said he was encountering strong support for the moynihan 
plan wherever he travels 
but bentsen who chairs the senate finance committee said he 
opposes the plan because it would mean the loss of 50 billion in 
revenue 
my concern is that i dont want to see us get into a bidding 
war with the republicans bentsen said we cant win that one 
because they dont care how far they go insofar as increasing that 
deficit by cutting of taxes 
brown denied that his difference with bentsen was a sign of an 
unbreachable division within the party whose more conservative 
wing is represented by those in new orleans 
just because we dont have every i dotted and every t 
crossed doesnt mean we are not unified brown said were 
having an open and honest discussion about very complicated 
matters 
party officials in indianapolis also moved a step closer to 
adopting the final rules for selecting delegates to the 1992 
democratic national convention 
endorsed was a proposal to permit states to hold primaries or 
caucuses starting the first tuesday in march and ending the second 
tuesday in june the starting date would be one week earlier than 
it was in 1988 
also backed was a plan to strip states of up to 25 percent of 
their delegates if they fail to comply with party rules brown said 
that proposal would permit the party to exert reasonable pressure 
on states rather than be faced with a choice of unseating entire 
delegations or ignoring rules violations

civil rights leader ralph david abernathy 
remained hospitalized in fair condition friday for a sodium 
imbalance but was not in great danger his physician said 
abernathy was brought to crawford long hospital of emory 
university thursday night after his wife reported that he wasnt 
his usual self said dr robert kaufmann abernathys physician 
he was somewhat lethargic and not as alert as he usually is 
kaufmann said 
abernathy was diagnosed with hyponatremia an electrolytic 
imbalance or low sodium count in his bloodstream the sodium 
deficiency was probably triggered by nausea abernathy suffered two 
days earlier coupled with diuretics he takes for high blood 
pressure kaufmann said 
a sodium imbalance can be life threatening but abernathy is 
responding to fluids treatment kaufmann said 
i dont think hes in great danger at this point the doctor 
said adding that abernathy was alert friday morning asking 
howm i doing 
a possible complication of sodium imbalance is arrythmia or an 
irregular heartbeat and abernathy is being monitored in the 
hospitals cardiac care unit however he is not suffering from 
heart trouble 
the 63yearold minister and civil rights leader could be 
hospitalized a week or so depending on how he responds to 
treatment kaufmann said 
abernathy pastor atlantas west hunter street baptist church 
has a recent history of health problems including strokes in 1983 
and 1986 he had been hospitalized recently but kaufmann declined 
to say what prompted that hospitalization 
abernathy worked with martin luther king jr during the early 
years of the civil rights movement but his relationship with many 
former colleagues has been strained in recent years 
he angered many of them last year when his autobiography and 
the walls came tumbling down suggested that king committed 
adultery the night before he was assassinated a memphis tenn 
woman last month sued abernathy for libel over the passage

a federal program to provide community mental 
health services to the poor and uninsured is an abysmal failure 
because up to 100 million was squandered building forprofit 
hospitals with swimming pools and tennis courts a consumer group 
charged friday 
half of 575 community mental health centers funded under the 
program are violating federal regulations that require them to be 
nonprofit to provide certain essential services and to make some 
services available to the poor public citizen health research 
group said 
one of the most visible consequences of the failed program has 
been a significant increase in the number of seriously mentally ill 
homeless and an increase in the number of mentally ill persons in 
jails and prisons the groups report said 
the community mental health centers program has been an 
abysmal failure the report said 
a report by the house government operations subcommittee on 
human resources and intergovernmental relations chaired by rep ted 
weiss dny said its investigation has revealed the same kinds 
of violations 
weiss called for a general accounting office investigation to 
determine the extent of the problem 
and the inspector general of the department of health and human 
services is beginning an investigation of the matter in response 
to a request by hhs undersecretary constance horner a spokeswoman 
for the inspector general said 
alan leshner deputy director of the national institute of 
mental health said officials are aware of problems with the 
program and 10 months ago began to identify centers out of 
compliance and to seek recoveries 
asked if he were aware of any fraud or abuse leshner said i 
dont know of it and if we do know of it we will correct it 
that doesnt mean that there arent centers that are out of 
compliance but i dont see any fraud and abuse 
public citizen said that between 50 million and 100 million is 
owed the federal government by mental health centers that received 
federal construction grants under the program and are out of 
compliance 
it based the estimate on reports of inspections of 158 centers 
in the program the inspections were conducted by a company under 
contract to nimh and were obtained by public citizen and the 
national alliance for the mentally ill 
some 575 community mental health centers have received grants 
under the program since it began in 1967 
so far nimh has recovered only 38 million from 10 of those 
that received grants but were found to be out of compliance public 
citizen said 
all of this was collected from 198386 when paul curtis was 
headed the program at nimh the group said 
in a statement included in public citizens report curtis said 
that while he found many of the hospitals out of compliance he was 
actively discouraged from seeking recoveries by his superiors 
at nimh curtis retired in 1986 
grants under the program require a community mental health 
center to provide five essential services to the mentally ill for 
at least 20 years and require that they provide a reasonable 
volume of services to the poor the required services are 
inpatient outpatient partial hospitalization emergency services 
and consultation and education 
as an example of centers the group contends are seriously out of 
compliance public citizen cited the orlando regional medical 
center in florida which received 731912 in 1967 with some of 
those funds it built a swimming pool and tennis courts hired 
a gardner lifeguard and swimming instructor public citizens 
report said 
depaul hospital in new orleans which received 475484 in 
construction funds and opened in 1972 was sold to a forprofit 
company the next year the group said 
leshner attributed some of the problems with the 23yearold 
program to the philosophy of the programs leaders during previous 
administrations 
the previous philosophy was that its better to provide some 
service than to shut down a mental health center and have all the 
money go into the treasury and not be used for mental health he 
said 
perhaps too much was done to get noncompliance centers into 
compliance he said at some point you have to say ok this 
isnt going to work we have to get the recovery 
nimh was alerted to the problems by the inspection contractor 
continuing medical education inc and began an audit 10 months 
ago the audit found no major problems but some procedural 
changes were called for and a number of them were put in place 
leshner said 
the institute also compiled a list of 33 centers in the program 
that had been identified as having compliance problems nimh staff 
will visit all of those centers by june leshner said 
the institute also will visit by sept 30 the 72 centers that 
have received waivers of the requirements during the past two 
years he said 
leshner said he could not estimate the amount of money nimh will 
seek from the centers that are out of compliance

president bush said friday he is deeply 
offended by some of the filth that passes for art and receives 
federal grants but that hes not about to propose government 
censorship 
i dont know of anybody in the government that should be 
set up to censor what you write or what you paint or how you 
express yourself bush said 
the president made the comments at a questionandanswer session 
in the white house with outoftown editors and reporters he was 
asked about his administrations opposition to placing restrictions 
on financing from the national endowment for the arts for 
controversial art 
the administrations position was outlined earlier this week by 
nea chairman john frohnmayer at a congressional hearing the agency 
has come under mounting criticism from sen jesse helms rnc 
and other conservatives who claim it is ignoring a congressional 
ban imposed for this fiscal year on financing obscene art 
some critics have proposed legislation to place even more 
stringent restrictions on federal arts financing but frohnmayer 
said the white house opposes extending such restrictions into the 
next fiscal year 
bush supported frohnmayer and said he opposes any efforts to 
write art standards into law 
i am deeply offended by some of the filth that i see and to 
which federal money has gone and by some of the sacrilegious 
blasphemous depictions that are portrayed by some to be art bush 
said 
but he said that while he will speak strongly out against 
such art i would prefer to have this matter handled by a very 
sensitive knowledgeable man of the arts john frohnmayer than 
risk censorship or getting the federal government into telling 
every artist what he or she can paint 
so i am against censorship but i will try to convince those 
who feel differently in terms of legislation that we will do 
everything in our power to stop pure blasphemy 
bush said two horrendous examples came to mind of what i 
would call blasphemous material that has no business getting one 
cent of the taxpayers money 
but he added i dont want to offend the american people by 
describing those particular works 
bush engaged in a wideranging exchange with the reporters and 
editors in which he also 
said that any attempt by the soviet union to use force to put 
down lithuanias bid for independence was bound to backfire he 
also reiterated his criticism of congress for not moving faster on 
his 800 million aid package for panama and nicaragua 
said that despite progress on the humanrights front in south 
africa it was still not time to change the policy of us 
economic sanctions on pretoria he suggested that he first wants a 
chance to meet with south african president fw deklerk and black 
nationalist leader nelson mandela both have been invited 
separately to the white house but dates have yet to be set 
defended spending money to aid new democracies instead of 
putting more into domestic programs saying it was important to 
help create stable democracies that will actively trade with the 
united states 
declared himself opposed to statehood for the district of 
columbia this is a federal city and my view is it should remain 
that he said put me down as unsympathetic to that particular 
cause

a 100footlong wall being erected atop a 
warehouse toppled onto an adjoining roof friday smashing through 
in an avalanche of debris that killed two people and critically 
injured two others officials said 
ten other people suffered less serious injuries in the collapse 
at the century 21 department stores warehouse in brooklyn the dead 
and injured included construction workers and employees in the 
building below 
i just heard the big noise it sounded like a building 
falling fannie deblasio a neighbor said of the 915 am 
accident i looked out the window and saw people running 
workers were adding a second floor to the onestory warehouse 
when the new wall a foot thick 14 feet high and 100 feet long 
fell on an adjoining onestory building also owned by century 21 
officials said 
the debris smashed a 30by30foot hole through the roof of the 
second building killing a woman working inside rescuers said a 
construction worker also was killed 
the buildings department had approved construction plans and 
issued permits for work at the site but apparently only for a 
groundfloor extension not a secondfloor addition said spokesman 
vahe tiryakian 
they had a permit but it appears the permit did not include 
permission to do the work they were doing tiryakian said the 
department was investigating he said 
the permit was issued to a vortex contracting corp in queens 
tiryakian said there was no telephone listing for a vortex in 
queens officials at a vortex listed in brooklyn did not return a 
telephone call 
the city ordered the contractor to shore up another wall it had 
built atop the 100by100 foot warehouse then to stop work while 
an engineer determined what caused the accident

a treasury department official nominated to 
the federal reserve board promised friday that he would exercise 
independent judgment rather than serve as an agent of the 
administrations push to lower interest rates 
if confirmed i pledge i will exercise my independent 
judgment on matters before the board david w mullins jr told 
the senate banking committee 
mullins 43 is assistant treasury secretary and one of the 
architects of president bushs savings and loan bailout he has 
been a professor at the harvard business school 
president bush nominated him in november to serve the remaining 
six years in the term of h robert heller who resigned the 
committee also reviewed the nomination of edward kelley jr 58 a 
fed board member for the past three years to a new 14year term 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the committee 
and sen paul sarbanes dmd said they worried that mullins was 
being appointed to do the administrations bidding at the central 
bank which sets the nations monetary policy and controls 
shortterm interest rates 
i certainly hope youre going as your own man with absolute 
independence of mind and thought riegle said 
mullins said he would seek counsel from all quarters but 
make his own decisions 
sarbanes noted that mullins had been interviewed by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady budget director richard darman white 
house chief of staff john sununu and white house economic adviser 
michael boskin 
i think youre being nominated because youre pretty much on 
the same wave length as the people who interviewed you he said 
administration officials from the president down have 
periodically criticized the fed for being overly worried about 
inflation and keeping interest rates too high 
a recent published report quoted an unidentified bush adviser as 
saying the president was mad as hell not inclined to reappoint 
alan greenspan when his term as fed chairman expires next year 
mullins said he believed accounts of a rift between the 
administration and the fed were exaggerated adding it is not 
unusual for the president to call for lower interest rates 
however he said there was no compelling evidence that the 
feds current policy of relatively high interest rates is unsound 
on other topics mullins 
called for reform of the toobigtofail doctrine in which 
regulators bail out all depositors of failing big banks even over 
the 100000 insurance limit he said the drexel burnham failure 
proves that big financial firms can fail without threatening the 
financial system 
said he did not believe the central bank should try to improve 
the us trade deficit by managing the value of the dollar in 
currency markets central bank intervention is appropriate only to 
steady markets or if the value of the dollar has deviated from 
economic fundamentals 
defended the administrations sampl bailout saying the major 
reason for the slow start was the massive complexity of the 
task rather than any flaw in last summers legislation 
riegle said he would support mullins nomination

former president jimmy carter found a calmer 
middle east on his latest factfinding mission but a solution to 
the hostage issue is not around the corner according to a 
middle east expert who accompanied him 
kenneth stein who advised the expresident on his tour of 
egypt syria jordan the west bank and israel this month also 
said that recent jewish immigration from the soviet union had 
aroused rancor from arab countries 
during his tour carter had private conversations with several 
heads of state about the 18 western hostages believed held by 
shiite moslem groups in lebanon but stein would not divulge the 
content of the talks 
carter will meet with bush administration officials and members 
of congress tuesday to discuss sensitive issues of his trip and 
may reveal further details after that stein said 
stein said carter denied reports friday that he had any 
communication about the hostages from sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah the reputed spiritual leader of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah group 
the weekly magazine ashshiraa in beirut reported the same day 
that fadlallah had responded through an intermediary to questions 
carter had posed about the issue but carter in hawaii said he 
had asked no questions stein said 
ashshiraa gained international recognition in 1987 for breaking 
the story that the reagan administration was trading arms for us 
hostages however its frequent reports that a hostage release was 
imminent have not proven accurate 
stein said carter had no reaction to fadlallah lebanons most 
influential shiite moslem cleric stating that a new situation 
has emerged with regard to the possibility of a hostage release 
but stein said carter was encouraged when during his trip to 
syria that countrys foreign minister farouk alsharaa said he 
saw no reason to be pessimistic about progress toward the 
hostages freedom 
he has since gone to tehran to urge them to continue to be 
flexible stein said i dont think the syrian foreign minister 
would make a statement like that unless there was some progress 
but a solution is not around the corner 
the united states should be encouraged also that syrian 
president hafez alassad is bolstering the middle east peace 
process stein said syria will announce next month that it is 
sending an ambassador to washington and has said it will help 
negotiate a settlement in lebanons civil war 
these are all signals noises washington wants to hear 
stein said but he added that assads support of statesponsored 
terrorism is still questionable 
stein an emory university middle east expert who accompanied 
carter on two previous trips to the region also said he was 
surprised that the immigration of soviet jews has set arab nations 
in turmoil 
i didnt know how upset theyd be he said jordan is 
beside herself at the prospect the real belief that these 
russianjewish immigrants will settle in the west bank and will 
drive out the palestinians 
in egypt syria and jordan there are certain voices who 
believe there is a conspiracy between moscow and washington with 
moscow providing the bodies and washington providing the money and 
doing it intentionally to hurt the arabs i was really surprised at 
that 
the carter presidential center will use information gleaned from 
the trip when it hosts an international forum in november to 
discuss economic means to promote further peace stein said

at his parents home mike painted his room 
black decorated it with black candles and an altar and put up 
obituaries and satanic symbols on the walls 
he began driving recklessly drinking heavily experimenting 
with marijuana and threatening his parents 
thats when mike ended up in one of the nations first treatment 
programs aimed at weaning disturbed teenagers from satanism 
at the time satanism seemed to have for mike a lot of 
answers that he couldnt find elsewhere said michael weiss a 
psychologist who specializes in treating adolescents it gave him 
the sense that he could control all things 
now that he can find other ways to feel good and have some 
sense of purpose he seems increasingly willing to put aside any 
satanic influence said weiss of hartgrove hospital on chicagos 
north side 
he successfully went through the inpatient program and at 
this point is continuing in treatment on an outpatient basis with 
individual therapy and also some family therapy to date no major 
crises and no return to any satanic involvement that were aware 
of at least 
mike not his real name is among about a half dozen youths 
ranging from ages 14 to 17 whove received treatment or are 
undergoing therapy at hartgroves center for the treatment of 
ritualistic deviance 
the center attached to the hospitals adolescent unit began 
receiving patients in october the inpatient program lasts four to 
eight weeks and involves individual as well as group therapy 
most patients are admitted voluntarily based on referrals from 
mental health workers police and parents 
weiss said its still too early to determine the success rate 
we didnt know what to expect but im pleased with the way 
things are right now he said were certainly finding that we 
can work with these kids and their families 
a similar program exists at denvers bethesda psychhealth 
system and hartgrove has received inquiries from hospitals in 
texas virginia and wisconsin interested in starting their own 
satanism treatment programs said social worker dale trahan 
i definitely see the problem as growing said trahan whos 
been researching satanic beliefs for three years and was contracted 
to set up hartgroves center 
the factors that seem to be adding to a growth of the occult 
dont seem to be going away a breakdown in family an abandonment 
of traditional values resistance towards traditional religious 
beliefs and an increasing number of youths who feel both alienated 
and powerless over their lives and future trahan said 
so many kids are feeling like theyre not going to get 
their needs met using traditional means so theyre looking for 
alternatives and there are many destructive alternatives such 
as street gangs neonazi groups drugs and satanism trahan said 
there has been a marked increase in the number of young people 
involved in satanism said cynthia kisser executive director of 
the chicagobased cult awareness network a nonprofit organization 
that has 30 volunteer chapters around the country 
two years ago the network got only one or two calls a month 
regarding satanism now there are as many as 300 a month ms 
kisser said 
weiss cautions that just because parents find that a teenager 
is into heavy metal music or wearing satanic symbols it doesnt 
mean hes a candidate for hartgroves program 
kids are admitted because they are having emotional or 
behavioral problems coupled with involvement in occult and 
satanic beliefs he said 
some warning signs include a sudden drop in school grades 
withdrawal from the family increasing drug or alcohol use and 
increasingly aggressive behavior trahan said 
satanic beliefs often can make traditional treatment approaches 
unsuccessful because a teenager can use the occult as a defensive 
mechanism weiss said 
trahan said staff members are advised not to react with shock or 
fear to satanic beliefs because this would only encourage the 
patient to believe in the power of the occult 
about 35 to 40 hospital staff members psychiatrists and 
psychologists physical and recreational therapists social 
workers teachers and nurses are involved in the program and have 
received special training 
trahan said the program doesnt have anything in common with 
deprogramming the radical therapy used to break some youths away 
from cults that use psychological manipulation to gain members 
we help them identify constructive alternatives thats not 
brainwashing trahan said 
said weiss our overall goal is to have a kid walk out of here 
who is going to be able to adapt to the world and live a 
reasonable safe and sane life

a mysterious illness that has felled 
hundreds of children in ethnically divided kosovo province appeared 
to be spreading there friday tanjug news agency reported it said 
tests uncovered no poison 
in violence arising from the incident slavs were reported to 
have been beaten by ethnic albanians friday in vucitrn about 18 
miles northwest of pristina and at least 10 were hospitalized 
radio belgrade reported 
on friday morning police moved into the streets of vucitrn 
filled with demonstrators to regain control 
representatives of the ethnic albanian opposition in kosovo 
disputed the official tanjug report claiming the medical team 
involved was not impartial 
the affliction causes breathing difficulties and eye and stomach 
pains the report said nothing about what might have caused 
symptoms 
opposition leaders earlier claimed an unidentified chemical was 
poured or sprayed into classrooms leading to poisoning of teenage 
students in several kosovo towns but belgrade medical experts said 
blood urine and gastric juice tests revealed no poisoning 
hundreds of children were hospitalized in pristina kosovos 
capital on thursday most were released on friday when 240 more 
patients mostly teenagers were admitted with similar complaints 
tanjug said 
an official medical team set up by the federal ministry for 
health in cooperation with serbias health ministry and pristinas 
medical faculty said 18 people were admitted to the hospital in 
pristina from monday through wednesday complaining of weakness 
breathing difficulty chest pains dry mouth and fainting 
on thursday 352 more people mostly aged 1618 were 
hospitalized with the same symptoms the official report said 
clinical examinations established redness on the cheeks and a 
mild swelling of the ears while in a smaller number of patients 
conjunctivitis an eye infection was also found tanjug said 
quoting the official medical bulletin 
the skin redness disappeared after an hour and special treatment 
was not needed the release said 
medical experts also took blood urine and gastric juice samples 
for toxicological examination at the military medical academy in 
belgrade the bestequipped hospital in eastern yugoslavia 
initial results of the analyses do not indicate the presence 
of poisonous substances tanjug reported 
the medical team said that overall no signs emerged of an 
epidemic involving an infectious disease or of poisoning 
but representatives of kosovos democratic opposition asked for 
comment by the associated press criticized the medical teams 
report 
academician rexhep qosja of the albanological institute of 
pristina said the finding was not sufficiently clear 
ibrahim rugova a historian and author said i doubt the 
finding since it was not reached by a neutral commission 
he said the commission representing a federal ministry was not 
neutral enough and alleged manipulation 
most of the original patients were expected to be released by 
weekend officials said 
in clashes with security forces the last 13 months at least 60 
people have been killed as ethnic albanians were protesting 
constitutional changes that gave serbia close control over kosovo 
serbian leaders contend the changes were necessary to protect 
minority slavs from virtual daily harassment by ethnic albanians

the national airline aeroflot closed one of the 
main routes for jews emigrating to israel halting ticket sales to 
budapest on friday and denied it had opened another one through 
egypt soviet media reported 
the closure followed a decision by hungarys malev airline to 
stop flights of soviet jews to tel aviv via budapest because of the 
threat of terrorist attacks israeli officials denounced it as a 
classic example of terrorist blackmail 
on thursday malev appealed to aeroflot to stop bringing jewish 
emigres into hungary 
soviet tv said aeroflot would not sell tickets to emigrants 
wanting to travel to budapest from moscow leningrad and the 
ukrainian capital of kiev it said it would still transport 
businessmen and tourists malev also will continue selling tickets 
to tourists 
foreign minister moshe arens said on israel tv late friday that 
the hungarian move surprised him he said the staterun hungarian 
airline was surrendering to terror 
arens said he had been unable to speak to hungarys foreign 
minister but that if the reports are true he will ask hungary to 
reverse the decision 
budapest the romanian capital of bucharest and several other 
european cities have become the transit points for soviet jews 
using aeroflot no figures have been available on how many soviet 
jews have used those routes 
malev began transporting the immigrants last year following 
hungarys resumption of diplomatic ties with israel 
hungarian officials said they cut off ticket sales to emigrants 
because of threats from palestinian extremists the proiranian 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine has threatened 
airlines of all countries involved in transportation of soviet 
jewish immigrants to israel 
immigration activists expressed their disappointment with 
hungarys decision demanding that authorities open as many routes 
as possible 
palestinian and arab leaders view the immigration of soviet jews 
to israel as a grave threat and have launched an unprecedented 
antiimmigration campaign their concern is based on statements by 
prime minister yitzhak shamir suggesting israel needed to retain 
the occupied territories to settle soviet jews 
israel last month imposed censorship on immigration figures 
routes of exit and the projected number of immigrants citing a 
danger of attacks by palestinian extremists israeli media also 
quoted security sources as saying israel has beefed up security for 
immigrants 
according to official israeli figures about 16700 soviet jews 
emigrated to israel from jan 1 1989 to feb 1 1990 they joined 
about 180000 of their brethren who have come to the country since 
1967 
israeli officials say they expect 750000 soviet jews to arrive 
in the next decade as the result of the soviet unions more liberal 
emigration policies and stricter us entrance requirements 
about 200 new immigrants have joined 70000 jews who live in the 
occupied west bank and the gaza strip home to about 17 million 
palestinians and the scene of the 27month uprising against israeli 
rule 
israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the 
territories which it captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
middle east war 
transportation problems and the difficulties in obtaining 
tickets to european destinations prompted suggestions some 
immigrants may be coming to israel via cairo egypt is the only 
arab country at peace with israel 
the deputy head of aeroflots cairo office a ananyin told the 
newspaper trud on tuesday that the company has added a second 
flight each week to cairo he said there would be one additional 
flight every two weeks in march and then more frequently 
but ananyin denied aeroflot carried any emigrants to egypt we 
meet and see off every flight and i can state with full 
responsibility that no emigrant has so far traveled to israel via 
cairo 
he said the flights were carrying some soviet jews who traveled 
to israel for shortterm family visits he justified the additional 
flight by citing an increase in tourism and business traffic 
trud published by the soviet labor unions said official soviet 
figures indicated a threefold increase in soviet tourism in egypt 
and said the number of businessmen traveling there has recently 
doubled 
soviet first deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov said 
aeroflot had no plans to make direct flights to israel the 
government newspaper izvestia said 
last year aeroflot concluded an agreement with israels el al 
airline on direct flights but soviet authorities have refused to 
ratify it citing shamirs ideas on the settlement of soviet jews 
in the occupied territories 
vorontsov dismissed arab demands that jewish emigration be 
stopped completely saying that the soviet emigration policy and 
its expected further liberalization conform with international 
standards

president bush said friday his administration 
is taking a whole new look at the possibility of shifting 
shipping lanes off the coast of california to get oil tankers 
farther away from beaches 
but spokesmen for the departments bush said were dealing with 
the matter were caught by surprise by the presidents statement 
made at a white house gathering with outoftown newspaper editors 
and said they knew of no new study other than coast guard efforts 
to revise complex shipping rules proposed a year ago 
bushs assertion followed a proposal on thursday from an 
environmental group that a 25milewide vesselfree zone be 
established along the central california coast to lessen the damage 
from crude oil tanker spills 
a study by the natural resources defense council said a buffer 
that keeps oil tankers away from the shore would allow additional 
response time for cleanup teams before oil hits the beaches 
bush said the coast guard the environmental protection agency 
and the transportation and energy departments were trying to take 
a whole new look as to shipping lanes to see what is the 
best whether there is a way to shift the shipping lanes to avert 
proximity to the beaches as much as possible 
the president said it would not be possible to deny oil tankers 
access to the california coast because the oil is needed 
the answer is make it as safe as possible he said 
bush said the federal agencies are cooperating with california 
environmental authorities on the issue 
but if youre saying to me can the federal government 
guarantee that no tanker will ever again have a leak or spill oil 
no i cant do that bush said but we can go the extra mile in 
terms of environmental protection safeguarding the sea lanes and 
all of that 
a coast guard spokesman cmdr john mcelwain said 299 letters 
were received on a proposed rule last april to set sea lanes off 
portions of the california coast and 289 didnt like the 
proposals public hearings in california also brought mostly 
criticism he said 
mcelwain said the agency is now awaiting the results of an 
environmental study of the impact of shipping lanes on wildlife 
before proposing a new rule 
the spokesman said however that he was not aware of a specific 
study on setting shipping channels farther from shore 
currently only limited sea lanes are defined and ships rely on 
rules of prudent seamanship along most of the coast mcelwain 
said 
transportation department spokesman bob marx and energy 
department spokesman phillip keif said they were not aware of a new 
study on the matter a call to the epas public affairs office was 
not returned before the office closed on friday

despite escalating tensions a lithuanian 
independence leader said friday he still believes moscow will avoid 
force and eventually negotiate with the breakaway republic 
lithuania on friday accused moscow of waging psychological 
warfare to force the republic to renounce its declaration of 
independence on march 11 
the kremlin has moved troops in a show of force confiscated 
weapons called for abolishing local defense units and demanded 
that lithuanian deserters return to the soviet military 
i think this absurdity is a duel of david and goliath that is 
understandable for the whole world and in the end moscow sooner or 
later will agree on negotiations said virgilijus cepaitis a 
deputy in the lithuanian parliament and secretary general of the 
sajudis independence movement 
asked at a news conference if he thought moscow would abide by 
public declarations it would not to use force cepaitis replied 
yes i believe in this 
deputies attending a regular session of polands parliament gave 
cepaitis and another lithuanian leader a standing ovation when they 
entered the legislatures main chamber cepjaitis colleague was 
kaziemeras motieka vice president of the lithuanian supreme 
council 
the pair also reported on the standoff between moscow and 
lithuania to members of the solidarity delegation of the polish 
parliament 
the lithuanians were given a copy of a declaration passed by the 
polish parliament thursday welcoming the baltic republic to the 
family of free nations 
the lithuanian cause has won great sympathy among the polish 
who have long historial ties with lithuania more than 100 students 
on friday demonstrated in warsaw to support the lithuanians

romania retracted on friday 
accusations made by authorities that hungary fueled ethnic tensions 
that led to deadly riots in transylvania 
and strikes that nearly paralyzed this ethnically split 
transylvanian town all week ended friday as government emissaries 
replaced both the city and mures county leaderships which had been 
accused of failing to prevent this weeks clashes between romanians 
and ethnic hungarians 
the government issued a statement denying accusations made 
wednesday after premier petre roman met in bucharest the capital 
with representatives of mures and other areas affected by the 
unrest 
it is not true that citizens from hungary incited the 
ethnic hungarians to violence said the statement read on evening 
television news 
it also said the government was dissociating itself from 
charges being brought against ethnic hungarians that they want 
to secede from romania 
the government will call to account all those who disseminate 
lies the declaration said adding that the ministry of education 
will act immediately to ensure that the hungarian language is 
introduced in schools in transylvania where most of the 2 million 
ethnic hungarians live 
in a tv interview broadcast late friday however roman blasted 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn for criticizing the conduct 
of romanian authorities during the violence in tirgu mures where 
seven people died and 300 were hurt 
tirgu mures where riots peaked tuesday night was calm friday 
after a commission of inquiry agreed that the hungarian minority 
has a right to education in their native tongue an issue that 
contributed to the clashes 
life appeared to have returned to normal and industrial 
enterprises were reported to be operating again 
elementary schools were closed because of fears of renewed 
violence rompres news agency reported 
shops reopened and city buses the target of attacks earlier 
this week were back on the streets 
but tension still ran high in the outlying villages of mures 
province where youths armed with sticks roamed the countryside 
i still dont dare to drive out into the nearby hungarian 
villages said municipal bus driver constantin buciu mountainous 
transylvania has about 2 million ethnic hungarians and about 5 
million romanians 
hungary ruled the region for hundreds of years until the end of 
world war i when transylvania was ceded to romania by the 
victorious allied powers 
some romanians accuse ethnic hungarians of trying to separate 
the region from romania in order to rejoin hungary 
hungarians deny that they harbor separatist sentiments and say 
they only want cultural and other ethnic rights 
they along with other national minorities were oppressed under 
longtime communist dictator nicolae ceausescu who was ousted and 
executed in december

the coast guard on friday suspended its 
search for the bodies of nine men presumed drowned after their 
fishing trawler capsized and sank in the frigid bering sea 
fishing vessels rescued 22 crew members who had abandoned the 
sinking ship on life boats they were reported in good condition 
aboard a trawler that was taking them to dutch harbor about 250 
miles southeast of the accident site 
the nine including a federal fisheries observer were lost 
thursday when the 162foot aleutian enterprise sank according to 
the coast guard which said there was little chance their bodies 
would be found 
we had a very good search yesterday lt brian flory said 
friday in juneau we think we would have found anyone who was 
afloat 
several fishing vessels remained in the area to look for bodies 
friday but they also gave up said dan roberts executive vice 
president of arctic alaska fisheries corp in seattle whic 
haley said 
the coast guard will convene a formal board of investigation 
into the accident at noon saturday in anchorage haley said 
roberts said some survivors and company officials would attend 
weather permitting 
the seattlebased ship sank about 60 miles south of the pribilof 
islands town of st paul which is north of the aleutian islands 
chain and southwest of the alaska mainland 
roberts agreed that continuing the search would be useless 
the boats searched for seven hours yesterday they searched 
all night with the water temperature 32 to 34 degrees its 
doubtful they would have survived he said 
the coast guard earlier reported that 10 people were missing 
but the figure was revised to nine after officials discovered one 
crewman apparently had stayed off the ship at its last port 
none of the crew was wearing survival suits said haley coast 
guard officials said a person couldnt survive the frigid water 
more than 30 minutes without insulated survival gear 
the survivors were transferred to the bristol enterprise which 
wasnt expected to arrive in dutch harbor until late friday haley 
said 
from there they were to be flown home as soon as possible 
weather permitting roberts said most of the crew members are from 
the seattle area he said 
lt cmdr richard blaze of the coast guards licensing and 
inspection office in anchorage said the agency has no file on the 
aleutian enterprise nor does another inspection agency the us 
occupational safety and health administration said victor brandt 
of the osha office in anchorage 
the aleutian enterprise was part of a fleet of socalled factory 
trawlers that fish for cod and pollock in the remote bering sea

us diplomats were ordered out of lithuania 
by the soviet union on friday the white house said as president 
bush cautioned the soviets that using force against the breakaway 
republic would be bound to backfire 
us officials said other foreign diplomats and some journalists 
also had been told to leave the lithuanian capital 
bush declared that the united states stands with the brave men 
and women of lithuania in their struggle for selfdetermination 
and in his strongest words yet on the situation he said any 
attempt to coerce or intimidate or forcibly intervene against the 
lithuanian people is bound to backfire that is inevitable 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
would comply with the order for its two diplomats to leave but 
would formally protest to the soviet union this action certainly 
adds to our concerns fitzwater said 
the situation appears to progressively get worse he said 
indeed late in the day the soviets tass news agency said the 
situation was approaching anarchy in all its manifestations 
the sort of language that in the past has been used to prepare 
soviets for major actions 
the us diplomats douglas wake and jon purnell said friday 
night in vilnius that they had heard nothing about the order for 
them to leave 
fitzwater said the diplomats both state department foreign 
service officers were in lithuania only temporarily in any case 
they were returning to the us consulate in leningrad 
the spokesman said it is unclear what specific actions have 
been taken against journalists but we are opposed to any 
infringements on freedom of the press 
other us officials speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said other foreign diplomats and journalists had been ordered out 
of lithuania 
fitzwater said the deputies committee of highranking 
officials of the pentagon state department cia and other agencies 
was keeping track of developments in lithuania but its not 
being treated in a crisislike way from our standpoint 
us options beyond appeals for a peaceful settlement are 
limited and the administration wants to keep the rhetoric 
down fitzwater said 
meanwhile soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin said after a 
meeting with deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger that he 
had no information from moscow about the expulsions 
he indicated that eagleburger raised the issue but that the 
problem generally was being handled by the soviet foreign ministry 
and the us embassy in moscow his meeting with eagleburger had 
been arranged before the expulsion order became known 
earlier bush said at a luncheon meeting with outoftown news 
media representatives we know that the soviet union has a 
longstanding interest in lithuania but those interests can only be 
addressed through dialogue and negotiation 
with tensions steadily escalating bush said we have made 
clear to the soviet union that the situation in lithuania can only 
be solved peacefully 
fitzwater said the two us diplomats had arrived in vilnius 
the lithuanian capital only tuesday and had planned to leave on 
sunday 
they were given 12 hours to leave and they will comply he 
said 
fitzwater said that the united states was not given a reason by 
moscow for the expulsion he said that the soviet chief of protocol 
relayed the expulsion notice to officials at the us embassy in 
moscow 
he said the two officials were in vilnius on routine reporting 
and analysis as they do for the embassy 
they are staff people in our consulate in leningrad he 
said theyre not spies he added 
word of the soviet action came shortly after bush took questions 
at the white house from the outoftown reporters and editors the 
president later flew by helicopter to the presidential retreat in 
camp david md where he was to spend the weekend 
fitzwater said that bush was informed of the soviet action 
shortly before he left the white house 
fitzwater said that the united states has not acted in any way 
to exacerbate tensions in lithuania 
on reports that journalists had been expelled the white house 
spokesman said he expulsion of journalists undermines the spirit 
of glasnost 
bushs words came a day after he had declined to specifically 
criticize soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for his order to 
lithuanians to surrender all firearms 
on thursday bush had appealed to lithuanians to recognize 
certain realities of soviet control but with soviet armor 
rumbling through the streets of the lithuanian capital and other 
evidence of an intensified crackdown by the kremlin the president 
on friday appeared to toughen his message 
the brave men and women of lithuania have made known their 
desire to reestablish the sovereignty of the republic of lithuania 
the united states stands with them and supports their right to 
selfdetermination bush said 
he said the situation was complex and sensitive and required 
realistic levelheaded leadership on both sides 
lithuanian leaders have consistently demonstrated their 
capacity in this regard and the united states will do nothing that 
will make their task more difficult bush said 
in the same vein as bush gen colin l powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff said in a los angles appearance soviet use 
of force would be a major setback and said soviet intentions 
were unknown

alaskas governor and the commander of 
the us coast guard disagreed friday over how much environmental 
damage remains in prince william sound on the anniversary of the 
nations worst oil spill 
there is a lot of cleanup work left to do this summer gov 
steve cowper told reporters at a news conference 
the indications are that there is biological damage we hope 
it isnt longterm cowper said after a visit thursday to shores 
blackened when the exxon valdez ran aground spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil 
coast guard commandant adm paul yost who also revisited prince 
william sound this week almost a year after the march 24 1989 
spill disputed the governors generally negative portrayal in 
another news conference 90 minutes later 
there is a tremendous improvement in the situation yost 
said 
cowper released state department of environmental conservation 
preliminary data indicating dramatic biological impacts on salmon 
and herring fisheries in some streams that enter the sound 
he said major measures may be required in this summers 
oilspill cleanup program to save the fisheries and other 
resources exxon is proposing a cleanup plan that the state 
considers inadequate 
at one heavily polluted site a normally rich salmon stream on 
latouche island not a single small salmon exists this spring 
cowper said though results of the state data are not definitive 
he said it indicates that the oil in the substrata killed 
whatever was there 
the governor also said 90 percent of herring roe at another site 
have shown aberrations 
cowper also called on exxon to settle outofcourt all valid 
spillrelated lawsuits with the federal government the state and 
private parties if that is not done he envisions up to a dozen 
years of litigation he said 
yost said he doubts the existence of state biological data 
mentioned by cowper he said if the state is holding secret 
data it should released it immediately 
the coast guard chief he learned from his visit to four heavily 
oiled shorelines this week that a cleanup is still needed but said 
exxons 1989 efforts and the effects of winter storms and wave 
action had made a major major difference 
yost said a fairly major cleanup effort will begin may 1 
after the coast guard determines on a milebymile basis the 
proper kind of treatment that will be required this year 
in a separate letter to the coast guards onscene coordinator 
rear adm david ciancaglini released friday by cowper alaska dec 
commissioner dennis kelso criticized exxons general plan for 
1990s cleanup effort 
exxon which released the plan on march 15 contended that last 
years heavy equipmentaided cleanup followed by winter tides 
allows the company to use milder cleanup techniques this year 
but the state said friday the plan is far too limiting 
we cannot afford to base our work plan and our standards on 
unsupported conclusions public relations strategies and solely 
shortterm fixes kelso wrote 
cowper said the state will support more intrusive cleaning 
techniques including such unproven tactics as bulldozing 
shorelines if they are proven effective and allow microorganisms 
and other life forms to reestablish themselves over the long term 
yost said the federal onscene coordinator will make the final 
decisions on future cleanup activities and exxon officials have 
assured him the company will do everything reasonable it is 
asked to do 
economics also will be a factor in determining what can be done 
yost said i dont think you can require anybody to spend an 
unlimited amount of money he said

the loincloths painted on some nude figures 
in michelangelos last judgment on orders of pope pius iv 
should be left on the 16thcentury masterpiece vatican restorer 
fabrizio mancinelli said friday 
to remove them we would have to make a hole in the wall and 
frankly i dont want to make a hole in the wall said mancinelli 
who is directing the cleaning of michelangelos sistine chapel 
frescoes 
the last judgment is a 60by30foot painting on the wall 
above the chapel altar 
mancinelli spoke at a news conference presenting a vatican 
exhibit on michelangelo and the 11yearold project of wiping away 
centuries of soot grime and dust from the renaissance work 
the sistine chapel restoration has long been surrounded by 
controversy critics led by columbia university art historian 
james beck charged the restorers were removing some of 
michelangelos retouchings and altering the colors of the frescoes 
but mancinelli said the vatican team left michelangelos 
original work intact removing only gluevarnish added to the 
painting by 17th and 18th century restorers 
restorers recently finished cleaning the 5533squarefoot 
vaulted chapel ceiling revealing bright and dynamic colors early 
next month they will begin the fouryear restoration of the last 
judgment 
some 16thcentury church officials were shocked by the nude 
figures in the last judgment and in 1564 pius iv ordered 
those found most offensive to be covered up by artist daniele da 
volterra 
some art experts argue the loincloths should now be removed but 
mancinelli said the rules of italian restoration call for all 
essential elements of an artwork to be maintained including da 
volterras reworkings 
he noted previously that the whole issue may be moot since some 
historians think the nude parts were removed when da volterra made 
his additions if they are correct taking away the loincloths 
would reveal bare spots on the wall 
the issue is expected to be debated by 50 international 
scientists restorers and art historians meeting at the vatican 
next week to discuss plans for the last judgment restoration 
carlo pietrangeli director of the vatican museums said the 
results of the ceiling restoration had eliminated the bitterness he 
felt over the unjustified criticism of the project 
there has been talk of limiting the number of tourists in the 
chapel which on peak days can attract up to 19000 visitors but 
pietrangeli said it would be practically impossible to turn 
back tourists 
pope john paul ii is scheduled to inaugurate the michelangelo 
exhibit on saturday in the braccio di carlo magno in st peters 
square entitled michelangelo and the sistine chapel technique 
conservation and myth the exhibit will open to the public sunday 
and run through july 10 
the exhibit includes a selection of michelangelos drawings 
showing how he planned the sistine chapel decoration a scale model 
of the scaffolding he used a video on the cleaning techniques and 
drawings by raphael rubens caravaggio and others underlining 
michelangelos impact on other artists

former exxon valdez capt joseph 
hazelwood was sentenced friday to help clean up prince william 
sound and pay 50000 in restitution by a judge seeking to soothe 
outrage over the nations worst oil spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone in sentencing hazelwood to 
1000 hours of community service by cleaning beaches said he was 
disappointed that the fired skipper had not publicly apologized for 
his role in the disaster 
im sure deep down he is very shameful the judge said 
johnstone however acknowledged that hazelwood had been advised by 
his lawyers to keep silent because of the many civil lawsuits he 
still faces 
hazelwoods attorneys said they thought the sentence for a 
single misdemeanor conviction of negligence would be overturned on 
appeal in part because the order to pay 50000 in restitution to 
the state was illegal 
the defense attorneys said johnstone chose an arbitrary figure 
without measuring hazelwoods ability to pay 
the judge also gave hazelwood the maximum jail term of 90 days 
and fine of 1000 but suspended both sentences saying he felt 
prison would not deter hazelwood 
imprisonment is not going to restore the environment the 
judge said but there is community outrage and something has to 
be done to provide condemnation and reaffirmation 
johnstone who presided over hazelwoods sevenweek trial said 
he felt the captain was wrong to drink before he boarded his ship 
and believed he violated at least some coast guard regulations in 
the grounding a year ago saturday 
a 12member jury found hazelwood guilty thursday of a charge of 
negligent discharge of oil into state waters but he was acquitted 
of three other charges including a felony that he was reckless 
and drunk during the disaster that blackened the rocky shoreline of 
prince william sound 
had he been convicted of all four hazelwood could have received 
a maximum 7 years and a 61000 fine 
hazelwoods lawyers said they would appeal the conviction as 
well as the sentence and johnstone said he would stay the sentence 
as soon as that appeal is filed 
one of hazelwoods lawyers later issued a statement accusing the 
judge of hazelwood bashing and said johnstones criticism of 
the skipper for drinking and being off the bridge of his ship 
improperly tried to override the jurys verdict 
in light of the jury verdict this type of demagoguery should 
stop said attorney thomas russo 
he said 90 percent of johnstones comments friday were directed 
at what the jury already had decided absolving hazelwood of 
recklessness and intoxication 
another hazelwood attorney dick madson told reporters after 
the sentencing the restitution is illegal i think the judge 
has no right to set an arbitrary figure like that 
madson said that in almost any crime a judge can assess a figure 
for restitution an amount that goes to the victim rather than to 
the state as would a normal fine 
he said however such an assessment always involves measuring 
the defendants ability to pay and degree of responsibility 
johnstone made no such inquiry and the madson asserted this would 
invalidate the the assessment 
madson called the order to perform community service a novel 
way to come up with a fair sentence but he and another hazelwood 
attorney michael chalos said they thought the 1000 hours were 
excessive since the sentence would exceed the maximum 90 days in 
jail allowed under the law 
even if hazelwood worked 8 hours a day cleaning beaches they 
said he could not finish 1000 hours within 3 months 
the judges decision also meet with the disapproval of the jury 
forewoman lori wing who was in the courtroom along with four 
other jurors for the sentencing 
i had high hopes he would walk out of here a free man and get 
on with his life she said 
hazelwood had no immediate comment on the sentencing madson 
said hazelwood had come to court expecting the worst jail time 
after thursdays verdict hazelwood had commented id like to go 
back to the sea thats what i do 
assistant district attorney brent cole in remarks before the 
sentencing cited hazelwoods history of two drunken driving 
convictions and declared that captain hazelwood is probably on a 
scale of 1 to 10 a 3 or 4 as to his likelihood of rehabilitation 
the skippers future also is clouded by more than 100 lawsuits 
filed by assorted victims of the spill 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker ran aground on march 24 
1989 and gushed nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine 
sound 
it killed countless birds fish and wildlife in the scenic area 
and exxon came under bitter criticism for failing to respond 
quickly with a clean up effort 
hazelwood was charged last year with a felony criminal 
mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating 
a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil jurors 
took only 10 hours in deliberations to reject all but one count 
two of them said afterward that they rejected the states 
contention hazelwood was impaired by alcohol when the ship grounded 
because blood alcohol tests were performed on the skipper 10 hours 
after the tanker hit the reef 
in his ruling however johnstone condemned hazelwood i think 
captain hazelwood knows that no reasonably prudent person would 
have had those drinks or left the bridge in my opinion he 
violated at least a couple of coast guard regulations and that 
constitutes negligence 
i think captain hazelwood knows the buck stops with him and he 
has to take responsibility the judge said 
but jim morakis an exxon spokesman in new york said thursday 
that the verdict would seem to confirm the view that the 
grounding of the exxon valdez was an accident 
alaska gov steve cowper said hazelwoods acquittal on the most 
serious charges shows that someone other than the veteran mariner 
was responsible for the grounding 
the result bears out the fact that there are other people 
responsible for this other than captain hazelwood said cowper

a us judge in guam on friday blocked the territorys new 
abortion law the nations most restrictive and a legislative 
package that would let maryland voters decide the abortion issue 
lost a vote and appeared doomed 
in idaho more than 50 junior high school students staged a 
brief sitin in the office of gov cecil andrus protesting the 
legislatures passage of a law that would ban more than 90 percent 
of the abortions performed in the state 
they demanded that the governor veto the legislation which was 
approved thursday and is the most restrictive abortion measure 
passed by any state legislature 
prochoice interests in california michigan wisconsin rhode 
island and north carolina have threatened to boycott idaho potatoes 
if andrus fails to veto the bill 
women can fight back said anne nicol gaylor administrator 
of the madison basedwomens medical fund inc based in madison 
wis we do not have to beg and plead for our rights any more 
either the guam law or the idaho law could provide the basis for 
a direct challenge to the us supreme courts landmark 1973 roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortions 
the maryland senate early friday approved and sent to the house 
of delegates a complicated compromise to end an eightday 
filibuster on the abortion issue 
but the house environmental matters committee voted 13 to 12 
against the package friday night 
there had been a possibility that an attempt to revive the 
proposal would be made on the house floor but because of house 
democratic leadership opposition the committee action most likely 
ends the matter for the 1990 session 
john s arnick chairman of environmental matters told that 
panel before he cast the tiebreaking vote that the leaderships 
recommendation was to defeat both bills for the sake of the 
system he said the compromise involved a convoluted system 
that doesnt make sense in a lot of ways and warned that the 
public would be cursed with confusion 
under the compromise an abortion rights bill permitting 
unrestricted abortions during the early stages of pregnancy would 
have become law voters would have been able to call a referendum 
on the law in november through a petition drive 
if voters then rejected it in the referendum then a bill 
sponsored by antiabortion senators would have become law unless 
it also was defeated by voters that bill would have allowed 
abortions in cases of rape or incest to protect the mothers life 
or if the pregnancy would produce serious and adverse effects on 
the womans health 
the compromise required that both measures be passed by the 
house and signed by the governor if one of the measures was 
rejected the other one aldo would have died but the committee 
vote made all that moot 
in agana guam us district judge alex munson issued a 
temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the territorys 
new law a few hours after a group of guam residents and medical 
groups filed a classaction lawsuit he scheduled a hearing for 
monday on whether to extend his order 
the plaintiffs included maria doe a guam woman who is eight 
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion the guam society of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the guam nurses association an 
episcopal priest and three doctors 
defendants include gov joseph ada who signed the bill into law 
monday and territorial attorney general elizabeth 
barrettanderson who advised the legislature that the bill was 
unconstitutional before it was approved 
rachael pine staff attorney for the american civil liberties 
unions reproductive freedom project in new york said the lawsuit 
cites violation of constitutional guarantees of right to privacy 
due process free speech equal protection guarantees of religious 
freedoms and freedom from slavery 
guams law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers 
the life of the mother it makes it a felony to perform abortion or 
aid in the procedure and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or 
have an abortion or for a person to solicit a woman to have an 
abortion 
the law provides for a referendum on the nov 6 ballot for guam 
voters to decide whether to retain or reject the law 
guams law is more restrictive than the bill passed by the idaho 
legislature 
the idaho bill would ban abortion except in cases of 
nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if the victim 
is younger than 18 severe fetal deformity or threat to the 
mothers life or physical health it would ban more than 90 percent 
of the 1500 abortions performed in idaho annually 
idaho was one of the first states to give women their rights 
and now they want to take them away from us said 15yearold 
michele may one of those protesting at the governors office in 
boise we cant let them do that 
if andrus signs the bill the law would take effect july 1 and 
abortion rights groups have promised a quick court challenge the

a state senate compromise to end an 
eightday filibuster over an abortion rights bill was narrowly 
rejected by a state house committee friday night 
because of house leadership opposition the action by the 
environmental matters committee most likely ends for the 1990 
session an abortion debate that has dominated the deliberations of 
the maryland general assembly for several weeks 
the senate approved the compromise earlier in the day agreeing 
to pass both a prochoice bill and a more restrictive measure 
favored by abortion opponents lawmakers expected that at least one 
of the bills would be petitioned to a referendum which would 
essentially give voters the final say on the issue 
normally friday nights 13to12 vote by house environmental 
matters would doom the compromise however there was at least a 
possibility that an attempt to revive the proposal would be made on 
the house floor which was to meet later friday night 
another possibility would be for a move from the floor to revive 
the prochoice bill only approve it and pass it back to the 
senate which would then have to deal with the abortion issue again 
but the house democratic leadership was opposed to any revival 
attempt 
john s arnick chairman of environmental matters told that 
panel before he cast the tiebreaking vote that the leaderships 
recommendation was to defeat both bills for the sake of the

hydrogen gas building up in nuclear waste 
storage tanks at the hanford nuclear reservation could explode 
possibly spewing radioactivity into the atmosphere the us 
department of energy warned friday 
the hydrogen buildup has been spotted in 20 storage tanks at 
hanford and is the result of the decomposition of organic wastes 
introduced into the tanks in the 1970s said hanford manager mike 
lawrence 
the wastes in the form of a slurry with a surface crust that 
traps gases underneath are byproducts of production of nuclear 
weapons materials at hanford 
the chance of an explosion is low lawrence insisted friday but 
added scientists do not know enough about the problem to rule it 
out 
we taken every precaution we can think of but i cant give you 
an absolute guarantee lawrence told a hastily called news 
conference 
the worst case is any explosion that could cause the dome to 
collapse and send the contents up to the air he said i cant 
sit here and say its not going to happen 
the tanks are built of 1footthick reinforced steel and 
concrete and are buried under six to eight feet of dirt 
there has never been a storage tank explosion at hanford but 
nuclear waste storage tanks have apparently exploded in the soviet 
union a 1989 tass report said 10000 people were evacuated after a 
1957 explosion but other reports of the 1957 accident indicated 
that hundreds had died 
the hanford danger came to light in a study performed by the 
westinghouse hanford co main doe contractor at the reservation 
the study was prompted by concerns raised by congress late last 
year about the possibility of ferrocyanide exploding in the tanks 
ferrocyanide was added to the liquid waste stream from 19541975 
to concentrate the waste and produce additional storage space in 
the tanks 
while the ferrocyanide threat was ultimately ruled to be very 
low scientists discovered that hydrogen gas buildup in the tanks 
was a greater danger than previously thought lawrence said 
he said he first learned of the studys conclusions thursday no 
copy of the study was immediately available 
one of the newer doubleshell storage tanks is of particular 
concern lawrence said that milliongallon tank known as 101sy 
has seen its waste level rise and fall by as much as 33 inches 
because of hydrogen gas buildup he said 
hydrogen concentration in the tank has been measured at as much 
as 5 percent at an exhaust vent and may have been higher elsewhere 
in the tank lawrence said 
a 5 percent hydrogen buildup is considered potentially 
flammable while an 18 percent buildup is considered potentially 
explosive he said 
the waste rise was first noticed in 1977 and scientists since 
1984 have tried various methods to reduce the tanks gas buildup 
including injecting water into the slurry and lancing the surface 
crust with pipes to relieve pressure none of those measures 
worked lawrence said 
hanford workers have now stopped all transfers of waste in or 
out of the tank and conduct no maintenance work that would create 
heat or sparks in the area he said 
lesser hydrogen buildup has also been spotted in four other 
doubleshell tanks and in 15 of the older singleshell storage 
tanks he said 
in addition to hydrogen the decomposition of the organic wastes 
is producing nitrous oxides and nitrogen with the combination of 
gases increasing the risk doe said 
scientists will not have a plan for dealing with the problem 
until june lawrence said but added the explosion danger is not 
imminent and precautions are being taken 
the storage tanks contain a mixture of wastes the organics were 
added in the 1970s when they were used as solvents to recover 
radioactive strontium from some of the taks lawrence said 
while past analysis of the possiblity of a hydrogen explosion 
has indicated that the giant tanks would remain intact and contain 
their radioactivity lawrence stressed that hanford scientists will 
conduct new studies because they feel the new danger is greater 
than that previously analyzed 
westinghouse scientists are seeking outside help from industry 
experts with experience in fire and explosion prevention doe said 
the ferrocyanide investigations were prompted by sen john 
glenn dohio who last year released a 1984 report raising the 
possibility of explosions in the tanks

a compromise has been worked out to avert 
the collapse of the 5monthold mixed cabinet of moslems and 
christians over an attempt to arrest the central bank governor 
prime minister salim hoss said thursday 
his statement came after president elias hrawis office said 
interior minister elias khazen offered his letter of resignation 
late wednesday 
the president decided to keep the letter of resignation 
hrawis office said without specifying if khazen would remain in 
the post 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the presidents neither accepting or rejecting the resignation was 
a facesaving exit for both khazen and hoss 
any other decision would have toppled the government had 
khazens resignation been accepted several ministers would have 
resigned in solidarity with him had it been rejected hoss would 
have resigned he explained 
hoss demanded the resignation after khazen sent police to arrest 
bank governor edmond naim on march 15 
central bank guards foiled the attempt though a bank 
administrator suffered a minor wound in the brief shootout 
hours after the compromise was worked out wednesday the central 
bank announced it has approved the payment of 15 million to the 
londonbased company thomas de la rue for printing 1 million 
lebanese passports 
the central banks original refusal to finance the deal on the 
ground it received an offer from a swedish company to do the job at 
half the price prompted khazens attempt to arrest naim the fate 
of the swedish deal was not disclosed 
also thursday hoss instructed the foreign interior and defense 
ministries to check out thoroughly reports about israeli settlement 
activities in south lebanon 
salah staitieh chief of the foreign ministrys political 
department said a diplomatic effort will be launched if it was 
confirmed that the enemys troops were building roads or annexing 
lebanese territory 
israeli troops and allied militiamen control a 6to10miledeep 
strip of territory in south lebanon 
christian militia chieftain samir geagea on thursday meanwhile 
repeated a cautious welcome for an arab leaguebrokered peace plan 
to end lebanons civil war 
geageas rival gen michel aoun has rejected the accord along 
with hrawis election as president nov 24 almost 800 people have 
died in fighting between aouns soldiers and geageas militiamen 
since jan 30 
hrawi geagea and aoun are maronites the catholic community 
that has dominated lebanon since independence from france in 1943

federal regulators on friday declared safe a 
genetically engineered enzyme they said was identical to the 
naturally occurring substance the same stuff that made little 
miss muffets curds and whey 
the food and drug administration said it received no objections 
to the addition of bacterially produced chymosin the active 
ingredient in rennet to its list of foods generally recognized 
as safe 
the only two objections received by the agency raised the 
question of whether the dairy industry needed additional sources of 
rennet a question the agency said was irrelevant to the safety 
issue and one it could not consider fda said in a notice published 
in the federal register 
rennet makes milk clot and forms curds and whey and is used to 
make cheese and other dairy products 
it is derived from the fourth stomach of calves kids or lambs 
as a solution of prochymosin and treated with acid to break down 
the prochymosin into chymosin the active ingredient in rennet 
chymosin is sometimes called rennin 
the pharmaceutical firm pfizer inc petitioned fda two years ago 
to approve its manufactured chymosin as generally recognized as 
safe or alternatively to approve it as a food additive the food 
additive petition was withdrawn friday when the safety petition was 
approved 
pfizer uses the k12 laboratory strain of escherichia coli a 
common human intestinal bacterium to make the chymosin the k12 
strain has lost the ability to live in humans 
the gene that directs the manufacture of prochymosin is inserted 
into the bacterial genes and works there instead of in the animal 
the prochymosin solution that results will have different 
impurities but the agency said pfizer had shown those impurities 
do not provide any basis for concern

the federal bureau of land management is 
disputing a senate subcommittees finding that the nations largest 
independent oil producer stole more than 30 million worth of crude 
oil from indian lands 
the agency said it took independent measurements on oil 
shipments from onequarter of the 917 indian land leases involving 
koch industries inc across the country and found just three minor 
discrepancies the company had been accused of deliberate 
mismeasurements to avoid paying royalties 
in a report published wednesday the agency said it carried out 
460 inspections on leases and lease agreements involving koch 
industries both before and after the may 1989 hearings by the 
senate select committee on indian affairs 
on another 42 randomly selected leases the bureau compared 
purchaser and producer measurement records with the production 
figures reported to the federal government and no discrepancies 
were found the report said 
and on monday the osage tribal council said it completed a 
review of koch industries inc purchases in osage county okla 
for 1987 1988 and the first five months of 1989 and found that 
overpayment of royalties by koch were made as well as 
underpayments 
the net amount owed was about 22000 plus 7057 in late 
penalties the council said 
during that period koch industries bought 10 million barrels of 
osage oil and paid 33 million in royalties for it it said the 
discrepancy amounted to less than onetenth of 1 percent 
koch industriess executive vice president for legal and 
corporate affairs donald l cordes said both investigations were 
in marked contrast to the shallow selective and biased 
investigations reported to the senate subcommittee in the 
sensationalized hearings of last spring 
two former koch employees told the subcommittee they were 
pressured to steal oil from wells on indian land the company 
expected them to mismeasure oil from the wells so that koch did not 
have to pay for all it got they testified 
the company rebutted the allegations saying the subcommittees 
figures were inaccurate 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who was chairman of the 
subcommittee was not available for comment thursday a secretary 
in his office said 
koch officials maintained from the start of the controversy that 
factors such as temperature crude oil composition and holding tank 
conditions make precise measurement of crude impossible 
the company also suggested an ongoing koch family feud might 
have led to the subcommittees findings 
the subcommittee heard testimony from an investigator hired by 
william koch the son of the companys founder koch sold his 
interest in koch industries in 1982 as part of the outofcourt 
settlement of a lawsuit in which he and others attempted to gain 
control of the company his brother charles koch is koch 
industries board chairman 
koch industries based in wichita has interests in energy real 
estate manufacturing and cattle it is one of the nations largest 
privately held corporations with annual revenues estimated at 
1618 billion and employs more than 7000

a handwritten 1918 letter from russian 
revolutionary leon trotsky to vi lenin was auctioned thursday for 
27500 an extreme bargain in the view of the buyer a 
california book dealer 
but an original manuscript of drawings and writings by the late 
actor orson welles failed to draw a bid after being offered for 
11000 at the swann galleries auction 
louis weinstein owner of the heritage bookshop inc of los 
angeles bought the onepage trotsky letter and said he planned to 
offer it for resale at a new york book fair this weekend 
it was very cheap i expected it would go for 60000 to 
70000 he said 
the letter addressed to dear vladimir ilyich is considered 
historically significant because it outlined trotskys own plan for 
a no war no peace settlement with the socalled central 
powers led by germany near the end of world war i it was also 
intended for lenins cohort josef stalin 
the days most successful bid was 57750 for a 1663 collection 
of william shakespeares comedies histories and tragedies a 
price nearly three times the initial bid of 20000 
caroline birenbaum a spokeswoman for the gallery said the 
buyer who bid by telephone wanted to remain anonymous 
neither the trotsky letter nor the welles manuscript had a 
estimated price in the catalog but it was evident that swann 
officials were disappointed at the response to the two highly 
publicized items 
however george lowry the president and chief auctioneer of 
swann galleries disagreed with weinsteins estimate on the letter 
we figured it at between 20000 and 30000 and it came in right 
in the middle he said 
lowry said he thought the welles material was the victim of 
its own advance publicity several prospective buyers were on the 
telephone but did not bid and others evidently could not get 
through lowry said 
birenbaum said later that several expressions of interest 
had been received after the auction for the welles manuscript a 
68page collection of sketches and written text done by the actor 
in 1956 as a gift to his daughter rebecca who consigned it for 
sale 
it deals with the bravades a threeday festival held each year 
at the french resort city of st tropez 
the trotsky letter written during the turbulent period just 
after the abdication of czar nicholas ii and the seizure of power 
by the bolsheviks has been quoted in previous writings on the 
period but had not itself been available to scholars of the russian 
revolution 
it was offered for sale from the estate of adele bernstein of 
binghamton the daughterinlaw of herman bernstein a noted 
american foreign correspondent who obtained the letter in russia 
in the letter trotsky outlined his views of what russias 
position should be in regard to german demands that it withdraw 
from the allied side in the war 
it is impossible to sign their peace trotsky wrote adding 
that he would propose instead an end to russian involvement without 
signing any agreement this no war no peace position has been 
likened to the cold war following world war ii 
in fact he took that stance as head of the russian delegation at 
brestlitovsk a month later a strategy that backfired by allowing 
the germans to drive farther into russia the russians were forced 
to sign a less advantageous treaty but were saved by germanys 
eventual defeat

residents of a retirement home for aging 
political activists held a victory celebration thursday the day 
they had faced a deadline for moving out of the stately 
spanishstyle mansion 
the homes nine remaining residents applauded the resignations 
of 10 board members who wanted to sell the home to a developer for 
12 million a deal originally set to close march 26 and the 
appointment of a new board tuesday 
the residents and the new directors promised to press their 
struggle to keep open sunset hall which has been a home to 
socialists radicals communists and liberal religious activists 
it was a very joyous occasion in which we were able to declare 
a total victory to our struggle said jan goodman the new board 
president we now have a new board totally dedicated to keeping 
sunset hall open 
that wont be easy she acknowledged it costs 30000 a month 
to run the 36bed facility but the nine residents bring in only 
about 7200 a month they pay between 900 and 1400 a month 
although some are charged less because of need the home has 
15000 in reserve 
the home has operated at a deficit for nearly 20 years said 
administrator thomas e brandlin 
some longtime residents moved out after the old board announced 
in july that it was going to sell 
but other residents went to court earlier this month and 
obtained a temporary injunction a 20day reprieve of the march 22 
deadline for moving out 
residents claimed the board had failed to do enough to keep open 
the home which they call a special place to live where lively 
discussion music and social activism remain a way of life 
then the 10 board members resigned after it became apparent they 
would not be able to muster enough votes from members of the 
nonprofit group that runs sunset hall to approve the sale at an 
april 1 meeting 
founded in 1924 by the first unitarian church of los angeles 
sunset hall was intended for elderly religious liberals the church 
no longer runs it 
among the homes past residents have been ruben burroughs 
editor of socialist uptoin sinclairs newsletter during sinclairs 
1934 run for governor other residents helped with union causes in 
the 1930s and fought mccarthyera blacklisting in the 1950s

it may have been the bestknown 
500 square yards of the vietnam war the continental hotel terrace 
where spies soldiers and journalists met at sunset to swap tales 
and numb the horror with drink 
after years as a military headquarters and extensive remodeling 
the continental and its shelf as the terrace was called are 
open again and catering to the business crowd 
the continental was built between 1910 and 1915 in the french 
era and initially welcomed a colonial cast of rubber planters and 
foreign legionnaires 
then the americans came to fight and to spend their dollars on 
the shelf every night they were ambushed by prostitutes crippled 
beggars pickpockets and the doeeyed urchins selling flowers whom 
hardly any could resist 
that era ended in april 1975 when north vietnamese tanks rolled 
into saigon 
saigon became ho chi minh city the frenchowned continental was 
summarily nationalized as was the rex a block down the street 
where american officers lived and played 
vietnamese military officers occupied the continental for 13 
years while communist authorities tried to impose their will on the 
freewheeling southerners with less than gratifying success 
six months ago the continental began its fourth life after two 
years of renovations the hotel opened its 72 rooms to tourists and 
the foreign businessmen who are flocking to economically 
liberalized vietnam 
war and its traditional intrigues are gone from the shelf the 
talk on the terrace these days is of investment opportunities 
cheap labor bureaucratic snags and how to get around orthodox 
communist functionaries 
military green and safari jackets are the stuff of ghosts 
replaced by the oncescorned jacket and tie 
the rooms on the three floors above are occupied by company 
executives and deal makers they come from taiwan japan hong 
kong thailand western europe and from the united states although 
americans are barred by their government from doing business in 
vietnam 
oldtimers notice other changes sometimes with regret the 
shelf has been glassed in airconditioned adorned with 
neogrecian columns and crystal chandeliers 
what i remember most about the continental is the open 
terrace the ceiling fans the colonial atmosphere george 
belcher said now thats all gone 
belcher back on a visit spent four years in vietnam with the 
us aid mission 
dao huu loan the manager said the continentals history and 
architecture were of prime concern in the renovation 
these days around the world there is a tendency to pull 
everything down destroy tradition and the beauty of the past he 
said we have made some changes but the basic structure is the 
same 
rooms cost an average of 70 a night payable in us dollars 
and loan said the occupancy rate was 85 percent so far this year 
he hopes the vietnam year of tourism proclaimed by the government 
will attract more nonbusiness travelers 
the most important thing is to improve the service every 
day the manager said he told an interviewer the 120 hotel 
employees receive aboveaverage salaries plus bonuses for good 
performance 
loans governmentrun parcel of history competes with a 
capitalist oasis of luxury its general manager a patrick 
imbardelli calls a monument to the new era in vietnam 
imbardellis saigon floating hotel is a 200room steel behemoth 
that may mar the exotic atmosphere of the saigon river but offers 
foreigners direct dial telephone service french cheeses

most of the guests so far have been businessmen said 
imbardelli the first foreigner to run a hotel in this communist 
country 
his hotel used to be anchored at australias great barrier reef 
but did less business than its owners expected and was moved to the

the investment community is looking messy 
the domestic securities industry has been forced to cut tens of 
thousands of workers since the great crash of october 19 1987 and 
still some of its members are hurting financially 
in the final quarter of 1989 the industry lost about 92 
million almost half the brokerage house members of the new york 
stock exchange were in the red 
the price of a seat on the big board is down the junk bond 
market has just about collapsed takeovers buyouts and mergers 
which helped some of the firms have declined in number recently 
and are likely to continue to do so 
the investment communitys reputation has been tarnished by 
scandals questionable practices and volatile prices the public is 
upset the amount of stock held by individual investors shrank last 
year by 104 billion 
individuals arent the only sellers federal reserve figures 
show private pension funds the biggest bundle of funds in the 
world cut their us stock holdings last year by 20 billion many 
were attracted to foreign stocks 
some big institutions generally friends of wall street have 
been hurt hard as it might be to believe insurance companies and 
pension funds usually the most conservative investors hold 45 
percent of all junk bonds issued 
some of those bonds are selling for less than half their 
purchase price moreover some of the issuers are in deep financial 
difficulty and find it difficult to maintain the huge interest 
rates they promised to pay 
adding insult foreigners seem to be doing ok they became wary 
right after the big collapse in 1987 but now they seem to be 
moving back in last year foreigners were net buyers of 8 billion 
worth of stocks 
more significantly foreign brokers seem to be thriving right in 
the same territory vacated by domestic brokers while american 
brokers hold wakes some british japanese and swiss firms 
celebrate by hiring and expanding 
the future is liable to be more competitive for the domestic 
industry competition from foreigners isnt the sole reason as 
important perhaps is the fact that there are far fewer shares to 
sell than there used to be 
a lot of fee money poured into the investment community via 
takeovers mergers leveraged buyouts but that big money came at a 
big price those very activities shrank the amount of us equities 
outstanding by 472 billion 
it was accomplished through the departure of some very large 
companies with their very large equities gobbled up by other 
companies that substituted debt for equity junk bonds for shares 
not all is lost you may be sure that imagination and nerve are 
still alive in the investment community 
there are those for example wholl bundle up those junk bonds 
and somehow peddle them in a package moreover it shouldnt be 
forgotten that companies that took their shares off the market by 
going private might go public again 
it is often observed that when a broker convinces you to sell 
he or she has made more than one transaction the sale is one the 
purchase of another stock is the second the sale of that is the 
third and so on 
buy or sell the commission is the same 
its the same with going private and then returning as a public 
company there is money either way 
it has the appearance of what they call a winwin situation but 
it isnt because an already wary public is bound to become further 
disenchanted with the whole buisness

at 41 on the richter scale the earthquake on 
the afternoon of march 20 1980 was no great shakes it knocked 
snow off the north face of mount st helens but went virtually 
unnoticed in the surrounding counties of southwestern washington 
nearly 130 miles to the north the line traced by a wandering 
pencil on a seismograph at the university of washington was first 
interpreted as evidence of a tremor 75 miles southeast of the 
dormant volcano 
but on closer inspection seismologists determined the quake had 
occurred under the mountain and relatively close to the surface 
it was the first recorded sign that mount st helens volcanic 
fuse was lit one week later on march 27 the volcano belched 
steam and ash in its first eruption in 123 years the accompanying 
47magnitude quake sent seismic needles skittering 
fiftytwo days after that on may 18 1980 the mountain 
exploded spectacularly the eruption killed 57 people and sent ash 
around the world in an instant 1300 feet of the mountain 
disappeared fully a fifth of its towering majesty simply blown 
away 
the smoking rawedged crater left behind stunned residents of 
washington and oregon used to gazing out at a symmetrical 
snowcapped peak 
it woke people up to the fact that having a volcano in your 
back yard can be dangerous said dwight crandell retired from 
the us geological survey in 1978 crandell helped write a report 
that predicted an eruption at mount st helens this century 
the blast was also a wakeup call for volcanologists around the 
world in the 1970s only two countries with volcanic mountains 
were examining the dangers of nearby human settlements today 16 
countries have active studies under way crandell said by telephone 
from his home in denver 
its clear that the 1980 eruption was a sensation for the 
science of volcanology said geologist steve brantley stationed 
at the usgs cascade volcano observatory in vancouver wash about 
45 miles southwest of mount st helens about 80 scientists work at 
the observatory built after the eruption 
uw seismologist steve malone said the march 20 earthquake was 
strong enough to draw attention to the area but not so unusual as 
to make scientists suspicious that molten rock was squeezing into 
crevices deep under the earth 
earthquakes at the volcano are not unheard of malone said 
they generate a bit of interest but not immediate alarm 
but quakes kept coming increasing in number and strength three 
days after the initial quake uw seismologists warned the usgs 
about a potentially serious situation 
this was when we first suspected we might be on to something 
other than just a small earthquake swarm malone said 
teams of geologists arrived to set up equipment to monitor 
ground movement and the gases emitted each time the volcano burped 
seismologists stayed close to their machines the forest service 
began warning people to stay clear of the mountain because of 
avalanches 
but the scientists were not working in isolation scores of 
eager newspaper and broadcast reporters joined the crush 
researchers accustomed to working in geologic time in a science 
where more is unknown than known were being asked to provide 
instant answers for that evenings news and the next mornings 
newspapers 
i remember being a bit overwhelmed by the media interest 
this was already generating malone said all we had was data 
and some possibilities and a lot of questions 
meantime the ground was moving at postcardperfect spirit lake 
at the mountains foot chuck tonn who ran the forest service desk 
at the lake hung a pencil from a string to show the faint shaking 
the lake was evacuated tuesday morning march 25 
i was glad to leave that morning tonn said that last 
night i dont think any of us slept it seemed like there was 
always some movement going on 
not everyone left harry truman the 83yearold owner and 
keeper of rustic spirit lake lodge dug in his heels truman said 
he would stay on the mountain that had been his home for 50 years 
the mountain that eight weeks later would kill him in the media 
catering to the nations rising anticipation truman became a 
cantankerous folk hero 
another local stan lee 67 owner of the kid valley store about 
20 miles from the peak snorted at talk of a possible eruption and 
accused the forest service of plotting to squelch development two 
days later the mountain blew 
that first eruption shot a black plume almost a mile and a half 
high by midapril the stark gray and brown hollow of a crater had 
replaced the mountains snowy point once 9677 feet above sea 
level ashfalls in the region were commonplace with fickle winds 
determining who got dusted next 
may 18 1980 the day the mountain finally blew its top is now 
designated eruption day in geological survey books on those who 
were there and experienced the power and awe and terror mount st 
helens has left its mark as clearly as the eruption scarred the 
landscape 
i feel fortunate to have been at mount st helens from the 
beginning all these 10 years said tonn who now manages the 
forest services visitors center west of the 110000acre national 
volcanic monument 
it eruption kind of puts me in my place it puts me in awe 
of what can happen 
for crandell and fellow usgs geologist donal mullineaux the 
eruption was right on time after studying dormant cascade range 
volcanoes in the 1960s and 1970s they predicted in 1978 that mount 
st helens would likely erupt relatively soon 
everything we found indicated it was a very young volcano and 
a very explosive volcano and a frequently active volcano which 
last erupted in 1857 crandell said we felt almost sure the 
volcano would erupt and sooner rather than later that is what the 
history told us 
while some public officials greeted their hazard report 
seriously there were also snickers the two scientists said a 
lot of people made fun of it of course mullineaux said 
crandell said he was gratified that many countries with 
volcanoes have since made use of their work in hazard assessment 
including new zealand japan italy mexico equador and colombia 
the eruption of colombias nevado del ruiz in november 1985 
provides an example of how hazard assessment could have helped 
crandell said an assessment had been completed and hazard zones 
had been laid out including likely flood and mudflow zones at the 
town of armero but word never reached local officials there were 
no evacuations and 25000 people perished 
mount st helens prompted gains in both volcanology and 
seismology since 1980 scientists have learned to better predict 
volcanic eruptions by studying earthquake activity including the 
harmonic tremors that indicate movement of molten earth 
other volcanic mysteries are also better understood crandell 
said these include the devastating sideways force of the may 1980 
eruption the fastmoving and deadly mixtures of matter and gas 
known as pyroclastic flows and surges and the mudflows that let 
loose in minutes after vibrations turn snowfields into walls of 
water 
mullineaux and crandell retired in the mid1980s but both 
remain active in research on mount st helens 
i cant leave it alone crandell said

in 1969 and 1970 veteran hollywood observer 
harry shearer covered the oscar awards show as a member of a radio 
comedy troupe credibility gap they had press credentials and 
everything 
they did deliberately what some reporters do accidentally on 
oscar night he recalls we went with the avowed purpose of 
asking the most inane questions anybody could ask of winners like 
have you ever been to new york 
alas shearer wont be covering tonights oscar show which 
starts at 9 pm est and will be televised live by abc 
hes not even going even though he once cowrote and appeared 
in the noted rock documentary film this is spinal tap 
but hell be back in journalism sort of on april 18 reporting 
results of a national celebrity poll in an nbc special spy 
magazine presents how to be famous 
the magazines mission is to poke fun at those in need of poking 
shearer a contributing editor to the publication say the nbc 
show is about the whole idea of being a celebrity in america 
what it takes to be one and to stay one 
the spy study is pretty scientific at least as scientific as 
the research film studios do to discover what movies to make he 
said they go into a shopping mall and ask three people would 
you like to see three men and an alien three aliens and a baby 
shearer knows whereof he speaks having been born in los angeles 
and in show business since he was a tyke his big break was the 
1953 film classic abbott and costello go to mars 
a veteran of saturday night live and various cable ventures 
including his own hbo special the magic of live he currently 
does various voices on fox broadcastings hit the simpsons 
he also conducts a weekly national public radio show le 
show from kcrwfm in santa monica calif 
he may or may not use the radio show as a forum for thoughts on 
mondays oscar festival it depends 
however he says im uniquely qualified to comment on the 
oscar show because i followed my usual policy of not seeing any of 
the nominated pictures 
shearer has an alternateyear policy one year he avoids the 
oscar show the next year hes watching the thing on tv with 
friends just laughing our way through the evening 
because to me the best thing about the oscar show is the 
marvelous bad fit between the jokewriting and the people who have 
to say the lines the writing and the performances come from two 
different planets 
but he isnt against the oscar show far from it 
actually of all the unnecessary award shows that seem to have 
proliferated this is the only one that makes any sense at 
all he submits because its the only one where immediately 
afterwards whoever wins an award gets more money

when the bulldozers came to raze 
mohammad massouds home the call for help went out to his squatter 
neighborhood and men from 30 houses answered 
they attacked the bulldozer drivers forcing them to flee 
paramilitary troops arrived wielding sticks and truncheons but 
massouds friends drove them off 
the battle for massouds house was one of a hundred skirmishes 
that have earned the squatter settlement of 5000 people the name 
zorabad or people power village 
with nothing but our bare afghan fists we took on the 
government and won said massoud seated in his sparsely 
furnished house built of mud bricks that is how we got our 
name 
for the time being at least zorabad is ahead 
in late 1989 the government abandoned almost seven years of 
efforts to remove the people and their singlestory mud houses from 
government land now the communitys elders are negotiating with 
officials to supply electricity 
the name zorabad brings a smile to the lips of many afghans 
whose tradition is one of independence and casual regard for 
authority 
in a capital closely patrolled by military and intelligence 
forces the squatter village on the northern outskirts represents a 
rare victory of the people over those in charge 
zorabad also has a wider significance it illustrates the return 
of president najibs sovietsponsored government to the old afghan 
ways in which local tribes pledge loyalty to a central government 
but retain control of local affairs 
after abandoning efforts to evict the squatters officials 
generally have ignored zorabad 
a new effort to collect taxes is made now and then but the 
people say they wont pay unless they get services zorabad has no 
schools garbage collection doctors running water or electricity 
one city official who would not discuss the situation unless 
his name wasnt used said the governments main desire was that 
zorabads politically sensitive name be changed to nawabad or 
new village 
disputes within zorabad are resolved by elders 
one of the elders said mahmoud explained only when we have 
a serious crime do we ask for police and then they dont really 
like to come here last week two clans had a fight over food 
there were many casualties but we handled it alone 
most residents come from northern afghanistan which was heavily 
bombed during the nine years of soviet combat support for the 
governments war against moslem guerrillas 
soviet bombing raids seven years ago leveled shakardarah 
mahmouds home village 18 miles north of kabul he lost four sons 
his small pharmacy and several acres of grapes 
we had no place to go he said we didnt want to go to 
pakistan or iran so we came here millions of afghans have fled 
to the two neighboring countries 
hundreds of other families from shakardarah came to kabul with a 
horde of refugees from all over the country looking for work and 
shelter 
kabuls population had more than doubled to 225 million by 
the end of the soviet intervention on feb 15 1989 it seems to be 
declining now as some people return home to areas where fighting 
has eased 
when refugees were streaming into kabul demands on the 
governments scarce resources were overwhelming and it did little 
or nothing to help them 
so mahmoud said some of us from my village had a meeting 
and we decided to seize government land 
their chosen site is adjoined on two sides by comfortable 
government housing and adjacent to kabuls dogfighting fields 
refugees from other villages joined massouds people built 
homes and found jobs many now are truck drivers engaged in the 
lucrative smuggling trade with pakistan and others work in auto 
repair shops or as street sweepers 
the government sent emissaries to ask the squatters to leave 
zorabad apparently at the urging of officials living in the 
neighboring apartment complex 
massoud and the others refused and continued to build expanding 
their small clusters of houses into a warren of thousands 
alleyways twisted this way and that small shops opened selling 
dried fruits and nuts 
then the bulldozers came after the paramilitary troops were 
turned back officials arranged a truce in an effort to avoid 
bloodshed that was in late november no more bulldozers have 
appeared 
residents say theyre happy to be left alone but would like to 
tap into the power lines that carry electricity past them to the 
government apartment buildings 
at night when the apartments blaze with lights and television 
serials flicker through the windows zorabad looks like an old ruin 
we call ourselves people power village massoud said 
but our power is not enough

each time the us supreme court issues a major capital 
punishment ruling a blood bath is predicted at the nations death 
houses but execution statistics do not bear out those fears 
california which has the countrys thirdlargest death row 
population is preparing for its first execution in 23 years set 
for april 3 
capital punishment opponents say the prolonged period between 
executions is indicative of americans ambivalence about the death 
penalty they support it in theory but not in practice 
a recent survey indicated 79 percent of californians polled 
favored the death penalty in general but 67 percent preferred the 
option of life in prison without parole combined with a work 
program an alternative not currently available in the state 
when people are given the alternative of life rather than the 
death penalty people will choose life said ramona ripston 
director of the american civil liberties union of southern 
california i think the poll shows people dont want to kill 
people 
states have executed 121 people since the supreme court allowed 
the revival of death penalty statutes in 1976 thirtysix states 
have death penalty laws under which some 200 people are sentenced 
each year 
sixteen murderers were executed nationwide in 1989 up from 
1988s 11 but down from 1987 when 25 men were gassed electrocuted 
or poisoned intravenously 
the supreme court has issued three major opinions in the past 
three years that opponents feared would speed the rate of 
executions 
in 1989 in two separate rulings the justices refused to call a 
blanket halt to the execution of retarded people or convicts who 
committed capital crimes as 16 and 17yearolds and a 1987 ruling 
in a georgia case held that death penalty laws can be valid even if 
statistics suggest they are carried out with racial bias 
the reason that the floodgates did not open following those 
landmark decisions in my opinion is that reason prevails in 
matters as serious as capital punishment said stephen merrill 
former attorney general of new hampshire a state with a death 
penalty statute but no one on death row 
even those of us who favor capital punishment are very slow 
and very cautious concerning its use as a tool within the criminal 
justice system merrill said 
the court this year is reviewing more than a halfdozen death 
penalty cases but none is expected to yield a ruling with dramatic 
results 
americans generally favor the death penalty when surveyed but 
once people start dying fewer folks support the process said 
wellborn jack jr a defense lawyer in shreveport la 
until the death penalty came back and we started having 
executions it was a real easy thing to say im for the death 
penalty jack said 
you had to kill some people now that weve killed them and 
we did have the floodgates open up people dont want to be a part 
of it 
in july 1989 the latest national figures available there were 
2264 men and 25 women on the nations death rows florida had the 
most with 294 followed by texas with 283 california with 247 and 
georgia with 102 louisiana had 39 
texas has executed 33 convicts florida 21 louisiana 18 and 
georgia 14 said karima wicks research director of the capital 
punishment project of the naacp legal defense and education fund in 
new york 
the south is by far the deadliest region for condemned killers 
she said 
we are a more bloodthirsty region wicks said executions 
in the south are sort of latterday lynchings

for 2 a minute anyone with a phone can hear 
a beat helms message sponsored by a critic of sen jesse helms 
of north carolina 
for 1250 a month anyone with a bank account can support helms 
and other senate republicans by allowing automatic deductions from 
their bank books 
in the competition for campaign cash candidates and political 
groups are trying out new fundraising gimmicks and dusting off 
reliable old ones 
it gets intense out there when everyone is asking so 
sometimes being different works said michelle davis executive 
director of the republican governors association 
davis describes the traditional fundraiser like this you 
dress up you go to a dinner you listen to people give speeches 
you write your check and you go home 
the big money in politics still comes from these bigname 
fundraising dinners and from the huge soft money contributions 
that corporations and labor unions make to party organizations 
but some of the newest fundraising methods rely on hightech 
gimmicks such as 900number telephone lines and electronic fund 
transfers that allow fast and easy access to contributors bank 
accounts 
the republican governors group meanwhile is adding a little 
glitz but sticking to basics as it tries to offer contributors more 
than a chicken dinner for their checks the group is holding 
smaller more intimate sessions at which donors can chat with 
governors and other prominent republicans 
we have to do more than we have in the past to add a little 
cachet davis said 
the democratic congressional campaign committee which helps 
elect democrats to the house this year added the preakness to the 
lineup of big sporting events for which it offers tickets in 
exchange for contributions super bowl parties long have been 
fundraising favorites 
the committee hard pressed for cash also is raising more money 
than ever from democratic incumbents who have cash to spare in 
their huge campaign war chests 
the antihelms effort sponsored by a north carolina state 
university professor is but one example of the growing popularity 
of 900 phone lines as a political tool the national rifle 
association started the trend a year ago and quickly raised 25 
million 
kent hance defeated in the texas gop gubernatorial primary this 
month charged 395 a call for a message from his antitax group 
the campaign pocketed 2 a call 
the helms and hance phone lines come cheap when compared with 
the two 900 lines set up by republican sen phil gramm of texas 
the senates 1989 fundraising king the senator charged 25 and 
50 for two 900 lines that gave callers recorded voter registration 
information and details about a fundraiser gramm was holding with 
president bush 
the federal election commission has looked at a number of legal 
questions related to political use of 900 lines which critics say 
can easily be used to avoid or bend contribution limits 
democrats also are raising questions about the national 
republican senatorial committees candidate escrow funding 
program the 1250 a month directdeposit gimmick participants 
get a 25 check in exchange for authorizing monthly bank debits 
that will increase 10 percent a year 
leave it to the republicans to figure another way to con 
you texas democratic chairman bob slagle said of the gop effort 
the republicans have revised the fundraising letter that goes 
with the 25 check to make it clearer that people will pay out more 
than that in the long run and have set up a tollfree telephone 
line to answer questions 
some more traditional fundraising gambits also still stir 
controversy from time to time such as mailings that cash in on 
someones name without their permission 
some 200000 letters mailed out by friends of dan quayle 
late last year sought contributions to support the conservative 
agenda yet quayle had nothing to do with the mailing and gets none 
of the money 
the donations go to the congressional majority committee a 
conservative political action committee that used gramms name in a 
similar pitch several years ago provided such fundraising letters 
include a disclaimer there isnt much quayle or any other 
politician can do to stop the practice 
railing against enemies is another proven fundraising gimmick 
and democrats put it to use with a new twist late last year 
the party jumped out ahead of the republicans by soliciting 
money to counter anticipated attacks against its candidates by gop 
operatives lee atwater roger ailes and ed rollins

the supreme courts nine members are among the 
most private of public officials they wield enormous political 
power but rarely hold news conferences or give interviews recent 
polls indicate only one in three americans can name any of the 
nine this the fifth in an occasional series offers an uptodate 
look at one member of the nations high court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the night before she was to undergo cancer 
surgery in 1988 sandra day oconnor drove nearly seven hours to 
keep a longstanding commitment to deliver a college lecture 
completing that chore seems hardly suprising for the 
hardworking and strongwilled supreme court justice who as she 
turns 60 on monday is arguably the nations most powerful woman 
the high courts first and only woman she is unquestionably a 
figure of historic significance 
oconnor can exert unusual influence over divisive issues 
confronting american society particularly abortion rights as the 
most moderate member of a new but slender conservative court 
majority her vote often holds the key in 54 rulings that define 
american law 
feminists and civil libertarians are disappointed she has not 
wielded her power more forcefully for womens rights minorities 
and the poor 
but her performance sometimes leaves conservatives including a 
fellow justice less than fully satisfied 
few question her energy or independence 
from the getgo shes called her own shots said robert 
jerome glennon a law professor at the university of arizona 
i find her a fascinating figure he said noting she is the 
only justice who ever held elective office and apparently still 
draws on that experience 
she was a member of the state senate in her native arizona in 
the early 1970s and rose to majority leader the first woman in the 
country to hold such a position 
oconnor who declined to be interviewed for this article says 
she averages 60 hours a week on the job including saturdays she 
also often takes work home with her 
she had a breast removed in cancer surgery in 1988 followed by 
months of chemotherapy treatment it hardly seemed to slow her and 
she reports she is fully recovered 
the night before the operation oconnor drove to lexington va 
to lecture at washington amp lee university she was back on the 
bench 10 days later 
she and her lawyer husband john maintain an active social life 
that includes tennis golf and frequent appearances on the 
washington party circuit 
she also organized an exercise class at the court and works out 
first thing in the morning its just part of my routine and has 
been for a very long time in arizona she has explained 
oconnor may have acquired her resilience growing up on the 
familys 162000acre cattle ranch in arizona where as a child she 
learned to ride a horse mend fences and shoot a rifle 
she was thrust into the national spotlight in 1981 when 
thenpresident reagan chose her a relatively obscure state judge 
to end 191 years of male exclusivity on the high court 
my first year on the court made me long at times for 
obscurity she said years later 
her prominence grew last year as the justices once again were 
asked to overturn their 1973 roe vs wade ruling that women have a 
constitutional right to abortion 
the court including oconnor gave states new power to limit 
abortions but she refused to provide the fifth vote conservatives 
needed to overturn roe vs wade 
an exasperated justice antonin scalia often an oconnor ally 
called her stand irrational 
oconnor never has cast a high court vote to overturn a state 
regulation on abortion but glennon the arizona law professor 
sides with scholars who believe she never will cast the deciding 
vote to overturn roe vs wade 
is justice oconnor the first woman on the supreme court 
going to provide the fifth vote to overrule the most important 
womens rights decision in the history of court i think the answer 
is no he said 
a definitive answer may not be that far off as state 
legislatures enact restrictions on abortions that under roe vs 
wade are clearly unconstitutional 
for example the idaho legislature passed a bill last week 
outlawing abortions except to protect a womans life or physical 
health and in some cases of rape incest and fetal deformity if 
the bill is signed into law it certainly will prompt a 
constitutional challenge that could reach the high court 
on many issues critics are troubled by oconnors willingness 
to limit individual rights and limit federal court redress 
nan aron director of the liberal alliance for justice said 
oconnor who early in her career gave up practicing law for five 
years to stay home with her three sons is an admirable role model 
for working women determined to be good parents 
but oconnor has not been a fighter for justice ms aron 
said shes part of a majority on the court that seeks to limit 
and constrain the courts role in society its a disappointing 
trend 
oconnor has personal experience with sex bias when she 
graduated third in her law school class at stanford university in 
1952 the only california law firm that wanted to hire her offered 
her a job as a secretary 
on the court during oral arguments she appears stern and 
straightlaced sometimes sounding impatient as she interrogates 
lawyers with wellprepared questions 
but friends say she drops the reserve in less formal 
surroundings and is gracious caring and humorous 
a couple of years ago oconnor returned to el paso texas where 
she attended school as a child presented a key to the city she 
got a laugh when suggesting that her frightening school 
principal now deceased might not have wanted her to have the key 
oconnor who lives in chevy chase md recently told her local 
paper the gazette that she expects more women to be appointed to 
the court and i hope im still on it when the first one 
arrives she said

the census bureaus attempt to count the 
homeless last week focused attention on the unknown numbers of 
americans with nowhere to live a decade after street people first 
captured the nations sympathy has real progress been made toward 
helping them 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the story of the home that jack built is in many ways a typical 
tale of the homeless except that it has a happy ending 
out of work in the midwest where he grew up jack heard about 
jobs in colorado en route his old car broke down and he finished 
the trip by hitchhiking dropped off finally at the greyhound bus 
station in denver 
i had two dollars and some change in my pocket i was in a 
position in my life that id never been in before i had no idea 
what to do said jack who declined to give his surname because 
he doesnt want his fellow workers to know about his past 
i prayed that night ill tell you he recalled through 
providence or the luck of the draw in a lottery for limited space 
he got a bed and a new start at a shelter called samaritan 
house 
its jobs program helped steer him toward temporary work moving 
furniture as he looked for a job with a future samaritan house 
helped him save money too with budget counseling and the 
opportunity to stay on even after he was working 
these days jack has his own apartment hes shopping for 
furniture hes working as a fastfood restaurant manager and 
says kathy rembert of samaritan house now hes calling me when 
he has openings 
there have been successes in the 10 years or so since americans 
first recognized that thousands of their fellow citizens were 
homeless victims of circumstance like jack as well as 
deinstitutionalized mental patients vagrant alcoholics and drug 
addicts 
at the same time there have been setbacks even tragedies last 
november in boston a homeless vietnam combat veteran was moved 
from the streets to a nursing home after his frostbitten hands and 
feet were amputated 
stubbornly homelessness remains visible on the streets of 
every major city hidden in rural shacks with neither heat nor 
water it persists despite billions of dollars spent for shelters 
and emergency aid despite polltakers evidence that americans want 
an urgent response from the government 
president bush has called homelessness a national tragedy 
after years in which advocates for the homeless accused the 
government of indifference the bush administration has pressed for 
full financing of programs under the stewart b mckinney act the 
main homeless aid effort which congress passed in 1987 and has 
proposed other initiatives targeted at the homeless mentally ill 
drug abusers and alcoholics 
those projects are part of a program called hope for home 
ownership and opportunity for people everywhere bushs budget 
proposal for the coming year seeks about 12 billion for this 
program including nearly 250 million for the hardtoserve 
homeless the remainder would be mainly to increase lowincome 
housing 
the homeless component would provide up to five years of rent 
subsidies for individuals with the stipulation that communities 
match this assistance with rehabilitative services 
the administration is committed to ending homelessness said 
anna kondratas assistant secretary of housing and urban 
development and were going to be prepared to do what it takes 
to get the homeless into permanent housing and to get them the kind 
of services they need to stay in that housing 
some homeless advocates are less than impressed 
its a turnaround of extremely modest proportions from the 
reagan years said maria foscarinis who heads the national law 
center on homelessness and poverty in washington 
the lowincome housing portion of bushs proposal she said is 
extremely small when you consider all the cuts that have been 
made over the past few years 
advocates say a drop in appropriations for new housing for the 
poor in the 1980s contributed to homelessness although hud 
officials assert that spending merely shifted from construction to 
rent subsidies 
also blamed for causing homelessness are the loss of rooming 
housetype apartments to gentrification or deterioration 
economic dislocation when unemployed people move in search of 
work and the release of thousands of mental patients to the 
streets when institutions scaled back care 
last weeks census in shelters and the streets was intended to 
provide a better guess at the number of homeless people as 
estimates now range from 250000 to more than 3 million a survey 
by the us conference of mayors last year found demand for shelter 
up by 25 percent in a year 
those who provide shelter say thats continuing 
seems like its a neverending thing said joe flaherty 
whose shelter in little rock ark found 254 fulltime jobs for 
residents last year and 211 the year before it is expanding its 
quarters 
evan doss who oversees a shelter in port gibson miss spoke 
of rural homelessness we have people in abandoned cars and 
abandoned shacks living without electricity without heat 
without plumbing 
since 1987 mckinney act and other federal funds for the 
homeless have amounted to more than 178 billion according to 
hud with state local and private spending adding even more 
still said fred griesbach executive director of the national 
coalition for the homeless in new york many basic issues still go 
unaddressed 
seemingly large allocations such as the hope proposal need to be 
put in perspective he said 
people look at 250 million and say thats a lot of money 
he said but not when compared to amounts federal officials spent 
on the savings and loan failures theyre willing to put billions 
and billions to bail out the sampls because that was a crisis 
homelessness is not perceived as a crisis 
the administrations response griesbach said has been a 
thousand points of hype 
although public sympathy has run high for the homeless as 
indicated by polls there have been signs of frustration that after 
years of work and billions spent the homeless reappear every day 
on corners 
a number of cities including minneapolis and tulsa okla have 
passed ordinances regulating panhandling business owners in 
atlanta philadelphia and other cities have complained in new 
york a man was charged with manslaughter in the death of a beggar 
he said attacked him and his young son 
do i see a backlash in the country yeah said ken smith 
who runs a shelter for homeless veterans in boston why because 
i think theyre becoming aggravated by the fact that they cant 
walk a city block without being asked for money 
if the thousands of dollars given daily to panhandlers went to 
charitable programs for the homeless some of those who support 
themselves by begging would be forced instead to go to those 
programs and get help he said 
griesbach calls a backlash inevitable after all these years 
homelessness didnt go away and there is a large number of 
people who felt well wait a minute we volunteered we did our 
bit in church basements we contributed to programs like hands 
across america 
how come these people are still here

mario vargas llosa the acclaimed novelist 
has put his prestige on the line in trying to become president of 
his violent troubled homeland 
vargas llosa is the strong favorite to win the april 8 election 
and replace the populist alan garcia on july 28 
why does an urbane international figure often mentioned for the 
nobel prize fight so hard for the mandate to govern an 
impoverished chaotic nation bloodied by a savage leftist 
insurgency 
vargas llosa says he overcame his distaste for politics and 
ignored the warnings of friends because he felt a responsibility to 
those who supported his campaign against the attempt to nationalize 
the banks in 1987 
he organized a rally of 100000 people against the bank takeover 
and told the crowd garcias plan was a totalitarian threat 
that catapulted vargas llosa into the political arena the 
author of the green house conversation in the cathedral 
aunt julia and the scriptwriter and many other works has been 
there since 
the maker of tales about perus jungle mysteries its urban 
decay its corrupt dictators and failed revolutionaries has not 
written a line for publication in two years 
he acknowledges being frightened by the prospect of governing a 
nation that seems increasingly ungovernable 
perus situation is enormously difficult and its going to 
grow worse in coming months he said during an interview in the 
secondfloor library of his home on a cliff overlooking the pacific 
at the same time i think peru has a chance to recover 
precisely because of the magnitude of the crisis he said 
paradoxically a profound crisis leads a country to deep 
reforms when it is a middling crisis the illusion remains that 
what failed was men and not the system 
his nations crisis could not be much deeper 
the output of the economy has shrunk 20 percent in two years 
inflation soared to 2775 percent in 1989 
hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs the 
decadelong rebellion of the shining path guerrillas a fanatical 
maoist group has taken nearly 20000 lives 
many peruvians look to vargas llosa as a savior they did the 
same with garcia who campaigned in 1985 as the president of 
hope and now is viewed as having failed miserably 
it frightens me when i hear phrases like that at rallies that 
is why i try not to make promises i cant keep said vargas llosa 
on the contrary he said i always say there is going to 
be a period of great sacrifice before peru can begin to recover 
vargas llosa 54 preaches that a free market will halt the 
slide into anarchy he contends government intervention has caused 
20 years of economic decline and eliminating the thick net of 
controls is the only way to reverse it 
when the market is allowed to operate freely it produces 
great creative development he said 
campaigning as the candidate of the democratic front a 
centerright coalition vargas llosa has spelled out the radical 
reforms he says are needed to make peru a modern nation 
he has avoided the slogans of previous presidential campaigns 
preferring to risk votes with frankness about the social cost of 
his program 
if i reach the presidency the only thing that will give me 
sufficient strength to do what must be done is if the peruvian 
people have elected me knowing exactly what to expect he said 
vargas llosa promises to sell all 232 state enterprises most of 
which lose money and slash hundreds of thousands of jobs from the 
bloated bureaucracy 
a vargas llosa government would ease restrictions on foreign 
investment to create jobs and would end price controls reduce 
import restrictions and force perus flabby protected private 
enterprise to compete 
i believe in competition he said i believe that our 
national industries should be competitive efficient industries 
not parasitic industries 
he expects fierce resistance by business leaders who have 
profited from government favors and by communist labor bosses who 
represent the countrys bureaucrats 
there are going to be many problems because a society in which 
the state has been the great distributor of privileges creates a 
dependent mentality in people said the candidate who came home 
in 1974 after living and writing for 15 years in paris london and 
barcelona spain 
his campaign takes him through streets piled high with rotting 
garbage where children in rags and mothers with babies in their 
arms beg on every corner where tear gas chokes innocents caught in 
clashes between riot police and striking workers 
he visits public markets to talk with housewives who despair 
over food prices that are 25 times higher than 12 months ago 
the author said he does not like politicking 
i dont feel comfortable with it he said i try to take 
it in a sporting spirit with good humor but its hard work for me 
you need a certain quota of histrionics and i dont have it i 
have to force myself to do these things 
vargas llosas image as a political amateur and his frankness 
about his plans for the country appeal to peruvians fed up with 
easy promises say analysts for polling firms 
surveys show him with about 45 percent of voter support in a 
field of 10 his closest competitors are luis alva castro former 
finance minister in the garcia government with 16 percent and 
alfonso barrantes a marxist and former mayor of lima with 12 
percent 
presidents of peru are limited to one 5year term so garcia 
could not run again 
a majority is needed to avoid a runoff and vargas llosa is 
confident of attracting enough undecided voters to get it 
if a second round is necessary polls show him winning by a 
landslide 
opponents have accused vargas llosa of tax evasion and planning 
an apocalyptic economic program to fulfill his pledge of 
cutting annual inflation to 10 percent 
nightly television commercials predict 30000 percent inflation 
food riots mass starvation and escalating terrorism if he is 
elected the spots show vultures walking through pools of blood 
the campaign has confirmed my worst instincts about 
politics vargas llosa said its a world that brings out the 
dirtiest things in men power attracts men and makes them willing 
to do anything to achieve it and hold on to it 
when he opposed garcias attempt to nationalize the banks a 
group of political independents rallied around vargas llosa and 
formed the liberty movement it later joined with the centrist 
popular action and conservative popular christian party in the 
democratic front 
at a certain point it became difficult to reject this 
candidacy he said it seemed to me unethical to say to people 
after i had encouraged them to get involved that this was as far 
as i was going to say that i didnt want to risk my career as a 
writer 
will there be a novel about this some day 
vargas llosa laughed and said i dont know if it will be a 
novel but if i survive this experience i will have great material 
for a book no doubt about it

antismoking activists say a tobacco 
company is exploiting femininity to sell poison by marketing a new 
cigarette designed specifically for women 
golden tobacco co introduced the brand called ms last month 
with a campaign aimed at career women 
who says a woman wants to be like a man say advertisements 
that show young indian women dressed in western skirts and blouses 
instead of traditional saris they appeal to the female smoker with 
an independent mind a liberated lifestyle who competes in 
a mans world 
one critic taposh roy responds women who smoke like men 
will die like men 
why should a woman have a separate cigarette for herself 
roy asked how is it less dangerous than a socalled mans 
cigarette 
he said the company was exploiting femininity in a developing 
country at a time of increasing pressure against smoking in the 
west roy heads the antitobacco program of the private voluntary 
health association of india 
no figures are available on the number of women smokers in 
india but a government survey found 25 percent of women 15 or 
older use tobacco by smoking chewing or eating it with betel leaf 
women in villages commonly smoke beedis or chuttas 
handrolled leaves stuffed with uncured tobacco but ashis nandy 
a social scientist said smoking is rare among urban women 
pinaki pan of golden tobacco said the company decided to 
introduce a cigarette for women because there was a sizable 
market out there our market research showed that 50 percent of the 
target group bought imported brands 
he said ms offers women an alternative and is a feminine 
cigarette sleeker whiter and milder 
we are not making a conscious attempt to entice nonsmokers 
pak said it is only the smokers especially the career women 
who are our intended consumers 
nandy said women smokers were considered liberated or of loose 
character until a few years ago a view reinforced by indian 
movies that showed female accomplices of the villains smoking and 
drinking liquor 
the social stigma led to women smoking in the privacy of 
locked bedrooms or office bathrooms said padma rao a 
34yearold journalist who began smoking at 18 
ms rao said she smokes openly at home or at parties where it is 
acceptable but still slips into the restroom at the office 
roy said women who were hesitant about smoking in public would 
be encouraged by the ms ads to indulge openly 
the closet smoker will come out and the market is so rich 
that other companies will introduce their womens brands he 
said this is crazy especially at a time when the tobacco 
industry is dying in the developed world 
twelve companies make cigarettes at 18 plants in india which 
ranks third in tobacco production after china and the united 
states the industry employs 20000 people directly and millions 
indirectly 
it is a womans business if she wants to smoke but to sell 
cigarettes only to women is nothing but asking more and more ladies 
to try smoking a direct invitation to adopt cancer said 
ravinder kumar president of the national salvation front an 
anticorruption social group 
cigarette consumption in india increased 400 percent from 1970 
to 1980 the latest decade for which figures are available said 
usha luthra of the official indian council for medical research 
a study by ms luthra said 20 percent of adult deaths in india 
were traceable to health hazards related to tobacco use 
every effort should be made to make tobacco use an antisocial 
habit be it at home at work in public places or at social 
gatherings she said 
she said treating tobaccorelated cancers cardiovascular 
diseases and chronic lung diseases cost the equivalent of 15 
billion a year 403 million more than the government earns in 
taxes and foreign exchange from tobacco sales

when the government gets involved can 
politics be far behind 
maine is spending 250000 this year promoting mexican hot 
sauce scottish scones and other native creations but a small 
businessman who stirs a mean brew of bush sauce isnt getting 
any help 
the staterun maine products marketing program publishes a 
catalog of crafts made by businesses with just a handful of 
employees the state says last years listing boosted sales by 9 
million a recently published second edition includes 130 products 
the states efforts we feel have been very very 
productive said may davidson who along with her husband jim 
sells backyard wind chimes from north country wind bells in round 
pond 
i can think of one absolutely major account that we can 
attribute to them and several other regular accounts probably 
about a dozen accounts in all she said 
dont tell that to paul hagen 
the maker of bush sauce a greentomato concoction said to 
be excellent with quail complains that politics kept him out 
of this years catalog 
what theyre doing is a pretty rotten trick said hagen 
whose oneman operation in ogunquit churns out bush sauce in three 
flavors original wicked good and kinder gentler i wonder how 
theyd feel about lincoln logs 
the state explains it has prohibited religious political or 
sexually suggestive items from the catalog 
but the new book features a picture and description of a 
limitededition miniature of president bushs summer home on 
walkers point in kennebunkport that is produced by the cheryl 
spencercollin studio in eliot 
is that right department of economic and community 
development spokesman jim thompson said thursday i didnt know 
about walkers point apparently the committee let this one go i 
dont know what the difference is 
the state screens entries for the catalog which is sent to 
numerous major distributors who are encouraged to buy things from 
maine several businesses report good results from the program 
judith monroe an author who also bakes and sells scottish oat 
scones at her belleweather business in hallowell said the state 
has promoted her product through the catalog and a tollfree number 
stores can call and helped with ideas on design shipping and 
pricing 
ive had people call from new york and say theyve gotten my 
name from the department of agriculture ms monroe said 
the maine department of economic and community development said 
the program costs 250000 a year 
the program also provides money to let entrepreneurs show off 
their wares at outofstate trade events runs marketing sessions 
and even helps design labels to show that products are made in 
maine 
the catalog includes solidwood furniture musical instruments 
toy lobsters and other products made by the states craftsmen 
theres even mexican hot sauce made with pure chilis by the mex 
restaurant in ellsworth but not the presidential poison 
hagen said bush sauce is doing well enough on its own through a 
marketing strategy that includes putting his name and address on 
each bottle so people who run across the sauce can find out how to 
get more 
democrats often send it to republicans and vice versa he said 
hagen even sent a bottle to president bush and got a thankyou note 
from the white house staff 
i wish he would try it on his broccoli hagen said 
referring to the presidents widely publicized disdain for the 
green vegetable he might like it better

southland corps plan to sell control to a 
japanese company could face strong opposition from creditors who 
must approve a restructuring of 18 billion in junk bonds and 
other debt analysts say 
but the proposal by the owner of the 7eleven convenience store 
chain gets different views from opposite sides of the pacific 
japanese analysts say the deal should go smoothly while some in the 
united states say its shaky 
the exchange offer will ensure a rapid descent toward 
bankruptcy said chriss street a managing director with seidler 
amdec securities inc in los angeles 
southland said thursday it agreed to sell 75 percent of its 
common stock for 400 million to itoyokado co ltd japans 
secondlargest supermarket operator and longtime southland 
affiliate 7eleven japan which itoyokado controls 
7eleven is the worlds largest convenience store chain 
offering items ranging from milk and frozen foods to newspapers 
hot coffee video rentals and slurpee slushed ice drinks it 
began in 1927 as a dallas ice house 
southland which sought the japanese buyer said the deal hinges 
on the companys ability to get 32 bank creditors to restructure 
terms of its outstanding preferred stock and 18 billion in debt 
much of the debt is in highinterest junk bonds used to finance 
the 49 billion leveraged buyout by its founding thompson family 
in 1987 under a restructuring the debt would be exchanged for new 
bonds and stock with a much lower face value 
the japanese acquisition asked the bondholders to put 
themselves at tremendous risk if southland files for bankruptcy 
reorganization street said it is a trust me situation bond 
holders and southland are suffering from their original 
acquisition 
a recent court ruling limiting bondholders claims in a 
bankruptcy proceeding to the bonds fair market value at the time 
of the exchange offer will hurt the deals acceptance by creditors 
he said 
mark yim an analyst with baring securities inc in tokyo said 
the deal makes good sense for itoyokado which is flush with cash 
after a successful introduction of pointofsale systems for 
tracking inventory at checkout counters 
their profitability is among the highest in japan yim said 
that is all the more remarkable because what they sell food 
traditionally has a lower profit margin their cash position is 
very very strong 
southland to raise money for paying debt sold its 58 hawaiian 
stores to 7eleven japan co ltd for 75 million cash last 
november 7eleven japan japans largest conveniencestore 
operator operates 3940 licensed stores itoyokado owns 503 
percent of 7eleven japan 
yim said the japanese company and its affiliate could easily 
finance this whole deal out of what they have right now 
we have been in a consumption boom for the past three years in 
japan and all the retailers have been doing really well he said 
the retailers have very conservative management 
the agreement besides the companyowned 7elevens includes 
southlands six food processing centers and five distribution 
centers 
street said 7eleven the worlds largest convenience store 
chain with more than 47000 fulltime employees in the united 
states and canada is troubled not only by great debt but by an 
eroding competitive position 
they were great pioneers in convenience stores he said 
but in the last number of years they have been a follower rather 
than a leader in serving the customers needs 
under the agreement the family of john p thompson southlands 
chairman would retain a 15 percent stake in the company and 
positions on the board of directors 
street said that at the time southland borrowed 25 billion for 
its 1987 buyout the economic outlook was rosy during a takeover 
binge 
unfortunately in the years since southland has had its 
competitive position eroded its competitive position in providing 
the customer convenience he said 
soon after the buyout dubbed by wall street as the texas 
chain store massacre the company had problems meeting huge debt 
payments it attempted to raise cash partly by selling such assets 
as a halfinterest in citgo petroleum corp a major refiner 
southland lost 2437 million in the first nine months of last 
year company officials acknowledged last november that southland 
would not be able to meet debt payments by 1991 and was considering 
a financial restructuring

a california thrift has lobbed a new grenade 
in the war to lure customers into banks and savings and loans free 
insurance on many items purchased with personal checks drawn on its 
accounts 
the offer by coast savings is akin to services already provided 
by american express co and other credit card companies gold 
cards and a small but growing number of banks 
we had had to do it theres such a fierce competition for the 
checking account coast savings president gerrald d barrone said 
thursday there are more branches of sampls in the state than 
supermarkets 
analysts and bank and thrift officials said that if coast 
succeeds it may well trigger a new round in the customerservice 
battle 
since last summer california banks have extended their monday 
through friday hours opened on weekends created branches in 
supermarkets and even started paying bonuses to customers if 
service lags 
everybody is after market share said dan williams a 
banking analyst with sutro amp co in san francisco if deposit 
insurance works for coast it may get to the point where everyone 
will have to do it 
barrone said a quarter of coasts customers now have checking 
accounts about 200000 in all the thrift hopes to improve that 
figure by 50 percent this year taking in about 20 million a month 
in new checking accounts he said 
purchases included in the program and paid for in full with 
coast savings checks are insured for 90 days against theft loss 
accidental breakage and fire manufacturers warranties are doubled 
up to a year so a 90day warranty is good for 180 days claims can 
be filed through a tollfree 24hour number 
the program begins monday some items such as vehicles 
dwellings coins services art objects items used for business 
and consumables such as fuel and food are excluded from coverage 
coast a savings and loan with 112 billion in assets and 125 
branches around the state is the first major california financial 
institution to provide such insurance californias napa valley 
bank and valley national bank of arizona offer the service 
barrone said coast pays an insurance company 86 cents per year 
per checking account for the insurance service 
checking accounts are a cheaper source of deposits than savings 
accounts and certificates of deposits financial institutions also 
try to provide multiple services to customers and checking 
accounts are a good way to cement such an approach 
we try to crosssell its the old idea of offering more 
services like being a drug store instead of a pharmacy barrone 
said 
financial services consultant bert ely said the country is 
glutted with banks and thrifts coasts new program is taking 
place in the context of an extremely competitive industry ely 
said 
barrone said there are 56 financial institutions for every 
million people in the united states compared to one per million in 
japan and eight per million in europe 
bigger banks were watching carefully 
its definitely something were looking at and were aware 
its gaining in popularity but we have no plans for a similar 
program at this time said kathleen shilkret a spokeswoman for 
san franciscos wells fargo bank which set off the rush to 
extended hours last year 
we currently offer the same type of program with our gold visa 
and mastercards she said

texas investor harold c simmons says he 
likely would sell about 1 billion worth of assets in lockheed 
corps technology and electronics services businesses if he wins 
control of the company 
though a final decision would not be made until after a review 
of the companys financial records simmons said thursday he 
probably would pressure managers to improve profits in the 
divisions then sell unprofitable parts 
lockheed the nations sixthlargest defense concern has 
deployed more than 2 billion in assets in the technology and 
electronics services divisions which have produced scanty profits 
chief among the problem divisions is sanders inc in nashua 
nh the secondlargest employer in new hampshire according to 
simmons and his chief lieutenant j landis martin 
the defense electronics company was purchased by lockheed in 
1986 
they spent 12 billion for sanders martin said thats 
far too much 14 times sales and 57 times earnings he said 
annual return has been just 39 percent 
simmons who heads nl industries a specialty chemicals concern 
is trying to unseat lockheeds board of directors at the companys 
annual meeting march 29 he contends current management has wasted 
money in attempts to diversify the company away from its core 
missiles space and aeronautical divisions 
on thursday simmons took his crusade for control of lockheed to 
an airport near where the aerospace giant developed the sr71 
blackbird spy plane and stealth fighter 
i dont consider myself a corporate raider i consider myself 
a corporate builder said simmons who has spent 530 million 
buying about 19 percent of lockheeds stock and so far has lost 
about 100 million on that investment 
despite the loss and problems facing defense contractors as 
world tensions ease simmons maintained he was a long term investor 
in lockheed 
he purchased his stock at an average share price of 44 
lockheed closed thursday up 25 cents at 3562 on the new york 
stock exchange 
simmons told reporters it was absolutely false his only 
interest in lockheed was seeing his share price rise enough to get 
out without losing money thats not my record he said 
the news conference held near the supersecret skunk works 
where lockheed became famous for developing secret military planes 
was the latest in a nationwide series for simmons he has argued 
his case before securities analysts in new york and reporters in 
georgia and new england where lockheed is a big employer 
lockheed chairman daniel tellep has criticized simmons who also 
controls sugar and oil and gas servicing companies as having no 
experience in aerospace and no clear vision for lockheed 
simmons contends he had no experience in earlier businesses he 
purchased but had made them profitable by concentrating on 
maximizing profits instead of emphasizing sales 
tellep has acknowledged that lockheed has concentrated on 
increasing revenue in recent years he has said he and his top 
managers now are focusing on profits instead

pinnacle west capital corp said it injected 
about 465 million into merabank federal savings bank and was 
released from obligations from its 1986 purchase of the savings and 
loan 
richard snell chairman of the 7 billion holding company said 
thursday the transfer of funds including interest consisted of 
about 310 million in cash and a 155 million unsecured note 
payable in 12 years 
he said the infusion ended pinnacle wests obligation to 
merabank which federal regulators seized jan 31 
we have now put the merabank issue behind us this ends a very 
difficult period for pinnacle west and our shareholders but is only 
the beginning of the companys recovery plan snell said in a 
statement 
pinnacle west bought merabank in december 1986 before it got 
rid of the states largest thrift it was forced to restructure 
676 million in debt 
the sampl known as merabank before the resolution trust corp 
took over lost over 200 million in both 1988 and 1989 leading to 
pinnacle wests 5514 million loss last year 
last dec 6 the rtc the office of thrift supervision and the 
federal deposit insurance corp agreed to release pinnacle west 
from a keepwell agreement in exchange for injecting 450 
million into merabank to meet capital requirements

company closed an agreement with a consortium of financial 
institutions to provide longterm financing for the 310 million 
salomon brothers inc of new york served as pinnacle wests

pinnacle west previously had arranged interim financing through 
a group of new york banks to satisfy the agreement those funds 
were not used snell said

ual corp has agreed to negotiate an employee 
buyout proposal with united airlines labor unions despite what it 
calls serious deficiencies in the latest offer 
the companys board announced the talks thursday in a statement 
issued after a special meeting in new york 
but ual also said the board had directed its financial advisers 
to develop a plan for selling company assets it said advisers also 
should consider buyout proposals from other parties and discuss 
other alternatives for increasing the value of ual shares 
chicagobased united airlines is the nations secondlargest 
carrier after american airlines it has been the target of several 
employee buyout proposals in the past three years 
the fourth and latest proposal for more than 38 billion was 
announced monday by unions representing uniteds pilots machinists 
and flight attendants 
the bid supported by uals largest shareholder coniston 
partners would give ual employees including nonunion workers 75 
percent ownership of the company 
there was no comment thursday on the boards action from the 
unions which have joined forces as the united employee acquisition 
corp 
uals board said the unions and coniston had asked on wednesday 
that negotiations begin in hopes of reaching an agreement and to 
avert a proxy fight threatened by coniston 
despite serious deficiencies which the board believes exist in 
the buyout proposal including its value and financeability the 
board has instructed its advisers to enter into the requested 
negotiations the board said 
coniston principal paul tierney said the new york investment 
group endorsed the negotations the unions sent a letter 
requesting negotiations we endorsed the letter and we think its 
worth trying he said 
as for the threatened proxy fight he said coniston has filed 
materials we have our nominees for a replacement board of 
directors he said the firm is waiting for the securities and 
exchange commission to approve the materials probablt within 10 
days 
the boards reference to the possible sale of assets could refer 
to certain united routes uals 50 percent stake in a computerized 
reservations system and some planes united owns a larger portion 
of its fleet of jetliners than most airlines 
industry analysts have speculated ual might sell those assets as 
part of a takeover defense 
asset sales are pretty much antithetical to the objectives of 
the unions said samuel buttrick an airline analyst at kidder 
peabody amp co in new york labor unions dont like to see chunks 
of their company sold 
i think an outright rejection of the bid at this stage is 
unlikely under the threat of a proxy fight he said 
under the offer shareholders would receive 150 per share in 
cash 25 in debt securities and stock in the new company 
to help defray the cost of an acquisition the unions are 
offering wage and benefit concessions in fiveyear contracts that 
contain nostrike clauses 
in proposing the buyout coniston also threatened a proxy fight 
to replace the ual board of directors at the companys april 26 
meeting the new york investor group owns 118 percent of uals 
outstanding stock 
if the unions are successful they likely would dump ual 
chairman stephen wolf who has irked some union leaders with his 
hardline bargaining tactics and lucrative personal compensation 
arrangement 
airline industry analysts are divided on the chances of ual 
employees acquiring the company which has been at the center of 
control struggles for more than seven months 
ual stock fell 1 to 152 a share thursday on the new york stock 
exchange the boards announcement was made after the market closed

the worldwide publisher of newsweek magazine 
plans to retire at the end of the year while a murdoch magazines 
executive was named to head newsweeks us edition 
howard w smith said thursday that peter w eldredge an 
executive with murdoch magazines would become publisher of the 
us edition of newsweek on april 2 
eldredge and peter luffman president of newsweek international 
each will report directly to newsweek president alan g spoon with 
no new worldwide publisher to be named 
the newsweekly which is owned by the washington post co is in 
a fierce battle with time and us news amp world report for 
advertising and circulation 
newsweeks circulation was 32 million at the end of 1989 which 
puts it between time at 43 million and us news amp world report at 
22 million its ad revenues rose 5 percent to a record 2538 
million last year according to a spokeswoman for the publication 
in a telephone interview smith 55 said he has worked for 
newsweek for 25 years and decided last year that 25 years is 
enough he said he planned to retire to a ranch he owns in 
nacogdoches texas but will remain a consultant to the magazine 
howard smith is a oneofakind spoon said in a statement 
his contributions to newsweeks success have been both 
farranging and of fundamental importance we will miss him 
greatly 
smith took over as worldwide publisher at newsweek in september 
1988 after running the international division for five years 
by announcing his retirement nine months in advance smith will 
be able to provide some guidance to eldredge who has been vice 
president for group sales at murdoch magazines a unit of news 
corp ltd of australia 
eldredge 45 said he has no immediate plans to make any changes 
at newsweek it is one of the best edited and best designed 
publications around he said in a telephone interview 
the post of us publisher has been vacant during smiths tenure 
as worldwide publisher 
one of the problems newsweek faces in competing for ad revenue 
is that time is one of several publications of time warner inc and 
times ad salesmen are able to offer packages of space in all of 
them 
washington post co owns four television stations several cable 
tv systems and the washington post newspaper 
i think there is an opportunity there to sell ad packages 
involving two or more of those properties eldredge said it is 
something we have to explore 
eldredge joined news corps us publishing arm news america 
publishing inc in 1984 as advertising director of new york 
magazine he was publisher of star magazine from 1985 to 1987 and 
publisher of premiere magazine from its debut in 1987 to earlier 
this year 
prior to joining news america he worked at sport new times and 
money magazines

response to an oil spill as big as the one 
that polluted prince william sound alaska a year ago wouldnt be 
much better today than it was then officials say 
we dont believe recovery capability is where it should be 
larry dietrick of the alaska department of environmental 
conservation told a congressional hearing thursday 
cm harrison executive vice president of exxon corp said his 
company is concentrating on spill prevention but also has upgraded 
response procedures 
however he said he couldnt guarantee that an 11milliongallon 
spill like that from the tanker exxon valdez on march 24 1990 
would be fully recovered or kept off the shore 
walter parker chairman of the alaska oil spill commission said 
protection against spill damage was better in 1977 than it is now 
the three men and coast guard rear adm joel sipes appeared 
before the house interior subcommittee on water power and offshore 
energy resources which is investigating whether any improvements 
have been made since the spill 
dietrick said alyeska pipeline service co the company 
responsible for managing spills in prince william sound says it 
can do a complete cleanup on a 2000 barrel spill within 48 hours 
the department of conservation is asking for a 48hour cleanup 
capability for a much larger minimum spill of at least 250000 
barrels the size of the exxon valdez disaster said dietrick he 
said the alaska legislature is considering a bill requiring a plan 
for handling very large spills 
more than half of the oil lost by the exxon valdez still soils 
the waters and shores of the oncepristine sound according to 
estimates by dietricks department 
harrison said exxon which has already spent 2 billion trying 
to restore the area would resume cleanup in early may he could 
not estimate the final cost 
the company official said workers would be picking up tarballs 
and oil debris diminishing oil sheens and using a process called 
bioremediation through which fertilizer is applied to the shore to 
enhance growth of naturally occurring organisms that speed the 
breakdown of the oil 
harrison said other more intrusive techniques such as spot 
hotwater washing and tilling may be used in some places he said 
the methods will require fewer workers than last year and were 
recommended by scientists 
sipes said the coast guard has made a national effort to 
incorporate lessons learned from the exxon valdez spill 
the coast guard is installing better equipment instituting 
new procedures and increasing research and development in marine 
environmental protection he said 
the controversy over whether double hulls and double bottoms on 
oil tankers would be better protection against spills surfaced 
during the hearing 
exxon spent 30 million to repair the hull of the exxon valdez 
but did not include a double hull rep james mcdermott dwash 
noted 
harrison said the tanker was not designed originally for a 
double hull and did not have the structural integrity to support 
a double hull design 
a housesenate conference committee is trying to find a 
compromise between two bills on oil spill liability that have been 
passed and are wrestling with the double hulldouble bottom issue 
the house version would require double hulls and double bottoms 
the senate says other procedures of equal safety value could be 
used 
two environmental groups the natural resources defense council 
and the center for marine conservation released separate studies 
thursday that called for tighter standards governing tankers 
pilots and tug escorts 
the center suggested that the coast guard establish a network 
much like the airtraffic control system to monitor traffic off 
the florida keys and the central california coast and advise 
mariners of danger spots so they can avoid running aground as the 
exxon valdez did

flushed with a feeling of victory after 
three acquittals and a conviction on a minor misdemeanor exxon 
valdez skipper joseph hazelwood says he longs to return to the sea 
as a ship captain 
his lawyer michael chalos said he will start negotiating with 
exxon to regain the skippers job with the shipping company that 
hired him out of college and fired him after his tanker grounded a 
year ago causing the nations worst oil spill 
id like to go back to the sea thats what i do hazelwood 
said thursday after jurors absolved him of accusations he was 
reckless and drunk during the disaster that blackened the rocky 
shoreline of prince william sound 
the misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil on which 
hazelwood was convicted carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in 
jail and a 1000 fine far less than the 7 years and 61000 fine 
he could have faced if found guilty on all four charges 
superior court judge karl johnstone set sentencing for today 
a grand jury indicted him last year on a felony criminal 
mischief and two other misdemeanors reckless endangerment and 
operating a vessel while intoxicated jurors took only 10 hours in 
deliberations to reject those counts 
the state just didnt have the evidence said juror terrill 
smith a hardware store manager 
alaska gov steve cowper told a news conference that hazelwoods 
acquittal on the most serious charges shows that someone other than 
the veteran mariner was responsible for the grounding 
the result bears out the fact that there are other people 
responsible for this other than capt hazelwood said cowper 
who learned of the verdict thursday while touring prince william 
sound by helicopter 
alaska attorney general douglas baily disputed suggestions that 
the state had tried to make hazelwood a scapegoat 
it was always my view that the captain of that vessel is 
ultimately responsible he said 
the normally taciturn hazelwood smiled broadly for the first 
time in the twomonth trial when the verdicts were announced two 
days short of the oil spills first anniversary 
im not used to being in the limelight hazelwood told 
reporters i was a pretty anonymous character until a year ago 
chalos said he would fight expected efforts by the coast guard 
to revoke hazelwoods masters license 
the skippers future also is clouded by more than 100 civil 
lawsuits filed by assorted victims of the nations worst 
environmental disaster 
jim morakis an exxon spokesman in new york said the company 
which has fired hazelwood was pleased that the ordeal of the 
trial is over for capt hazelwood and his family 
the verdict would seem to confirm the view that the grounding 
of the exxon valdez was an accident morakis said in light of 
pending litigation any other comment would be inappropriate 
another lawyer for hazelwood dick madson said even the 
misdemeanor was wrongly filed and would be appealed 
the heart of the case against hazelwood was alcohol and jurors 
said the state failed to prove he was drunk 
juror jeff sage a grocery store manager said the panel didnt 
buy a prosecution experts backward calculations which tried 
proving intoxication without physical evidence a blood test of the 
skipper was taken too late to be conclusive 
the jury felt there were just too many variables to pinpoint 
whether he was drunk at all said sage 
assistant district attorney brent cole conceded his prosecution 
would have been easier if a timely blood test was taken he said he 
hoped the case had discouraged tanker captains from drinking before 
they sail 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker ran aground and spilled 
almost 11 million gallons of oil into prince william sound on march 
24 1989 it killed countless birds fish and wildlife in the 
scenic area and exxon came under bitter criticism for failing to 
respond quickly with a clean up effort 
sage said jurors concluded that hazelwood was negligent to leave 
the bridge of his ship during an icy transit but he also said they 
felt that all his orders were prudent he was in command 
to this day were never going to know exactly what caused the 
accident sage said 
but he found no fault with the states decision to put the 
skipper on trial 
i think that someone had to be tried he said and hes 
the captain he was in charge

the internal revenue service blames a budget 
squeeze for its inability to answer two of every three taxpayer 
telephone calls for help 
but if you can get through to the agency you have a better 
chance than last year of getting the correct answer to a tax 
question the general accounting office says irs employees give the 
right answer 78 percent of the time up from 66 percent last year 
the bad news is that only 34 percent of callers are getting 
through to the irs down sharply from 61 percent in 1989 jennie s 
stathis of the congressional investigative agency told the house 
ways and means oversight subcommittee thursday 
it bothers the hell out of me that taxpayer service has 
declined that way irs commissioner fred t goldberg testified 
he said the inability to take phone calls resulted from a decision 
by the agency to cut its service rather than the quality 
because of a shortfall in its 1990 budget 
he said the irs is also getting calls from 7 percent more 
taxpayers than had been expected 
goldberg said the irs budget that president bush proposed for 
the fiscal year starting oct 1 is reasonable he cautioned that 
any reductions would harm efforts to collect 80 billion of 
delinquent accounts force more cuts in taxpayer services and lead 
to further deterioration of a computer system that already has 
outlived its usefulness 
the only hope we have of meeting legitimate taxpayer 
expectations in dealing with their government is to modernize our 
systems goldberg said 
the administration has proposed a 61 billion budget for the 
irs up 12 percent from the 1990 fiscal year 
but goldberg said the agency is still suffering from previous 
tight budgets i am afraid that the tax system will continue to 
pay the price of the 19891990 hiring freeze and failure to provide 
adequate training and support for our employees for years to 
come he said 
ms stathis gave this rundown on how the irs is doing this 
filing season 
the gao telephoned 20 tax questions to 29 irs offices and 
scored 1261 responses 78 percent were correct 
through march 17 taxpayers had called the irs 315 million 
times and the irs had picked up the phone 107 million times 
during a similar period last year there were far fewer calls 
193 million but 118 million of them were answered 
processing of returns is 125 percent ahead of last years 
pace returns received are up 35 percent the number of refunds is 
up 167 percent 
the percentage of returns with taxpayer errors or irs 
processing mistakes is dropping from 16 percent last year to 14 
percent this year 
ordering forms and publications by phone can be as troublesome 
as calling with a tax question but once a caller connects the irs 
is prompt in mailing requested items within the promised 14 days 
the agency is not as reliable for items ordered by letter 
members of the subcommittee were concerned that the percentage 
of taxpayers being audited has declined to only about nine per 
1000 returns this year congress may be forced to mandate a 
minimum audit level said rep jj pickle dtexas the panels 
chairman 
goldberg said that with a larger budget the irs might be able 
to boost the current level to about 13 audits per 1000 returns by 
1993 
he noted that about 40 million individual returns whose incomes 
are solely from wages interest and dividends receive the 
equivalent of an audit every year through a computer matching 
program

a tentative longterm grain agreement between 
the united states and the soviet union was reached unexpectedly and 
without any lastminute major concessions from either side 
as recently as tuesday reporters were told negotiators were not 
expected to settle quickly on a new fiveyear agreement to replace 
the 1983 accord that will expire dec 31 
the talks were scheduled for wednesday and thursday in vienna 
an earlier round last december was inconclusive 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter downplayed the 
negotiations on the eve of this weeks talks indicating it was 
unlikely a package would be finalized soon 
but on thursday yeutter and us trade representative carla a 
hills announced in washington that an agreement in principle had 
been reached on a new fiveyear grain pact 
the official signing is scheduled for june when president bush 
meets with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
they just came to agreement much quicker than anyone 
anticipated said kelly shipp yeutters press secretary they 
were just able to wrap it up 
no major obstacles were suddenly overcome nothing like that 
she said the new agreement in fact tracks pretty well with the 
current version 
in december the soviets wanted to add grain prices to the new 
pact shipp said that was rejected by the us negotiators the 
current agreement and those in the past omitted those prices 
weve always stuck to competitive pricing or world markets 
something like that she said when they went into this it was 
expected there would be additional meetings 
shipp said the sudden decision by moscow to settle the grain 
question suggests the soviet union wants to be around a long time 
as a customer of the american farmer they still want to be in 
our longterm market she said 
shipp said there have been rumors of growing kremlin disinterest 
in the us agricultural market partly because of financial 
programs and possible commitments to other suppliers 
the major change from the current agreement she said will be 
to increase the annual minimum shipments of us grain to the 
soviets to 10 million metric tons from nine million tons under the 
current agreement that will guarantee 50 million tons over the 
five years compared with 45 million tons under the old terms 
soviet purchases in most years have exceeded the required 
minimums in 198889 for example sales were more than double the 
specified minimum in the current pact 
howard lyman a lobbyist for the national farmers union said 
the new pact was in line with the groups support of such longterm 
agreements we think its great he said 
john a schnittker a private analyst and consultant questioned 
whether the agreement with moscow is needed at all the new 
version he said is a little more flexible a little bigger 
and will provide some assurance and some stability for american 
farmers 
but ive never considered these agreements to be necessary for 
continuation of trade he said in my opinion we would be 
selling just as much they need the stuff weve got the stuff 
theyre going to buy it when they need it 
the kremlin will have some greater yeartoyear flexibility 
under the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat 
and feed grains although the minimums will have to be met over the 
life of the pact officials said 
under the new agreement the soviets are committed to buying at 
least four million tons each of wheat and feed grains however in 
any one year moscow can substitute up to 750000 tons of one 
commodity for the other 
also for the first time the agreement includes barley and 
sorghum along with corn under the definition of feed grains 
additional flexibility also was provided by giving moscow 
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually 
without further discussion with washington 
the automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons 
although the united states has routinely increased that lid to fit 
soviet needs 
as of march 8 the soviets had bought more than 138 million 
tons of us wheat and corn under the current agreement for 
delivery this year last years sales totaled a record 217 million 
tons 
over five years us farmers will effectively be assured a 
soviet market for at least 20 million tons of wheat and 20 million 
tons of feed grains with an additional 10 million tons that can be 
made up of wheat feed grains soybeans or soybean meal 
although it makes up a hefty share the soviet unions grain 
purchases by no means tell the whole story of us grain exports 
total wheat shipments in 198990 are currently forecast at 354 
million tons and socalled coarse grains or feed grains at 664 
million tons

than 200 suggested policy changes aimed at eliminating barriers 
faced by foreign firms operating in japan a news report said 
friday 
quoting unidentified us government officials the nationally 
circulated newspaper asahi shimbun said the list included 
recommendations ranging from an increase in public works spending

farreaching than the japanese side had expected and amounted to a 
plan to remake japan

talks begun last year concerning the bilateral trade imbalance

shops from competition the newspaper said 
also included was a proposal to reduce the amount of shares that

the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries apparently is considering moving a key conference from 
vienna to geneva after the austrian government canceled a meeting 
last week with the iraqi oil minister to protest the execution of a 
british journalist 
the journalist iranianborn farzad bazoft was executed in iraq 
march 15 after he was found guilty of espionage by a tribunal his 
execution drew outrage and protests from around the world 
iraq is one of opecs largest oil producers 
there was no official comment from opec but a source close to 
the organization said it was very very likely the ministerial 
conference on may 25 would be shifted to geneva where the cartel 
often holds its meetings 
the source who demanded anonymity said algerian mines minister 
sadek boussena who serves as opecs president has to make a 
request to other ministers to approve a change in the meeting site 
earlier in the week ecuadors oil minister diego tamariz said 
the ministers had decided at their weekend talks to hold the 
midyear conference in the swiss city he gave no reason 
the effort to move the meeting was apparently sparked by the 
austrian governments snub of iraqi oil minister issam abdul raheem 
alchalabi according to the source 
a scheduled meeting with him by austrian trade minister wolfgang 
schuessel was canceled last week without explanation 
chalabi was in vienna for a meeting on friday and saturday of a 
special monitoring panel of the 13 opec nations 
the cartels headquarters is in vienna but it often holds its 
meetings in other european cities it had announced at its 
ministerial conference last november that the may meeting would 
take place in the austrian capital 
at that meeting the oil ministers will decide their production 
and pricing guidelines for the last six months of the year 
opec meetings which attract hundreds of oil traders analysts 
and journalists are lucrative for cities hosting the sessions

unbroken after a fouryear strike 
workers from colts firearms division rejoiced when the state 
joined in a buyout that ends the strike and gives workers 13 
million in back pay 
state treasurer francisco l borges announced the terms of the 
buyout thursday to a room packed with reporters investors and 
union officials the state joined with striking workers colt 
managers and private investors to buy the firearms division which 
had been up for sale for 11 months 
borges said the state would contribute 25 million from pension 
funds and would own about 47 percent of the new company which will 
be called colts manufacturing company 
let me emphasize that this is a carefully thought out 
carefully structured potentially very profitable business 
venture borges said the states participation is not a 
bailout not a handout and not a subsidy 
the new companys first official act was to write out a check 
for 10 million in back pay to the 1050 workers who struck jan 
24 1986 about 50 striking workers broke out in applause when the 
company produced the check at a news conference in borges office 
under the terms of the buyout striking workers will be put back 
to work based on seniority and will receive a total of 13 million 
in back pay a 13 percent wage increase and a stock ownership plan 
that will allow united auto workers members to own 115 percent of 
the company 
in return for the 13 million in back pay the united auto 
workers dropped its lawsuit against colt industries for unfair 
labor practices 
the national labor relations board said the settlement was the 
largest in its 55year history the previous high was a 12 million 
settlement given in 1979 to chemical plant workers in westwego 
la who had been unlawfully locked out of their jobs for three 
years 
salaried colt managers will own about 12 percent of the company 
as will cf holding corp an investment group headed by hartford 
businessman anthony autorino 
neither borges nor autorino would release the total amount paid 
for the firearms division autorino said the final amount remains 
subject to negotiations with colt industries borges said his 
office will eventually release the total cost 
the agreement came 11 months after colt industries put its 
firearms division up for sale at the time the division was 
ravaged by a threeyearold strike and had just lost the contract 
to produce m16 rifles for the pentagon 
with no buyer in sight the striking workers won a major victory 
in september 1989 when an administrative law judge from the 
national labor relations board ruled that the strike was caused by 
colts unfair labor practices the judge ordered the company to 
reinstate the workers and pay them lost wages which were estimated 
as high as 40 million 
in november connecticutbased cf holding corp announced it 
had signed an agreement to buy the firearms division there was no 
mention at the time of union ownership or a state contribution but 
both were expected to be part of a final agreement 
union leaders praised the agreement and said they expected their 
members to resume working next week union members will replace 
approximately 600 nonunion replacement workers 
the strike began when workers walked off the job after working 
10 months without a contract eight months into the strike the 
workers offered to return under the terms of their old contract 
but colt refused 
colt was founded in hartford in 1836 by samuel colt the 
inventor of the first successful repeating pistol the company 
later developed the sixshooter the legendary gun that won the 
west 
in addition to the m16 the standard armyissue rifle still 
used today colt makes the colt 45 handgun the king cobra magnum 
revolver and the ar15 rifle 
in announcing its intention to sell the firearms division in 
april 1989 colt industries said it wanted to concentrate its 
efforts on its aerospace automotive and industrial service 
operations

general motors corp is offering a 1000 rebate 
on its new line of three minivans just four months after the 
vehicles were introduced 
the rebates along with a sliding scale of lowinterest 
financing became effective thursday and run until may 2 for the 
chevrolet lumina apv pontiac trans sport or oldsmobile silhouette 
typically incentives are offered on cars or trucks whose 
inventories rise because of slow sales overproduction or a 
combination of both none of these reasons however seems to be 
the case with the gm minivans 
i have heard that they are selling relatively well said 
senior economist tom webb of the national automobile dealers 
association in mclean va 
production at gms minivan plant in north tarrytown ny still 
is accelerating toward a goal of about 175000 vehicles this year 
and 225000 after that 
when asked why gm would offer a rebate on something selling 
well webb said good question 
yet dealer herb adcox owner of herb adcox chevrolet in 
chattanooga tenn likes the incentives he estimated that he had 
a lumina apv supply of about 75 selling days on his lot mainly 
because of a recent large purchase 
i felt like once they got production up you were going to get 
an incentive he said thursday the numbers just justify it 
gms minivans went on sale last october since then gm has sold 
30891 of them with the chevrolet model making up more than half 
we could see that there is a need in todays market to have 
incentives on just about anything pontiac spokesman ed lechtzin 
said because people are coming in and like the vehicle but look 
at the price and say how much rebate money am i getting 
lechtzin said there was some concern that production at the 
plant may outpace demand but oldsmobile spokesman ross ruehle said 
the sales demand is a little stronger than anticipated for the 
silhouette 
chrysler corp whose minivan sales command more than half of 
the vehicles market segment offered rebates on the vehicles for 
the first time between dec 15 1989 and jan 31 1990 
sales of the plymouth voyager dodge caravan and chrysler town 
and country soared during the incentive period since then the 
minivan sales pace has dropped 
what we think is we have been out there trying to sell 
something up against someone with an incredible rebate said 
chevrolet spokeswoman mary mcelyea 
ford motor co is offering a 500 rebate on its aerostar 
minivan that offer expires april 2

the us commerce secretary on 
friday predicted that reforms in eastern europe will have a 
favorable impact on the us trade deficit in the coming decade 
but secretary robert a mosbacher said an immediate impact will 
be limited due to the lack of hard currency available to eastern 
european countries 
short term they dont have the hard currency to do a huge 
amount of buying mosbacher said 
but the goal is to globalize free trade and integrate all 
geographic regions into one trading family 
mosbacher said newly opened markets in eastern europe could help 
bring us very close to a trade balance 
mosbacher declined to discuss prospects for the dollar but noted 
that the us currency is just one component of the trade equation 
mosbacher also forecast the us economy will become 
increasingly less dependent on defenserelated industries because 
of eastwest disarmament he said nondefense exports would have a 
growing role 
separately he said western nations could reach an accord as 
early as june on relaxing restrictions on the sale of 
hightechnology goods to eastern europe 
mosbacher said he and west german economics minister helmut 
haussmann have agreed there must be differentiation on cocom 
restrictions for east european countries and those applied to the 
soviet union 
cocom is the acronym for the 17nation coordinating committee 
for multilateral export controls that restricts western 
hightechnology exports to east bloc countries

ual corps board of directors said today it 
would allow former suitor marvin davis to again purchase ual stock 
raising the possibility of a rival buyout offer to the 38 billion 
bid by the companys unions 
uals board on thursday agreed to negotiate over the proposal by 
united airlines labor unions and an investor group despite what 
it called serious deficiencies in the offer 
the board also instructed management to explore other 
alternatives for increasing its share values including buyout 
proposals from other parties and directed its financial advisers 
to develop a plan for selling company assets 
today the board said it had modified a standstill agreement 
with davis the los angeles billionaire who last year made a buyout 
offer for ual to permit him to purchase ual stock 
rob doughty ual spokesman said he could not elaborate on a 
brief statement the company issued announcing the move davis 
spokeswoman mary conway in new york also had no comment and neither 
would say if davis had a new buyout offer on the table 
ual stock jumped 437 higher to 15637 in midday new york 
stock exchange trading 
in january the board said it would consider offers from davis 
but the agreement had blocked him from purchasing stock also in 
january the board lifted an agreedto restriction that would have 
kept davis from making an offer at less than 300 a share 
davis opened bidding in the longrunning battle for ual last 
august with an unsolicited offer which was not accepted of 200 a 
share or 432 billion the company later accepted a 300 a share 
offer valued at 675 billion from a group led by uniteds pilots 
union and senior management but the deal collapsed for lack of 
financing 
chicagobased united airlines is the nations secondlargest 
carrier after american airlines it has been the target of several 
employee buyout proposals in the past three years 
the fourth and latest proposal for more than 38 billion was 
announced monday by unions representing uniteds pilots machinists 
and flight attendants 
the bid supported by uals largest shareholder coniston 
partners would give ual employees including nonunion workers 75 
percent ownership of the company 
there was no comment thursday on the boards action from the 
unions which have joined forces as the united employee acquisition 
corp 
uals board said the unions and coniston had asked on wednesday 
that negotiations begin in hopes of reaching an agreement and to 
avert a proxy fight threatened by coniston 
despite serious deficiencies which the board believes exist in 
the buyout proposal including its value and financeability the 
board has instructed its advisers to enter into the requested 
negotiations the board said 
coniston principal paul tierney said the new york investment 
group endorsed the negotations the unions sent a letter 
requesting negotiations we endorsed the letter and we think its 
worth trying he said 
as for the threatened proxy fight he said coniston has filed 
materials we have our nominees for a replacement board of 
directors he said the firm is waiting for the securities and 
exchange commission to approve the materials probably within 10 
days 
the boards reference to the possible sale of assets could refer 
to certain united routes uals 50 percent stake in a computerized 
reservations system and some planes united owns a larger portion 
of its fleet of jetliners than most airlines 
industry analysts have speculated ual might sell those assets as 
part of a takeover defense 
asset sales are pretty much antithetical to the objectives of 
the unions said samuel buttrick an airline analyst at kidder 
peabody amp co in new york labor unions dont like to see chunks 
of their company sold 
i think an outright rejection of the bid at this stage is 
unlikely under the threat of a proxy fight he said 
under the offer shareholders would receive 150 per share in 
cash 25 in debt securities and stock in the new company 
to help defray the cost of an acquisition the unions are 
offering wage and benefit concessions in fiveyear contracts that 
contain nostrike clauses 
in proposing the buyout coniston also threatened a proxy fight 
to replace the ual board of directors at the companys april 26 
meeting the new york investor group owns 118 percent of uals 
outstanding stock 
if the unions are successful they likely would dump ual 
chairman stephen wolf who has irked some union leaders with his 
hardline bargaining tactics and lucrative personal compensation 
arrangement 
airline industry analysts are divided on the chances of ual 
employees acquiring the company which has been at the center of 
control struggles for more than seven months

the united states has gained major concessions 
from the japanese that should boost sales of americanmade 
supercomputers to japan us officials said today 
officials at the us trade office said that negotiators from 
both sides bargained late into the night thursday hammering out 
details of the proposal 
the announcement represented the first breakthrough on a host of 
contentious trade disputes between the two countries 
the dispute over sales of supercomputers centered around 
american demands that the japanese remove various restrictions that 
effectively barred us companies from selling supercomputers to 
japanese universities and government agencies 
if implemented we think this will give us full and effective 
access to the japanese government market said timothy oleary 
an official at the us trade office 
under the agreement reached during two days of talks in 
washington the japanese promised to open up the procurement 
process for supercomputers to foreign firms and to base government 
decisions on purchases on quality as well as price 
the market for supercomputers was one of three areas targeted 
last year when the bush administration put japan on a hit list 
of countries with the most onerous barriers to the sale of american 
products talks have also been proceeding on the two other products 
on the list us satellites and lumber products 
but negotiators on those issues have reported that both sides 
remain far apart on american demands to open up those markets 
still there have been reports from tokyo that japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu is preparing an array of trade concessions 
in these areas as well 
kaifu and president bush met last month in california for a 
hastily arranged summit meeting where both leaders pledged to make 
greater efforts to reduce americas huge 49 billion trade deficit 
with japan 
access to the government supercomputer market has long been a 
point of contention between the two countries us firms in 
particular cray research inc have dominated the market for the 
sophisticated machines around the world but have been unable to 
sell their products to the japanese government 
us negotiators estimated that the potential for sales to the 
japanese government was about 130 million annually 
dennis mcgrath a spokesman for cray said his company would 
withhold its comment until reviewing the details of the agreement 
we hope this is more than just a process thing but something 
that will translate into sales in the marketplace mcgrath said 
the japanese are under pressure to make concessions on 
satellites supercomputers and wood products before a june 16 
deadline at which time the bush administration has the authority 
to retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on japanese products 
the talks on specific industries are being conducted under a 
section of the 1988 trade law known as super 301 the 
administration is also conducting discussions on broader structural 
impediments to trade 
negotiators on these issues met at a remote hideaway in the 
virginia countryside earlier this week in hopes of making progress 
in advance of more formal discussions scheduled for washington on 
april 2 and 3 however us officials said the discussions near 
warrenton va had failed to make any progress

in a town where the pork barrel is considered 
a treasured commodity one consumer group says producers and 
advertisers of ham bacon and sausage are going too far 
the center for science in the public interest said thursday that 
it wants the federal government to halt advertising by the national 
pork producers council it says is deceptive and dangerously 
misleading 
it filed a petition today with the federal trade commission 
challenging various ad claims that pork is low in fat low in 
cholesterol and low in calories 
the center said the industrys 3yearold campaign touting pork 
as the other white meat is misleading because it claims pork 
is as nutritious as chicken turkey and fish 
to that barry pfouts director of marketing for the council 
replied were confident that our advertising is accurate and can 
be backed up by substantial scientific evidence 
all we have said all along is that our products are 
nutritionally comparable to other accepted white meats he added 
bruce silverglade legal director for the science center said 
the pork industry is trying to dupe consumers into thinking that 
pork is as healthful as chicken turkey and fish however 
government data show that almost all cuts of pork are considerably 
higher in fat saturated fat and calories 
the amount of cholesterol in a fourounce serving of cooked pork 
is virtually the same for similar servings of chicken and turkey 
charles mitchell a spokesman for the consumer group acknowledged 
but mitchell said the amount and percentage of fat and the 
number of calories is substantially higher for pork 
he said four ounces of pork trimmed of all visible fat 
averaged 148 grams or 13 percent fat while an identical serving 
of skinless chicken averages 84 grams or 74 percent fat turkey 
weighed in at 29 grams or 26 percent fat per serving according 
to mitchell 
similar servings of pork chicken and turkey contain 264 
calories 215 calories and 171 calories respectively said 
mitchell 
the science center said the ads also violate agriculture 
department requirements that average servings of lowfat foods 
must be 10 percent or less fat to make the claim 
pfouts of the pork producers council said the average 
threeounce serving of tenderloin the best cut of pork has about 
the same 140 calories as a similar serving of skinless whitemeat 
chicken 
and mike simpson executive vice president of the national pork 
board said nutritional assessments of pork are based on 
10yearold data that dont take into account recent research and 
improvements in breeding 
the consumer group said that in addition to filing the ftc 
petition it will ask congress to pressure the industry to increase 
its spending on research to reduce fat in pork 
money for the pork advertising comes primarily from the 
approximately 25 million collected annually from producers under 
the 1987 pork promotion and research act 
the science center contended that 70 percent of the money is 
spent on advertising and other promotional activities and just 10 
percent is spent on research that could lead to safe lowfat and 
goodtasting products 
simpson responded that in the early years of the program the 
council may have spent that much on promotion but in the 1990 
budget of 26 million promotion takes up 55 percent research is 
19 percent and consumer information is 26 percent he said

the boeing co is seeking sharegholder approval 
to more than double the number of outstanding common shares to 600 
million but the company said in its proxy statement that it has no 
immediate plan to issue more stock 
boeing has 2306 million common shares outstanding 
what theyre doing is a little longrange housekeeping said 
paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york theyre approving authorization just in case they want 
to use it at a later date 
shareholders and the board of directors will vote on the 
proposal at the companys annual meeting on april 30 
bill whitlow dain bosworths aerospace analyst in seattle said 
the authorization would given boeing greater financial flexibility 
and bolster its already formidable hostiletakeover defenses 
the additional shares could be issued if needed to dilute the 
holdings of a hostile party it would give them one more 
weapon he said 
less than a year ago the stock split 3 for 2 even though the 
stock has reached that level boeing probably will not split it for 
at least another year nisbet predicted 
a split reduces the value of each share but it doesnt reduce 
shareholders investment position the lower price for each share 
following splits generally opens up investment in a company to a 
broader range of investors 
wolfgang demisch an analyst with ubs securities in new york 
said boeing usually likes to split its stock or float some sort of 
financing issue when it gets ready to launch a new airplane 
boeing is expected to decide by this summer whether to build its 
proposed new 777 widebodied airliner 
in its proxy statement boeing said a stock sale could be used 
to obtain additional funds allow the company to acquire other 
companies or adopt additional employee compensation plans 
the proxy also noted the 1989 salaries of the companys leading 
executives chairman and chief executive frank shrontz was paid 
910000 a 7 percent increase over his 1988 wage

general mills inc has begun an 
experimental business delivering casual foods such as chicken 
wings roast chicken and sandwiches to customers ordering by 
telephone 
called bringers the service is provided only to people who 
live in southwest minneapolis and parts of suburban edina 
richfield and bloomington 
the bringers venture fits the general mills strategy of 
experimenting with concepts for several years before launching them 
nationally the company recently opened a chinese restaurant in 
orlando fla called china coast which industry analysts say 
eventually could parallel its successful italian chain olive 
garden 
general mills also owns the red lobster restaurant chain and 
markets consumer food products including big g cereals and betty 
crocker bakery mixes 
the company said bringers is strictly an exploratory venture 
and it has no plans for expansion now 
but we would never be this far if we thought the only place we 
could be successful was in a pocket of the twin cities said 
craig shulstad a company spokesman 
bringers is general mills second try at finding a business 
strategy to serve dualincome families who dont have the time or 
energy to cook at home or go to a restaurant its first attempt 
the order inn ended in 1988 after a years trial 
while bringers is similar to the order inn there are distinct 
differences that demonstrate what general mills learned through its 
first effort 
order inn was designed to deliver restaurantstyle food to 
peoples homes the menu items were more expensive including 
grilled salmon and prime rib and they were delivered cold in 
refrigerated vans for reheating at home 
bringers will supply food hot and its offerings are decidedly 
more plebeian with prices to match 
everything we know says thats where the american public is 
headed said gary rodkin president of bringers and a vice 
president of general mills casual dining and convenience seem to 
be two trends that are very apparent and we believe we have the 
right kind of menu to serve those needs 
by late april customers will be able to go to bringers 
takeout store in the centennial lakes shopping center in edina to 
pick up food to take home the local phone number for the delivery 
service is 941food

car and lighttruck sales by the nations big 
three automakers fell 122 percent in midmarch compared with the 
same time last year as the 1990 spring buying season got off to a 
lessthandazzling start the companies said friday 
the automakers used incentives and temporary plant closings 
earlier this year to balance production and sales levels but 
consumer demand appeared to be flagging as the march and april 
buying season got under way 
chrysler corp led the slide with its combined car and truck 
sales down 266 percent during the period 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler said they sold 
an average of 31918 cars and trucks during march 1120 this year 
compared with a daily rate of 36321 during the same period last 
year 
car sales this year were 132 percent lower than last year and 
truck sales were down 105 percent it was the third consecutive 
10day period that sales dropped compared with last year 
typically car and truck sales get a shot in the arm in the 
spring as americans head for the road but last year after 
automakers offered attractive incentives in january and february 
the hopedfor spring buying blitz fizzled 
the companies may find themselves in a similar situation if 
early indications hold 
so far this month big three car and truck sales were down 96 
percent compared with the first 20 days of march last year 
for the year so far combined car and truck sales for the three 
companies were down 39 percent with a 04 percent increase in 
truck sales offset by a 66 percent decline in car sales 
chryslers midmarch car sales tumbled 299 percent while its 
truck sales fell 233 percent through march 20 of this year 
chryslers combined car and truck sales were down 35 percent 
compared with last year 
gm said sales of its cars and trucks in midmarch were down 95 
percent with car sales down 104 percent and truck sales off 78 
percent so far this year gms cars and trucks were selling at a 
pace 19 percent behind last years 
fords midmarch car and truck sales didnt suffer quite as much 
as gms dropping 82 percent with car sales down 10 percent and 
truck sales off 55 percent so far this year fords combined car 
and truck sales were down 68 percent

soybean futures prices closed substantially lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade on profittaking prompted in 
part by ideas that brazilian soy exports may resume soon 
grain futures prices fell modestly 
exports of brazilian soybean meal and oil have been on hold this 
week while the government implements economic reforms aimed at 
halting runaway inflation in the south american nation 
the reforms include a new currency with freefloating foreign 
exchange rates and limits on bank account withdrawals when they 
were announced a week ago many market analysts said the measures 
might result in a flood of export sales of brazilian commodities 
brazil is the worlds secondlargest soybean grower and the 
largest exporter of soy products 
william biedermann research director with the commodities 
brokerage allendale inc in crystal lake ill said soybean 
speculators sold contracts friday to reduce their risk to a 
reopening of brazilian exports 
there is some concern that if brazils problems are resolved 
they would be a heavy seller over the weekend he said 
the decline in grain futures reflected preweekend profittaking 
and slack export sales of us grains 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in may at 356 a bushel corn futures 
were cent to 1 cents lower with may at 258 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 147 a bushel

state treasurer francisco borges just 
announced a deal to make the states pension fund a major owner of 
colt firearms but hes already talking about selling that interest 
because he doesnt like guns 
what i have is an exit strategy to get me out of this thing 
borges said thursday the day he announced a deal that gives new 
life to the 154yearold gun maker after a bitter fouryear strike 
asked why he would want to get out of it so quickly borges said 
simply i dont like guns 
under terms of the buyout the state will put up 25 million 
from pension funds and will own about 47 percent of a newly created 
company called colts manufacturing co 
in addition strikers would be put back to work based on 
seniority and would receive a total of 13 million in back pay a 
13 percent wage increase and a stock ownership plan that will allow 
united auto workers members to own 115 percent of the company 
in return the uaw dropped a lawsuit charging colt with unfair 
labor practices 
borges who described the deal as a carefully structured 
potentially very profitable business said his distaste for the 
colt product was outweighed by his concern for the striking 
employees and his conviction that the investment would be good for 
the pension fund 
but now that the company has been saved borges said he would 
like to curtail his role in it 
the plan is still evolving but it calls for the creation of a 
new state program sponsored by the department of economic 
development and financed by selling bonds 
borges and stephen b heintz economic development commissioner 
said the new program would help the state save manufacturing firms 
that might go out of business or move out of the state 
although its first beneficiary may be colt the main purpose 
would be to position the state to step in quickly should another 
company get into serious trouble 
all of this is still in the exploratory stages heintz said 
a bill to create the program is before the legislatures 
finance review and bonding committee 
depending on its final form borges said it might enable him to 
sell much of the investment in colt at a profit within a short 
period of time

sun and from increased interest expenses 
the offer to buy debt comes three months before the troubled 
ingersoll subsidiary community newspapers faces what analysts say 
is the impossible task of resetting its 125 million worth of 
bonds 
the bonds issued at 13 percent interest have been selling at 
40 cents on the dollar the reset provision for them would require 
ingersoll to raise the interest rate on june 30 so that the bonds 
would sell at 101 cents 
there is no way to reset them said james rubin who has 
organized a group of bondholders to negotiate with ingersoll the 
interest rate is so high its unrealistic it would seriously 
impair the credit worthiness of the bonds 
ingersoll has offered to buy back up to 80 percent of the 125 
million worth of bonds for 55 cents on the dollar the company also 
has offered to pay 25 cents on the dollar for 51 percent of 1149 
million in bonds that wont start paying interest until next june 
bondholders cant evaluate the offer because they havent been 
able to get information on the company over the past several weeks 
said rubin who works for sass lamle rubin amp co a new 
yorkbased investment firm specializing in financially distressed 
companies 
we think its understandable that company officials havent 
been able to talk with us theyve been tied up trying to resolve 
their problems rubin said friday we dont look at it as a 
problem but as a hurdle to overcome 
ingersoll publications declined to comment on the bond buyback 
referring questions to its financial adviser goldman sachs amp co 
the financial problems hitting ingersoll publications are based 
partly on the sagging state of the junkbond market where prices 
have fallen widely boosting interest rates since the highly 
publicized failures of several junkfinanced companies such as 
campeau corps federated and allied department store chains 
the market also has been hit hard by the collapse in february of 
drexel burnham lambert inc its main underwriter and a key source 
of financing for ingersoll acquisitions in recent years 
analysts say ingersoll also suffered because it paid too much 
and took on too much debt to buy community newspapers in 1987 
analysts said 
since the muchballyhooed launch of the brash new tabloid sun 
which has been spending money on a slew of promotions but has 
attracted limited advertising ingersoll has been buying and 
selling newspapers 
he bought the new haven register from goodson newspapers inc in 
december for 255 million that same month he bought 50 percent 
interest in three newspapers in dublin ireland 
in january he sold 10 small dailies in massachusetts ohio new 
york michigan indiana north carolina and wisconsin 
analysts speculated that ingersoll sold some of the newspapers 
to help pay interest expenses but company spokesman arthur wright 
said friday the sale was part of the companys new corporate 
strategy to sell small dailies that arent near a metropolitan area 
ingersoll owns 19 daily newspapers in the united states and 
great britain and also operates a dozen chains of weekly 
newspapers most of them located in the same cities as ingersoll 
daily newspapers

a greyhound lines representative met with 
federal mediators today in an effort to solve a drivers strike but 
the meeting produced no plan for further bargaining sessions 
according to a source close to the negotiations 
greyhounds chief negotiator anthony p lannie met with 
mediators at the national mediation and conciliation service to 
discuss the companys position on wages and grievance procedures 
the meeting did not result in plans for a new bargaining 
session said a source close to the mediation process the 
company broke off talks in the threeweek old strike sunday in 
tucson ariz 
the company has said it would not bargain with the union until 
attacks on buses stop since wednesday shots have been fired at 
four greyhound buses driven by replacement drivers and a fifth was 
pelted by rocks nobody was seriously injured authorities said 
early today someone shot an arrow at a bus carrying 59 
passengers in cleveland the arrow hit a window on the passenger 
side no one was injured 
unions representing 6300 drivers and an estimated 3000 other 
greyhound workers walked out over wages job security and grievance 
procedures greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus 
service and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for 
which buses are the only public transportation 
there have been 20 shootings at buses nationwide since the 
strike began march 2 the company said thursday 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions in washington 
released its own list thursday saying 55 pickets have been injured 
over the three weeks by being struck by buses hit by security 
guards or in other incidents 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said thursday the violence 
pushes greyhound away from reopening talks 
its impossible to reach an agreement while this violence and 
terrorism is going on gravley said 
nelson said any suggestion that violent acts have tacit approval 
from union leaders is absolutely ridiculous 
there have been no serious injuries in the 20 shootings but on 
the second day of the strike a veteran greyhound driver was crushed 
to death on the picket line by a bus driven by a replacement in 
redding calif no charges were filed 
in the most recent shootings 
the company said a dallasbound bus with no passengers aboard 
was fired upon 15 miles east of lake charles la thursday 
evening the bullet penetrated a rear air filter the company said 
but police in calcaiseu parish said it appeared that a van had a 
tire blowout as it passed the bus near the iowa exit of interstate 
10 
earlier thursday in the st louis area gunfire hit the 
windshield of a bus carrying 19 passengers from st louis to 
memphis tenn on interstate 55 and four shots struck a bus 
carrying eight passengers from chicago greyhound spokesman george 
gravley said there were no injuries in either shooting 
on wednesday a bullet was fired at a bus carrying 30 people in 
san antonio the bullet struck but did not penetrate a service door 
a greyhound bus en route to los angeles was pelted by rocks on 
interstate 15 west of the las vegas strip on wednesday said 
police an elderly passenger was slightly hurt by flying glass 
federal and state authorities were investigating the shootings 
nelson said the union issued letters wednesday afternoon asking 
members to refrain from violence 
whoever has committed these crimes should know that the union 
will support prosecution to the fullest extent of the law nelson 
said these are extremely unfortunate incidents

kentucky fried chickens new hot wings 
have proven too hot to handle 
the pepsico inc subsidiary said thursday it was suspending a 
2weekold national television advertising campaign for the spicy 
chicken product because sales are running 50 percent above 
projections and it needs time to rebuild its supply 
its an absolute success consumers love em said kfc 
spokesman gregg reynolds we just hope people will be patient 
when they run into short supply 
kentucky fried chicken could use a lift as the chain has proven 
a drag in recent months on earnings from pepsicos restaurant 
division 
in the fourth quarter ended dec 31 pepsico said its restaurant 
business posted a 9 percent increase in operating profit to 1143 
million 
but while quarterly earnings rose 21 percent at pizza hut and 33 
percent at taco bell they fell 12 percent at kentucky fried 
chicken 
kfc launched hot wings which are breaded and deepfried chicken 
wings on march 5 the national advertising campaign began a week 
later kfc had either rescheduled its ads or was working on doing 
so the suspension reportedly affected tv contracts worth about 4 
million 
kfc has also ordered its companyowned restaurants to remove 
promotional banners and signs while it rebuilds supplies 
the fastfood chain is promoting hot wings as a snack to younger 
consumers and those who are not regular customers in an effort to 
increase customers they are are sold in two sizes six pieces for 
189 and 18 pieces for 499 
kfc originally projected that it would sell 62 million pounds 
of hot wings during the first two weeks of national promotion 
instead the total will be close to 9 million officials said 
hot wings are expected to make up 17 percent of total sales 
said john inwright director of food for kfc national purchasing 
cooperative inc but he said some kfc restaurants are reporting 
more than half of their sales from hot wings alone

the stock market rose today recovering from 
three straight days of declines 
analysts said the market was bolstered by a moderate gain 
overnight in the tokyo stock market and an advance today in the 
us bond market wall street has marked three consecutive sessions 
of declines as the japanese market has tumbled

that noboom nobust trajectory 
the perception that inflation is under control in the united 
states was one of the factors supporting wall streets recent 
impressive rally it was reflected in the dollars strength against 
other major currencies such as those of japan and west germany 
where faster economic growth has fueled inflation fears lately

general mills inc has begun an 
experimental business delivering casual foods such as chicken 
wings roast chicken and sandwiches to customers ordering by 
telephone 
called bringers the service is provided only to people who 
live in southwest minneapolis and parts of suburban edina 
richfield and bloomington 
the bringers venture fits the general mills strategy of 
experimenting with concepts for several years before launching them 
nationally the company recently opened a chinese restaurant in 
orlando fla called china coast which industry analysts say 
eventually could parallel its successful italian chain olive 
garden 
general mills also owns the red lobster restaurant chain and 
markets consumer food products including big g cereals and betty 
crocker bakery mixes 
the company said bringers is strictly an exploratory venture 
and it has no plans for expansion now 
but we would never be this far if we thought the only place we 
could be successful was in a pocket of the twin cities said 
craig shulstad a company spokesman 
bringers is general mills second try at finding a business 
strategy to serve dualincome families who dont have the time or 
energy to cook at home or go to a restaurant its first attempt 
the order inn ended in 1988 after a years trial 
while bringers is similar to the order inn there are distinct 
differences that demonstrate what general mills learned through its 
first effort 
order inn was designed to deliver restaurantstyle food to 
peoples homes the menu items were more expensive including 
grilled salmon and prime rib and they were delivered cold in 
refrigerated vans for reheating at home 
bringers will supply food hot and its offerings are decidedly 
more plebeian with prices to match 
everything we know says thats where the american public is 
headed said gary rodkin president of bringers and a vice 
president of general mills casual dining and convenience seem to 
be two trends that are very apparent and we believe we have the 
right kind of menu to serve those needs 
by late april customers also will be able to go to a bringers 
takeout store in edina to pick up food to take home

sales of north americanbuilt cars and trucks 
tumbled 95 percent in midmarch compared with a weak period last 
year as the absence of big rebates especially on trucks showed 
its effect automakers said friday 
the nine major automakers with us plants said they sold cars 
and trucks at an average daily rate of 35497 during march 1120 
this year compared with a rate of 39225 during the same period 
last year 
car sales slipped 89 percent while truck sales were down 106 
percent 
the slide in truck sales which make up 38 percent of all 
vehicles sold in the united states may end soon on thursday 
general motors corp for the first time offered 1000 rebates on 
its threevehicle line of frontwheeldrive minivans 
ford motor co already was offering a 500 rebate on its 
aerostar minivan 
when chrysler corp offered incentives on its marketleading 
minivans in late december and january sales soared but since the 
incentives expired sales have plummeted 
chrysler led the decline in midmarch sales with a 299 percent 
drop in car sales and a 233 percent decline in truck sales 
combining for a 266 percent overall sales skid 
the minivan incentives probably created a lot of sales for 
them but pulled sales from march said auto analyst douglas 
laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york more definitively 
the omnihorizon has been discontinued so they are not pushing 
those 
chrysler stopped making those subcompact cars which accounted 
for about 79500 sales last year in early february when the no 3 
automaker closed a plant in detroit the company currently has no 
largevolume subcompact car 
midmarch sales at gm and ford fell less drastically than at 
chrysler gms combined car and truck sales were 95 percent lower 
during the period and fords were down 82 percent 
sales in midmarch last year were below what proved to be the 
trend for the entire year and this year the demand appears down 
from that 
the overall sales rate in midmarch laughlin said still 
reflects weakness in the industry and the fact that interest rates 
are rising 
usually march and april are hot car and truck selling months as 
americans prepare for spring and summer road trips but as 
automakers move incentive offers in and out of the market trends 
tend to vanish 
you look at the first two 10day periods of march and it 
would seem that way laughlin said 
for the first 20 days of the month the car and truck sales rate 
was 96 percent behind last years pace 
since the first of the year chryslers combined car and truck 
sales were down 35 percent compared with last year the strong 
january minivan sales helped soften the blow of weak car sales 
gm said its car sales were down 104 percent and truck sales 
were off 78 percent in midmarch so far this year vehicles made 
by the worlds largest automaker were selling at a pace 19 percent 
behind last years 
no 2 fords midmarch car sales fell 10 percent and truck sales 
dropped 55 percent the smallest decline of the big three fords 
combined car and truck sales were down 68 percent through march 20 
this year compared with last

lee iacocca the chrysler corp chairman whos 
talked frankly with americans for years leans forward and peers 
over his bifocals 
hes just spent 52 seconds of national television advertising 
time emphatically reminding lieutenants in the chrysler boardroom 
that the companys cars are just as good as japans but theres a 
problem 
nobody knows it says iacocca and thats going to 
change 
his pitch to change chryslers image is perhaps the boldest 
example of a theme that has dominated detroits effort to contain 
the foreign assault on the us car market of which japan commands 
a 25 percent chunk the big three are telling consumers to buy 
american cars because theyre just as good as japans 
what iacoccas message doesnt tell consumers is that many cars 
with big three nameplates are now either produced in japan 
designed by the competition or built in partnership with the 
increasingly mighty rivals across the pacific 
general motors corps chevrolet division for example markets 
its four small geo vehicles as import inspired actually two 
of the cars are made in japan and the other two are assembled in 
gmjapanese joint venture plants in the united states ana corral of new 
chrysler cars serving 
as a backdrop while executives talk about the companys cars and 
make themselves available to the press 
in atlanta last week iacocca repeated his message saying he 
wants to take the teflon kimono off japanese automakers 
we have a perception that in the 80s we built lousy cars and 
guess what we built lousy cars he said standing in front of 
some of chryslers 1990 models 
ford is doing basically the same thing with the escort a car 
that wont be a big profitmaker but one the company calls critical 
in efforts to meet federal fuel efficiency regulations 
automakers shouldnt expect too quick of a bang out of their 
japanese comparison advertising or road shows said auto analyst 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york their advertising 
may not make too much of a difference anyway he said 
the crux of the matter here is that people buy cars on what 
theyve experienced and what theyve heard other people have 
experienced brady said it doesnt matter if you think youre 
equal today 
if youve proven to be inferior in the recent past you will 
have to pay a price for that 
japanese automakers themselves fought a similar battle in the 
1970s 
it was hard for them to gain a toehold in our market because 
their products were cheap and inferior brady said 
and they kept chipping away

energy futures ended higher friday led by 
strength in gasoline after a choppy week of trading sparked by 
concern about seasonal demand weakness 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate the key grade of us crude oil rose 39 cents 
to finish at 2039 a 42gallon barrel after a 4cent rise on 
thursday 
contracts for later delivery also advanced 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale 
unleaded gasoline for delivery next month which fell 056 cent in 
the previous session advanced 028 cent to 5766 cents a gallon 
may unleaded gasoline jumped 156 cents to 6354 cents and june 
gained 098 cent to 6277 cents 
no 2 heating oil for april delivery ended at 5546 cents a 
gallon up 045 cent while may gained 070 cent to 5367 cents and 
june rose 089 cent to 5298 cents 
analysts said two consecutive weeks of lower gasoline 
inventories was bullish for the gasoline market and helped buoy the 
crude and heating oil markets tighter gasoline supplies around the 
gulf of mexico became more noticeable late thursday they said 
demand for gasoline is picking up in the gulf apparently 
theres not as much available as people thought so gasoline led the 
market up said tom bentz director of futures trades for united 
energy inc 
analysts attributed the lower gasoline supplies partly to 
seasonal refinery maintenance when big oil companies close 
refineries for annual repair during the maintenance period 
refineries use less crude oil and make fewer fuel products such as 
gasoline 
oil prices have sagged in recent weeks due mainly to increasing 
supplies and slowing demand opec is believed to be producing about 
1 million barrels a day more of crude oil than the market can 
absorb

the dollar was mostly higher in domestic and 
foreign trading friday but fell sharply against the yen as 
investors regained some confidence in the japanese currency 
gold prices were lower 
analysts said a rise in interest rates in japan and a recovery 
on the tokyo stock exchange after a string of steep losses helped 
support the yen which itself has fallen sharply in recent weeks 
jack barbanel president of first global asset management inc 
said traders believed japanese yields would go even higher which 
would make the yen even more attractive 
the dollar fell to 15430 yen in new york from 155095 late 
thursday in tokyo early friday the dollar rose 024 yen to a 
closing 15507 yen and in london it was quoted at a sharply lower 
rate of 15385 yen 
overseas dealers said the dollar was hit in afternoon dealings 
by a report later denied that japan was moving to issue 
dollardenominated bonds in a bid to add a layer of intervention to 
help the sagging yen 
the dollar also was hit by profittaking before fridays talks 
between treasury secretary james brady and his japanese 
counterpart ryutaro hashimoto in los angeles 
barbanel said the dollars strong showing against other 
currencies was due partly to higher interest rates in the united 
states and also to concerns about tensions between the soviet 
union and lithuania the dollar is seen as a safe haven in times of 
international political strife 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
thursdays quotes included 17135 west german marks up from 
17028 15200 swiss francs up from 15120 57720 french francs

from buffalos rusty waterfront to the 
steelmill hulks of pittsburgh a small but growing movement is 
underway to save examples of industry from the ravages of the 
postindustrial age by preserving them as national parks 
the thought may startle those for whom the term national 
park conjures up images of jagged mountains foaming waterfalls 
boiling geysers and other pastoral scenes 
a revolution is going on that i think is as significant as the 
industrial revolution of the late 1800s said eric n delony 
head of the national park services historic american engineering 
record unit were in the process of completely redefining our 
economic base 
in that process old factories canals and warehouses that no 
longer have an economic role to play face the threat of a wreckers 
ball delony said if he had his way sites like the bakers dozen 
of grain elevators along the buffalo waterfront would be preserved 
as parks 
its this cluster of 13 huge concrete monoliths along the lake 
shore he said they are representative of industry in america 
we are one of the largest grain producers and have been so 
historically and elevators are a stop in the process of moving 
grain from the heartland east 
the grain elevator was invented here in 1842 and buffalos 
specimens include the 92yearold great northern one of only two 
surviving brickandsteel elevators and the quartermilelong 
concrete central big enough to handle three lake freighters 
simultaneously and the largest in the world when built in 1918 
buffalo remains the countrys flourmilling capital and half 
the elevators are still in use but concrete central stands vacant 
and the crumbling great northern has been threatened with 
demolition by owner pillsbury inc 
to architecture students from canada and europe who take boat 
tours of the elevators each summer such buildings are an important 
landmark in the development of 20th century architecture their 
stark walls inspiring modernist architects such as erich mendelsohn 
and le corbusier 
it became known as the formfollowsfunction school of 
architecture very clean simple lines as opposed to the 
victorian style which was very decorative said lorraine pierro 
president of buffalos industrial heritage committee 
but many buffalo residents when they think of the elevators at 
all see them as just a hazy part of the industrial wasteland 
i think its partly a fault of the educational system 
pierro said many people said to me theyve lived in this area 
all their lives and never knew where the buffalo river was 
the preservation movement is more advanced in lowell mass 25 
miles north of boston where twin national and state parks 
incorporate much of the citys downtown 
we have a representative sample of the important buildings in 
lowells history said chrysandra walter superintendent of 
lowell national historic park 
we have a mill building we have a boardinghouse where the 
mill girls and the immigrants lived we have an agents house 
where the mill agent and his family would have lived the state has 
11 or so gatehouses along the canal that house the mechanism for 
running the canal 
the park has become lowells main tourist attraction partly 
because industrial new england is not the sort of place visitors 
expect to find a national park said michelle hatem executive 
director of the northern middlesex convention and visitors bureau 
people at first say what do you mean its a park she 
said they expect green space nature and all 
other industrial heritage parks in existence or in the works 
incorporate the lake michiganillinois river canal system in 
chicago the steel mills of pittsburghs monongahela valley and 
the coal steel and railroads of northeastern pennsylvania 
parks have also been proposed for the copper industry of 
northern michigan washington states hydroelectric plants and even 
the cape canaveral space center 
the first step in preserving something like buffalos grain 
elevators is for a crew of students under the direction of delony 
and his fulltime staff of seven to make architectural drawings 
this is a very pedantic scholarly exercise delony said 
ill have two or three students up there this summer if the 
funding comes through measuring and drawing 
the drawings will be a permanent record of the buildings in the 
event they are destroyed but the exercise also sends a message he 
said look buffalonians if the federal government and the 
national park service are interested enough to send a special team 
to your city to document these structures theyre worth saving 
while the federal government is interested enough to spend 
380000 a year on documenting historic buildings its usually up 
to local governments and preservationists to raise the larger sums 
necessary to acquire and preserve historic buildings 
delony who grew up in cleveland and visited buffalo frequently 
as a child said buffalos preoccupation with enhancing its 
national image could be used in the projects favor 
my image of buffalo was niagara falls first of all but the 
other image was these magnificent grain elevators he said

gold futures prices tumbled to 4month lows friday on new 
yorks commodity exchange amid heavy european selling as the dollar 
resumed its advance against most other major currencies 
on other commodity markets silver also retreated grains and 
soybeans fell energy future advanced and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 530 to 560 lower with the contract for 
delivery in april at 38940 a troy ounce the lowest settlement 
for a nearmonth gold contract since nov 10 
silver futures ended 41 cents to 47 cents lower in new york 
with march at 5043 a troy ounce 
analysts said buying interest in gold has faded as prices have 
skidded from near 430 an ounce over the past six weeks april gold 
fell by 1150 in this week alone 
gold is traded in dollars on the world market so a stronger 
dollar makes the metal more expensive in terms of other currencies 
discouraging foreign buying 
but analysts said golds decline in the face of global political 
and economic uncertainty suggests other factors are also at play 
gold traditionally has been viewed as a safe haven for investors 
during times of inflation and political crises such as the current 
showdown between the soviet union and the breakaway lithuanian 
republic 
but instead of buying gold international investors have shunned 
the metal preferring to buy us dollars 
the dollar is becoming the safe haven said john jonat a 
preciousmetals trader with deak international inc 
william oneill research director with elders futures inc 
said the gold market ignored a bevy of traditionally bullish 
developments during the week including rising us retail prices 
predictions for high inflation in britain a sharp drop thursday in 
the stock market and the increasingly tense lithuanian situation 
at the same time the dollar has surged in value 
you can see that the focus here is on the dollar more than 
anything else oneill said 
soybean futures prices fell substantially on the chicago board 
of trade on profittaking prompted in part by beliefs that 
brazilian soy exports may resume soon grain futures prices fell 
modestly 
exports of brazilian soybean meal and oil have been on hold this 
week while the government implements economic reforms aimed at 
halting runaway inflation in the south american nation 
wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower with may at 
356 a bushel corn futures were cent to 1 cents lower with 
may at 258 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with 
may at 147 a bushel and soybeans were 5 cents to 7 cents lower 
with may at 598 a bushel 
petroleum futures advanced in technically inspired trading on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 39 cents 
higher with may at 2039 a barrel heating oil was 45 cent to 70 
cent higher with april at 5546 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 15 cent to 156 cents higher with april at 5766 cents a 
gallon 
expectations for stronger cash markets next week prompted buying 
of livestock futures on the chicago mercantile exchange pork 
bellies ended mixed ahead of the agriculture departments monthly 
coldstorage report which showed a lowerthanexpected amount of 
pork bellies in commercial freezers as of feb 28 
belly prices are expected to rise in reaction to the report when 
trading resumes monday 
live cattle futures settled 20 cent lower to 38 cent higher 
with april at 7720 cents a pound feeder cattle were 08 cent 
lower to 22 cent higher with march at 8265 cents a pound live

ual corps board of directors said friday it 
will let former suitor marvin davis again buy company stock 
raising the possibility of a rival buyout offer to the 38 billion 
bid by uals unions and a major shareholder 
davis sparked a bidding war for ual last august but later 
withdrew his buyout proposals after the company the parent of 
united airlines accepted a higher offer from a group led by senior 
management and its pilots union that plan later collapsed 
ual stock finished up 512 at 15787 friday on the new york 
stock exchange although coniston partners uals biggest 
shareholder and the backer of the union buyout expressed 
skepticism that davis would make an offer 
im not sure what they board members were trying to 
accomplish or what the implications might be said keith gollust 
a principal in coniston a new yorkbased investment group 
gollust said that more than two months ago coniston urged the 
ual board to lift the restriction on davis purchase of stock as a 
way to enhance shareholder value 
i dont see why anyone shouldnt be able to buy the stock 
he said in a telephone interview friday as a practical matter i 
dont expect him davis to make a bid its very speculative 
rob doughty ual spokesman said he could not elaborate on a 
brief statement that the company had modified a standstill 
agreement with davis to allow him to buy stock davis spokeswoman 
mary conway in new york also had no comment neither would say if 
davis has a new buyout offer on the table 
in january the ual board said it would consider offers from 
davis but the agreement had blocked him from purchasing stock 
davis a los angeles billionaire last august made an 
unsolicited offer which was not accepted of 200 a share or 432 
billion for ual 
the united airines pilots were the first employee group to 
propose buying the company three years ago 
the fourth and latest proposal was announced monday by coniston 
and the unions representing uniteds pilots machinists and flight 
attendants representatives of those unions were not immediately 
available for comment on friday 
under the offer shareholders would receive 150 per share in 
cash 25 in debt securities and stock in the new company and the 
unions would make wage and benefit concessions in fiveyear 
contracts that contain nostrike clauses 
the bid would give ual employees including nonunion workers 
75 percent ownership of the company 
the ual board on thursday said it would negotiate on the latest 
offer by the conistonunion group even though it believed the 
offer had serious deficiencies including its value and the 
groups ability to finance it 
the board also said it had directed its financial advisers to 
develop a plan for selling company assets it said advisers also 
should consider buyout proposals from other parties and discuss 
other alternatives for increasing the value of ual shares 
in proposing the buyout coniston also threatened a proxy fight 
to replace the ual board of directors at the companys april 26 
meeting the group owns 118 percent of uals outstanding stock 
robert j joedicke advising director of shearson lehman hutton 
in new york said he did not think lifting the standstill 
restriction on davis changed the buyout situation significantly 
joedicke said a takeover of ual would be so complicated that 
davis likely would have to join forces with other parties but he 
added if he got involved all indications are hed want to be 
more than one of the players

the worlds key cocoaproducing countries agreed 
friday to back a twoyear extension of the present international 
cocoa agreement with all pricesupport provisions frozen for the 
duration a producer spokesman said 
the producers accepted in all details the plan for the extension 
put forward by peter baron the west german chairman of the 
41nation international cocoa organization said producer spokesman 
kouame nguessan of the ivory coast 
but he said that his side at a separate meeting friday did not 
reach a view on how the money needed to implement the extension 
could be guaranteed and needed more time to study the question 
money is required to finance the storage of the cocoa 
organizations stockpile of 250000 metric tons which under 
barons plan would be frozen during the extension period 
delegates said that financing would be the key issue when the 
two sides begin a further week of discussions on the cocoa pact on 
monday 
the european community and the cocoa organizations other 
leading consumers earlier this week accepted in principle barons 
plans but officials said they wanted the extension linked to 
guarantees of adequate funding 
the plan calls for the cocoa pact to be extended for two years 
starting oct 1 with all its present dormant powers to support 
prices officially suspended 
ctober but 
cashinhand sept 15 is forecast at 15 million 
the shortfall is the result of unpaid producer debts to the 
organization totalling 140 million 
consumers have informally proposed that producers should either 
pay some of their debts or agree that in an emergency some of the 
stockpiled cocoa could be sold to raise cash 
they have suggested a token debt repayment of 15 million or 
permission for the cocoa organization to sell 20000 tons if 
necessary

trans world airlines inc said friday it lost 
2985 million in 1989 contrasting with a profit of 2497 million 
the previous year

the year ended dec 31 down sharply from 2593 million in 1988 
it said its operating revenue rose 34 percent to 451 billion 
in 1989 from 435 billion a year earlier but operating expenses 
rose at a 93 percent rate to 448 billion from 411 billion in 
1988 
icahn who is twas chairman in recent months has been pushing 
for wage concessions he has asked pilots for instance for 80 
million in wage and benefit concessions but talks have not produced 
any agreement 
the company based in mt kisco said the fullyear loss 
reflected the sharp decline in operating profit and the absence in 
1989 of 1905 million in onetime gains related to its sale of 
stock in another company and a cash judgment in a longstanding 
legal dispute 
twa said its net interest expense in 1989 was up 1939 million 
from the previous year 
the company said its operating expenses rose mainly to a 
snapback of wage concessions from the machinists union higher 
salaries for other employees a 12 percent increase in the average 
price of jet fuel and increased costs attributed to service 
improvements

sell a norwegian oil and gas subsidiary for 322 million the 
latest in a series of asset sales by the parent of union oil co of

unocal norge is owned by a unocal subsidiary unocal 
international corp legal paperwork must still be completed and 
government approval obtained in norway but unocal said the deal 
was expected to close this may

companywide redeployment of unocals 10 billion in assets not a 
retreat from the north sea he noted that last year unocal was 
awarded seven offshore exploration blocks in the united kingdom

rfampp corps independent directors reversed 
themselves friday and voted to terminate a 385 million merger deal 
the railroad reached feb 19 with csx corp 
earlier in the day the committee of independent directors said 
termination of the 3450ashare deal would not be in the best 
interests of rfampp shareholders 
the panels final action followed the enlargement of the 
committee to include rfampps two new directors jacqueline g epps 
and mark t finn the two were recently appointed by the trustees 
of the virginia supplementary retirement system which owns rfampp 
common stock 
following discussion with the new members of the committee 
the other members of the committee concluded that shareholder 
approval of the cxs proposal was highly unlikely and for that 
reason further pursuit of that proposal would not be in the best 
interests of the rfampp and its shareholders the companies said in 
a joint release 
the reconstituted special committee voted unanimously to accept 
the csx proposal that the agreement be terminated all six 
csxaffiliated directors abstained from voting on the matter and 
the action was later ratified by the full board including the six 
csxaffiliated directors 
fridays decision came three days after csx announced it wanted 
to pull out of the deal because of controversy surrounding the 
merger under the terms of the proposal both companies boards 
must agree to terminate the merger 
after csx made its offer in february numerous stock analysts 
criticized it as too low considering the potential value of rfampps 
real estate holdings 
the deal also was questioned by gov l douglas wilder the 
state owns 20 percent of rfampp common stock through its supplemental 
retirement system 
some observers said the csx bid was tainted by conflicts of 
interest among rfampp directors wilder fired retirement board 
chairman charles b walker who represented the retirement system 
on the rfampp board and supported the merger 
csx argued that the special committee that weighed the proposal 
was composed only of rfampp directors who were not associated with 
csx and that its offer was a good deal for rfampp whose shareholders 
could take the 3450 a share or exchange them for csx shares on a 
1for1 basis 
richmondbased csx operates 19000 miles of track in 20 states 
the district of columbia and ontario canada rfampp has 113 miles of 
track between richmond and the northern virginia suburbs of 
washington dc both companies also have extensive commercial real 
estate interests

lockheed corp fired back at its chief 
assailant friday saying now is a bad time to sell assets from the 
military contractors technology services and electronics systems 
groups 
texas investor harold c simmons proposals to do so are 
simplistic and show how poorly simmons understands lockheed 
the aerospace giants chairman daniel m tellep said in a 
statement 
simmons is trying to unseat lockheeds board of directors at the 
companys annual meeting march 29 he has purchased about 19 
percent of lockheeds stock at a cost of 530 million and has 
shown a paper loss of about 100 million on his investment as the 
stock price has fallen 
he said thursday that if he wins control of lockheed he likely 
would sell 1 billion worth of assets in its technology and 
electronics services businesses sales he said would help boost 
the stock price simmons said lockheed should concentrate on the 
core business it knows missiles space and aeronautics 
though no final decision would be made until after a review of 
the books simmons said telleps public statements lead him to 
believe that only small portions of the noncore divisions are 
profitable enough to merit keeping 
tellep said simmons is fundamentally uninformed about the 
technology services and electronics systems groups adding that 
theres no way to get a good price for them at present even if 
selling them were a good idea 
these simplistic simmons proposals are we believe typical of 
his attempt to sound constructive when he and his team in fact 
understand very little about our businesses tellep concluded 
on another front in their battle simmons chief lieutenant j 
landis martin renewed his complaint friday that lockheed had 
denied simmons access to lockheed employees the workers own 19 
percent of lockheed through a stockownership plan and simmons 
hopes they will back his slate of directors at the annual meeting 
martin said lockheed promised to allow a simmons videotape to be 
shown to employees then reneged because it lasted 24 minutes 
twice as long as a video presenting telleps side martin said he 
would book time at a los angeles television station to show the 
video calling that a woefully inadequate substitute for equal 
access to employees at the workplace 
lockheed spokesman bob slayman said the calabasasbased company 
felt it had bent over backward to accommodate simmons and 
offered them an equal amount of time as our videotape 
simmons said thursday that lockheeds management is unable to 
face the fact that its deployment of more than 2 billion in assets 
in the technology and electronics services divisions has largely 
failed 
tellep said friday that the interdependence of lockheeds units 
was far greater than simmons claims 
our electronic services group provides critical technologies 
that are an integral component of our missiles space and 
aeronautical businesses he said

the bulk of a 150 million lawsuit accusing 
apple computer inc of pirating pioneering xerox corp designs to 
create the revolutionary macintosh computer was thrown out friday 
by a federal judge 
xerox immediately announced it would appeal 
us district judge vaughn walker dismissed five of six counts 
the only count remaining asks for a declaratory judgment stating 
that xerox is the owner of copyrights pertaining to its star 
computer 
xerox said in a statement from its stamford conn 
headquarters this ruling does not mean apple has not taken 
substantial portions of star and claimed them as their own the 
court merely held we believe erroneously that xerox did not have 
standing to present facts in support of that contention we 
intend to appeal 
we welcome the ruling in every way said apple spokeswoman 
carleen levasseur were pleased that the xerox case was 
dismissed today im confident that the sole remaining issue will 
be dismissed in the near future 
referring to the remaining accusation lavasseur said apple 
has never disputed the validity of xeroxs copyright 
registration 
the suit filed in december alleged that apple derived the 
software for its lisa and macintosh computers from xerox computer 
programs 
the suit said steven jobs cofounder of apple had seen a 
demonstration of a xerox program called smalltalk at xeroxs palo 
alto research center in 1979 and that he and other apple employees 
were impressed with the concept and copied it 
smalltalk was the first computer language to use a mouse a 
small handheld devise used to manipulate information on a 
computer screen 
jobs left apple in 1985 
the suit also claimed apple employees saw the xerox star program 
at a trade show in houston in june 1981 and copied substantial 
portions of it into its lisa and macintosh including the design 
and appearance of such onscreen devices as applications windows 
dialogue boxes and menu and some exact symbols from the program 
the suit asaid xerox never licensed apple to use the star 
computer program or its graphics and alleged that apple gained 
unauthorized access by hiring several xerox employees in the late 
1970s and early 1980s including star software developers 
apple was granted a license in june 1981 to participate with 
xerox in a project to implement smalltalk into a hardware system to 
be developed by apple the suit said 
apple responded at the time of the suit that xeroxs software 
concepts were not protected by copyright any more than images of 
birds or trees were protected by the copyright on a painting 
software industry officials hoped the lawsuit would clarify 
issues surrounding the right to copyright certain aspects of 
computer programs such as their look and feel

industries lumber and satellites 
are they supercomputer concessions all we want brady 
asked no are we going to get more yes when i cant say i 
hope soon

said it really was just a meeting to talk

range of bilateral and multilateral issues

changes to eliminate broad trade impediments in both countries 
and the proposed international bank to lend to eastern europe it

american economy is good despite cautiousness over inflation 
among us monetary authorities he said

backdrop of chaotic action on the japanese stock market where the 
closely followed nikkei average of 225 stocks has fallen more than 
25 percent since the beginning of the year
