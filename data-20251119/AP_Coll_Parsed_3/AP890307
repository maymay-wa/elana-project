fourterm socialist mayor bernard sanders 
party won another victory tuesday as former community development 
director peter clavelle defeated alderman nancy chioffi to become 
sanders successor 
clavelle the progressive coalition candidate had 5626 ballots 
or 52 percent of the vote to 4400 or 41 percent for democrat 
chioffi a store owner who also had republican backing according to 
unofficial results 
sanders often billed as the nations only socialist mayor had 
decided against another term clavelle shies away from the socialist 
label but ran under the banner of sanders party 
today was a referendum on progressive government and we won 
it clavelle told a throng of 150 supporters he said he would 
continue to push most of sanders platform which includes 
affordable housing and public access to the lake champlain 
waterfront 
also in the race were greens party candidate sandra baird and 
tax revolt candidate michael hackett baird received 596 votes 
or 5 percent and hackett 91 or slightly less than 1 percent 
cold weather which brought the wind chill factor to 43 degrees 
below zero tuesday morning may have kept some of the citys 25000 
registered voters away from the ballot box jo lamarche secretary 
to city clerk james rader said turnout was below average in the 
city of 38000 
the progressives success once again deprives the democratic 
party of the mayors seat which democrats have not held since 
sanders beat longtime incumbent gordon paquette by 10 votes in 1981 
sanders said the win was significant because it showed the 
progressives strength 
its not a oneman show its a movement he said thats 
what weve accomplished tonight 
he said american voters have been demoralized by the political 
process 
people look to the democratic party they dont see anything 
they look to the republicans and they dont see anything there is 
one city in america that has said we can go beyond staus quo 
politics we can talk real issues to the people we can have a dream 
of a city and a state and county that is fundamentally different 
than it is now sanders said 
the 47yearold mayor who is known for railing against the rich 
and powerful decided in the fall to leave politics to teach and 
write 
with a promise to fight for the underdog the brooklyn ny 
native was elected in 1981 by 10 votes over a democrat he was 
reelected three times by more comfortable margins winning in 1987 
with 6901 votes to 5594 votes 
even sanders critics give him credit for reinvigorating city 
politics us news and world report rated him in 1987 as one of the 
nations 20 best mayors burlington has prospered and has been 
ranked highly in national qualityoflife surveys 
elsewhere around vermont it was town meeting day and residents 
braved the cold to travel to their town halls and approve school 
budgets and socialize with friends and neighbors not seen for a year 
in nearly 70 towns residents voted on a nonbinding resolution 
asking the legislature to reinstate the death penalty last used in 
the 1950s at least 45 towns supported capital punishment but 18 
rejected or tabled it one town that voted down the resolution cited 
the recent film the thin blue line which suggests that an 
innocent man faced the death penalty in texas 
two years ago about 30 towns took up the question and 
twothirds voted for reinstatement said republican rep nancy 
sheltra a proponent of capital punishment and major force behind 
the town meeting resolution

a federal judge monday dismissed charges against 
half of the 14 defendants in a massive moblinked drug conspiracy 
trial finding prosecutors failed to prove their case because of 
ineptitude 
if these drug dealers are walking free its because you people 
are not competent us district judge john sprizzo told 
protesting prosecutors as he dismissed narcotics conspiracy charges 
against seven defendants in the pizza connection ii drug trial 
you let them go sprizzo told prosecutors later in the day 
dont lay at my feet your ineptitude 
the judge then barred lawyers from talking to reporters about the 
case 
sprizzo dropped the drug conspiracy charge after the government 
finished presenting its case and defense lawyers contending the 
charge was too broad made routine requests for the dismissal of 
charges for lack of evidence 
the trial which began last october is a spinoff from the 
original 17monthlong pizza connection drug trial so named 
because prosecutors accused the defendants of using pizzerias in the 
midwest and northeast as fronts for their heroin dealing and 
moneylaundering conspiracy 
eighteen of the 19 defendants in the first pizza connection trial 
were convicted 
the 14 defendants in the pizza connection ii case were accused of 
participating in a massive conspiracy to distribute heroin cocaine 
and marijuana some also were charged with possession of drugs with 
intent to distribute 
the seven remaining defendants face maxiumum penalties of life in 
prison if convicted

jesse jackson fasted for three days because he 
hungers for the defeat of democratic mayoral nominee richard m 
daley but some democrats say jacksons efforts are straining the 
twotime democratic presidential contenders party credentials 
what kind of credibility does that give jackson nationwide with 
other democrats asks illinois party chairman vince demuzio 
this is certainly not going to bode well for jackson nationally if 
he has any future ambitions which im sure he does 
jackson backed mayor eugene sawyer in the democratic primary won 
last week by daley but that was because his candidate of choice 
democratic alderman timothy evans sat out the primary in favor of 
a thirdparty bid in the april 4 general election 
the attack on jacksons party credentials is only the latest 
event in what has become an imbroglio in the politics of chicagos 
black community since harold washington the citys first black 
mayor died near the start of his second term in 1987 
jackson has tried to be a peacemaker but his plea for unity 
among supporters of sawyer and evans during the primary went 
unheeded now his position is at odds with the man jackson 
successfully backed to head the democratic national committee 
ron brown the first black to hold the top post has announced 
his support of daley said mike mccurry spokesman for the dnc in 
washington 
to top it off republicans have taken note of the black split in 
chicago and some see it as playing into the hands of new republican 
national committee chairman lee atwater who is trying to lure 
disenchanted blacks to the gop 
jackson says he is unfazed 
in these contests sometimes you win the votes and sometimes 
you dont but you must always preserve your dignity he said 
monday in a telephone interview while enroute from tuskegee to 
montgomery ala 
what that democratic machine represents is a violation of 
people jackson said of what he thinks would be a closed 
democratic party under daley it strips them of their dignity 
daley denies that he represents the past or the politics of his 
father the late mayor richard j daley who ran a vast patronage 
army young daley talks as do others of unifying the city and 
giving all people opportunities 
jackson identifies the issue in his support of evans running on 
the harold washington party ticket as reciprocity meaning he 
wont support those who havent supported him 
us rep marty russo dill a daley ally who has criticized 
jacksons opposition to the democratic mayoral nominee received a 
letter from jackson that requested a meeting jackson spokesman 
frank watkins said later monday 
if you are serious about unity in the democratic party i am 
perfectly willing to meet with you and richard daley to discuss a 
similar deal said the letter drafted by watkins if i do run 
for president in 1992 will you support my candidacy as a favorite 
son that is the basis of a reciprocal deal 
watkins said the letter was kind of a rhetorical device 
hes really not willing to talk to daley watkins said 
rev jackson is supporting tim evans 
jackson backed a slate of democratic cook county candidates last 
year including daley in his successful bid for a third term as 
county states attorney but he notes daley didnt support him in 
his 1988 presidential bid and didnt endorse washington in 1987 
i reached out to daley and endorsed him and yet he seems to 
have no sense of obligation to be reciprocal or fair jackson said 
jackson denies that race is the only issue although daley is 
white and evans is black he says the issue is one of going 
forward instead of backwards 
in daley there is relief for those who have a history of 
monopolizing grief for those whove been locked out jackson said 
saturday at an operation push meeting where he also announced his 
threeday fast jackson who was taking only liquids planned to 
return to a normal diet on tuesday 
a mostly white coalition of aldermen elected sawyer over evans a 
week after washington died and many evans supporters sat out last 
weeks primary sawyer got about half the votes washington did from 
the citys 19 predominately black wards 
some political analysts say jacksons run against the partys 
endorsed candidate in chicago will have little bearing on his 
national standing 
it will certainly be used against him but i think chicago 
politics is seen as a unique situation thomas cavanagh 
director of johns hopkins universitys center for the study of 
american government in washington said monday people who like 
what he stands for probably wont care if he endorses the 
democratic mayoral nominee or not

sen edward m kennedy said monday the 
republican party is succumbing to the delusion that the old ways 
will still work opening the door for democrats to regain the 
ideological initiative 
it is time for democrats to become once again the party of 
ideas the massachusetts democrat said in a lecture at yale 
university our opportunity now our responsibility is to 
to put forth a vision for the 1990s and beyond 
the 1988 election which he said was so apparently devoid of 
ideas also revealed how important they are the republicans 
succeeded in defining the contest because there was no compelling 
democratic message he said 
competency was not enough he said in a reference to the 
failed presidential campaign of massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
ideology which is about ideas was missing and our opponents 
filled the gap 
if you dont define yourself your opponent will that is very 
dangerous in life and devasting in politics kennedy said at a 
news conference after his speech the republicans were able to 
define both governor dukakis and the democratic party in a way i 
didnt recognize 
the senator said the democrats are now presented with a great 
opportunity because this republican president and perhaps the 
republican party have run out of ideas 
the administraion has no agenda other than coping no real 
budget no major initiatives and very little to say about what 
george bush calls the vision thing kennedy said 
the administration holds office but doesnt know what to do 
with it he said 
kennedy said the republican party cant live permanently off 
the legacy of ronald reagan any more than democrats can succeed by 
simply repeating franklin roosevelt or john kennedy 
the other side is now succumbing to the delusion that did so 
much demage to democrats in other days they assume that old ways 
will continue to work that they dont have to rethink them that 
they have won and will win if only they rerun the campaigns of the 
past

a slumping economy is sending norwegians on 
bargain hunts in junk shops and secondhand stores 
when north sea oil wealth flowed norwegians spent freely in an 
economy that quickly became overheated but the boom came to an 
abrupt end two years ago when oil prices plunged 
business is booming said leon andersen who runs a salvation 
army shop in the city of stavanger its better than ever so far 
this year sales are up 30 percent compared to last year 
people come here looking for everything from used clothes to 
furniture theyre being more careful with their money 
we just may run out of used merchandise people seem to be 
holding onto their things they make do with an old couch for 
another year or use an old dress another season 
stavanger the nations oil capital on the west coast was 
hardest hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986 but the drop in 
national income has squeezed the whole country 
with its offshore oil fields pumping 144 million barrels a day 
lower crude prices quickly chilled norways overheated economy 
tough measures including legislated wage controls have helped 
reduce inflation and the trade deficit but unemployment doubled in 
the last year to 4 percent the highest since the 1930s and 
thousands of businesses went broke 
the government decisions combined with a modest recovery of oil 
prices hold out promise for the future but it may take time before 
it is felt in the household budget 
many norwegians may be willing to lower their standards a 
little compared to 1986 said oddbjoern eiden an economist for 
the confederation of norwegian business and industry 
he said consumer spending declined 16 percent in 1988 after 
dropping 27 percent in 1987 in 1986 the peak of the oil boom and 
spending spiral consumption leaped 57 percent 
its hard to say why people would buy more used merchandise 
said oddbjoern knutsen of the state institude of social research he 
said it was possible that norwegians were simply returning to a 
normal state of affairs 
i dont think the spending spree of mid1980s was typical oil 
resulted in an economic growth that was without equal in the west 
and people spent money freely he said 
its more typical of norwegians to be careful with money if 
they are indeed buying more used things and not discarding as much 
then it seems we are returning to the cautious ways of the 1950s and 
1960s when norway was not a rich nation 
arne johansen who works for oslos fivestore elevator thrift 
shops said he noticed an upswing in sales just after the economic 
slump began 
we havent noticed much of an increase since 1987 at any of our 
stores individually sales are pretty stable but a lot more used 
merchandise shops have opened in oslo during the past year or two 
he said 
business is up said willy olsen who has owned oslos 
willys used merchandise for 22 years but a lot of new stores 
have opened there must be 10 that opened in the past two years 
twentynine thrift shops are listed in the telephone book for 
oslo a city of 425000

communist rebels have established a 
shadow government and are collecting taxes in this northern town 
named for the family of ferdinand marcos a fierce anticommunist 
during his 20year rule 
local military and civilian officials say this town of 12000 
people that is 230 miles north of manila became a rebel stronghold 
after the former president fled to hawaii in the 1986 
militarycivilian uprising that propelled corazon aquino to power 
in the time of marcos they were only in the mountains mayor 
felicito tamayo said of the rebel new peoples army now they have 
been able to reverse that its as if the timing was great 
communists entering and marcos leaving 
marcos town is about 10 miles south of sarrat where the former 
president was born 71 years ago the towns 13 outlying hamlets 
most named for members of marcos family have become gateways for 
guerrillas to slip down from the mountains into populous areas of 
ilocos norte province 
they just pass through said melecio duldulao 45 chief of 
the hamlet of imelda named for marcos wife occasionally when 
they come at lunchtime we ask them to join us but thats all 
tamayo said the rebels have killed civilians seized private 
property for their revolutionary agrarian reform and have forced 
businesses to pay protection money or what they call 
revolutionary taxes 
on march 1 army troops raided a 14acre rebel training camp less 
than two miles from the town the camp which was abandoned 
contained obstacle courses and a makeshift clinic 
tamayo said the rebel activity has created a climate of fear in 
the town which civilian and military officials appear powerless to 
stop 
by 6 pm you should have already eaten and gone home 
tamayo said then make sure all the windows are closed 
townspeople say they try to remain neutral in the conflict but 
find themselves increasingly drawn into the cycle of violence 
cory arrived and the new peoples army arrived said helen 
abrigado wife of a town official we are really having a hard 
time we are afraid if we see the rebels we get scared when we 
see the military we also get scared 
duldulao said the rebels began infilrating his hamlet about a 
mile east of the town center in 1984 four years later they killed 
artemio manguma leader of the village security volunteers and a 
suspected military informant he said 
several months later rebels tied up duldulao in front of his 
eight children but released him after his wife milagros convinced 
them he had no links to the military 
they have organized in the village level said brig gen 
bayani fabic northern luzon commander they have organized 
economic committees and are already collecting taxes 
the armys 45th infantry battalion operates in the area and 
fabic has stepped up intelligencegathering operations against the 
shadow governments which he considers the principal threat 
to us the armed component is easy to control fabic said 
referring to armed guerrillas but to uproot the political 
structure of the shadow government that is a very tedious process 
rev rock bonoan a spokesman for roman catholic archdiocese 
said the church plays a leading role in mediating between the 
military and the rebels he said priests often must defend 
parishioners accused by the military of sympathizing with the 
rebels whose insurgency is 20 years old 
most of them are victims in this war bonoan said people 
are branded communist rebels even before they become one 
last may gunmen who bonoan said were believed to be soldiers 
massacred a family of five in the nearby town of vintar no one was 
arrested he said 
that has added to the peoples dissatisfaction and 
demoralization with the government bonoan said they have lost 
confidence in the government

only coinoperated laundry was forced to close over safety concerns 
now have to drive at least 15 miles to wash their clothes 
others among the 50 or so washout customers travel 30 miles to 
do their laundry in other towns 
i feel very badly if someone has to travel 32 miles to do a 
load of laundry said virginia pierce of the state department of 
natural resources on the other hand i would feel a lot worse if 
someone contracted a disease that terminated their life 
authorities said washouts owner dennis morse jr used to 
allow waste water into a sewer near a neighboring nursing home but 
he was told last year the state agency would not renew its permit if 
the laundry continued to dump water there 
theyre going to have to change the law because if they dont 
youre not going to see a laundromat in a small town said morse 
who closed his 13yearold business recently

chinese primary school pupils are far better at 
mathematics than american youngsters and are more organized and 
attentive in their studies a study by experts from the two 
countries indicates 
the study by the chinese academy of science and the university of 
michigan surveyed pupils in 20 chicago schools and 11 beijing 
schools the official xinhua news agency reported today 
professor fang ge of the chinese academys institute of 
psychology said in a report on the study that said one reason the 
chinese outshined the americans was that american textbooks teach 
less about fractions ratios proportion and decimals than chinese 
textbooks 
she also said chinese teachers spend more time on math and that 
general math concepts are taught earlier in chinese than american 
schools 
ms fang noted that american children spend half their class time 
without leadership and are more likely to be engaged in 
inappropriate activities than chinese students 
american students spent less than half the time on assigned tasks 
as chinese children and american children pay less attention to 
their teachers the paper quoted her as saying 
ms fang added that chinese children may be under greater social 
pressure to succeed because passing national examinations to get 
into good schools is directly related to their future jobs 
the report did not provide figures on how the two groups scored 
in the math tests

wintertime and the living is easy in the kingdom 
of rattus norvegicus the common brown rat which has become 
uncommonly numerous around britain 
complaints about rats are up as much as 70 percent in parts of 
london which has had just a touch of slush during a very mild 
winter similar increases have been reported in bristol manchester 
and other large cities 
ive never never known such a year said stuart slater 
chief environmental services officer of babergh district council 
northeast of london i havent had a saturday off since the end of 
november 
norman foster health officer for the midsuffolk council said 
he received 1323 rat complaints last winter this year he had 
matched that total by late december before winter had officially 
begun 
rentokil one of britains largest exterminators has doubled its 
sales of poisons this winter said peter bateman the companys 
director of public relations 
with the increase in rats there has been a growing concern about 
weils disease which is spread by rat urine in water the ailment 
used to be seen mostly in miners and sewer workers but cases have 
cropped up among water skiers and canoeists 
the reasons for the rats prosperity are various 
weve had mild winters before without having more rats said 
graham twigg retired senior lecturer in zoology at royal holloway 
college at the university of london and author of scholarly books on 
vermin 
certainly in towns one aspect of it is the lack of good 
hygiene said twigg who has done research on rats in coal mines 
and caribbean canefields 
its one of those things a general lack of attention this 
country is pretty scruffy he said 
hilary king spokeswoman for the institution of environmental 
officers said decaying victorian sewage systems in big cities have 
contributed to the problem she also blamed the illegal dumping of 
garbage and the spread of fastfood restaurants 
efforts to poison rats have been frustrated by the rich menu of 
trash and debris especially from fastfood restaurants said angela 
moon environmental health officer for the borough of lambeth in 
south london 
they would rather eat that than our poison she said 
the sewers at least have their defenders 
there have been a lot of stories around recently a story which 
comes up year after year after year that rat populations are 
increasing and sewers are decaying i just say prove it said 
brigette daniels spokeswoman for thames water which is responsible 
for a thousand miles of sewers in and around london 
if there are more rats about she said we believe they are 
aboveground rats 
in bristol an industrial city in western england the sewers are 
taking the blame without dispute 
the sewers are crumbling because of lack of upkeep and the 
rats are finding it increasingly easy to get out said peter 
archer bristols assistant chief environmental health officer 
also there is a great deal of redevelopment going on and if 
the drains are not properly sealed when the old buildings are 
knocked down the rats can find their way up them and appear to 
everyones horror on the nice piece of landscaped garden outside 
the gleaming new office blocks 
archer said his ratcontrol budget has not been increased in 
three years and nine of 54 positions in his department are vacant 
we can control rats in two ways by blocking up the holes in 
the sewers so that they cannot get out and by poisoning them we 
want to do both but the governments spending limits mean that we 
cannot do either properly he said 
twigg dismissed stories in the tabloid press which have claimed 
that a super rat has emerged from the sewers 
he recalled coal miners telling him about big rats rats big 
enough to enter in a dog show and the sage insight of one miner 
no one ever sees a small rat

the furor over salman rushdies novel the 
satanic verses highlights a gulf between western europe and its 
moslem minorities here is a report from an english city with a 
large moslem community 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bradfords moslems invited eric pickles 
leader of the city council to a public burning of the satanic 
verses and were surprised when he refused 
the incident illustrates the gap salman rushdies novel opened 
between western europe and its minority moslems between men like 
sher azam spiritual leader of bradfords 60000 moslems and 
pickles the anglosaxon businessman to whom he extended the 
invitation 
azam born in pakistan 48 years ago was equally offended by 
british outrage at the bookburning 
we were left with even more hurt and frustration he said 
the publicity we got was that moslems are doing something not in 
line with british culture and tradition 
pickles 36 said they were genuinely surprised i wouldnt go 
that burning book brought back all kinds of images of repression in 
particular nazi germany in the 30s its an obscene act 
the protest jan 14 in this north england city of 500000 people 
was widely publicized in moslem countries some analysts believe it 
began the international crisis in which iranian spiritual leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered rushdie killed driving the 
author him into hiding 
outraged moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by 
portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggesting he wrote the holy koran rather than receiving it directly 
from allah 
like most bradford moslems of his generation azam arrived from 
pakistan in the 1950s to work in a textile mill he now heads a 
chain of moslemrun supermarkets and is president of the council of 
mosques the bradford islamic organization 
from book burning in bradford to prokhomeini demonstrations in 
paris the uproar over the satanic verses has increased the 
alienation of western europes 5 million moslems 
officials in ravenna italy ordered increased security around a 
monument to dante alighieri on sunday after a group threatened to 
blow it up because the medieval poets famed divine comedy 
places the prophet mohammed in hell 
the main moslem communities are turkish immigrants in west 
germany who have made no significant protest about rushdies book 
north africans in france and pakistanis and indians in britain 
firebombs have been thrown at two mosques in britain and there 
are fears of a religious and racial backlash against moslems 
bradfords council of mosques is on the edge of the asian quarter 
and has been under discreet police guard since intruders broke in 
last month and left a message leave rushdie alone 
most government and intellectual comment has focused on rushdies 
right of free speech but the affair has racial undertones and has 
revived calls for stricter curbs on third world immigration 
it is becoming disturbingly clear that immigrants anyhow from 
islamic countries are going to constitute the biggest concentration 
of religious fanaticism this country has experienced for many 
centuries peregrine worsthorne editor of the conservative sunday 
telegraph wrote in a signed editorial 
jeanmarie le pen president of the extremeright national front 
in france said the controversy reflects exactly what i am afraid 
of for france and europe namely the invasion of europe by moslem 
immigrants 
conservatives like worsthorne say british liberals are reaping 
the harvest of their multicultural doctrines which hold that ethnic 
minorities should be free to preserve their cultures rather than 
blending into the society 
commentator auberon waugh pointed to the irony of rushdie 
enjoying the protection of a government he has likened to a police 
state and the police he has denounced as racist 
he should pay for any police protection he may judge 
advisable waugh wrote in the conservative weekly spectator 
rushdie was born in bombay india of moslem parents but now is a 
british citizen the satanic verses was published in britain 
last fall 
liberal intellectuals among whom rushdie is prominent have 
united with margaret thatcher the conservative prime minister who 
ordinarily is their favorite hate figure in defense of free speech 
the opposition labor party also joined it but notes that mrs 
thatchers record includes banning broadcast interviews with members 
of the outlawed irish republican army and spending millions on law 
suits to suppress spycatcher the memoirs of a retired 
intelligence agent 
they the government are total hypocrites labor foreign 
affairs spokesman gerald kaufman said in an interview theyve 
spent the last several years suppressing freedom of speech in every 
way they can 
labor also has been accused by some of its own supporters of 
pulling its punches for fear of losing moslem votes 
many british moslems consider speeches by cabinet ministers about 
democratic values and civilized behavior insensitive at best and at 
worst intolerant 
those who wish to make their home in britain to contribute to 
our society and to prosper within it cannot deny to others the very 
freedoms which drew them to this country education secretary 
kenneth baker said at a political meeting in bradford 
liaqat hussain one of azams deputies responded they are 
turning the attention of the british public against the moslem 
people 
former mayor mohammed ajeeb the first nonwhite to run a british 
city said a form of racism manifests itself in times of tension 
and thats what is happening now 
in one view the rushdie affair is a power struggle between 
fundamentalists and secularized moslems some islamic religious 
leaders have supported khomeinis death call and none has publicly 
rejected it 
moderate moslems are embarrassed and fear association with a 
fundamentalist image that equates in many west european minds with 
hostagetaking airline bombings and keeping women in veils 
pickles said of the situation in bradford weve done all right 
so far over this but if something happens to mr rushdie then 
we could be in trouble

more than 3000 poles have recently been 
caught trying to smuggle food into western europe to sell at a 
profit the official pap news agency reported 
in one case a pole tried to smuggle a goat and a baby pig into 
west berlin zygmunt janczyk spokesman for the main customs office 
was quoted as saying 
we will fight this negative phenomenon until it vanishes 
completely janczyk was quoted as saying in the report monday 
pap did not say during what period of time the offenders were 
caught by customs officials 
pap did not say during what period of time the offenders were 
turned back communist authorities on jan 1 eased procedures to 
obtain passports and thousands of poles have headed west to trade 
mainly to west berlin or austria where visas are not required 
janczyk said poles were allowed to take enough food for their 
journey but a 300 percent customs duty is charged on any excessive 
amount 
he said some polish passengers on a train en route to west berlin 
threw food away when they saw customs officers approach

immigration and naturalization service 
commissioner alan c nelson will be replaced as part of a major 
turnover in the administration intended to reflect president 
bushs priorities and views the los angeles times said 
despite a concerted effort by nelson to hold onto his job the 
search for his replacement is under way the newspaper said in 
tuesday editions 
nelson presided over the governments massive program to give 
legal status to illegal aliens 
the report came in the wake of a recent justice department audit 
that was highly critical of ins management practices citing such 
problems as missing documents massive backlogs of cases and failure 
to conduct background checks on many applicants for citizenship 
in addition nelson has been criticized for the agencys plan to 
dig a fourmilelong ditch on the mexicocalifornia border near san 
diego to deter smuggling 
attorney general dick thornburgh whose department oversees the 
ins wants to bring new blood to the agency the times said 
the president indicated he would like to see major turnover of 
people in the administration to reflect his views and priorities 
a justice department source told the times 
the attorney general has been engaged in the process of 
interviewing people for major positions said spokesman david 
runkel no determination has been made with regard to ins 
no decision on a replacement is expected this month the times 
said administration sources said several people have been mentioned 
as possible successors to nelson but no frontrunner has emerged 
were not in a position to confirm or deny that to the best of 
my knowledge he has not been told that i just talked to him 
said nelsons chief spokesman greg leo 
the report that nelson was being ushered out was no surprise to 
several immigrant rights activists 
there are enough people out there who want him out to start a 
club said mario moreno of the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund 
nelson a former san francisco attorney who took over the job in 
1982 oversaw implementation of the landmark 1986 immigration reform 
law and was sharply criticized by alien advocates who said he was 
slow in informing the public about the measures provisions

the 19891990 winter look italian style 
is a cozy combination of soft fabrics and casual styles 
italys top readytowear designers including armani versace 
ferre krizia fendi moschino missoni and biagiotti are showing 
their winter wears during the five days of shows here 
as the second day unfolded monday it became apparent that milan 
designers are not going to sacrifice wearability for creativity 
gone are the padded shoulders frilly blouses and short 
hiphugging skirts to be replaced by dropped sleeves sporty 
sweaters and lots and lots of pants 
there are skirts as well but except for gianni versace who 
shocked the fashion crowd with a miniskirt so short it barely 
covered the derriere designers opted for a classic knee length or 
a comfortable midcalf hemline 
milan will always favor black but the winter wear was also full 
of bright colors and prints for both day and night 
its a big season for message prints as well with such slogans as 
very expensive appearing on a moschino jacket and the word 
fog written on the back of a gray cashmere dress by biagiotti 
then there are the usual floral prints this time inspired by 
rich velvet geometric figures and letters and the animal prints 
championed by krizia this year she dedicates her collection to the 
ferocious tiger putting his stripes as well as his face and tail on 
sweaters and dresses alike 
speaking of animals there is a runway battle going on between 
the conservationist designers who are showing only fake furs this 
season and those who cannot abandon the luxurious feel of the real 
thing 
thus giorgio armani at his emporio collection opened with a group 
of stuffed animals ranging from teddy bears to sables to introduce 
his new line of synthetic fun furs the lookalikes were fashioned 
into elegant stoles and capes full length coats and sporty jackets 
at the other end of the spectrum are the fendis who show their 
new fur collection today but who are showing off their original 
ultralight workmanship of humble skunks and squirrels as well as 
lofty sable and mink throughout the week at their downtown milan 
showrooms 
in the accessory department the big item is the long strand of 
beads in shiny stones or gold somewhere between a designer jewelry 
ripoff and 1920s flapper beads these beads can be worn casually 
by day or decorate an otherwise simple black evening gown krizia 
even had strands twined around the collar of a lavish fur coat 
shoes this season are generally flat to go with the comfortable 
look of the clothes with a rare spiked heel for more sophisticated 
evening wear 
after a number of seasons of cropped boyish haircuts designers 
are proposing women with manes of wild curly hair if all hair 
growing lotions fail to produce the required length by october 
chief italian fashion pranster franco moschino offers a solution a 
curly blond wig the same one the balding black mustachioed designer 
wears in his present ad campaign

the us parole commission is tightening its 
drug regulations on federal parolees who used to get up to three 
chances to slip up and use drugs before the commission heard about 
it 
the previous policy stated that when any three violations 
occurred in a 12month period the probation officer didnt have to 
notify us until after the three violations occurred said linda 
marble the commissions director of case operations and program 
development 
now we require it immediately she said monday as soon as 
the first drug violation occurs they have to notify us the new 
procedures are effective immediately 
affected by the new rules are about 12900 people on parole and 
2500 who were required to serve their full sentences less good time 
off she said the latter are under parole commission supervision 
until the end of their original sentences 
they are supervised by about 2220 probation officers 
the reason that its so important to find out immediately if 
these people are using drugs is because they commit criminal 
behavior to support their drug addiction ms marble said 
its a very expensive habit and they have to get the money for 
it somewhere she said most of them dont have jobs or good 
enough jobs to pay for the drugs and its important to get those 
people off the streets to protect the public 
parolees who have had a history of drug abuse are required to 
submit to urinalysis to participate in drug counseling sessions 
and on occasion to be placed in an inpatient drug treatment 
program ms marble said 
not all parolees found to have used drugs missed a counseling 
appointment or failed or refused to submit a urine sample would be 
sent back to prison she said 
the commission has a range of options from returning the parolee 
to prison immediately after a hearing to sending him to a 
communitybased drugtreatment center she said 
ms marble estimated that 50 percent of federal prisoners are 
confined for drug charges drug dealing to moneylaundering but 
these rules are aimed at those among them who use drugs 
the new procedures were approved by the commission 70 at a feb 
8 meeting but not announced until monday

conflicts are sure to continue among the 
nations courts over the use of corporal punishment in public 
schools due to the supreme courts reluctance to address the issue 
the court on monday refused without comment to review a texas 
law that permitted two kindergarten girls to be paddled severely for 
snickering 
lawyers for the girls cited department of education studies 
indicating that 30000 american schoolchildren are physically 
injured each year because of the infliction of corporal punishment 
to a degree that requires medical treatment 
their appeal said those studies estimate at least 100000 
children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessive 
and inappropriate school punishment each year 
the american medical association and the national committee for 
prevention of child abuse also urged the justices to hear arguments 
in the case 
but the court left unresolved whether the constitution affords 
any protection against corporal punishment by teachers and school 
administrators 
left intact is a texas law that allows the use of all necessary 
corporal punishment short of deadly force 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the texas law but 
other federal appeals courts have made it easier for schoolchildren 
to sue in such cases for example the 10th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled in a new mexico case that at some degree of 
excessiveness or cruelty such punishment violates constitutional 
rights 
the justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinary 
measures involving physical force do not amount to cruel and 
unusual punishment banned by the constitutions eighth amendment 
while the decision barred students from suing teachers and school 
administrators in federal court over alleged eighth amendment 
violations it left them free to sue in state courts under state 
laws 
the 1977 decision left it unclear whether corporal punishment 
ever may violate the constitutions 14th amendment that protects due 
process rights 
the case the court turned aside monday came from jacksonville 
texas where on may 6 1987 crystal cunningham 5 and ashley 
johnson 6 were paddled twice once by their school principal and 
once by their teacher 
mary sue bruno the principal at westside kindergarten school 
saw the two girls snickering in the hall and gave each child two 
swats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle 
when the girls returned to the classroom teacher rosa cook saw 
them still snickering she took the girls into the hallway and gave 
each three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle 
each girl missed six days of school the lawsuit filed in their 
behalf said the reason for their absence was severe pain and 
fear of returning to school 
according to court documents both girls were taken to a child 
welfare office where social workers who examined the paddling 
bruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse 
the childrens federal lawsuit dismissed by a judge sought 
monetary damages in alleging the girls were victims of conduct that 
was excessive brutal disproportionate to the circumstances and 
shocking to the conscience 
in other action monday the supreme court 
ruled that people accused of drunken driving usually have no 
right to a jury trial if they face a jail term of no more than six 
months the court said unanimously in a nevada case that states do 
not violate fairtrial rights by treating drunken driving as a petty 
offense not warranting trial by jury 
rejected an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the 
federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution 
they say is caused by factories and power plants in other states 
agreed to review the fines imposed against four yonkers ny 
councilmen for defying a federal judges order to adopt a housing 
desegregation plan 
agreed to decide in a case from washington state whether a 
prison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and other 
constitutional safeguards before being forced to take antipsychotic 
drugs

with the prospect of a rigged election 
perpetuating the rule of panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
administration officials and other experts see little hope of any 
thaw in uspanamanian relations 
panamas ruling coalition has selected a noriega confidant 
carlos duque as the official candidate in the may 7 election an 
indication that noriega intends to continue running the government 
from behind the scenes much as he has for the past five years 
this is causing headaches for us policy makers who see panama 
as one of the major hemispheric issues facing the new 
administration ranking alongside debt drug trafficking and marxist 
penetration of central america as priority problems a prime concern 
is the continued smooth functioning of the panama canal 
almost nothing has gone right for the united states in panama 
since relations began to deteriorate in june 1987 a year ago 
administration officials confidently predicted noriega would quickly 
fall after a series of us sanctions were imposed 
but noriega the defense force commander who is under indictment 
in florida on drug smuggling charges has survived the challenge 
leaving us officials perplexed and divided on what to do next 
gen fred woerner the panamabased commander of us forces in 
latin america has taken the unusual step of going public with his 
concerns suggesting that noriega is the beneficiary of a policy 
vacuum in washington 
there is virtually unanimous agreement among government and 
outside analysts that noriega is laying the groundwork for a 
fraudulent election 
woerner says noriega has been moving adroitly to manipulate 
the balloting against an opposition slate 
the state department said last month that it is hard to imagine 
a free and fair election being carried out in an atmosphere of 
heavyhanded repression and intimidation 
a report released last week by the puebla institute a lay roman 
catholic human rights group said panama denies basic civil 
liberties and that noriega allies control the electoral tribunal and 
voter lists and also are in charge of the balloting 
leslie hunter who wrote a portion of the report said there is a 
widespread expectation in panama that these elections will be the 
most fraudulent of all in a series of fraudulent elections in that 
country 
carl gershman president of the usfunded national endowment 
for democracy said a huge majority of panamanians oppose noriega 
and they may be able use the election process to their advantage 
gershman who returned recently from panama said noriega could 
be weakened politically from the process if it exposes the depth of 
the sentiment against him 
noriega may be faced with a choice of calling off the election or 
engaging in massive fraud to ensure victory leaving him in a 
difficult position both at home and internationally gershman said 
ambassador juan sosa a captain of the antinoriega forces in 
washington agreed that noriega may have to confront that unhappy 
choice nobody believes the election will be a solution in the 
struggle sosa said 
sosa was appointed by ousted president eric arturo delvalle as 
ambassador and the united states continues to recognize both in 
february 1988 delvalle tried to fire noriega but instead was 
deposed by noriegas allies hours later 
latin american democracies have kept a diplomatic distance from 
the noriegaled government and the united states has shunned 
virtually all dealings with it 
this has created a variety of problems for us diplomats in 
panama including obtaining such mundane items as license plates and 
drivers licenses to minimize hardship the state department has 
sharply reduced its staff in panama and additional cuts are under 
consideration

army warrant officer james w hall iii feels 
remorse for spying in behalf of warsaw pact nations and hopes for 
clemency from the military judge before whom he pleaded guilty to 10 
counts of espionage his lawyer says 
vaughn e taylor halls civilian counsel said monday that the 
30yearold new york city native is truly sorry for whatever 
damage he may have done to national security and will throw 
himself on the mercy of his military judge 
under a plea agreement hall cannot receive the death penalty 
hall admitted during his courtmartial monday that he 
participated between 1983 and 1988 in a conspiracy to deliver 
classified military information to east germany and the soviet union 
col howard c eggers the military judge presiding at the 
courtmartial at fort mcnair in southwest washington will decide 
whether to accept halls plea after hearing the prosecutions case 
and defense witnesses court officials said the final verdict and 
sentence probably would come friday at the soonest 
hall an intelligence analyst with a topsecret security 
clearance was arrested dec 21 near savannah ga and accused of 
delivering film and documents dealing with communications 
intelligence and war plans to warsaw pact nations 
at the time of his arrest hall was assigned to the 24th infantry 
division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the armys g2 
intelligence section he joined the army in 1976 and spent most of 
his career in europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and 
telephone traffic and coded messages 
hall pleaded guilty under an agreement that prohibits the 
government from seeking the death penalty the maximum punishment he 
could receive is life in prison forfeiture of all pay and 
allowances dishonorable discharge and a fine 
a stillsecret part of the plea agreement outlines the sentence 
that hall will receive unless the presiding judge who is not 
permitted to see the sentencing agreement imposes a lighter 
sentence if the judge imposes a sentence that is harsher than the 
one in the agreement the agreement will prevail 
hall waived his right to a grand jurytype hearing to determine 
if a courtmartial was warranted and agreed to be tried by a single 
military judge rather than a panel of officers 
he also agreed to submit to unlimited debriefing and 
polygraph examination by government officials and to testify if 
called at grand jury proceedings against huseyin yildirim a 
turkishborn naturalized citizen to whom hall allegedly passed the 
classified information 
the plea agreement requires that hall sign away any profits he 
might earn in the future from any publication based on his 
involvement in the espionage case 
taylor said through a military spokesman that he would not 
comment on halls motivation for passing classified information 
until after hall has been questioned by eggers during the closed 
part of the courtmartial

the first senate democrat to support defense 
secretarydesignate john tower has frequently sided with republicans 
but also cast crucial votes against three of former president 
reagans nominees 
sen howell heflin of alabama was reagans most consistent 
democratic supporter in the senate but he played a major role in 
the senate rejection of supreme court nominee robert h bork 
he also cast the deciding vote in the senate judiciary 
committees rejection of two other reagan nominees william bradford 
reynolds for the number three post in the justice department and 
jefferson b sessions for a federal judgeship in south alabama 
but heflin on monday announced that he would break ranks with his 
democratic colleagues and support towers confirmation 
i will rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove 
himself heflin said in a speech on the senate floor referring to 
towers promise to swear off drinking if he is confirmed to head the 
pentagon 
heflin met privately with president bush for 45 minutes last week 
to discuss the tower nomination he said afterward that he believes 
a presidents appointments should be confirmed unless it can be 
proven that the person is flawed or that he would be a detriment 
to the country 
in towers case heflin said he was not convinced after reading 
the fbi reports that the former texas senator has a drinking problem 
that would disqualify him from serving in the nations top military 
post 
in reviewing all of the charges i have concluded that his 
conduct in many areas is not applaudable and not without justifiable 
criticism but on the other hand not disqualifying he said 
heflin also cited towers qualifications for the pentagon post 
and said that in the six years that he served with tower in the 
senate between 1978 and 1984 he never saw nor heard any evidence 
that tower had a drinking problem 
had tower been nominated for a lifetime judgeship heflin might 
well have voted against confirmation but he said the since the 
secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the president bush 
will be responsible and accountable for towers conduct 
it is the presidents cabinet heflin said not congress 
cabinet 
heflin a 67yearold exmarine and former alabama chief justice 
was widely criticized in alabama for his opposition to both bork and 
sessions but neither vote appears to have caused him any lasting 
political damage 
first elected to the senate in 1978 with more than 90 percent of 
the general election vote heflin was reelected in 1984 with 63 
percent of the vote against a conservative gop opponent 
his only announced challenger in 1990 is republican state sen 
bill cabiness of birmingham a businessman who chaired the states 
delegation to the republican convention that nominated bush for 
president

one of the most intense solar flares since 1984 
could still be making itself felt wednesday by triggering the aurora 
borealis and giving faulty commands to satellites 
the massive flare erupted monday on the eastern edge of the sun 
sending a burst of radiation that interfered with a navigation 
system and some communications federal officials said 
officials expected havoc early today as a result of a burst of 
highenergy particles from the flare which they said could affect 
some aircraft communication and television signals 
forecaster joe kunches at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations space environment services center in boulder 
colo said the flare was beyond the measuring capacity of the 
agencys goes satellites he estimated the solar eruption was the 
most powerful since april 1984 
the flare detected at 905 am est affected the loran 
navigation system of the coast guard and disrupted some shortwave 
radio communications 
gary heckman director of the boulder center said another 
effect called a geomagnetic storm may arrive at earth about 9 am 
est wednesday 
a geomagnetic storm is a wave of magnetically charged particles 
smashing into the earths magnetic field disrupting natural 
currents and triggering the aurora borealis or northern lights 
the storm also slightly heats the atmosphere causing it to 
expand this in turn can affect the flight paths of satellites in 
relatively low orbits 
the geomagnetic storm said heckman also could energize 
particles trapped in the earths magnetic field if these particles 
hit a satellite he said it could cause the craft to receive stray 
signals or faulty commands 
heckman said the flare occurred on the eastern edge of the sun 
which means that much of the radiation will not affect the earth 
directly the same area of the sun that spawned the flare however 
is rotating closer into view 
over the next two weeks we could more more vulnerable to more 
flares he said 
the sun goes through phases of intense activity it passed a low 
point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in 
intensity later this year or early in 1990 
a flare occurs when energy stored by the suns magnetic fields 
suddenly becomes unstable and is converted to heat and radiation 
within a few minutes heckman said 
he said noaa solar telescopes recorded a flare of particles 
rising some 70000 miles from the surface of the sun

israels largest peace movement has come under a 
new barrage of criticism from hawks and prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is heading the attacks by questioning group members loyalty 
to their country 
shamirs remarks sunday that peace now activists are in cahoots 
with the most dangerous and extremist of our enemies triggered a 
barrage of accusations and counterattacks 
peace now members like all other israeli citizens serve in the 
armed forces and do annual reserve duty 
they are sabotaging israels political war the war for 
israels security they are helping the most dangerous and most 
extremist of our enemies shamir said 
tzahi hanegbi a member of shamirs hardline likud bloc agreed 
at the height of the uprising when there are blood riots and 
jews are being murdered they peace now members go crawling toward 
the leaders of the uprising and break a rule that every 
selfrespecting jew abides which is to wait for the governments 
decisions hanegbi said 
he was referring to the actions saturday of thousands of peace 
now members who tried to drive into the occupied territories to 
talk peace with palestinians the army which bars political 
activity in the occupied areas sealed the west bank and turned back 
activists headed to arab villages 
underlying the attacks on peace now however is the groups 
controversial decision several months ago to change its stand toward 
the palestine liberation organization which rightwing circles 
still consider a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction 
of israel and call on the government to talk peace with chairman 
yasser arafat 
the government refuses to negotiate with the plo 
peace now also favors territorial compromise 
the loosely organized peace now does not keep membership rosters 
and therefore has no clear estimate of its popularity but scores of 
thousands of people turned up at a recent rally calling for talks 
with the plo 
on monday foreign minister moshe arens urged leftist legislator 
yossi sarid to cancel a scheduled trip to new york later this week 
for a columbia university conference with plo officials 
this is an attempt to try and influence the israeli 
government not through a debate in parliament or through 
elections but through the foreign media and foreign 
governments he said this to my mind is something that should 
not be done 
yisrael harel a leader of the gush emunim jewish settlement 
movement in the occupied territories has accused peace now of 
running to talk with palestinians while resisting talks with 
rightwing israelis 
the agenda should be that first we come to a national 
consensus and then present that to the arabs harel said 
shamir meanwhile called peace now the most marginal of 
marginal elements and added they arent worth the paper used 
to write on about them 
twenty legislators of leftwing parties and the centerleft labor 
party signed a letter to the prime minister demanding he retract 
the statements made at a meeting of his rightwing likud bloc 
peace now activist and playwright benny barabash had harsh words 
for shamir and accused him of starting a drive of incitement and 
bloodletting 
he was referring to the 1983 murder of peace activist emil 
greenzweig killed by a fellow israeli who hurled a handgrenade 
into an antiwar and peace now rally 
peace now does not plan to give up its struggle 
the movement was formed in 1978 as a pressure group to persuade 
thenprime minister menachem begin to make concessions for peace 
with egypt a peace treaty was signed the following year with 
israel returning the entire sinai desert captured in 1967 
movement leaders feel the 15monthold palestinian uprising has 
created an historic opportunity for another peace settlement in the 
region 
its our job to prepare peoples hearts for compromise

open the refrigerator might not be last weeks meatloaf 
reynolds metals co the people who brought you reynolds wrap and 
reynolds plastic wrap has introduced colored plastic wrap 
the clear clingy stuff will now be available in red blue 
yellow and yes green 
the companys advertising says the new wrap which costs the same 
as its clear counterpart makes the mundane task of wrapping 
leftovers fun 
the addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic 
wrap which in its clear form is considered purely a functional 
product said reynolds brand manager jane d nims 
marabel morgan author of the total woman who has advocated 
that women add excitement their marriages by greeting their husbands 
at the door wearing only in plastic wrap says the colored wrap is 
a great idea it would really add a lot of zip she said in a 
telephone interview from her home in miami 
crystal color plastic wrap generated lots of enthusiasm in focus 
groups and simulated test markets said anne f waring a 
spokeswoman for reynolds consumer products division 
adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product exciting 
she said noting that the same thing has been done to paper clips 
and rubber bands 
the company will promote use of the colored wrap in crafts as 
well as food storage ms waring said monday and will have several 
special promotions around the holidays 
ms waring declined to speculate on the impact the colored wrap 
might have on sales or how much the new product which has been in 
the works three to fours years cost to develop 
the consumer products division accounts for 10 percent of 
reynolds sales she said 
in 1988 reynolds reported a record net income of 482 million 
or 835 per share on revenues of 56 billion

some commercial and homemade chopped garlic and 
oil mixes can cause potentially fatal botulism if left at room 
temperature the federal government warns 
the food and drug administration also asked producers of the 
commercial products to review their labeling to assure that the need 
for refrigeration is clearly marked on shipping cartons and the 
product containers 
the warnings follow an investigation in kingston ny last 
month in which two men and a woman were hospitalized with botulism 
after a dinner at the home of one of the victims the three had 
eaten a chopped garlic and oil mix that had been used in a spread 
for garlic bread the fda said 
the agency said garlic and oil mixes containing little or no 
acidifying agent such as phosphoric or citric acid should be kept 
refrigerated at all times from manufacture to consumption 
fda studies have shown that garlic in an oil mixture can support 
growth of clostridium botulinum bacteria whose spores produce a 
deadly toxin under certain conditions 
botulism is characterized by blurred or double vision speech and 
breathing difficulty and progressive paralysis without prompt and 
correct treatment a third of those diagnosed with it may die the 
fda said 
preliminary findings in the kingston incident being investigated 
by the new york department of health implicated a commercially 
prepared mix called colavita chopped garlic in extra virgin olive 
oil distributed by colavita pasta and oil co newark nj the 
firm is recalling the product and told new york officials that 
distribution was discontinued more than a year ago the fda said

a member of the federal communications 
commission is castigating exorbitantly paid television 
journalists and entertainers who he said carried out an 
unconscionable campaign against the recent attempt in congress to 
raise the pay of highlevel federal officials by 51 percent 
commissioner james h quello who would have gotten the pay hike 
had it cleared congress said it was the ultimate in 
unconscionable selfappreciation for tv and cable personalities 
many of whom make 10 to 25 times more than a senator or congressman 
to indulge in a messianic binge against a salary adjustment to keep 
pace with inflation for congressmen key government officials and 
judges 
are exorbitantly paid personalities and anchors who utilize 
government licensed airwaves to accommodate their perpetual quest 
for ratings money and power really performing more valuable service 
than those that grant and manage communications licenses pass laws 
and govern the nation i think not quello said in a speech for 
the new york chapter of the federal communications bar association 
the pay plan would have raised congressional salaries from 
89500 to 135000 quello said congress and the news media 
failed to emphasize enough that this was a catchup increment 
recommended by the panel to keep government pay abreast of 
inflation

rocker peter gabriel

produced by greenpeace the international environmental group 
millions of dollars from its sales will go toward fighting 
environmental problems in the soviet union 
the hoopla was especially great monday on moscows kalinin 
prospekt outside the melodiya store where gabriel and annie lennox 
of the eurythmics autographed copies of breakthrough 
the album also contains music by artists including u2 sting the 
grateful dead talking heads huey lewis and the news bruce hornsby 
and the range sade john cougar mellencamp and dire straits 
at the kalinin store a police guard was posted at the door and 
a steel barricade was set up on the sidewalk as young soviets 
wearing traditional russian fur hats and westernstyle ski caps 
massed 
melodiya the name of the states record company as well as 
record stores is known for small pressings of popular albums 
especially rock and the initial pressing of 500000 copies of 
breakthrough was likely to last just a couple of days if not 
hours melodiya plans to release 3 million copies as well as 
500000 cassettes in this country of 285 million people 
a black market for western rock recordings thrives in the soviet 
union and even melodiya director valery sukharado admitted to

black market 
the tworecord album carries a compilation of songs previously 
issued in the west by the individuals and groups international 
release is scheduled for april 25 
sukharado said melodiya will donate about 16 million from record 
sales to a moscowbased charity that is working with greenpeace on 
environmental problems in the soviet union 
peter bahouth the executive director of the greenpeace branch in 
the united states said his organization plans to open an office in 
moscow 
some of the rock stars told a news conference here that they were 
surprised at how well rock is known in the soviet union where the 
music was once condemned as decadent and kept underground

coffee are heard on oncestaid official radio moscow 
jerry harrison keyboard player for the talking heads said he 
and several other western musicians visited a rock music center 
sunday night in gorky park and saw soviet musicians who had made

rock music and are interested in it harrison said 
gabriel said he liked several soviet rock groups and quipped 
this is the best way to conquer the west 
he said he learned during his visit that one of his albums had 
been released in the soviet union and found the fans here very 
warm friendly and generous gabriel said he would like to perform 
in the soviet union next year if his band is ready

a woman at odds with her husband over who 
should have control of their frozen embryos says the eggs represent 
life and the case should be looked at as a custody battle 
her husband says the eggs represent his future and that he should 
be allowed to determine if he becomes a father or not 
the courts dont know what to say as there isnt much precedent 
concerning invitro fertilization and divorce 
i consider them life mary sue davis 28 said of the eggs 
that she and junior lewis davis placed in frozen storage a few years 
ago as part of the invitro fertilization program at fort sanders 
regional medical center in knoxville 
if i cannot have them then id like to donate them to another 
person she said in an interview saturday at the couples log home 
in the foothills of the smoky mountains 
davis 30 filed a divorce petition last month that also asked 
for a temporary restraining order preventing his wife from having 
any of the seven eggs implanted the document called them joint 
property 
blount county circuit judge w dale young quickly granted the 
order as attorneys searched for any court rulings that could guide 
them no further court dates have been set 
davis said his wifes ability to have the embryos implanted after 
the divorce violates his right to control his own future 
he did not ask that the embryos be destroyed 
its unsettling to know that 10 years from now i could be 
walking down the street and bump into my child and not know it he 
said 
he also objects to mrs davis donating the embryos to another 
woman 
i would not let her donate he said if i would not let her 
have them why would i give them to a complete stranger 
the davises met while both were in the army and stationed in west 
germany he as a serviceman and she as a secretary 
after they were married in 1979 they moved to tennessee where 
she works as a service representative at a boat company in nearby 
knoxville and he is an electrical technician for the maryville 
housing authority 
the davises were unable to conceive a child and gave up on 
adoption when they learned their only chances were for foster 
children who later could be taken away 
they opted for invitro fertilization which involves surgically 
removing a womans eggs from her ovaries and fertilizing them with a 
mans sperm in a laboratory dish 
the embryos are then either implanted or frozen for future 
implantation 
frozen embryos are viable for several years the divorce petition 
said 
the chances of a pregnancy are about 15 percent with each egg 
that is implanted invitro fertilization specialists say each 
implant costs between 4000 and 10000 
the couple said they never signed a contract before entering the 
program and never discussed what would happen to the eggs should 
something happen to either of them such contracts are fairly common 
in test tube baby cases 
mrs davis said the eggs are the result of years of surgery 
tests and selfadministered injections and are her best shot at 
becoming a mother 
i would love to be a mother she said im not even sure i 
can go through the program again its a very hard process mentally 
and physically 
she also said that if she became pregnant with any of the embryos 
she would consider raising the child by herself and not seek child 
support 
i respect her view davis said but the fact remains that 
she can still have a baby through another donor 
the only case resembling the davises seems to be that of a los 
angeles couple killed in a 1983 airplane crash 
the couple mario and elsa rios did not leave instructions on 
what to do with the embryos they had in frozen storage debate 
followed as to whether the fertilized eggs should be destroyed 
implanted inside another woman or left frozen 
the embryos remain frozen and are stored at the monash 
universityqueen victoria medical centre in melbourne australia 
where the rios had participated in an invitro fertilization 
program a hospital spokeswoman said last week

levity has returned to the police barracks 
in this ailing steel mill town now that residents have raised 
110000 to enable nearly half the force to return to work following 
a weeks layoff 
its the greatest feeling in the world said alfred tedesco 
one of 21 officers who returned to work sunday following a weeklong 
furlough 
were used to being on the other side of the fence and to see 
something like this touches a part of your heart 
the layoffs ordered by mayor louis washowich to save 90000 
were to last three months but the fundraising campaign led by the 
voluntary ambulance crew in this town 15 miles south of pittsburgh 
netted more than enough money to bring all the officers back 
immediately 
as a police officer you tend to become hardened to life you 
deal with the criminal element for so long that you tend to believe 
there are only two types of people in this world cops and bad 
guys said inspector daniel kochman who was laid off after more 
than nine years on the force to see something like this opens 
your eyes again 
the mckeesport emergency medical services started the campaign 
with a 15000 donation from its own building fund 
throughout last week some of the 38000 residents dropped 
thousands of dollars into cans at churches clubs restaurants and 
businesses and people from as far away as nevada sent checks and 
good wishes 
by friday the campaign netted more than 54000 which 
pittsburghbased equibank promised to match 
i would have bet my whole years pay that they wouldnt have 
made it said judy mclaren a clerk on the 50member police force 
others werent so skeptical though 
people here have seen hard times they know what its like to 
be down said connie derrick who manages a discount store for 
a town that depressed to get that much money together says a lot 
donations have continued to pour in said betty patterson 
president of the ambulance service fundraisers from disco dances 
to polka parties are planned every weekend for the next month 
any surplus money will be saved for next year she said so the 
police department can use it in case of a similar financial crunch 
washowich ordered the layoffs after state arbitrators awarded the 
police 4 to 4 percent wage hikes 
the mayor had asked all city employees to accept wage freezes 
after the city found itself 13 million in debt at the end of last 
year but the police refused and the issue went to arbitration 
new officers on the force make 14000 to 14500 a year or 
about 697 an hour 
although heartened by the campaign the mayor said the city still 
must deal with the 225000 cost of the increase in police salaries 
in 1990

the president of the countrys 
rightistcontrolled legislature has rejected postponement of this 
months presidential elections leftist rebels main condition for 
participation 
ricardo alvarenga made the statement monday a day after a rebel 
commander interviewed in this town said the guerrillas are on the 
verge of a new offensive in the countrys nineyear civil war 
prospects for peace had dramatically brightened then dimmed after 
jan 24 when the guerrillas offered to participate in the 
presidential vote and respect its outcome if given six extra months 
to prepare and guaranteed security the rebels boycotted all five 
previous national elections this decade as shams 
president jose napoleon duarte has proposed a sixweek delay of 
the vote but rebels dismissed it as inadequate 
the military called a threemonth unilateral ceasefire last week 
and urged the rebels to do the same 
but diego a top officer of the rebels popular liberation 
forces said sunday that we are ready to escalate the war his 
force is one of five guerrilla factions united in the farabundo 
marti national liberation front 
to say we will escalate the war then not do it would be 
stupid both militarily and politically so you can be sure well do 
it he said sitting on a bench in a classroom off the main square 
of las vueltas a rebeldominated town in the northern province of 
chalatenango diego is a nom de guerre 
over his shoulder was slung a sovietdesigned ak47 assault 
rifle one of several hundred diego said his group bought indirectly 
this year from usbacked nicaraguan rebels based in honduras 
the aks are part of the military leap were preparing diego 
said it is more potent in terms of firepower it makes its user 
feel more powerful while contributing to the demoralization of the 
enemy 
salvadoran rebel chiefs said last year they were acquiring arms 
indirectly from the usbacked contra rebels but ak47s the 
standard contra weapon have never been so evident among salvadoran 
guerrillas as during the past few weeks 
contra leaders deny their forces which have been mostly idle 
since washington cut off military aid 13 months ago are selling 
weapons el salvadors military high command contends nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government is giving ak47s to the rebels 
several reports say the weapon may already be in the hands of up 
to 10 percent of the estimated 7000 rebel fighters 
diego did not say when the offensive might begin 
on monday alvarenga said the constitution blocks any change in 
the date of elections 
just like they the guerrillas do not accept the march 19 date 
for whatever reasons we do not accept any change in the date 
because constitutionally the date cannot be changed he told 
reporters at the national assembly 
on saturday the rebels repeated their charge that the 
usbacked government was procrastinating and proposed direct talks 
this week in san salvador the capital 
the singlechamber legislature controlled by the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance or arena has virtual veto power 
over any postponement 
arena of which alvarenga is a leader is favored to win the 
presidency in next weeks election 
the constitution says the election must be held at least two 
months before a new government takes office duartes term ends on 
june 1 
leaders of duartes christian democratic party have said 
elections could be legally postponed and an interim president named 
by the legislature if a political consensus existed to do so 
the civil war has claimed the lives of about 70000 people most 
of them civilians

announced at 1130 am exactly the same time the majlis 
parliament last tuesday decided to give britain seven days to 
decide over the matter 
the agency quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying the 
world oppressors and the west which find genuine islam against their 
objectives and plots have risen against islam and in this

creation of the zionist regime the allout support for it sowing

us sen gordon humphrey says a man can 
take only so much of meeting presidents and meeting prime 
ministers and spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year and 
is calling it quits after this term 
you only get one life and i didnt want to spend the rest of 
my productive years in congress said the 48yearold republican 
who describes himself as the most conservative voice in the senate 
he said he would return to private life although he did not rule 
out a future run for office 
humphrey with two years left on his sixyear term said he was 
making his decision public now to give potential republican 
candidates a chance to raise money needed for the race 
i have to admit i was very tempted to run again not 
withstanding my pledge of old to limit myself to two terms 
humphrey said power after all is not only corrupting but 
its addictive its fun exercising power politics is fun 
the problem he said is you get caught up with it meeting 
presidents and meeting prime ministers and spending hundreds of 
billions of dollars a year 
you lose touch with the real world he said i dont think 
ive reached that part yet but i think it could happen in a third 
term 
a former airline pilot who never considered himself a politician 
humphrey had never held office before he ran for the senate in 1978 
and pulled a stunning upset over democratic incumbent thomas 
mcintyre 
he easily won reelection in 1984 and would have been considered 
the favorite to win again in 1990 in a heavily republican state 
humphrey occasionally criticized the reagan administration for 
softening its stance against communism and supporting a 
congressional pay raise 
but his voice has been heard the loudest as an opponent of 
abortion and the pay raises and as a supporter for the afghanistan 
rebels 
humphrey has consistently been given 100 ratings by conservative 
groups that monitor senate votes and zero ratings by liberal groups 
humphrey called congress a wonderful institution but human 
nature mucks it up an awful lot he complained that congress is 
deteriorating because it is becoming more and more powerful at the 
expense of the presidency 
we used to hear about the imperial presidency he said 
nowadays were hearing about the imperial congress

misha talks yes mikhail baryshnikov has as much 
stage presence as a theater actor as he does as a dance superstar 
he proves it in metamorphosis a riveting adaptation of franz 
kafkas short novel that arrived monday night at broadways ethel 
barrymore theater 
baryshnikov is fine but the real star of the evening is director 
and adaptor steven berkoff who imposes a theatrical unity on the 
play that is astonishing 
every component of this stylized production serves the script 
brilliantly from setting to costumes to lighting to music to 
movement to acting there is a seamlessness to this production a 
quality that also enhanced berkoffs provocative staging of 
coriolanus which played recently at the new york shakespeare 
festival 
still most theatergoers will focus their attention on 
baryshnikov in his first dramatic stage role he portrays gregor 
samsa a hardworking traveling salesman who wakes up one morning 
and finds he is turning into an insect a dung beetle to be specific 
youd expect his physical movements to be superb and they are 
dressed in a striped waistcoat and knickers and wearing wirerimmed 
spectacles baryshnikov epitomizes kafkas beleaguered little man 
while at the same time suggesting the insect he uses his feet 
hands arms and legs to mime his gradual change into the bug its a 
startling transformation powerful unnerving yet touched with pity 
but baryshnikov also is in command of his voice using it to 
great effect in sorrow listen to him call out for his mother and 
in humor particularly when he munches the food thrown to him by his 
horrified family 
the action lasting some 95 minutes without intermission unfolds 
on a raked stage with black lines radiating across a gray floor the 
scenic supervisor is duke durfee a large skeleton of black metal 
bars shaped like a spider fans out across the playing area three 
spiderlike stools are strewn across the footlights upstage above 
a small ramp is a cage where gregor spends much of the evening 
watching his family there are no props everything is suggested 
rather than played realistically 
three other actors portraying gregors family share the stage 
with baryshnikov for the entire play each is a distinctive 
memorable character rene auberjonois plays the father a gruff 
bully fearful of losing his sons meal ticket while laura esterman 
is right on the edge and on target as the loving yet fearful 
mother madeleine potter exudes a steel reserve as gregors faithful 
sister 
mitch kreindel and tj meyers offer fine comic cameos as an 
outraged chief clerk and a fussy lodger in a way they all scurry 
like insects in a frenzy over gregors hideous transformation 
berkoff sees metamorphosis as an existential horror story 
with no way out for the tormented gregor or for the other almost 
hysterical characters 
the director captures that mood of desolation through dramatic 
use of lighting supervised here by brian nason there are several 
episodes when giant shadows play across the back wall of the set 
giving the drama a nightmarish quality larry spivacks music 
contributes to that tension building in volume as the family 
realizes what has happened to gregor and what eventually must be 
done to get rid of him 
berkoffs production ends on a poignant note the final image 
baryshnikov curled up in almost a fetal position is haunting but 
then the whole show is a series of haunting images pictures that 
reinforce kafkas striking story of what society does to those who 
are more than a little different 
in other reviews frank rich wrote in the new york times its 
hard to guess who will suffer most devotees of franz kafka 
whose story is distorted into marxist kitsch by this adaptation or 
fans of mikhail baryshnikov whose stage debut as a dramatic actor 
however dignified amounts to little more than a sideshow to the 
loud circus surrounding him 
kafka never lets the human dimension disappear however surreal 
the situation howard kissel wrote in the daily news berkoff 
on the other hand never lets the human dimension appear at all 
as an attempt to convey kafkas world berkoffs adaptation is 
tiresome as a piece of merchandising though its a triumph 
the berkoff play itself is an expressionist impression of the 
kafka original with little of the finite detail that makes the 
kafka so chilling and moving wrote clive barnes in the new york 
post however whatever objections one may have to berkoff as 
an adaptor his work here as director is fascinating and 
unquestionably effective

foreign minister abdul wakil of afghanistan declined to give any 
details of the assistance which was announced monday as he

visionaries in this aging small town 
wanted to bring profits to prophetstown to save it so they went out 
and bought a company 
we figured if we didnt grow wed die said howard bud 
thompson 58 a hog hauler and president of prophetstown 
manufacturing inc which brought clear creek furniture co to this 
community of 2100 
its going to take something like this to keep small towns 
alive revived or whatever you want to call it he said as you 
go around illinois you can smell death 
clear creek has eight workers who saw sand and spray finish on 
oak furniture patterned after designs of the 18th and 19th century 
the furniture sells in 14 states especially the midwest 
with the federal governments approval local officials created 
pmi sold 10 shares and made an offer to darrell milsap you need 
the capital we want your furniture 
milsap and his wife diane packed up the company and moved 75 
miles from granville in northcentral illinois to the banks of the 
rock river in whiteside county where they manage the business now 
owned by pmi 
its very difficult to keep a small town going said clear 
creeks chief assembler wayne proeger 34 turning off his electric 
saw to talk about the company and the future of his hometown 
population 2100 about 140 miles west of chicago 
i like living in small rural communities theres more of a 
relationship between citizens in big cities people dont talk to 
one another 
thompson a member of the illinois state board of education 
believes the furniture company has boosted the towns pride when 
pmi was selling stock to make the purchase of clear creek possible 
it posted signs that said buy a share in prophetstowns future 
many did 
the spirit has returned said thompson who noted that 
residents many of whom are elderly recently voted twice over 12 
months to raise their taxes 
people keep their lawns mowed and their bushes trimmed pride 
its an ingredient i sure appreciate i know it sounds a little 
hokey but thats what its all about 
pmi hopes to add a few more small companies to prophetstowns 
economy moves that would depend on the profits earned at clear 
creek 
last year clear creek had sales of 280000 thompson is 
projecting sales of 360000 for 1989 and milsap hopes to add a 
second shift 
sales havent been a problem said thompson

opposition lawmakers charged that prime minister 
margaret thatchers government is not spending enough on britains 
staterun railways after the systems third fatal train crash in 
three months 
fortytwo people have been killed in the three crashes the 
latest of which occurred monday near glasgow and claimed the lives 
of two passengers fortyfour people were hurt when the two commuter 
trains collided 
transport secretary paul channon later acknowledged passenger 
fears of traveling on the british rail network 
we have got to allay that concern among the public about rail 
safety and remove that concern he said in parliament 
on saturday five people died and 94 were injured when two 
passenger trains crashed near purley station on londons southern 
outskirts 
thirtyfive were killed and more than 100 injured dec 12 in a 
crash involving three passenger trains at clapham junction near 
london 
john prescott transport spokesman for the opposition labor 
party on monday called for an inquiry into safety to ensure that 
standards are not being compromised in order to meet financial 
targets that are too tight and demanding 
speaking in the house of commons prescott quoted a former 
british rail safety official stanley hall as saying safety was 
being compromised because prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government was tightfisted 
prescott said the government grant to the rail system had been 
cut by 35 percent in five years a decrease of more than 34 
billion 
channon accused prescott of trying to score political points he 
said government investment in british rail was running at 
historically incredibly high levels it stands at 963 million 
this year and will rise to an average of 129 billion a year over 
the next four years he said 
jimmy knapp general secretary of the national union of 
railwaymen the 117000member train engineers union said 
government cuts have impaired safety 
the liberal london newspaper the guardian in an editorial today 
on the three crashes wrote this is becoming an epidemic no 
one wants money spent foolishly but if it is a choice between a 
safe or a more profitable railway there is not much doubt which way 
the public would vote 
the independent times of london in a headline spoke of a 
safety crisis 
the conservative tabloid the daily mail spoke of a growing 
crisis of confidence among passengers

lurid and sensational endanger good journalism 
i am concerned about the garbage that is masquerading as 
television these days cronkite said most of it is real 
scandaltabloid journalism absolutely totally useless stuff 
but cronkite said were very lucky we have a more 
responsible press today in this country than weve ever had 
he said reporters now are much more enterprising and 
conscientious than during the mid1940s and several years after 
when journalists were passive and practiced reporting by handout

news conference to pitch a local water pollution documentary he 
narrated he signed off for the last time as anchor of the cbs

relatives and friends of britons believed held in 
lebanon and iran said today that irans decision to break diplomatic 
ties with britain will make it harder to free the captives 
hostages families all around the world will be upset that a 
major player in this game is now out of the arena said john 
waite a cousin of missing anglican church envoy terry waite we 
will have to sit back and wait rather dismayed 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported today that 
iran decided to sever ties at the end of a oneweek deadline that 
irans parliament had set for britain to disavow salman rushdies 
novel the satanic verses 
britain withdrew its diplomats from iran after irans spiritual 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for rushdies death on 
feb 14 the novel has set off worldwide protests by moslems holding 
the book to be blasphemous 
prime minister margaret thatcher said saturday that iran must 
repudiate the death threat before diplomatic relations can be 
normalized 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held in 
lebanon by proiranian islamic fundamentalists waite journalist 
john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man with dual 
british and irish nationality whose release is also sought by the 
irish government 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a new 
yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim they 
killed him his body was never found 
nothing can ever be resolved unless there can be discussions 
with the other side that was the whole basis of terrys life 
said john waite whose 49yearold cousin vanished in beirut on jan 
20 1987 while trying to negotiate the release of two us hostages 
waite said many moslems had been deeply insulted by rushdies 
novel but he added i dont see that the british government could 
have acted in any other way over khomeinis death threat 
the brother of british businessman roger cooper imprisoned in 
tehran for alleged spying said he expected the diplomatic break to 
remain for quite some time 
iran doesnt like losing face and they are unlikely to come 
forward with a begging bowl said journalist paul cooper this 
will have a very negative effect on the chances of my brother and 
the hostages in lebanon being released it is a sad day 
our government appears to have made the condition that khomeini 
should retract what he said but he is not the type of person to do 
that cooper told reporters 
chris pearson a friend of mccarthy said the hostages prospects 
of being freed have evaporated for the time being 
fifteen foreigners including nine americans are missing in 
lebanon the longest held is terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

china today declared martial law in the tibetan 
capital of lhasa following three days of antichinese rioting by 
proindependence activists in which at least 12 people were killed 
the measure marked the first time since the cultural revolution 
that martial law has been publically announced in china 
police slapped a temporary curfew and cleared the streets in the 
afternoon threatening to shoot anyone found in the central square 
or in the tibetan section nearby an american witness said they had 
fired on protesters earlier today said foreign travelers 
the state council or cabinet said martial rule would be imposed 
at midnight the order was signed by premier li peng the official 
xinhua news agency said 
by early this afternoon groups of 20 to 30 police armed with 
automatic weapons shields and sticks had begun taking positions 
throughout the tibetan part of lhasa telling all people to get off 
the streets an american witness said 
all the tibetans just disappeared everybody just evaporated

southern region 
there were no reports of casualties today 
western travelers today quoted tibetans as saying as many as 75 
people died and 300 were wounded there was no independent 
confirmation 
martial law was never imposed during previous outbreaks of 
proindependence violence in lhasa over the past 18 months police 
armed with tear gas guns and machine guns had been charged with 
subduing the violence 
it was last publically imposed during the ultraleftist cultural 
revolution from 196676 when bands of red guards fought armed 
battles on the streets of dozens of chinese cities 
chinese police today fired on tibetans for a third day in lhasa 
and proindependence activists carried tibets banned snow lion flag 
around the citys center and lit bonfires of chineseowned goods 
the tourists said 
tibetans stoned chinese civilians who ventured into the tibetan 
section of town one american tourist said he saw a chinese man 
running up the citys main street beijing road bleeding from his 
face and neck

were only treating chinese leaving injured tibetans to fend for 
themselves

toward beijing road with the tibetan flag as they marched they

centrallylocated hotel frequented by foreigners said an american 
tourist from galveston texas 
the protest ended when two trucks carrying 60 armed police 
dispersed the crowd japanese tourists said the american said he 
saw three chinese policemen with automatic weapons charge the crowd 
on foot 
most of the tourists who spoke by telephone did so on condition 
of anonymity for fear of police reprisals 
the protests began sunday when 13 buddhist monks and nuns started 
marching near the jokhang temple a center of tibetan buddhism they 
shouted independence for tibet police opened fire and a crowd 
of tibetans began ransacking chinese buildings 
on monday thousands of tibetans flooded the old city they broke 
into small chinese and moslemrun stores hauled out their goods 
and burned them in bonfires 
the violence broke out just days before fridays 30th anniversary 
of a failed tibetan uprising against the chinese 
china claims tibet has been part of china since the 13th century 
many tibetans say tibet should be independent and led by the dalai 
lama their spiritual leader who fled to exile during an aborted 
uprising in 1959 
on monday the dalai lama appealed to world leaders to persuade 
the chinese to find a peaceful solution to the unrest 
china and the dalai lama have agreed to discuss the tibetan 
situation but have yet to agree on a site for the negotiations

new york will have a new death penalty law by 
nov 1 predicts the chief assembly sponsor of legislation to put 
the states electric chair back into use after a 26year hiatus 
the democratcontrolled assembly approved a bill to restore 
capital punishment following an emotional debate that lasted more 
than five hours monday night 
on the strength of the 9748 vote sponsor vincent graber a 
buffaloarea democrat predicted his chamber would override a 
promised veto by gov mario cuomo 
the republicancontrolled state senate is certain to do likewise 
having approved the deathpenalty bill each year for 12 years most 
recently last month the senate has voted to override cuomos 
vetoes but the assembly hasnt 
mondays 97 death penalty supporters plus two who were absent add 
up to 99 yes votes in the 150member assembly graber predicted 
he would have the 100 votes needed for a veto override by the time 
the attempt comes probably in may 
certainly its a whole new ballgame said graber of the 
political pressure that will face death penalty opponents i think 
one of them will blink 
new york is one of only 13 states without a death penalty law 
and the only one among the nations seven largest states new yorks 
old death penalty statute was gradually eliminated by a series of 
court rulings and the electric chair was last used in 1963 
cuomo favors a lifewithoutparole sentence for murderers 
during the debate graber noted that the number of murders in new 
york state last year rose to 2225 an increase of 213 murders from 
1987 and pointing out that most of those murders occurred in new 
york city graber read off a list of what he said were the 20 most 
dangerous assembly districts in the state all were in new york city 
and all but one were represented by legislators who had voted 
against the death penalty bill in the past 
i wouldnt want to reside in one of these assembly districts 
graber said not having a death penalty in this state isnt 
working

new book cowritten with cardinal john oconnor says when he was a 
child his mother resorted to illegal abortions because of 
depressionera poverty 
throughout his eminence and hizzoner which goes on sale next 
week koch describes his transformation from a greenwich village 
liberal to a man who shares views with many conservatives 
koch says that a few years before his mother joyce koch died in 
1961 she told me that during her lifetime shed had a number of 
abortions her reasons were economic 
when she was pregnant with kochs younger sister pat his mother 
told me that she tried to induce a miscarriage by jumping off 
chairs and trunks it didnt work when she finally accepted that 
the child was going to be born she worried that she might have 
injured the fetus 
personally i dont think abortion on demand is a good idea 
koch wrote nevertheless koch has consistently opposed outlawing 
abortion 
when asked monday by the new york post about his position koch 
said women will get abortions no matter what the law is for a 
whole host of reasons and i would not want us to go back to the 
coat hanger or other home remedies or quack doctors 
the post and other news organizations including the new york 
times and new york newsday obtained the book monday 
in an interview with the times koch said none of the views he 
expresses in the book are new 
koch who plans to seek a fourth term as mayor this year denied 
that the books publication is meant to shore up his support among 
roman catholic voters but when asked what impact the book could 
have on his political career the mayor said i hope it helps 
for his part oconnor restates his opposition to new york citys 
gay rights bill abortion and giving out condoms and hypodermic 
needles to stem the spread of aids 
the book published by william morrow amp company costs 1895 
both men have said they would donate their earnings to charities

western diplomats said today they 
expect moslem guerrillas soon will launch a longawaited offensive 
against communist forces who still hold afghanistans key cities 
following the soviet pullout 
insurgents fighting to establish an islamic republic hint they 
are preparing a decisive battle to bring down the marxist kabul 
government once spring melts snowbound mountain passes the 
diplomats said 
the battle plans appear likely to be executed roughly 
simultaneously with serious fighting expected in most areas during 
the month one western source said on condition of anonymity 
guerrilla spokesmen in neighboring pakistan said an interim 
government announced feb 24 by the fighters may hold its first 
meeting inside afghanistan on thursday 
washington and islamabad the guerrillas main backers have 
withheld formal recognition of the rival government until it 
establishes a capital and begins a functional administration 
regime forces are extremely worried about the imminent massive 
assault by the afghan guerrillas in many areas the afghan news 
agency of guerrilla leader gulbaddin hekmatyar claimed monday 
it said the insurgents have sent clandestine messages to 
civilians to flee eastern jalalabad city and the southeastern city 
of kandahar diplomats earlier reported similar notices in the 
capital 
combined assaults on the key cities of kabul jalalabad kandahar 
and herat in the west will be tricky 
guerrilla field commanders have disagreed over timing and tactics 
for fear of causing unnecessary civilian casualties many have 
argued for an extended siege to encourage defections in hopes the 
communists will collapse from poor morale 
nearly 15 million afghans or 10 percent of the population have 
died in the civil war since the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan seized power in a 1978 coup 
soviet forces intervened in december 1979 they withdrew last 
month after losing 13000 men 
western diplomats in pakistan said commanders based near 
jalalabad also are concerned about their ability to control outsize 
guerrilla groups that have converged there 
it could become a problem entailing unnecessary killing and 
destruction said one source 
combined reports indicate fighting around afghanistan is on the 
rise after a winter lull 
the guerrillas claim thousands of government troops have 
surrendered or been captured since the last red army soldiers went 
home on feb 15

california sea lions with a taste for trout are 
frustrating wildlife officials by swimming nearly 300 miles back to 
seattles ship canal within days after they are trucked off to the 
ocean 
agents trying to protect a wild fish run caught three more sea 
lions on monday said susan ewing of the washington department of 
wildlife 
but a third sea lion that was trapped and shipped to the pacific 
ocean has returned to the ballard ship locks a favorite fishing 
ground for the sea lions said hal alabaster spokesman for the 
national marine fisheries service 
the latest returnee was discovered in the floating capture cage 
being used to trap the sea lions in an effort to protect steelhead 
trout migrating from puget sound to lake washington through a ship 
canal alabaster said 
the three sea lions that have returned have made the 280mile 
trip in four days 
i think were kind of taking it in stride ms ewing said 
at least were giving the fish some relief 
wildlife agents plan to ship all the captured sea lions to 
klipsan beach on the southwestern washington coast 
eleven sea lions have been transported to the beach two others 
that were trapped died after they were sedated for tagging and five 
more were let go because cold weather made it risky to drive them to 
the coast

fawaz younis says he commandeered an airliner 
in 1985 on command from his amal militia superiors in the belief 
that the act might stop the factional bloodshed in lebanon 
younis also testified monday that he had given a detailed 
confession to fbi agents who arrested him in 1987 because he was 
seasick in shock and wanted to do anything so that they would 
just leave me alone 
an appeals court has already ruled that the confession was valid 
although defense attorney francis d carter has sought to convince 
the jury that it was improperly obtained because younis was ill and 
without an attorney at the time 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr has not yet ruled 
whether he will instruct the jury to heed the defense argument that 
younis was innocent because he was just following orders 
todays scheduled trial session was canceled because of hazardous 
conditions caused by snow and freezing rain 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent to a sixcount indictment 
stemming from the hijacking of a royal jordanian airlines plane in 
beirut lebanon on june 11 1985 no one was killed in the incident 
the case is a test of a 1984 statute under which the united 
states asserts longarm jurisdiction over the taking of american 
hostages abroad 
younis said monday that on june 10 1985 the day before the 
hijacking he was summoned to the office of aqil hamiyya the 
military commander of lebanons amal militia younis said he was 
introduced to four other men and ordered to lead them in the 
hijacking 
younis speaking through an arabic interpreter testified that he 
received more detailed orders from another amal commander named ali 
hassan the amal militia is the military arm of a shiite moslem sect 
headed by nabih berri lebanons minister of justice 
we were in a state of war younis said describing the armed 
struggle that has engulfed lebanon since 1975 
i was following military orders he said he told fbi agents 
who arrested him more than two years later it served the 
interests of my people and my country 
younis taking the stand on the sixth full day of the trial told

antiapartheid activists today 
accused the government of reneging on a promise to release a 
substantial number of detainees as south africa marked its 1000th 
day under a state of emergency 
we challenge the government to lift the state of emergency 
because even that has failed to break the resistance of the 
people said mohammed valli a former detainee and a spokesman for 
the banned united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition 
valli and other speakers at a johannesburg news conference 
reiterated a call for the government to free all being held without 
charge some have been in custody the entire 1000 days under 
emergency regulations 
a group of detainees began a hunger strike jan 23 demanding to 
be released or put on trial hundreds in custody joined the strike 
and minister of law and order adriaan vlok said feb 16 he would 
release a substantial number of detainees within two weeks 
the government says it has freed 279 people held in south african 
prisons since then and more than 500 people remain in detention 
the hunger strike support committee said 202 detainees have been 
released and about 700 remain in prison many of those released have 
been placed under tight restrictions that limit their movements and 
prohibit them from participating in antigovernment groups 
anger is growing among detainees their parents massbased 
organizations and the community as a whole at vloks failure to 
honor his agreement the support committee said in a statement 
the general impression created as a result of his talks with 
lawyers church leaders and detainees parents was that well over 
half of the detainee population would be released the statement 
added 
more than 500 activists in detention have participated in the 
hunger strike but most resumed eating when vlok promised the large 
scale releases however detainees in natal province have continued 
their fast and about 50 remain hospitalized nationwide the support 
committee said 
the committee said detainees were considering rejoining the 
hunger strike and that sympathy fasts were being planned around the 
country 
a spokesman for vlok leon mellet said the law and order 
minister was looking at each detainees case individually 
an estimated 30000 people almost all black have been detained 
for varying lengths of time under the state of emergency declared by 
president pw botha on june 12 1986 
the government has banned most blackled antiapartheid groups 
since the emergency went into effect 
some 4000 people have died since widespread unrest erupted in 
september 1984 most deaths occurred before the nationwide state of 
emergency was declared although there has been ongoing 
blackonblack faction fighting in natal province 
police said today five blacks were killed overnight in unrest 
around the southeastern city of pietermaritzburg where most of the 
fighting has occurred 
the state of emergency gives security forces widespread powers 
and prohibits most forms of peaceful protest censorship rules 
imposed under the emergency restrict reporting about unrest and 
actions by security forces but the measures have not been 
comprehensively enforced

iran severed diplomatic relations with 
britain today and accused london of antiislamic treachery for 
refusing to denounce salman rushdies novel the satanic verses 
irans parliament had given britain one week to lift britains 
diplomatic embargo and clarify its stance on the book many 
moslems consider blasphemous 
london blamed tehran for the break it comes after britain 
withdrew all its diplomats from iran to protest ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis feb 14 religious edict calling on moslems to kill 
rushdie for insulting islam 
the present situation is entirely of irans making said a 
foreign office statement incitement to murder is a violation of 
the most elementary principles and obligations that govern relations 
between sovereign states 
iran did not formally communicate to britain its decision to end 
relations the statement said 
relatives of britons believed held hostage by proiranian 
radicals in lebanon said they are saddened and dismayed by irans 
move 
hostages families all around the world will be upset that a 
major player in this game is now out of the arena said john 
waite a cousin of missing anglican envoy terry waite 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted a foreign 
ministry statement as saying the world oppressors and the west 
which find genuine islam against their objectives and plots have 
risen against islam and in this antiislamic campaign the role of 
the british government is salient 
in the past two centuries britain has been in the front line 
of plots and treachery against islam and moslems 
iranian clerics have put a bounty of 52 million on the head of 
the author a british citizen born to a moslem family in india 
rushdie 41 went into hiding and is under police guard with his 
wife american novelist marianne wiggins 
irans threats prompted the 11 other european economic community 
nations and norway sweden and canada to recall their ambassadors 
from iran 
a radical palestinian group the prosyrian popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command led by ahmed jibril has 
said it will kill rushdie 
in washington us state department spokesman charles redman 
condemned the palestinian threat 
this terrorist group is based in damascus and therefore we 
call on syria to take appropriate action redman said 
in vienna british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe indicated 
to reporters he wants the soviet union to take a stronger stand and 
influence iran to rescind the death threat 
howe said he and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
discussed the rushdie affair in private talks monday in vienna 
he told shevardnadze there can be no justification for irans 
incitement to murder and no justification for seeking to impair 
the freedom of speech in a country like ours howe said 
the soviets have said western countries are justified in their 
indignation they have not condoned the decree but said khomeini 
may have had to act under islamic teachings 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said saturday she 
believes the novel has deeply offended moslems but her government 
still insists iran must revoke the death sentence before relations 
can be normalized 
iran rejected thatchers statement of sympathy saying it was 
insufficient and suggesting london defuse the crisis by prosecuting 
rushdie and banning the novel britain refuses to do either 
moslems have objected to rushdies portrayal of the prophet 
mohammeds wives as prostitutes and the books suggestion the koran 
islams holy book was not inspired by allah 
rushdie has said his novel was meant to explore good and evil 
secularly and was not meant to insult islam 
nineteen people have died in pakistan and india in violence 
related to the book 
in bangkok thailand about 300 moslems demonstrated against 
rushdie today outside the british embassy as their government 
prepared to ban the novel 
national thai police chief gen pow sarasin was to sign an order 
today banning distribution and sale of the book a police spokesman 
said

engineers today swapped out a faulty 
electronic part on the space shuttle discovery and nasa expressed 
optimism it could hold the latest delay to two days and launch 
discovery on monday 
were still pressing ahead toward a monday launch at 807 
am said space agency spokesman dick young but he said a firm 
date could not be set until after the replacement unit was 
thoroughly checked out a task expected to take several hours 
the launch which had been set for saturday after three earlier 
postponements received its latest setback on monday when a 
prelaunch test disclosed the failure of a master events 
controller a vital system that commands separation of the booster 
rockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight 
engineers replaced the failed unit with one borrowed from sister 
ship columbia and then had to postpone testing so that explosive 
devices throughout the spaceship could be disarmed to avoid an 
accidental firing 
the explosives are fired in flight to separate such things as the 
spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets and external 
fuel tank form the spaceship 
officials were worried that any extended delay could affect the 
launch period for the highpriority atlantis mission that is to 
propel the magellan probe out of earth orbit toward venus 
nasa has said if discovery which is to carry five astronauts 
could not be launched by march 18 it might have to yield the pad to 
atlantis set for liftoff april 28 if magellan cant be launched 
between that date and may 23 the planet will not in proper position 
again until 1991 
discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since the 
challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years 
ago during five days in orbit the astronauts are supposed to 
deploy a communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments

hundreds of police and security guards 
held back vengeful relatives today as a confessed north korean agent 
went on trial for the bombing of a south korean airliner that killed 
115 people 
im here to kill you shouted one person bring back my 
husband another screamed at kim hyon hui as security agents led 
her into the courtroom 
she buried her face in her hands and sobbed 
in january 1988 she admitted on south korean television that she 
planted a bomb disguised as a radio and liquor on the boeing 707 in 
november 1987 to disrupt last summers olympic games in seoul she 
also told the court today she had been a north korean agent 
the korean air plane flying from baghdad to seoul disappeared 
over the andaman sea as it approached the burmese coast all 115 
passengers and crew were lost 
north korea denies it had anything to do with the bomb 
about 1500 police and security agents guarded the court today to 
prevent disruption from relatives and possible threats from north 
korean agents 
crying and sobbing relatives among a few allowed into the 
courtroom interrupted the hearing repeatedly demanding the 
defendants death twenty security agents surrounded her 
some relatives shouted claims that kim actually was a south 
korean agent used by the government to discredit the north and stir 
up support for the seoul administration 
prosecutor ahn kangmin reviewed kims life story questioning 
her about her training as a north korean intelligence agent the 
accused sat slumped forward replying yes to all the questions 
the defendant repeated an earlier statement that she received the 
order to blow up the plane through a top communist party official 
who said he acted for kim jung il son and political heir of north 
korean leader kim il sung 
ahn presented charges of mass murder destruction of an aircraft 
and violation of national security and civil aviation laws 
the court adjourned until march 21 when defense lawyers will 
present their case 
court sources who declined to be identified said the woman 
probably will be saved from the death sentence because she allegedly 
was duped by north korean intelligence 
the bomber has said north korean officials fooled her into 
believing south korea was a police state but she realized she was 
duped after she was brought to seoul 
other captured north korean intelligence operatives have been 
pardoned and used as propaganda symbols against the north 
the defendant and an elderly man who helped her plant the bomb 
were arrested shortly after the blast in bahrain they tried to take 
cyanide hidden in cigarettes the other agent died kim recovered 
and was extradited 
south korea successfully hosted the olympics last september 
communist north korea boycotted after it unsuccessfully demanding to 
be a cohost of the games which it saw as a major political coup 
for seoul

rain sleet and snow pelted the east threatening to push streams 
over their banks in already drenched north carolina today after 
heavy snow forced the closure of the missouri legislature and 
stopped the mail in oklahoma 
the weather was blamed for at least 24 deaths with nine in 
missouri including three people who collapsed after shoveling snow 
the storm caused millions of dollars in damage to poultry 
operations in a fourstate region as poultry houses collapsed under 
the weight of the snow 
the bad weather also forced president bush to cancel a trip today 
to lancaster pa and wilmington del 
up to 10 inches of snow kept some schools in southern illinois 
closed today schools also were closed today in parts of delaware 
maryland ohio pennsylvania and washington dc because of icy 
roads 
a storm system over north carolina brought rain and snow to the 
atlantic seaboard early today snow extended from the midatlantic 
coast to southern new england and the ohio valley 
the ground is very wet and saturated said dennis decker a 
meteorologist with the national weather service in raleigh nc 
it wont take much in the way of additional rain to produce a 
quick rise on some of the smaller creeks and streams 
rain caused flooding across southern west virginia closing roads 
in 14 counties and in tennessee about 120 families were forced to 
evacuate from along the swollen cumberland and harpeth rivers 
in pennsylvania the monongahela river crested at 63 feet above 
flood stage this morning at charleroi and also overflowed at 
braddock elizabeth and mckeesport there is some damage at these 
levels most often to warehouses or storage areas along the river

the missouri legislature canceled mondays and this mornings 
sessions because of the storm 
nine inches of snow snarled traffic in tulsa okla prompting 
even the intrepid us postal service to call off most deliveries 
monday 
today our rule of thumb is if the carriers can deliver by 
walking from the station they will if they have to drive forget 
it said bob hunt director of city operations for the us postal 
service 
ice on interstate 35 north of denton texas caused a 20mile 
long traffic tieup this morning 
icy runways forced cincinnatis lunken airport which handles 
mostly commuter and private flights to continue diverting arriving 
flights elsewhere 
the st louis area received 11 inches of snow the third largest 
accumulation for a 24hour period in march since recordkeeping 
began in 1874 
that prompted election officials in st louis to ask a judge to 
postpone todays primary for a week the request was turned down by 
municipal judge evelyn baker who looked out an office window monday 
afternoon and noticed that the snow had stopped 
government officials said reports indicated that as many as 700 
poultry houses in southwest missouri northwest arkansas northeast 
oklahoma and southeast kansas were damaged 
this could be the single biggest disaster ever to hit the 
poultry industry said lynch butler president of simmons 
industries inc of siloam springs ark which processes about 15 
million chickens a week

secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze agreed today that 
baker would visit moscow in may and discuss the possibility of a 
superpower summit meeting 
baker also told shevardnadze that the bush administration would 
complete its review of its strategic nuclear arms policy next month 
and afterward a date might be set for the resumption of negotiations 
to slash missile arsenals 
i am pleased with this meeting shevardnadze told reporters 
outside the residence of us ambassador to austria henry grunwald 
i believe that there will be good cooperation between us 
maybe this is the most important conclusion 
shevardnadze said the moscow meeting with baker would be used to 
discuss the future agenda for the superpowers and the prospects 
for a summit meeting 
but baker speaking after shevardnadze also stressed some sharp 
differences between the two sides 
he objected specifically to the soviets proposal to try to curb 
nato and warsaw pact battlefield nuclear missiles in new arms 
control negotiations that open thursday and on a soviet drive to 
hold a mideast peace conference 
the situation cries out for some hard work on the ground 
baker said in explaining why he did not think the time was right to 
try to get israel and the arabs together at the table 
on the combat aircraft issue baker noted the mandate for the 
arms talks specifically exclude battlefield nuclear weapons and 
naval forces which shevardnadze said monday would have to be the 
subject of negotiations in the future 
baker also said he took issue with what he called recent soviet 
posturing on iran he declined however to specify what his 
objections were to soviet policy toward iran where shevardnadze 
recently paid a visit 
irans relations with the west have chilled over the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis death threat against salman rushdie author of 
the novel the satanic verses which many moslems consider 
blasphemous 
in his speech to the current 35nation foreign ministers 
conference monday shevardnadze said there should be no playing on 
contradictions such as the wests difficulties with iran 
a us official briefing reporters under rules that barred 
identifying him later called that remark snide it was evidence of 
old thinking rather than the new dogma the kremlin professes now 
guide its foreign policy the official said suggesting the soviet 
union should condemn irans death threat against rushdie 
the two men met for 67 minutes alone with their interpreters 
their delegations then joined them for a further hour 
on the strategic arms negotiations that were due to resume in 
february but remain suspended baker said the united states would 
complete its policy review by the end of april 
this will pave the way to set a date for the resumption of the 
talks at the moscow meeting with shevardnadze baker said 
shevardnadze said the soviets had suggested april or may as firm 
dates for the resumption of the strategic armsreduction talks 
on the differences between east and west proposals for the new 
conventional arms control talks shevardnadze also noted significant 
gaps between the two positions but added negotiation is 
negotiation it is a complex process and i believe that in this 
process we will be able to find mutually acceptable decisions 
the new round of armsreduction negotiations formally begins 
thursday bringing together all 16 nations of the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the seven sovietled warsaw pact countries 
on monday shevardnadze outlined a threephase proposal that 
calls for both sides to eliminate imbalances in their forces and 
then further reduce troops and major weapons systems by 10 to 15 
percent over the next two to three years 
the broad soviet proposals seemed certain to open up splits 
between the united states and other nato allies kremlin reforms and 
moscows apparent new willingness to disarm have already led some 
west europeans to question the purpose of the western military 
alliance 
nato has said it wants to retire at least 25000 warsaw pact 
tanks only then would both sides reduce armor artillery and 
personnel carriers by 510 percent 
the western alliance says the warsaw pact has at least a 2to1 
edge in tanks and artillery even after president mikhail s 
gorbachevs pledge in last december to unilaterally remove 5000 
tanks and 50000 men from eastern europe by 1991

said his group would increase guerrilla attacks against israel 
saying such actions were not included in the palestine liberation 
organizations renunciation of terrorism 
george habash leader of the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine told a news conference there is no

yasser arafats fatah 
in december the united states ended a 13year ban on public 
contacts with the plo and initiated dialogue with plo chief arafat

were not considered terrorist acts but he recently indicated he 
would be willing to negotiate a truce in south lebanon

killed in the shootouts but no israelis have been hurt

bulk of its forces three years after invading lebanon 
israeli jets have struck palestinian targets in lebanon three 
times this year killing two guerrillas and wounding 34 people

the judge in the oliver north case has leveled 
scathing criticism of the governments handling of memos written by 
robert owen norths courier to the contras 
us district judge gerhard a gesell issued an order saying that 
government intelligence experts sometimes classify material which is 
already being accurately reported in the news media gesell 
concluded in the order that he may disregard claims of 
classification that are frivolous 
the judges sixpage memorandum issued monday denies a motion by 
norths lawyers to dismiss the indictment against the fired white 
house aide but it is a strong attack on government procedures for 
classifying information 
on feb 27 norths lawyers were notified by owens attorney that 
uncensored versions of classified memos by owen on the contras had 
been turned over last june to a private group in a civil suit 
norths lawyers were using some of the memos to crossexamine 
owen on the witness stand and were seeking to disclose some of the 
names in the censored memos names of foreign officials and 
intelligence operatives were blacked out 
owens lawyer told norths attorneys he had told prosecutors on 
feb 10 in the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh about 
the memos becoming public informed at the time were office security 
chief allen stansbury prosecutor michael bromwhich and another 
attorney in the office stansbury asked owens lawyer to turn over 
the memos but he refused and no one in walshs office took any 
further action until feb 27 when the private group the christic 
institute announced its intention to publicize the uncensored text 
of the memos 
stansbury made only a halfhearted attempt to retrieve copies 
of the memoranda said gesell he made no attempt to retrieve 
them from the christic institute 
stansburys boss at the department of justice was out of town 
and he simply did not act said the judge he never advised 
trial counsel of his inaction and he never pursued his authority to 
resolve the matter one way or the other he proved incompetent for 
the task assigned to him 
bromwich also failed to follow up he let the matter slip 
his mind under the pressure of trial preparation 
gesell said that with regard to classifying material the 
executive branch has frequently ignored the requirements set out 
in a presidential executive order 
it is now abundantly clear that many documents that should have 
been classified from the outset were not classified in any way at 
certain agencies such as the national security council and 
department of state said the judge no effort was even 
attempted to follow precise directives found in the executive order 
either by the agencies or by the interagency group of intelligence 
experts 
this has resulted in a haphazard process of review of 
nonclassified materials to determine what can now be released 
publicly said the judge gesell said the conscientious work of 
the interagency group of classifying and declassifying at the same 
time has created uncertainty as to the status of many papers 
he said the owen memos reflect difficulties that arise when 
necessary procedures for control of national security data are 
observed in the breach among other things it leads to the often 
absurd situation where the press is accurately reporting information 
in the public domain while the court is confronted with 
representations that the same facts must never be officially 
acknowledged 
gesell noted that the us court of appeals in washington dc 
in a case involving accused terrorist fawas younis concluded that 
the court may disregard claims of classification that are frivolous 
the court will do so hereafter should an occasion warrant 
concluded gesell 
meanwhile prosecutors are outlining norths links with a 
conservative activist convicted of illegal fundraising for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
the case lost a round to the weather today as snow and freezing 
rain here forced a suspension in the trial along with other 
proceedings in us district court 
carl spitz channell testified monday about how he set up a 
foundation which eventually was used to solicit taxexempt 
contributions for the guerrillas fighting the leftist government of 
nicaragua 
channell was convicted in april 1987 of conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by illegally using the taxexempt 
foundation to support contra military activities one of the 12 
criminal charges against north a white house aide at the time is 
that he helped in the fundraising effort 
channell said that in 1985 he succeeded in getting two letters 
from contra leader adolfo calero authorizing him to be a fundraiser 
channells group the national endowment for the preservation of 
liberty used white house briefings and private meetings with 
president reagan to persuade private contributors to make donations 
it raised more than 10 million

electing a successor to socialist bernie 
sanders as burlingtons mayor a push to bring back the death 
penalty and a host of environmental issues were on the agenda today 
as vermont observed its annual town meeting day 
voters braved wind chills of 43 degrees below zero to travel to 
their local town halls and settle affairs for another year 
in burlington turnout was described as light to moderate 
maybe their cars some of them probably wouldnt start this 
morning said jean poulin an office assistant in city clerk james 
raders office 
burlington population 38000 and the nearest thing vermont has 
to a big city will be choosing between a liberal democrat and two 
candidates further to the left to replace sanders 
the 47yearold mayor nationally known for outraged rhetoric 
against american corporate capitalism is taking leave from 
politics at least temporarily to teach and write 
peter clavelle who eschews the socialist label but is running 
under the banner of sanders progressive coalition is favored to 
win over democrat nancy chioffi and greens party candidate sandra 
baird 
clavelle initially angered many sanders backers by ducking even 
the progressive label calling himself only an independent in 
his first batch of campaign literature but lately he has more 
clearly articulated the activist politics he helped execute as chief 
of the community economic development office under sanders 
in about three dozen towns around vermont residents will be 
voting on a nonbinding resolution asking the legislature to 
reinstate the death penalty last used in the 1950s 
on monday night at least six towns approved the death penalty 
resolution it was tabled in one community and rejected in three 
including rockingham where residents said they were afraid of 
sending an innocent person to the electric chair 
at least nine towns will decide whether to form environmental 
conservation commissions nine communities already have such boards 
which are volunteer groups created to protect a towns natural 
resources 
in several other communities voters may authorize selectmen to 
create funds with local taxes to protect land resources such as 
farmland waterfront property and scenic areas 
several towns approved resolutions expressing worries about a 
proposed pipeline to bring natural gas from western canada through 
new england in rockingham where the proposed line would go through 
a historic cemetery and two church parking lots residents approved 
a resolution to examine the safety and economic need for the line 
in hartford residents approved a resolution giving them a say if 
the state tries to locate a proposed 15000seat sports and arts 
complex in their town proponents want the complex to keep the volvo 
international tennis tournament in the state

solidarity chairman lech walesa today met 
with minister gen czeslaw kiszczak and later reported progress in 
monthlong negotiations between the opposition and communist 
government 
he announced the last session of the talks would be held april 3 
and various working groups composed of experts will finish putting 
the final touches on the accord by march 20 
the period between march 20 and april 3 would be devoted to 
reviewing the agreement he said 
all basic problems like pluralism will be achieved in 
time in line with our commitments said the solidarity leader 
looking cheerful after the eighthour meeting with the leader of the 
government side in the talks i am very satisfied 
walesa indicated agreement was reached on legalizing the three 
main banned independent organizations at issue in the talks the 
solidarity trade union movement the farmers union rural solidarity 
and the independent students association 
agreements on all those organizations a mininum of three 
will be achieved he said 
he said further talks with kiszczak might be necessary 
we are removing obstacles that have appeared here and there 
but we are only removing them politically and the rest must be 
worked out at the various working group tables he said 
walesa spoke outside the roman catholic episcopate in warsaw 
after returning with a vanful of advisers from the meeting in a 
secluded government villa outside the capital 
the session came the morning after a communist party session that 
gave gen wojciech jaruzelski qualified support for his policy of 
rapprochement with the opposition government spokesman jerzy urban 
said in a telephone interview 
urban described mondays meeting of the partys governing central 
committee as very difficult 
he said committee members expressed different fears and doubts 
remembering the events of 1981 when solidarity grew in membership 
to include one of every three poles and pressed its demands with 
general strike threats 
authorities suppressed the free trade union movement in a 
december 1981 military crackdown ending its 16month legal 
existence 
the general outcome of the meeting monday was approval for 
the party leadership urban said 
walesa and the interior minister also met thursday and agreed 
that the talks aimed at restoring the solidaritys legal status and 
producing a consensus for guiding the country out of economic 
turmoil should move more quickly 
the two sides are in general agreement on the outlines of a 
national compromise legalization of solidarity in exchange for the 
oppositions participation in early elections that would guarantee 
the ruling communist party a continued majority in parliament 
but several obstacles have appeared including the authorities 
hesitation to legalize the independent students association 
disagreement over a program to index wages to inflation and how much 
access the opposition is to be given to the statecontrolled mass 
media

a car bomb exploded near the american 
university hospital in moslem west beirut today killing two women 
and injuring 21 people police said 
druse warlord walid jumblatt a staunch ally of the syrians who 
police west beirut blamed the blast on the christian cabinet of 
gen michel aoun 
the explosiveladen yellow fiat blew up in front of a fruit and 
vegetable stall at an intersection off a main commercial 
thoroughfare 
one of the victims was killed as she maneuvered to park her car 
near the stand police said 
another woman died at the hospital said a police spokesman who 
under standing regulations is not identified 
the explosion started a fire involving several parked cars and 
shattered glass in surrounding buildings 
three people were evacuated by ambulance and the police 
spokesman said civilians carried most of the casualties on their 
backs to the american university hospital several hundered yards 
away 
jumblatt charged at a news conference that the bomb was part of a 
campaign by the christian cabinet to choke private militias in 
lebanon 
those who are trying to encircle us today sent us a 
boobytrapped message jumblatt told a news conference at his 
familys ancestral palace in mukhtara southeast of beirut 
tensions between lebanons rival christian and moslem cabinets 
have increased since monday when aoun ordered the army to block 
merchant ships trying to dock at militiacontrolled ports instead of 
those run by the government 
aoun has said his move will cut off the main revenues of private 
armies but his syrianbacked moslem rivals view it as an economic 
blockade of moslem regions 
at the scene of the blast a witness who also spoke on condition 
of anonymity said he was in a building 150 feet away when the blast 
occurred it shattered windows there 
i was having my coffee first i felt the glass crumbling down 
then i heard the blast 
he said when he looked out of the window he saw fires and a body 
lying in the street 
gunmen fired their rifles in the air to make way for the 
ambulances 
it was the fourth car bombing in lebanon this year 
by police count 11 people have been killed and 47 wounded in the 
previous three car bombings since jan 13 
last year 116 people were killed and 488 wounded in 20 car bomb

no group claimed any of the explosions but moslem and christian 
officials have blamed each others militias for them

three soviet far eastern ports wary of nuclear 
power after the chernobyl disaster have refused to allow the 
docking of a nuclearpowered merchant ship that a newspaper today 
compared to a homeless child 
sovietskaya rossiya said the 858footlong sevmorput has been 
anchored off vladivostok for four days because the city council 
refused it entry the newspaper said city officials will not allow 
the ship to dock until they receive additional information about its 
radiation safety 
officials of the pacific port of nakhodka and the coastal magadan 
region have also rejected port calls by the ship the newspaper said 
the newspaper said fractures recently appeared in the 260 
million ship but that its atomic heart was not damaged it did 
not say how the damage was inflicted 
sovietskaya rossiya said the vessel was like a sea monster 
and a huge offended homeless child 
on saturday the newspaper vodny transport reported that a 
nuclear reactor meltdown nearly occurred last fall aboard another 
nuclearpowered ship the icebreaker rossiya 
public opposition to nuclear power has been mounting in the 
soviet union since the april 26 1986 explosion and fire at the 
chernobyl nuclear power plant in the ukraine at least 31 people 
were killed in the accident and a cloud of radiation spread 
worldwide

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference tuesday 
bush well as you know we got canceled out of lancaster pa 
and wilmington today and so i thought it might be an opportune 
moment to stay indoors take a few questions 
the lancaster trip has been rescheduled for the 22nd of march 
and i look forward to going there talking to the people and really 
discussing that community participation on drugs 
i want to take this brief opening statement opportunity to 
restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the best means 
of resolving the dispute between eastern airlines and its unions 
i continue to feel it would be inappropriate for the government 
to intervene and to impose a solution 
this dispute has gone on for more than 17 months and its time 
for the parties involved to get down to serious business and reach 
an agreement 
the actionforcing event in this case is the strike and that is 
the tool at the disposal of labor and theyre properly going 
forward with that 
management and labor now have to find a settlement 
but let me just say that i hope my position on secondary boycotts 
is well known 
thankfully these boycotts have not yet materialized and i hope 
they dont 
temporary restraining orders have been in effect yesterday and 
today in the new york and philadelphia areas 
but even when those restraining orders lapse i remind all 
parties that secondary boycotts are not in the public interest and 
i will send legislation to congress to forbid them if that is 
necessary 
it is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in from 
long island that youre going to be caught up and victimized by a 
strike affecting an airline 
it simply isnt fair in my view 
secretary skinner has been monitoring the situation from the very 
beginning 
in my view on top of it 
the department of transportation and the faa have taken every 
precaution to ensure airline safety during this period 
and i understand that the pilots are talking about a work 
slowdown beginning today 
certainly i must recognize their special concerns for safety 
during this period but i also would urge them not to make the 
traveling public the innocent traveling public a pawn in this 
dispute 
so thats my view on the airline strike 
and i hope that it is settled in the traditional way 
management labor sitting down and working out an agreement

wait a minute weve got to go to the 
q oh 
a protocol sorry about that 
q thank you mr president mr president your struggle to win 
the confimation of senator tower and the seeming lack of direction 
has caused a lot criticism that your administration is in drift 
there is malaise what is your response and what are you going to do 
about it 
a my response is that its not a drift and there isnt malaise 
and i talked to a fellow from lubbock texas the other day which 
was the best phone call ive made 
and he said all the people in lubbock think things are going 
just great 
and so and he is a very objective spokesman laughter the 
guy that huh 
q do you really think youre doing fine when you 
a i think were on track 
q dont really know where your administration is going with a 
plan 
a well let me help you with where i think its going 
in the first place in a very brief period of time we addressed 
ourselves to a serious national problem the problem of the sampl 
bailout 
that is still moving forward 
it takes a little time 
ive challenged the congress to act 
secondly we came up in a very short period of time with a great 
amount of detail far more than the two previous administrations 
regarding the budget sound proposals 
the no 1 problem facing this country in my view is getting 
this federal budget deficit down 
not only did we address it but we addressed it in considerable 
detail and talks are going on right now to try to solve that problem 
ive taken a substantive foreign policy trip that took me not 
only to three countries but where i met with i think some 19 
representatives of 19 countries and talked about their objectives 
and mine for foreign policy 
our secretary of state has not only touched base with all the 
nato leaders but has had a productive meeting with mr shevardnadze 
the defense reviews and the other foreign policy reviews are 
under way 
and i will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up 
with bold new foreign policy proposals in 45 days not going to be 
so i think plenty of substantive things are going on 
and then i have made clear you saw my statement on cfcs on the 
environment 
our environmental man is over there bill reilly a very able 
administrator attending a conference that will then lead in my 
view to unilateral proposals by the united states not in terms 
just of cfcs but other global environmental matters 
we are confident of the confirmation of bill bennett and he is 
charged with a sixmonth mandate to do something map out the drug 
program 
and he will be very serious about going forward on that

i appointed early on an ethics commission which has been 
meeting and will be coming out with i think sound proposals 
and so well start moving forward legislatively there 
i spelled out in my speech an education agenda and that will be 
followed the speech very shortly with legislative initiatives 
were moving forward with our volunteer approach this national 
the organization to pursue national service under greg petersmeyer 
here in the white house 
our secretary of hud has taken some factfinding speeches trips 
and made some good comments speeches about our objectives in 
terms of the homeless 
so i would have to urge and everyone here is familiar with my 
position on child care thats going to take legislation but i 
think the congress clearly knows where we want to go there 
so i would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be 
bubbling around that nothing is happening 
a lot is happening not all of it good but a lot is happening 
q mr president you mentioned your asian trip now one of the 
issues that arose there was kind of a disagreement or a dispute with 
china over a dissident attending your dinner and it seems that you 
failed to raise human rights in your meetings with chinese leaders 
is this going to be your preference for conveying harmony rather 
than confrontation over human rights 
a no it was raised 
when marlin spoke to you at the beginning of the trip there in 
china and said it hadnt been raised he was right 
it hadnt been raised publicly in the meetings with that id 
had up to that moment 
i believe deng xiaoping was the one where he spoke 
but it was raised by me personally 
but you know theres two schools of how you do the human rights 
agenda 
i think that president reagan was correct when he raised the 
human rights agenda with the soviets privately rather than beating 
his breast and doing it publicly 
and i think the results have been rather penetrating 
theres still a long way to go with the soviets 
but i have not only raised them but the very invitation to that 
dissident that they thoroughly disapproved of shows our public 
commitment to it 
and there was a reference to it in his speech 
so it all depends how you how in our toasts 
so it all depends you know what approach you take 
but i think quiet discussion is a good approach to trying to 
effect the human rights objectives that i feel very strongly about 
craig

president bush said today he is open to a 
sensible answer to the proliferation of semiautomatic assault 
weapons and has asked william bennett his nominee for drug policy 
coordinator to work on it 
bush a member of the national rifle association has said he 
opposes a ban on such guns in a news conference today he said he 
talked to bennett about the problem after bennett was quoted as 
saying he might favor curtailment of such weapons as a way to cut 
down on drugrelated violence 
bush said he told bennett im not so rigid that if you come to 
me with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns that ive 
felt over the years ill take a hard look at it and ill work with 
you to that end 
he said he wants to find what can be worked out with finality 
on ak47s and still do whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
it isnt as easy as it seems bush said 
bush was to have gone to pennsylvania today to speek on drugs 
but the trip was scrapped due to the icy and snowy weather that 
battered the east coast 
on monday bush began a week devoted to an antidrug message 
appealing to military veterans to help combat narcotics by 
encouraging drugeducation programs and antidrug legislation at the 
state and local levels 
youve fought for your nation once and your nation needs you 
again bush said in an address monday to several thousand people 
at a veterans of foreign wars conference 
bush has asked congress for 55 billion for the battle against 
drugs with most of the money going to law enforcement efforts and 
border interdiction 
his request for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 is 21 percent 
more than the 46 billion allocated for this year it is 236 
million more than former president ronald reagan had sought in his 
first draft of the spending plan 
bush told the veterans that drugs were a threat no less real 
than the adversaries you have battled 
the notion that america is a nation at peace is only partly 
true as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault 
our communities he said 
bush said he will mobilize all our resources wage this war on 
all fronts were going to combat drug abuse with education 
treatment enforcement interdiction and yes with our nations 
armed services 
speaking of involvement by the military bush said when that 
prudently can be done and when thats what it takes we are going to 
have to go all out 
bush had planned to carry his antidrug message today to 
pennsylvania and delaware but a storm along the east coast caused 
him to cancel the trip white house aides said it would be 
rescheduled probably for next week 
on another subject bush said monday that he supports lower 
levels of armaments in europe but with a continued backup by 
nuclear weapons 
for america and its allies a survivable nuclear force will 
remain the ultimate deterrent of aggression bush said 
his comments coincided with a proposal by the kremlin for heavy 
reductions in troops and armor in europe moscow also urged 
negotiations to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the 
continent

q on that regard on human rights will it always be the first 
thing you mention with the soviets as it was under president reagan 
a i dont recall it always being the first thing because the 
last meeting i attended with him and mr gorbachev it was raised 
but it wasnt the first thing 
but it will be high on our agenda 
i confidently expect that jim baker will continue to raise it 
and yes it will be an agenda item 
q mr president on the air strike your opposition on capitol 
hill many of the democrats up there wanted you to intervene in 
this strike should you have to go to congress for emergency 
legislation to deal with secondary boycotts it is likely they are 
going to say no no we want you to intervene first if the 
eastern pilots succeed and the machinists succeed in imposing 
secondary boycotts you seem to be on a collision course there will 
your policy hold firm 
a it will hold firm 
the secretary is testifying i think at this very moment about 
the kind of legislation you are talking about and some wanting to 
compel the president to convene this board 
so there are two schools of thought 
i still feel that the best answer is a headonhead mantoman 
negotiation between the union and the airline 
and i think that is better and more lasting incidentally the 
agreement that would stem from that more lasting than an imposed 
government settlement which could cause the airline to totally shut 
down 
so i think there could be some you know confrontation 
but i will stick with my view and i will keep and if indeed 
innocent parties are threatened through the secondary boycott 
mechanism i will move promptly with the congress and what would 
happen and i dont want to buy into a lot of hypothesis here but 
you would have an outcry from the american people on the basis of 
that i mentioned about that commuter 
it is not fair to you know have innocent people victimized by a 
struggle between eastern airlines and the machinists union 
so there may be a different a closelyfought contest and there 
might i know theres some widely differing views on this 
q but if that should happen sir you must recognize that there 
would be great pressure on you to at least stop it for 60 days are 
you intent on not doing that 
a i am intent on staying with what ive outlined is our 
administrations policy and it is the correct policy 
and i think its the best way to have a solution to this question 
well go right across here and then start greater than

eastern strike 
bush urged pilots for other airlines not to slow operations as a 
way of supporting the eastern airlines strike and thus make the 
innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute

to stop the walkout but he said that if striking machinists try to 
shut down rail service he will ask congress to ban such secondary 
boycotts

tower nomination

senate because i want him and i believe he is the best man for the 
job

he gets the defense job and he said youll have 25000 people in 
the pentagon making sure thats true

a stowaway cat from baltimore survived a 
twoweek journey by land and sea from the united states without food 
or water only to be killed when it arrived in britain because of 
strict quarantine laws an official said tuesday 
the cat apparently was locked in a container full of tires in 
baltimore said john mackie staffordshire countys emergency 
planning officer 
the container made the 3000mile journey to an auto factory in 
rocester western england by ship and truck 
the longhaired grayandwhite cat survived by drinking the 
condensation on the inside of the sealed container mackie said 
when it was discovered however a veterinarian decided it had to 
be killed because of the rabies risk 
the risk was slight but rabies is endemic in the united states 
and the import of cats and dogs is strictly controlled because of 
it mackie said 
the factory organized a collection to keep the cat in quarantine 
for the required six months but the vet declared the cat was in too 
poor a condition to survive the quarantine period and he killed it 
painlessly mackie said

north korea accused south korean troops of firing 
machine guns tuesday at a guard post on the north korean side of the 
border and contended it was part of attempts to start a new war 
pyongyangs official korean central news agency monitored in 
tokyo said the firing gravely threatened the safety of civilian 
policemen of our side on routine duty and said their patience 
prevented the incident from developing into an armed conflict 
it said the firing occurred tuesday morning in the central sector 
of the border area between north korea and south korea 
the gun firing timed to coincide with the aggressive team 
spirit 89 joint military maneuvers staged by the us imperialists 
and the south korean puppets shipping huge aggressive forces and 
destruction weapons into south korea vividly shows how frantically 
they are trying to unleash a new war by aggravating the situation on 
the korean peninsula the agency said 
north korea has demanded cancellation of the team spirit exercise 
this month saying it makes progress in a korean dialogue 
impossible us and south korean officials say the annual military 
exercise in which about 200000 us and south korean troops are 
involved is purely defensive 
north korea suspended talks between legislators of both countries 
in protest of the military exercise other talks aimed at arranging 
the first meeting between both sides prime ministers also have

president bush today praised the naming of 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater to the howard 
university board of trustees as students continued to occupy the 
administration building in protest 
the students said they would stay until atwater who was bushs 
campaign manager is removed from the board classes were suspended 
today due to snow and freezing rain 
bush was asked if the students at the largely black campus who 
question atwaters commitment to black concerns had a legitimate 
complaint 
no i think its a good thing hes on the board i think 
thatll work out just fine bush said at a news conference 
no arrests have been made in the latest round of a protest that 
began late last week on friday students disrupted the universitys 
annual charter day convocation and prevented entertainer bill cosby 
from giving the main address 
from as few as 250 to more than 1000 students were occupying the 
mordecai wyatt johnson administration building after the takeover 
began monday morning according to varying reports reporters were 
not allowed inside 
michael lewis a junior who is serving as a spokesman for the 
protesters said in a statement that atwater is regarded by 
students to be opposed to the black agenda 
the university refused to comment last night on the students 
actions or on what steps might be taken 
a group of students met with howard university president james e 
cheek and board of trustees chairman john e jacob on saturday to 
discuss a list of demands 
on sunday atwater met with a group of students in an attempt to 
allay their concerns according to an atwater spokeswoman she said 
he was unavailable for interviews but he remained committed to his 
seat on the howard board 
although some professors and students have praised the 
appointment as an intelligent move others have attacked it as poor 
symbolism 
some of atwaters critics point to his use of the furlough of 
convicted criminal willie horton to criticize the judgment of 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis the democratic presidential 
nominee during george bushs campaign last year 
he masterminded use of the willie horton issue to contribute to 
the rising antiblack sentiment of the american people lewis 
said during an earlier interview and we feel that facilitated 
the election of former ku klux klansman david duke to the 
louisiana state legislature 
aside from the removal of atwater students are demanding a more 
afrocentric curriculum a better financial aid processing 
system and improved campus security

the soviet media gave raisa gorbachev some rare 
coverage tuesday carrying a report on the kremlin first ladys 
comments on her husbands reforms and how the worlds women have 
improved prospects for peace 
if people currently are more confident of a peaceful future we 
know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all 
continents for friendship cooperation and profound mutual 
understanding of nations mrs gorbachev said at a reception she 
gave monday in honor of international womens day a soviet holiday 
that will be celebrated wednesday 
her remarks were reported by tass the official soviet news 
agency 
although mrs gorbachev is shown frequently on soviet staterun 
television and has been interviewed by western reporters her views 
are rarely reported in soviet media or heard by her fellow citizens 
it was unusual for tass to cover her reception for wives of 
ambassadors and other diplomats in moscow wives of members of the 
ruling communist party politburo and soviet women in various fields 
mrs gorbachev who captures world attention on frequent trips 
abroad with her husband arouses contrary passions in soviets 
some are curious about the dashing 57yearold woman who has 
changed the role of the soviet leaders wife into something more 
resembling that of the wives of us presidents 
until mikhail s gorbachev to power four years ago the spouses 
of kremlin figures kept a low often invisible profile with the 
exception of russian revolutionary nadezhda krupskaya the wife of 
vladimir i lenin who was a member of the partys policymaking 
central committee 
many soviets look askance at mrs gorbachev whose wardrobe is 
large and glamorous by soviet standards others grumble that the 
former teacher of marxistleninist philosophy is too involved in her 
husbands work 
mrs gorbachevs recepition gave her an opportunity to share her 
opinions on both domestic and international affairs 
soviet people are putting into practice plans of revolutionary 
restructuring we are connecting to it the destiny of our country 
of our nation mrs gorbachev said in a reference to her husbands 
reforms we want our public life in all aspects socioeconomic 
political moral ecological and in the sphere of human rights and 
freedoms to be worthy of a human being 
by transforming and renewing our society on a socialist basis 
on the principles of humanism and democracy we are making our 
country more open for all the nations of the world she said 
mrs gorbachev greeted her guests individually and gave each of 
them a bouquet said rebecca matlock the wife of us ambassador 
jack matlock 
shes a very attractive intelligent and vocal woman if they 
let her speak more often everyone would benefit mrs matlock 
said in an interview with the associated press 
i hope with the example of nancy reagan coming here and the 
television coverage she received here will make it acceptible for 
the spouses of leaders to think their own thoughts and express 
them mrs matlock said 
mrs matlock who was referring to mrs reagans visit during the 
moscow summit meeting last summer was one of several hundred guests 
at the reception 
the gorbachevs later attended a celebration held in moscows 
bolshoi theater to mark international womens day the ceremonies 
broadcast on tv showed mrs gorbachev returning to the more 
traditional protocol role of the soviet leaders wife 
gorbachev sat on the dais with other politburo members and 
dignitaries while his wife was in the audience 
in a dispatch showing the limited political clout of women in 
soviet society tass also reported tuesday that of 2901 candidates 
running to represent territorial districts in a new national 
assembly only 17 percent are women 
voters nationwide on march 26 will choose 1500 deputies for the 
council of peoples deputies a new body that will elect the soviet 
president and parliament organizations such as the communist party 
and trade unions are directly electing deputies to fill 750 other 
seats

president bush said today that 25000 pentagon 
employees will provide a failsafe guarantee that john tower 
abides by his vow to abstain from drinking if he is confirmed as 
secretary of defense 
as bush underlined his support for his nominee senate 
republicans accused sen sam nunn dga of improperly reopening 
the investigation into the former texas senators personal fitness 
to serve 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee said he 
had dispatched investigators from the senate governmental affairs 
investigations subcommittee that he also heads to dallas to probe 
new allegations against tower he said he did so because he 
understood the fbi had ended its own work on the case and was out 
of business 
as the senate opened its fourth day of debate on the nomination 
republican leader bob dole of kansas said he found it very 
troubling that nunn had acted on his own to reopen the tower 
investigation using senate employees 
why are we investigating senator tower dole asked isnt 
the fbi record adequate when does this investigation stop 
nunn later told dole that there were three or four new 
allegations and said he had advised republicans on the 
investigations panel before acting 
he said he had been told the fbi was no longer on the case so 
forwarding the allegations to the bureau would have been an 
exercise in futility 
there was no other way to check them nunn said adding that 
iot would satisfy him if the fbi took over 
republicans including sen arlen specter rpa said they found 
nunns action questionable and inappropriate 
meanwhile today senate majority leader george mitchell said that 
while some other democrats may follow the lead of sen howell 
heflin dala and announce support for tower there are not enough 
votes to confirm the nominee 
mitchell said also that while some republicans are talking of 
prolonging the debate through easter he wants a vote soon 
certainly this week 
commenting in the aftermath of heflins decision to support 
tower mitchell dmaine said it is entirely possible some other 
democrats may follow the senators lead 
i feel that when the vote is taken the nomination will be 
rejected mitchell said i do not believe there are sufficient 
votes to result in the confirmation of senator tower 
bush commenting at an impromptu news conference at the white 
house this morning said john tower has said hell never touch 
another drop of liquor and hell have 25000 people at the pentagon 
making sure he keeps his word i would say we have a failsafe 
guarantee 
heflins decision on monday heartened towers republican leaders 
who said they may yet ask the senate to let the nominee defend his 
battered reputation from the floor of the chamber itself 
mitchell told reporters today he is prepared to comment on that 
possibility but will do so only if the request is actually made 
some senators who are not part of the gop leadership have said 
the debate may be extended through easter mitchell said he will 
oppose such a lengthy delay 
it is my hope it can be concluded soon and certainly this 
week he said 
heflin said monday that the fbi had not built a persuasive case 
against tower he said he is convinced the nominee would not break 
his pledge never to drink again if confirmed as the nations defense 
chief he said tower is qualified for the job by reason of 
background and expertise in military affairs 
but the encouragement gop leaders drew from heflins announcement 
was dampened when another southern democrat sen david pryor of 
arkansas said he would vote no 
i feel this man is going to create rather than solve 
problems pryor said 
pryor cited the former texas senators lucrative consulting ties 
with leading defense contractors after leaving government service as 
a us arms negotiator and as chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
heflin and pryor announced their decisions shortly after 
president bush called on democrats to put aside partisanship and 
support the nominee basing their decisions on their personal 
knowledge of towers 24year senate career rather than rumor and 
innuendo 
heflin is a former chief justice of the alabama supreme court and 
chairman of the senate ethics committee republicans said that if 
someone of heflins background is unconvinced by allegations against 
tower in the massive fbi report other democrats might be persuaded 
to follow his lead 
the most recent associated press survey found 47 democrats and 
one republican sen larry pressler rsd either solidly 
opposed or leaning against confirmation forty republicans and one 
democrat were either leaning for or supporting confirmation 
we have a better chance but its still an uphill fight said 
sen william cohen rmaine after heflins announcement were 
looking for more good men 
republican leaders met with white house chief of staff john 
sununu and said later that the possibility of asking the senate to 
permit tower to come to the senate floor to answer questions remains 
an option 
such a dramatic appearance if approved would be unique in the 
senates 200 years of experience in judging candidates for cabinet 
positions 
it would give tower the chance to rebut allegations that he has 
drinking problems has indulged in indiscreet behavior toward women 
and has opened the appearance of possible conflict of interest in 
his relations with the defense industry 
in making his announcement heflin said the president and the 
american people would see to it tower kept his word not to drink if 
confirmed as secretary of defense 
john tower if confirmed will live in a glass bowl heflin 
said no one will be more closely watched his most persistent 
watchdog will be the american people 
im willing to rely on his pledge and give him a chance to 
prove himself heflin said giving one a chance to redeem 
himself or herself is one of the great redeeming factors of the 
american way of life 
in addition to heflin the bush administration has courted sen 
bennett johnston dla who has labeled the fbi report on tower as 
unreliable 
johnston says he has not made a decision even though he believes 
there needs to be more fairness put into this process 
republicans said they are also looking at a short list of other 
possible democratic converts including sens chris dodd dconn 
charles robb dva lloyd bentsen dtexas and claiborne pell 
dri

q mr president back to helens question the sort of sense 
thats developing that lets say the john tower fight is sapping 
you your ability to get on with other issues how long are you 
willing to fight this fight let the debate go on are you ready to 
now call for them to have a vote say today or tomorrow just to get 
this behind you one way 
a no 
q or the other 
a no because lesley in the first place theres two major 
principles fair play and secondly the right of the president to 
have historical right to have who he wants in his administration 
and ive heard a lot of judgments on tower based on reports 
during people reading the same report and coming out with 
different judgment 
i want him 
i believe he is the best man for the job 
there are a lot of historical precedents behind my desire to have 
him and you might say right to have him barring any very clear 
reason not to 
and therefore i will stay with it 
and secondly its the senate that controls when they vote or 
not and i will leave that to bob dole and to george mitchell both 
of whom i think are conducting themselves very well 
q may i ask you 
a this is a followup yeah 
q a question about the chain of command question because the 
senator admits to excessive drinking which would disqualify him for 
a job in the socalled chain of command does this not disturb you 
at all that thats the qualification for a job 
a no i think hell measure up to that qualification 
indeed he has said hed never touch another drop of liquor and 
youll have 25000 people in the pentagon making sure thats true 
so what i mean heres a id say a failsafe guarantee 
it doesnt bother me 
and i 
q inaudible 
a no i think he i think when you look at the record and look 
at the testimony as i have and i havent had one single senator 
not one served with him over the years say i have seen him my 
firsthand evidence is this man is ineligible because of his 
consumption of spirits 
not one 
and isnt that a little bit unusual 
so i go right back to the presidents right to have his choice 
lets keep it on a nonpartisan basis 
i would just reurge that both senator nunn and george mitchell 
have told me wait a minute this isnt a partisan fight 
and i would simply ask that they keep reiterating that to those 
senators who may not have made up their minds with finality and 
lets go to a vote 
but im not going to pull back on this 
and lesley it isnt ironwilled stubbornness 
its a question of fundamental principle here 
and ive spelled out my call for fair play and im going to keep 
reiterating it 
so let the senate work its will 
its not going to hurt 
and this concept that you can never work in the future because 
people disagree with you in the senate i simply dont accept that 
q mr president you have said that the fbi report guns down the 
accusations against senator tower and yet you have also said that 
there can be no release in practical terms because of the 
confidentiality of people interviewed have you given consideration 
given the problem with the nomination to asking those interviewed 
to waive the right of confidentiality so that the public doesnt 
have to take your word for it as to the degree to which this report 
exonerates the senator

a confessed north korean agent said in 
court tuesday she planted the bomb that blew a south korean jetliner 
apart over the andaman sea in 1987 killing all 115 people aboard 
relatives of victims shouted insults as security agents led kim 
hyunhui into the courtroom for the opening session of her trial 
one relative screamed im here to kill you and another bring 
back my husband 
the 27yearold defendant buried her face in her hands and sobbed 
ms kim told the court later she bombed the korean air boeing 707 
on orders from leaders of communist north korea who wanted to 
disrupt the 1988 olympics in seoul the bomb exploded as the plane 
approached the burma coast nov 29 1987 on a flight to seoul from 
baghdad capital of iraq 
her admission came in response to questions by prosecutors after 
the prosecution finished presenting its evidence the court 
adjourned until march 21 when defense lawyers will present their 
case 
ahn kangmin the senior prosecutor asked whether the order to 
bomb the plane came from kim jung il son and heirapparent to north 
korean leader kim il sung ms kim replied yes in a barely 
audible voice 
recounting the defendants earlier confession to being a north 
korean agent the prosecutor said kim jung ils order was issued 
through a senior communist party official he said it the bombing 
was intended to frighten foreign countries away from the seoul 
olympics 
although ms kim had confessed to the bombing in a national news 
conference a year ago her trial was delayed as part of south 
koreas effort to avoid trouble with north korea before the games 
the north koreans have denied involvement in the bombing 
mass murder and destruction of an aircraft are among six counts 
against the defendant and she could be sentenced to death if 
convicted but indications are that her life would be spared 
government officials have said she probably would be pardoned and 
used for propaganda against north korea 
one said privately she deserves capital punishment but 
keeping her alive is more useful she is a valuable evidence showing 
north koreas atrocity 
he said other north korean agents captured by south korea 
including one who attacked the presidential mansion in 1968 had 
been pardoned for that purpose 
about 1500 police were deployed tuesday at the seoul district 
criminal court to hold back angry relatives and guard against a 
possible north korean attempt to assassinate ms kim everyone 
entering the court walked through a metal detector and was 
physically searched 
crying and wailing relatives allowed into the courtroom 
interrupted the hearing repeatedly and about 20 security agents 
surrounded ms kim two women lunged at her during the afternoon 
session and guards took them away 
some relatives shouted claims that she was a south korean agent 
being used by the government to discredit the north 
prosecutors opened the trial by reviewing the defendants life 
and asking questions about her training as a north korean 
intelligence agent she slumped forward in her chair and replied 
yes to the questions 
ms kim said she and another agent traveling on forged 
passports planted a bomb disguised as a radio and liquor when they 
flew on the plane from baghdad to abu dhabi 
she and her companion an elderly man were arrested in bahrain 
three days later and tried to kill themselves with cyanide hidden in 
cigarettes he died but ms kim recovered and was extradited 
at the televised news conference in january 1988 she said she 
was a north korean agent and had planted a bomb on the plane 
north korea demanded to be a cohost of the olympics which it 
saw as a political victory for south korea and boycotted them when 
the demand was refused 
the korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 and the two 
sides fought a war in 195053

a or the word of the opponents yes we have thought about that 
and im not sure where our counsels office stands on it 
but ill tell you that the precedent is troubling when you take 
testimony and then and then certainly you cant go ahead and 
release 
i mean i just could not do that 
and i think its very damaging in the future 
so im saying i have read it this is my view and it is its 
inhibiting because it does confine the debate on the floor 
but i really worry about the precedent 
so i have not been pushing for sanitization and then release or 
for selective release or for i hadnt thought about this concept 
of going to somebody and say would you release us from 
confidentiality 
i think that would chill future proceedings 
lets go back in the back right in the middle back there 
q mr president you mentioned yesterday in the speech to the 
vfw that this 90day deadline that you had imposed on yourself for 
the strategic review might slip because you said that the results 
wouldnt be rushed is there going to be a new deadline and is the 
fact that you dont have a sitting defense secretary contributing to 
that 
a i hope theres not going to be any slippage 
i want that i want the budget review i want the management 
review completed by then 
and look not having a defense secretary in place no question 
that its an inhibiting factor 
but i went over to the bureau the other day in a i mean the 
defense department in a trip that was interpreted for one purpose 
and what i went over really for was a more was another 
purpose 
and the purpose i went over there for was please understand 
weve got to keep these reviews going forward 
and i am very grateful to those people some of whom wont be 
there in a new administration all of whom or most of whom have 
served in the past administration for seriously addressing 
themselves to these various reviews 
i hope we can make the target 
the minute thats made the target is made and the review 
comes then we have a lot of decisionmaking 
but i want to i dont want to be footdragging and therefore 
im going to try to keep the heat on without slippage there 
yes

when next winter rolls around no woman need 
worry that she will be left out in the cold 
italian designers showing their fallwinter 198990 collections 
here this week devote much of their creative talent to coats from 
the pratical polo to dramatic capes and elegant dusters 
the cut is as generous as it is cozy ample sleeves huge shawl 
collars and loosely pleated backs contribute to create a soft 
flowing effect most often belted at the waist these outer 
coverings are either cropped at the hip or so long they can double 
as street sweepers 
the favorite fabric is wool but leather and shearling also play 
heavily in the collections not to mention fur from fake to 
extravagant mink 
colors are warm fall shades ranging from forest greens to 
vineyard reds and purples to beiges and browns 
the unpractical but dramatically stylish cape often hooded like 
a medieval friars also makes a comeback 
ferragamo and genny who showed tuesday midway through the 
fashion week count heavily on the coat for winter warmth 
ferragamo the florentine family known for its town and country 
chic and its shoes presented a chocolate colored duster with super 
wide sleeves tied at the waist and a series of chic car coats with 
bright gold buttons 
on the whole the ferragamo collection was very smart and sporty 
with trim pants suits in black and white checkered patterns and 
patchwork leather blazers and kneelength skirts for daytime and 
sophisticated long sleeved silk jersey gowns buttoned or unbuttoned 
at the back with gold buttons for evening 
genny designed by versace but more subdued than his presentation 
of micro miniskirts during his own collection sunday night 
presented the most opulent coat wear seen thus far on the milan 
runway in his series of lavish mink wraps 
these unabashedly expensive creations made up no doubt of 
hundreds of skins to create the huge collar ample sleeve and wide 
swirling hemline go against the current conservationist trend for 
imitation furs in elegant styles favored among others by armani 
emporio and moschino 
the genny collection was snappy and young with a wide variety of 
pants ranging from mantailored to tightfitting jodhpurs and 
shortcropped jackets skirts were a mere four inches above the 
knee a conservative length for flamboyant versace but still had 
his trademark tight derriere 
evening at gennys is basically black enriched by traditional 
pearl accessories or an enticing rhinestone embroidered bustier 
peering out of a slinky chiffon gown

the bush administration will replace alan c 
nelson as head of the immigration and naturalization service an 
administration source said tuesday 
attorney general dick thornburgh who recently received a 
department audit that criticized management and operations of ins 
is searching for someone to take over the agency said the source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the source confirmed a report in tuesdays editions of the los 
angeles times that nelson would be not be kept as ins commissioner 
in the bush administration 
it has been long presumed by department watchers that nelson 
along with most other political officeholders in the justice 
department would be replaced 
nelson a san francisco lawyer close to former attorney general 
edwin meese iii became ins commissioner in 1982 
he was criticized by immigrant rights advocates for being slow to 
implement the provisions of the 1986 immigration reform law which 
provided for massive amnesty for illegal aliens 
ins became embroiled in a number of lawsuits charging that it was 
improperly making it difficult for illegal aliens to obtain legal 
status under the new law 
the justice department audit completed two weeks ago cited ins 
for its failure to conduct background checks on many applicants for 
citizenship and found that 23000 valuable naturalization 
certificates had been lost by the agencys miami regional office 
the special audit conducted at thornburghs request by the 
justice departments management division raised serious questions 
which are being reviewed now at the highest levels of the 
department spokesman david runkel said last week 
besides losing naturalization certifications which had a street 
value of up to 115 million ins was cited in the audit for failing 
to take action two years after investigators had discovered that 
61500 naturalized citizens had not surrendered their permanent 
resident alien cards

president bush today urged pilots threatening a 
sympathy slowdown in support of the eastern airlines strike not to 
make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute and 
stood by his opposition to government intervention to stop the 
walkout 
he said that if striking machinists try to shut down rail service 
he will ask congress to ban such secondary boycotts 
house speaker jim wright responded that bushs refusal to halt 
the strike by appointing an investigative panel would be 
unprecedented noting that over the past halfcentury 33 such 
boards have been named in transportation disputes 
bush said once again that he is determined to press his 
nomination of john g tower to be secretary of defense to a showdown 
vote in the senate because i want him and i believe he is the best 
man for the job 
bush reminded a white house press conference that tower has 
pledged not to touch a drop of liquor if he gets the defense job 
and youll have 25000 people in the pentagon making sure thats 
true 
the president said that his backing of tower against democratic 
opposition in the senate isnt ironwilled stubbornness its a 
question of fundamental principle here 
bush quickly added the news conference to his schedule this 
morning after an ice and snow storm forced cancellation of a 
presidential trip to lancaster pa and wilmington del 
the president gave a preliminary welcome to the soviet proposal 
made monday at an eastwest conference in vienna for a reduction in 
conventional weapons and military personnel in europe the proposal 
was outlined by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
it looks to me he is moving toward the oftstated public 
position of nato in this regard and that is good bush said but 
cautioned he had not yet seen secretary of state james a baker 
iiis cabled report on the conference of foreign ministers from nato 
countries and warsaw pact nations 
bush was asked if he would pursue linkage in his relations 
with the soviet union 
he said issues are related and if the soviets cooperate with the 
united states in one area it will respond in another area so 
there is linkage he said 
for example the president said he would welcome any reduction in 
soviet military aid to procommunist forces in central america or an 
increase in the number of soviet jews permitted to emigrate to the 
west he will welcome that 
when something good happens give them credit bush said 
there clearly has got to be some linkage 
bush said the tower debate has not immobilized his 
administration as some critics are saying countering simply that 
they are wrong 
he said the administration is not adrift were on track 
i will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up 
with bold new foreign policy proposals in 45 days bush said 
the president also defended his chief of staff saying john 
sununu the former new hampshire governor knows his way around 
washington and is doing his job well bush said he has total 
confidence in sununu 
on other issues he said 
there is not much question that the contra rebels in nicaragua 
will need additional humanitarian aid we simply cannot and i will 
not leave the contras out there with no humanitarian aid at all 
he said 
he is willing to be flexible on action to limit sales of 
automatic and semiautomatic weapons but the issue is a complicated 
one it isnt as easy as it seems for those who are understandably 
crying out to do something he said 
he did raise the issue of human rights in china during his visit 
to beijing but did so privately bush was criticized because the 
topic was not on his announced agenda but he said it was better 
handled quietly and i confidently expect jim baker will continue 
to raise it

gov michael s dukakis wife waved at reporters 
and held her husband tightly when she arrived home today after 
spending a month in an alcohol treatment program 
emerging from a car driven by her father harry ellis dickson 
kitty dukakis smiled broadly doesnt she look terrific said 
the governor his arm around her 
asked what was the best part of returning home mrs dukakis 
said being with my husband without missing a beat her husband 
added being with my wife 
mrs dukakis 52 had been in edgehill newport an intensive 
residential facility in rhode island since feb 5 she entered the 
facility after several bouts of excessive drinking at home following 
her husbands failed presidential bid 
following the familys wishes the governors staff was publicly 
silent about mrs dukakis condition and her treatment the 
governors press office has been bombarded with inquiries and 
interview requests but no plans have been made for mrs dukakis to 
discuss her experience 
mrs dukakis was driven home by the governor and by her father 
on the way home she visited with her 5weekold granddaughter 
kitty and i will never be able to thank personally the 
thousands of people in massachusetts and from throughout the country 
who have written or called with kind words of encouragement and love 
and support for her during her treatment dukakis said 
a statement by his office said mrs dukakis expects soon to 
resume a full and active schedule but provided no details 
one senior dukakis administration official said he had no reason 
to believe the treatment was not a success 
every indication from the governors attitude and what he has 
had to say is that it has been successful and that kitty is going to 
resume an active independently fulfilling schedule following up 
all the plans she had been making before said the source who 
refused to be identified 
our feeling is it is a private matter james dorsey the 
governors press secretary said but he added there may come a 
time when the governor and his wife decide to make it not a private 
matter

q mr president this is supposed to be the theme of the week 
is drugs this week and you mentioned again this morning your 
commitment to ridding the country of drugs but your designate for 
drug czar william bennett has said that as part of what the way 
that he would like to help end drug violence would be to consider a 
ban on semiautomatic weapons which is opposed to your own 
viewpoint and were getting more and more evidence from doctors and 
police that theres gunfire in the streets and wounds that they 
havent seen since the vietnam war because of these weapons what 
do you say to people whose families have family members have been 
maimed by these kinds of weapons 
a i say the same thing i say to a person whose family has maimed 
by a pistol or a explosive charge or whatever else it might be a 
fire this is bad and we have got to stop the scourge of drugs 
and i talked to bill bennett about that because i said bill 
what can be worked out with finality on ak47s what can be done and 
still you know do whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
id love to find an answer to that rita because i do think that 
there has to be some assurance that these automated attack weapons 
are not used in the manner theyre being used 
so id like to and i told bill i said look i dont worry 
about what you said up there i said i can identify with what 
was behind your thinking on that very very easily 
id like to find some accommodation 
the problem as you know is that automated ak47s are banned 
and semiautomated are not 
so in they come and then they get turned over to automated 
weapons by through some filing down 
it isnt as easy as it seems to those who are understandably 
crying out do something do something 
but ive tasked bill ive said bill work the problem find 
out and im not so rigid that i cant if you come to me with a 
sensible answer that takes care of the concerns ive felt over the 
years ill take a hard look at it and ill work with you to that 
end 
dave 
q mr president do you support the republican congressional 
committees decision to make jim wright its no 1 target next year 
and doesnt that conflict with your 
a hey listen ive got enough fights on my hands now dave 
i laughter im not looking for any more 
let the congress do its thing and ill just stay right where i 
am plugging away on a matter of principle for a battle thats going 
on in the ill let you know if i want to take on any more 
yeah 
q mr president on foreign policy theres some confusion over 
how you feel about linkage about linking soviet good behavior 
particularly in central america to granting them technological 
transfers and economic credits if gorbachev helps you in central 
america specifically nicaragua are you willing to help him 
economically

secretary of state james a baker iii has 
concluded that attacks by plo guerrillas against israelis in 
southern lebanon were not acts of terrorism requiring a breakoff of 
us talks with yasser arafats organization 
a senior state department official aboard bakers plane on the 
way home from vienna said tuesday concerning what should be labeled 
terrorism we make a mistake if we define that too closely 
in washington president bush was asked at his news conference 
whether arafat in refusing to criticize the raids was backing down 
on his condemnation of terrorism 
i hope not and id like to see him forthrightly condemn any 
terror that might be perpetrated by the palestinians bush 
answered i stop short of saying hes condoning it or that he is 
furthering it im not saying that but id like to see him speak 
out it would do wonders it would be very good for a future 
dialogue 
when the questioner asked if arafat was jeopardizing the current 
dialogue bush replied to the degree terroristic acts are 
condoned it doesnt help the dialogue 
arafats renunciation of terrorism and recognition of israels 
right to exist prompted the united states last december to open 
talks with the palestine liberation organization 
since then plo guerrillas have conducted at least three raids 
against israeli forces raids the israeli government contends were 
aimed at infiltrating israel itself 
senior us officials including thenassistant secretary of 
state richard w murphy had said at the onset of the dialogue that 
it would be suspended if terrorism recurred 
baker subsequently warned the plo the attacks could hurt the 
talks and us efforts to resolve the arabisraeli conflict last 
friday the state department questioned arafats commitment and 
whether he wanted to control plo factions that carried out the raids 
if the plo leadership cannot or will not exercise such control 
it raises questions regarding the commitments undertaken in the name 
of the plo indeed questions about the plos ability to carry out 
their commitment spokesman charles e redman said 
the strong statement appeared to suggest the bush administration 
was reconsidering the dialogue 
but as baker flew home from vienna where he had met with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze that impression dissolved 
bakers view is that the dialogue should continue the 
official said it is important 
for baker he said the real test is terrorism we make a 
mistake if we define that too closely 
the official recalled the late supreme court justice potter 
stewarts observation that he could not define pornography but would 
know it when he saw it bakers view on terrorism was described to 
reporters as similar to stewarts on pornography 
for instance the official said baker considers the attack on 
the us marine headquarters near beirut in october 1983 in which 
241 marines and sailors were killed as an act of terrorism

a look the more cooperation we can get on regional objectives 
our regional objectives in this instance the democratization of 
central america the more help we can get towards that end by the 
soviets with pulling back their large amount of military support 
the better it would be between relations 
so there is linkage 
but when it gets to the specifics of what ill be willing to do 
thatll come out under this whole policy review 
but we are not going to back away from agenda items including 
regional tensions 
and when something good happens give some credit 
when the soviets come out of afghanistan which happened here not 
so long ago give them credit for that 
when you get lightening up a little bit on the question of soviet 
jews or something of that nature give some credit 
so there is i dont know exactly how to help you in terms of 
how much linkage there is but theres clearly got to be some 
linkage 
q sir have you been getting the cables back from vienna from 
secretary of state baker hes been meeting with foreign minister 
shevardnadze is shevardnadze saying anything encouraging along this 
line 
a well i havent gotten i hadnt seen the overnight cable 
from baker reporting on that meeting so i cant comment 
i read some reports of what shevardnadze said in terms of 
conventional forces and it looks to me like hes moving towards the 
oftstated public position of nato in this regard and that is good 
where its not a question of numbers you take out its a question 
of numbers that are left when you finish taking troops out 
so i think theres been some encouraging but i have not yet 
seen the baker report and i havent talked to him since his visit 
yes 
q mr president nonmilitary aid to the contras will run out at 
the end of the month do you plan to propose new aid to the contras 
and some package of carrots and sticks for the sandinistas 
a well i hope there are some i hope there is some 
understanding on the hill that these people must not be left without 
humanitarian aid 
and we have already through the secretary of state before he 
left pointed out that that was my inclination was to strongly 
support the appeal for humanitarian aid 
we simply cannot and i will not leave the contras out there 
with no humanitarian aid at all ability to stay alive at this 
juncture 
q but will you would a package include some promise of renewed 
military aid depending on the sandinistas behavior at this point 
a we are talking as i think the secretary said the other day 
about how best to move the process of democratization forward 
had a very interesting talk with mr cerezo on that 
and im hopeful that before the 90day period is up you know on 
the presidents coming out that we can get some very clear 
statements

engineers tuesday replaced a failed 
electronic part on discovery with one borrowed from sister ship 
columbia and nasa said it hopes to launch the space shuttle and its 
five astronauts on monday 
were still pressing ahead toward a monday launch at 807 
am said space agency spokesman dick young but he said a firm 
date might not be set until wednesday after the replacement part 
had been thoroughly checked out 
the launch which will deploy a 100 million communications 
satellite had been set for saturday after three earlier 
postponements but it received another setback on monday with the 
failure of a system that commands separation of the two booster 
rockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight 
engineers replaced the unit with one from space shuttle columbia 
and began the testing of it on the launch pad tuesday 
the unit detonates explosives in flight to separate such things 
as the spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets and 
fuel tank from the ship 
nasa has said if discovery is not launched by march 18 it might 
have to yield the pad to space shuttle atlantis which is set for 
liftoff april 28 on a highpriority mission in which it will propel 
the magellan probe toward venus 
magellan must be launched between that date and may 23 because 
the planet will not be in proper position again until 1991 
discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since the 
challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years 
ago 
during five days in orbit the astronauts are scheduled to deploy 
a communciations satelllite and conduct medical and scientific 
experiments

lubbock may be george bushs peoria 
he cited a fan from the texas city on tuesday in defending the 
beginning of his administration which some critics contend is 
getting off to a slow start 
bush told a white house news conference that he had talked to a 
fellow from lubbock texas the other day and he said all the 
people in lubbock think things are going just great 
the reference to populatiry in a smaller city in the nations 
midsection evoked memories of the phrase will it play in peoria 
which became popular in the nixon administration 
if lubbock is to replace peoria as the standard for middle 
american acceptance lets see how the two compare based on 
statistics reported in the census bureaus county and city data 
book 1988 
lubbock is physically bigger with 1063 square miles of land 
compared to just 422 square miles in peoria lubbock has more 
people too outnumbering its illinois companion 186400 to 110290 
but peoria is a bit more crowded at 2614 people per square mile 
compared to 1754 in lubbock 
the two cities are diverging in size 
from 1980 to 1986 the sun belt city of lubbock saw its 
population grow 72 percent over the same time peoria lost 112 
percent of its residents 
in racial breakdown the cities are somewhat similar peoria has 
a population that is 81 percent white and 17 percent black while 
lubbock is 81 percent white and nearly 19 percent black peoria has 
about 1 percent asians to help make up the discrepancy 
on the other hand 19 percent of lubbocks residents are 
hispanic while this group makes up only 14 percent of the people 
in peoria hispanics can be of any race 
peoria is older with 123 percent of its people aged 65 and 
over compared to 78 percent in lubbock 
lubbocks birth rate is 201 births per 1000 people compared to 
165 for peoria while the death rate is 98 per 1000 in peoria and 
66 for lubbock 
peoria has a narrow lead in high school graduates 696 percent 
of its residents compared to 693 percent in lubbock on the other 
hand lubbock counts 224 percent of its people with four years of 
college compared to 165 percent in peoria 
per capita income in peoria in 1985 was 11140 compared to 
10452 for lubbock with 124 percent of the people in the illinois 
metropolis below the poverty level compared to 144 percent in the 
texas city 
peoria in the midwestern farm belt is twice as wet as the 
semiarid high plains city in texas rain averages nearly 35 inches 
annually in peoria but only 177 inches in lubbock 
peoria is also colder with an average january low reading of 
133 degrees fahrenheit compared to a low of 243 degrees for 
lubbock 
but summers are hotter in texas with julys high averaging 910 
degrees for lubbock and 855 degrees for peoria

but in terms of humanitarian aid i dont think therell be much 
resistance to that at all 
yeah 
q mr president on another regional question yasser arafat has 
refused to criticize any of the raids within israel that have been 
carried out is he backing down on his promise against terrorism 
a i hope not and id like to see him forthrightly condemn any 
terror that might be perpetrated by the palestinians 
i stop short of saying hes condoning it or that he is furthering 
it im not saying that 
but id like to see him speak out it would do wonders 
it would be very good for a future dialogue 
yes jim 
q well is he jeopardizing the dialogue as it sits now 
a to the degree terroristic acts are condoned it doesnt help 
the dialogue 
yes 
q there is a school of thought in washington mr president 
that perception is often reality or becomes reality the perception 
is that your administration is floundering that your white house 
staff is inept how do you deal with it how do you turn it around 
a i ask for your forbearance and leadership in this regard 
pointing out all the things that i spelled out in the beginning 
comparing that in terms of appointments 
ive spared you the statistics on appointments which i had 
prepared because one of the hits is you havent sent up any 
names you havent done anything about names 
and so i would refer to my notes jerry if thats all right 
and i have lost my notes on this no here they are 
and in terms of the reaganbush administration at this juncture 
55 names as of march 6th had been announced 
on the bushquayle administration 67 have been announced 
so its not bad 
were a little bit ahead in terms of announced names 
now youve got some different problems here because one is 
nomination and the other is intent to nominate 
and intent to nominate means theres still some more paperwork to 
be done 
but in terms of who we want in place were moving along all 
right 
id like to see it faster of course but thats one of the 
allegations disarray 
first i have great confidence in my staff and every chief of 
staff goes through this drill where he gets saluted for his 
brilliance and a month later he gets attacked for his something 
else 
and i have total confidence in john sununu 
he knows the way this town works 
he has a respect level that comes from being a and there he is 
laughs a respect level that comes from being a governor 
and so were all used to this 
hey this is light compared to what it was like about a year ago 
in my case so thats why i still feel relaxed

american workers productivity rose a barely 
perceptible 01 percent from october through december while unit 
labor costs a major inflation measure for business shot up at an 
annual rate of 56 percent the government reported tuesday 
the latest news from the labor department confirmed an initial 
report by the department a month ago which showed that productivity 
or output per hour of work turned sluggish in the final three 
months of the year while inflationary pressures intensified 
the 56 percent rise in unit labor costs was almost double the 
37 percent rate of increase in the third quarter unit labor costs 
reflect changes in hourly compensation as well as changes in 
productivity 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan last week cited labor 
costs as one of the factors behind the central banks recent 
decision to push interest rates higher in an effort to fight 
inflation 
analysts said that tuesdays report which did not revise the 
unit labor costs from the initial estimate would likely add to the 
central banks resolve to keep pushing interest rates higher 
especially if the report on february unemployment to be released on 
friday comes in as strong as expected 
with demand for workers pushing up against tight labor markets 
and high factory operating rates economists are worried that 
resulting pressures are starting to be seen in rising wage demands 
by workers and productprice increases on the part of businesses 
almost any reasonable person has to be scared about inflation 
right now said david wyss an economist with data resources inc 
of lexington mass there is clear evidence that compensation 
costs are accelerating 
the fear is that if wage demands begin chasing rising consumer 
prices the country could be plunged back into a wageprice spiral 
similar to the one in the 1970s that thenfederal reserve chairman 
paul volcker fought with the steep 198182 recession 
the 56 percent rate of increase for unit labor costs in the 
fourth quarter reflected a 56 percent rise in hourly compensation 
which includes wages and salaries as well as fringe benefits 
in the final six months of the year hourly compensation was 
rising at an annual rate of 57 percent a sharp acceleration from 
an annual rate of 39 percent in the first six months of 1988 
analysts said most of the increase in the final half of the year 
reflected rising health insurance costs 
for the year as a whole productivity increased 14 percent 
matching the average annual gains since the end of the 198182 
recession 
the final quarters 01 percent rise in nonfarm business 
productivity reflected a 37 percent increase in output which was 
nearly offset by a 36 percent rise in the number of hours worked 
the weak advance continued a sawtooth pattern in which a strong gain 
in one quarter has been followed by a poor showing in the next 
productivity rose at an annual rate of 34 percent in the first 
quarter of 1988 dropped at a rate of 24 percent in the second 
quarter and then rebounded at a 2 percent rate in the julyseptember 
quarter 
michael k evans head of a washington forecasting firm said 
that the 14 percent advance for the year while up from a 08 
percent increase in 1987 was still a dismal performance compared to 
the rapid gains of 33 percent posted in the two decades following 
world war ii when american workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a 
rising standard of living 
this set of figures reinforces the fact that productivity 
growth in this country is still very sluggish he said if 
productivity is hardly growing at all that means that peoples 
standard of living is not rising either 
the bush administration is counting on productivity rising about 
2 percent a year as a key underpinning of its economic forecast 
which sees the budget deficit being eliminated by the year 1993 
however many private economists believe this forecast is overly 
optimistic despite a major push by us industry since the last 
recession to modernize production facilities 
tuesdays productivity report showed that total us 
productivity including the farm sector fell at an annual rate of 2 
percent in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting the continued 
effects of last summers severe drought

but the point is to if you would just write down all of those 
wonderful things i told you that are happening and get it out to 
that wide readership it would be very helpful to me 
and i think and also ill refer you to the phone call in 
lubbock laughter 
and that is that is never get all too uptight about about 
stuff that hasnt reached lubbock yet and be sure that theres some 
accomplishments going on 
q in peoria 
a accomplishments going on that people can say wait a 
minute theres quite a bit happening here 
q but sir if i could follow up is there a danger here sir 
is there a potential danger if the perception lingers 
a youre in a better position to answer that than i am 
however i think you know i come back to the tower thing 
i think people are fair 
they are not making up their minds on perceptions make them 
up on facts 
and i am one who felt that way coming out of the campaign 
thats why i go back to that 
it was a very important thing to me what happened after about a 
year ago and what you know here i stand here 
and so i dont think the american people make up their minds on 
perceptions 
i think they make up their minds on facts 
now you can have various waves of approval or disapproval but i 
think if we can just get our message out on the facts the way ive 
spelled them out here i think well do fine 
but ive you know 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater its after 1130 
bush yeah 
q mr president id like to ask you about one of the facts that 
youve cited in your list 
a yeah 
q you said that the budget that youve sent to the hill has more 
detail than any than the budgets of the last two administrations 
im a little confused about that what are you referring to since 
yours does not list any of the domestic 
a more detail has been sent to the hill at this time in our 
administration let me clarify that than at any time for either 
the reagan administration 1981 or the carter administration in 77 
they hadnt gone up with near this amount of detail to the hill 
and we have a document that we should pass out to you because it 
is quite important that this be understood

housing secretary jack kemp in a congressional 
appearance that in itself signaled a change from the reagan 
administration pledged tuesday to steward hud into a new era 
and vigorously seek solutions to the nations housing ills 
i dont think theres been a time when there have been more 
people willing to put aside partisan differences and try to find 
solutions to the vexing problems in our society kemp said in his 
first testimony as secretary of housing and urban development 
well leave politics until 1992 he said 
kemp who has already toured several public housing projects in 
an ambitious schedule outlined a series of sharp turns away from 
the last eight years and said hes willing to be audacious in 
addressing inner city problems 
he said his priorities include strong enforcement of last years 
fair housing law the revitalization of what he called the third 
world economies of inner cities and a hope to end homelessness in 
the united states 
i believe that a dream must be recaptured for our urban cities 
and for those people urban and rural who today live their lives in 
poverty and despair said kemp a former nineterm congressman 
from upstate new york 
but members of the house committee on banking finance and urban 
affairs were as impressed with his appearance as with what kemp 
said his predecessor samuel pierce last testified in congress in 
march 1985 as hud became a battleground over reagan era spending on 
social programs 
snow sleet or rain i think its very symbolic that i am here 
today said kemp adding were all in the process of putting 
aside partisan difference to see what works 
he pledged to implement vigorously the law congress passed 
last year strengthening federal regulations against housing 
discrimination 
i am going to steward hud into a new era of fair housing 
enforcement kemp said we will try to end to the extent 
possible discrimination in housing 
kemp also promised that president bush will fully fund the 
mckinney act which congress passed last year over reagan 
administration objections to provide housing for the homeless 
this from a historical standpoint is something that can no 
longer be neglected he said im not going to approach this 
from some 18th century laissez faire attitude i believe our 
priority should be to end homelessness 
a booster of enterprise zones in which businesses would get tax 
breaks for locating in certain areas kemp said he will push the pet 
project but bowed to opponents by saying i dont think of 
enterprise zones as a panacea 
my mind is open he told the committee my door is open i 
want you to know my heart will be open to solutions as well 
although most members of the committee lauded kemp warmly 
several urged him to seek more money for housing programs and said 
theyll judge his commitment by the bottom line in president bushs 
budget 
hope is no substitute for a positive program said rep nancy 
pelosi dcalif i will hold you to your rhetoric and your claim 
to do something about homelessness

the national park service requested help 
from the army as fears mounted that three japanese climbers trying 
to make a winter ascent of mount mckinley were near death somewhere 
near the summit 
the park service on tuesday said little can be done until 
hurricaneforce winds buffeting the 20320foot peak abate 
the climbers have not been heard from in more than a week and are 
believed to have run out of food six days ago said john quinley a 
park service spokesman the men have a radio but have made no 
contact he said 
the army has chinook helicopters specially equipped for 
highaltitude rescues but they are not expected to be able to fly 
until thursday or friday because of the wind quinley said 
an army plane circled the mountain repeatedly on monday 
broadcasting messages but received no response from the climbers 
quinley said 
quinley said park rangers believe the climbers could be holed up 
in a snow cave somewhere between 17000 feet and the summit of mount 
mckinley north americas highest peak 
he said there is also concern that the men have run out of fuel 
needed to melt snow without water they could quickly succumb to 
dehydration and hypothermia 
mckinley because of its location near the arctic circle is 
judged to be one of the most difficult winter climbs 
based on what they took theyre six days out of food 
quinley said but the park service has a cache at 17200 
apparently fairly close to where they would be camped and theres 
food and fuel there 
the national weather service reported sustained winds of 60 mph 
to 100 mph in the area climbing ranger bob seibert of talkeetna 
estimated those winds reach 90 mph to 200 mph as they funnel through 
passes in the mountains 
he identified the missing climbers as 39yearold noboru yamada 
the group leader 31yearold teruo saegusa and 34yearold kozo 
komatsu all of tokyo

maxim shostakovich will raise the baton before 
a soldout house wednesday night in a concert that backers hope 
signals the end of years of debt and discord for the new orleans 
symphony 
the symphony suspended operation a year ago unable to pay its 
musicians and nearly 4 million in debt 
it is reopening with the help of volunteers corporate gifts 
donated services and free rent for five years its president said 
tuesday 
im elated said ronald w jones who assumed the job of 
bailing out the orchestra in december we have put together a 
wonderful staff that has been working 24 hours a day doing what 
everyone said couldnt be done 
the financial crisis had been building for years and was blamed 
on mismanagement before the symphony got a fulltime manager in 
1986 public and corporate financial support eroded and the money 
problems led to a musicians walkout in 1987 
jones president of louisiana cocacola bottling was picked to 
head the symphony board and engineer a comeback 
it really got to people in this city when the symphony was 
dark they realized what they were in danger of losing and decided 
to make sure it wouldnt happen jones said 
jones also helped the city during last summers republican 
national convention he took over a faltering private fund drive and 
helped raise the 5 million needed to pay new orleans cost of 
serving as host 
donations of 225000 earmarked for the symphony if it reopened 
will pay off the remaining debts and leave the books in the black 
thursday morning jones said 
the symphonys home the orpheum theater is being completely 
restored and has been sold to seven investors eliminating 24 
million of the symphonys debts jones said the investors who have 
asked not to be identified have agreed to let the symphony use the 
theater for free for five years 
the work on the theater has been done by volunteers and 
contractors who have donated their services for the most part 
jones said 
in addition to eliminating the debt jones said the symphony had 
two other goals selling out their first performance and 50 percent 
sales of the subscription tickets 
our opening concert has been sold out for over a week and our 
subscription sales are running at 80 percent he said 
shostakovich music director of the symphony will conduct a 
program of chopin brahms and wagner in the reopening concert it 
will be the third season for the son of the russian composer dmitri 
shostakovich

judge gerhard a gesell irritated by repeated 
interruptions of oliver norths trial by claims that national 
security was about to be violated warns lawyers in a blistering 
memo that he will no longer honor claims he considers frivolous 
in an order late monday dismissing a north contention that 
prosecutors were guilty of misconduct gesell blamed many of the 
problems in handling secret documents on the bush administration 
the north trial was in recess tuesday because of snow and 
freezing rain 
it has become clear gesell said in the written order that many 
documents were classified only for purposes of the north trial now 
in its fifth week when they were not deemed secret before 
not that they all should be out in the open the us district 
judge added 
it is now abundantly clear that many documents that should have 
been classified from the outset were not classified in any way at 
certain agencies such as the national security council and 
department of state he wrote 
no effort was made to follow rules set down for classification 
and this has resulted in a haphazard process of review of 
nonclassified materials to determine what can now be released 
publicly he said 
triggering the judges ire was an instance last month while 
robert owen norths courier to the rebels fighting the nicaraguan 
government was being questioned during questioning about letters 
owen had written to north prosecutors used versions of the letters 
with some names and places censored 
but it turned out that uncensored versions of the memos long ago 
had been turned over by owens lawyer to a private group the 
christic institute which was involved in a lawsuit and that the 
prosecution had known about it for two weeks the institute made the 
uncut documents available to news organizations 
owens lawyer said he had told prosecutors on feb 10 in the 
office of independent counsel lawrence walsh about the memos 
becoming public informed at the time were office security chief 
allen stansbury prosecutor michael bromwich and another attorney in 
the office stansbury asked owens lawyer to turn over the memos 
but he refused and no one in walshs office took any further action 
until the christic institute announced its intention to publicize 
the uncensored text 
stansbury made only a halfhearted attempt to retrieve copies 
of the memoranda said gesell he made no attempt to retrieve 
them from the christic institute he became uncertain and 
confused his boss at the department of justice was out of town and 
he simply did not act he proved incompetent for the task 
assigned to him 
bromwich too was to blame said gesell for letting the matter 
slip his mind but he had no purpose to conceal or to mislead 
the whole brouhaha said gesell illustrates a problem which 
continues to plague the course of the trial how to apply the law 
which governs handling of secret material in court 
while an interagency group has worked on classifying and 
declassifying documents for trial he said it has at the same time 
created uncertainty about the status of many papers 
it leads to the often absurd situation where the press is 
accurately reporting information in the public domain while the 
court is confronted with representations that the same facts must 
never be officially acknowledged he said 
gesell called attention to an appeals court decision in another 
case this year that district courts can ignore claims of 
classification that are frivolous 
should the occasion warrant said gesell he will do just that

reports that the bush administration is off to 
a stumbling start are common in the nations capital but the 
president said they havent reached lubbock yet and he wont be 
upset until they do 
a lot is happening said the president tuesday obviously 
nettled by commentaries that very little appears to be going on in 
his administration 
not all of it good but a lot is happening bush told an 
impromptu white house news conference 
at the top of the list of the notsogood things happening for 
the new administration is the prolonged fight over the nomination of 
former texas sen john tower to be secretary of defense 
but that was not all critics have also said the administration 
is moving very slowly in filling other posts 
bush said that was a bad rap and offered some numbers to make his 
case 
he noted that eight years ago as president reagan was forming 
his administration at this juncture 55 names as of march 6th 
had been announced on the bushquayle administration 67 have been 
announced so its not bad were a little bit ahead in terms of 
announced names 
david gergen a former bush adviser and reagan white house aide 
who now is editor at large of us news and world report put the 
numbers in a different perspective in an article published last 
weekend in the washington post 
gergen said the president had nominated people for only two of 41 
pentagon slots that require senate confirmation gergen used similar 
figures for other cabinet departments two of 17 at transportation 
two of 20 at energy and one of 18 at interior 
perhaps more telling than the numbers was the perception that 
bush was not matching his own rhetoric 
the day after his election victory bush said i will for the 
most part bring in a brand new team of people from across the 
country that will reinvigorate the process 
so far the new team has a familiar look about it 
to head the 14 cabinet departments bush stuck with three 
holdovers from the reagan administration and chose three others who 
had held cabinetlevel jobs in the preceding eight years 
four appointments went to veteran washington hands who had served 
in congress including tower and former reps jack kemp manuel 
lujan and edward derwinski 
one outsider nominated was robert mosbacher very much a bush 
insider from texas the other three outsiders were louis sullivan 
james watkins and samuel skinner 
not an unfriendly critic of the president gergen startled some 
washingtonians with such observations as there is a deepening 
sense in washington that something is badly amiss in his bushs 
administration 
some of his most ardent friends furrow their brows and quietly 
shake their heads so far despite some excellent appointments 
at the top it the administration has put together only a shell of 
a government 
gergen anticipated bushs contention that all was well in the 
west texas city of lubbock 
he noted that president carter a democrat learned that when the 
washington beltway crowd turns against an administration those 
feelings ripple out and can eventually sink a president 
the first shots often are aimed at the chief of staff in bushs 
case former gov john sununu of new hampshire a man who is 
described as bright and abrasive in roughly equal proportions 
every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets 
saluted for his brilliance and a month later he gets attacked for 
his something else and i have total confidence in john sununu 
said the president 
while it was a heartfelt endorsement the fact that bush felt he 
had to express his confidence in his chief of staff was an early 
sign that the knives are out for the former governor 
but it was a phone conversation with a supporter in lubbock that 
the president was most eager to talk about 
the supporter bush said had commented all the people in 
lubbock think things are going just great 
bush said he learned from the call never to get all too 
uptight about about stuff that hasnt reached lubbock yet and be 
sure that theres some accomplishments going on he said 
that may prove true but will it play in peoria

harry andrews a craggy jutjawed character actor 
who specialized in military roles has died at the age of 77 
andrews died in his sleep monday night at his home in the 
southern village of salehurst said his agent lawrence evans 
andrews made his stage debut at age 21 and had many shakespearean 
roles including horatio in hamlet in new york in 1936 he 
served as an artilleryman in world war ii and made his first movie 
in 1952 opposite alan ladd in the red beret 
he once said he was offered a hollywood contract in his younger 
days but they wanted me to have my ears pinned back like clark 
gable and the gap filled in between my front teeth i wouldnt have 
minded that but then they said the name was too plain and would 
have to go and a bit of chin so i said no 
instead he became a stalwart of postwar british cinema most 
memorably as the tough warden of a british army prison opposite sean 
connery in the 1965 film the hill 
andrews towering physique and growling voice made him a natural 
for the part of a general in the battle of britain in 1969 but 
he also showed a comic flair as the campy older man in 1970s 
entertaining mr sloane 
in 1985 he was in hollywood appearing in a play when he was 
asked to play a singleepisode deathbed scene as blake carringtons 
longlost father in dynasty 
andrews told the daily mail he had never been a tv watcher and 
i was startled when the americans in my play kept saying to me 
gosh an episode of dynasty what an accolade 
actress sylvia syms who starred with andrews in the 1958 war 
movie ice cold in alex remembered him as the gentle giant 
he was a perfect gentleman and a lovely softspoken man i 
cant think of anything nasty to say about him except that he had 
bony knees

eastern airlines struggled to restore its 
northeast shuttle tuesday throwing its strikediminished work force 
into an intense battle with competitor pan am for the lucrative line 
fly us with no reservations eastern declared in fullpage 
newspaper advertisements pledging routine service between 
washington new york and boston our no 1 priority is to keep the 
shuttle flying 
but ridership was low at eastern while pan am moving 
aggressively to capture eastern regulars reported strong shuttle 
business since the strike saturday pan am has doubled its 
rushhour service added a bigger airplane and aggressively promoted 
its frequentflier program to shuttle passengers 
we dont look at this as extra capacity for a few days we look 
at it as an opportunity to win longterm allegiance said pan am 
spokesman jeff kriendler we are trying to take advantage of the 
special opportunity 
its fair said tim cook a spokesman for eastern which is 
selling its shuttle to developer donald trump if the tables were 
turned he said wed be doing the same thing 
eastern which has operated its shuttle for 27 years held just 
over half the business before the strike for a profit of about 30 
million last year the rest roughly 5000 passengers each weekday 
had been gradually wrested away by pan am since it opened its 
shuttle in 1986 
cook said eastern operated 60 percent of its shuttle flights 
monday the others canceled by snow not strikers and hoped to 
fly them all tuesday despite continued bad weather crews were 
mainly management employees 
patronage was low a source at eastern speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it had been averaging 15 or 20 passengers per 
shuttle flight ronnet anderson a new yorker on the 9 am shuttle 
from washington said it carried just four passengers 
a lot of people went over to pan am just to avoid the hassle 
cook conceded but were routine today and expect to be routine 
from here on out 
the problem may not be easterns for long with a pending 365 
million sale to trump some wall street analysts suggested the 
strike if it led to bankruptcy could endanger the sale others 
said trump will be getting a somewhat tarnished property 
the hardest thing in any marketing business is to get somebody 
to try your product said louis marckesano airline analyst at the 
philadelphia brokerage house janney montgomery scott inc if pan 
am indeed is able to provide a good product theres a good chance 
theyll be able to keep at least some of the additional traffic 
theyve taken from eastern 
but bruce nobles president of trump shuttle inc said he was 
not the least bit worried 
i think when we start operating its going to be big news 
nobles said i think the trump name is a very powerful name we 
are not worried about whether were starting from one market share 
or another market share 
pan am which has gone so far as to laminate shuttle travelers 
business cards into free luggage tags at its terminals this week 
had another view 
this just gives us a golden opportunity to get those eastern 
diehard passengers said perette ross shuttle marketing director 
for pan am hopefully theyll become loyalists to the pan am 
shuttle

druse warlord walid jumblatt blamed the bomb on gen michel 
aouns christian cabinet charging its was part of the lebanese 
leaders efforts to neutralize the wartorn nations private armies 
i looked out of the window and saw fire blazing in several 
cars a corpse in the middle of the street and people running in all 
directions said a man who watched the blast form a nearby 
building he refused to give his name 
the fourth car bomb in lebanon this year was placed in a yellow 
fiat that exploded in front of a fruit and vegetable stall off the 
main hamra commercial thoroughfare 
a woman maneuvering to park her car near the yellow fiat was 
killed when the bomb went off a police spokesman said the blast 
threw her body from the car 
he said the second woman a passerby suffered serious head 
wounds and died later in the hospital 
the bomb triggered fires in nine cars parked near the stall and 
shattered windows in surrounding buildings 
panicking motorists caused several accidents as the tried to flee 
the scene said a woman who identified herself only as a telephone 
operator from the nearby cavalier hotel 
ambulances were slowed by rushhour traffic the police spokesman 
said 
accountant jamal hamoud said he watched as gunmen fired their 
rifles in the air to make way for the ambulances 
ambulances evacuated only three of the wounded 
civilians carried most of the casualties on their backs to the 
american university hospital a few hundred yards away the police 
spokesman said 
most of those injured suffered minor cuts from glass shards he 
said 
jumblatt whose progressive socialist party militia is allied 
with the syrians who police west beirut said the bomb was a warning 
from aoun 
those who are trying to encircle us today sent us a 
boobytrapped message jumblatt claimed 
he was referring to efforts by aouns helicopter gunships and 
gunboats to prevent merchant ships from docking at illegal port 
facilities run by his and other militias along lebanons coastline 
the airandsea patrols started monday ignoring rocket fire by 
jumblatts militia based near jiye port south of beirut 
aouns aim to choke off the main revenues of private armies has 
provoked objections from syrianbacked moslem leaders who consider 
it an attempt to restrict their operations 
moslems refuse to recognize aouns military cabinet appointed by 
outgoing president amin gemayel in september after parliament failed 
to elect his successor they pledge allegiance to the moslem cabinet 
of acting prime minister salim hoss who governed under gemayel 
by police count 11 people were killed and 47 wounded in three 
january car bombings

a budget increase of 14 million to ease what one justice said is 
such a severe money pinch the court is having trouble paying for 
typewriter repairs 
were hurting justice sandra day oconnor told a house 
appropriations subcommittee we have a real strain on our budget 
we cant keep our typewriters operating 
the court is asking for 173 million for the fiscal year

over the current budget 
rep joseph d early dmass gave a mixed reception to oconnor 
and justice antonin scalia who also spoke in support of the budget 
request 
im really not that sympathetic he said we cant be all 
things to all people 
but later early expressed support and urged the justices to speak 
out more forcefully to attract attention to the courts plight 
its ludicrous to treat you the same way as anyone else he 
said weve got to spend more money 
i dont know waht you should be doing all threatening to 
resign or something early said 
adding that the entire federal court system needs more money he 
said theres not one federal judge who couldnt leave and 
increase his salary by 20 to 25 percent 
underscoring the point oconnor said she knew of one former 
clerk to a supreme court justice who recently left for private law 
practice and is earning more than the justices 
the annual salary of a supreme court justice is 110000 
included in the courts budget request are 110000 for library 
shelves and 160000 to improve its computer system 
oconnor said 18 staff positions at the court have not been 
filled because of a hiring freeze imposed to meet budget restraints 
every justices chambers and office of the court has been 
affected by the hiring freeze she said it is having a negative 
impact on the efficiency and morale of remaining employees who must 
take on extra work when positions become vacant 
rep neal smith diowa the subcommittee chairman said you 
shouldnt have to put up with it well see what we can do

actress meryl streep joined forces with a 
public interest group tuesday in launching a nationwide campaign to 
focus attention on concerns about the health effects of pesticides 
on young children 
the natural resources defense council a private environmental 
group recently gained widespread attention when it issued a report 
claiming the environmental protection agency does not adequately 
take into account the relativley high consumption of fruits and 
vegetables by children when setting limits on cancercausing 
pesticides 
the epa has denied the allegations and said that children are not 
exposed to an unusual health risk because of the pesticides 
ms streep said she hoped the campaign would put pressure on the 
government to reexamine its methods of setting pesticide standards 
on fruits and vegetables and promote the shift to organic farming so 
that such pesticides could be eliminated 
as parents we care passionately about our children we 
shouldnt have to worry about the safety of the food we feed them 
especially fruits and vegetables that are essential to our 
childrens health said ms streep who has three children 
she is cochair of mothers and others for pesticide limits 
which was formed to coordinate the campaign ms streep also agreed 
to take part in a television advertisement cautioning parents about 
the use of pesticides on fruits and their potential effects on 
children 
the group has bought time on a washington television station for 
the ad and plans to distribute it elsewhere around the country as a 
public service announcement said a spokesman david fenton

president bush asserted tuesday that he is as 
committed to human rights as former president reagan had been even 
though bush didnt publicly focus on the issue during his recent 
trip to china 
i think quiet discussion is a good approach to try to effect 
the human rights objectives that i feel very strongly about bush 
told a white house news conference 
the president defended his conduct in not making a big issue of 
an incident in which chinese police prevented dissident fang lizhi 
from attending a barbecue in beijing last week hosted by bush 
fang had been on bushs invitation list 
the very invitation to that dissident that they thoroughly 
disapproved of shows our public commitment to it human rights 
bush said 
reagan raised human rights issues in each of his meetings with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and once invited a group of 
soviet dissidents to meet with him in the us embassy in moscow 
on a trip to china in 1984 reagan protested angrily when chinese 
authorities censored parts of his nationally televised address 
including a portion dealing with religion 
still bush sought to draw a parallel between his own 
presentation of humanrights concerns in meetings with foreign 
leaders and reagans approach 
you know theres two schools of how you do the human rights 
agenda he said i think that president reagan was correct when 
he raised the human rights agenda with the soviets privately rather 
than beating his breast and doing it publicly 
and i think the results have been rather penetrating still a 
long way to go with the soviets bush said 
during his china trip bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said that bush had not raised the issues of human rights with 
chinese leaders presumably including the key issue of human rights 
in tibet scene of recent clashes between police and rioters seeking 
independence from beijing 
china on tuesday imposed martial law in the tibetan capital of 
lhasa after three days of antichinese rioting 
bush on tuesday said that the press secretarys statement was 
true up the point that fitzwater spoke but that he later raised the 
general issue in a private meeting with chinese senior leader deng 
xiaopeng 
it was raised by me personally he said 
on the subject of linking economic concessions to the soviets to 
humanrights progress including an easing of emigration 
restrictions on soviet jews bush said theres clearly got to be 
some linkage 
when soviets come out of afghanistan which happened here not 
so long ago give them credit for that when you get some lightening 
up a little bit on the question of soviet jews or something of that 
nature give some credit bush said

a top us roman catholic church official 
says he expects points of difference to emerge between the 
vatican and american bishops but no confrontation in an 
extraordinary meeting beginning wednesday 
there will be probably in any freeflowing discussion points 
of difference points of difference that will be discussed and 
faced said archbishop john l may of st louis president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops 
he didnt go into specifics but there have been differences over 
the right of catholics to dissent from church teaching to how much 
weight bishops conferences should have 
thirtyfive us prelates gathered tuesday in rome on the eve of 
the fourday meeting with pope john paul ii and top vatican 
officials 
the us bishops originally had requested the meeting in 1986 
when tensions with the vatican were high over its disciplining of 
several clergy members considered too permissive on such issues as 
ministering to homosexual groups and artificial birth control which 
the church bans 
as tensions eased in recent years the bishops considered 
dropping the request however the pope wanted the meeting held 
according to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
in his speeches to american catholics the pontiff has expressed 
concern about people who disagree with church teaching and practice 
what vatican officials call cafeteria catholicism obeying some 
doctrines and ignoring others 
in this weeks meetings he and other vatican officials are 
expected to encourage the bishops to be ardent proponents of church 
teaching in a secular society 
cardinal joseph ratzinger the west german who heads the powerful 
congregation for the doctrine of the faith will deliver a major 
address wednesday that is expected to set the vaticans tone for the 
meeting a vatican source described it as a thoughtprovoking 
talk 
vatican officials stress the meeting wont be confrontational 
may said the bishops hoped to bring to rome a better 
understanding of the 52 millionmember american catholic church 
theres been a lack of understanding on the part of some people 
in the vatican he said in an interview tuesday some of these 
men have not been in the united states or not very much some of 
them havent been as fully conversant with our ways of doing things 
in a cultural contest 
he said he hoped for a deeper understanding of separation of 
church and state a deeper understanding of the freedom of thought 
in the united states a deeper understanding of the democratic 
process that were used to which is not always the way things are 
done in the church 
he added that the pope seems to have gotten a new vision of 
the united states from his trips there and meetings with american 
bishops last year 
i think it the meeting will be significant in the life of the 
church said may it will probably build a stronger sense of 
unity between the vatican and the bishops a better understanding 
and realization of how were all try to do the same thing in 
different contexts 
the pope has held extraordinary meetings with bishops from 
brazil to discuss liberation theology and bishops from holland 
where the church was split into conservative and liberal factions 
over issues such as celibacy and the role of women in the church

secretary of state james a baker iii met 
with the soviet foreign minister tuesday and agreed to visit moscow 
in may where they will discuss prospects for a bushgorbachev 
summit 
his twohour meeting with eduard a shevardnadze in vienna took 
place the day after they outlined their governments positions at a 
35nation conference on reducing conventional military forces in 
europe bakers plane made a refueling stop in shannon on the flight 
home 
baker resisted a soviet overture to reopen negotiations in april 
or may on reducing longrange or strategic nuclear missiles he 
said the bush administration wants to complete parallel reviews of 
its arms control policy and nuclear force structure before resuming 
the talks 
reopening the talks on longrange bombers nuclear submarines and 
missiles will be discussed during the visit to moscow in the first 
half of may after the parallel studies are completed in april he 
said 
in vienna after the meeting baker told reporters the united 
states is not ready to set a date at this point for a summit 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the secretary criticized the soviets about iran and military aid 
to the leftist sandinista government of nicaragua he said moscow 
was posturing on iran which shevardnadze visited recently and 
had helped arm nicaragua in a way out of proportions manner that 
threatens its central american neighbors 
a senior state department official traveling with baker said the 
soviet offer to mediate the furor over british writer salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verses interferes with a us 
campaign to isolate iran 
irans fundamentalist shiite moslem regime believes the novel 
blasphemes islam and its patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has 
ordered his followers to kill the author iran broke relations with 
britain on tuesday because it did not condemn the book and prosecute 
rushdie 
despite clear differences on those and other issues the 
getacquainted session between baker and shevardnadze appeared to go 
well baker said it was held in a very positive atmosphere 
reflecting a determination to cooperate 
as they parted at the residence of henry grunwald the us 
ambassador to austria shevardnadze told me it was a very good 
beginning and i would agree with that baker said 
baker objected to the soviet attempt in vienna to seek reductions 
in combat aircraft and naval forces and also eliminate shortrange 
or battlefield nuclear weapons he said the mandate for 
negotiations that begin thursday excludes missiles and ships 
shevardnadzes proposal for separate negotiations on the nuclear 
weapons with ranges of up to 300 miles conflicts with us 
determination to keep lance missiles in west germany and triple 
their current range of about 70 miles 
on monday night a senior state department official briefing 
reporters under rules of anonymity said the soviets were looking for 
fissures in the western alliance 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany has proposed delaying the 
lance modernization for two or three years 
on the trip home baker said soviet suggestions for conventional 
force reduction were remarkably close to the nato proposal 
nato has called for sharp reductions in warsaw pact tanks 
artillery and armored personnel carriers to western levels followed 
by additional cuts of 510 percent on both sides 
shevardnadze proposed a firstphase reduction of 15 percent by 
1992 and 40 percent by 1995 
ussoviet negotiations to reduce longrange arms have been 
suspended for three months in midfebruary bush postponed a 
resumption until the policy review was completed 
shevardnadze told a news conference in vienna he suggested to 
baker the talks resume in april or may but the secretary said the 
united states will need more time 
on the plane baker said he told shevardnadze it was premature 
to lock in on a date now with the review in process he added to 
reporters it is our strong desire to build on the progress that 
has been made to date 
when the talks were suspended negotiators had reached tentative 
agreement on several weapon ceilings but were having trouble on ways 
to guard against cheating

soviet reformers began planning their economic 
program two years before mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov said tuesday and he implied they molded 
communist ideology to fit 
we had to find theoretical foundations for all the actions that 
we wanted to pursue afterward ryzhkov said 
in a rare news conference that offered an unusual glimpse of the 
personality of a soviet leader ryzhkov also revealed he is a 
workaholic who loves to read misses the smell of newly machined 
metal from the factory where he spent 20 years and is frustrated at 
the slow pace of reform 
we have to have a lot of patience to implement what we have 
decided because the scale of the country is so vast he told 33 
women journalists gathered in ornate st catherines hall of the 
grand kremlin palace on the eve of international womens day 
ryzhkov said planning for perestroika gorbachevs program of 
economic and social reforms began two years before gorbachev was 
elected head of the communist party that would be in 1983 about 
the time former kgb chief yuri andropov came to power 
even at that time we had forces who understood that everything 
was not healthy in our economy ryzhkov said 
for the first two years after gorbachev took over in 1985 they 
worked on theory that would support their ideas he said 
gorbachev has rejected many longstanding soviet principles in 
his effort to revive a sickly economy he is trying to do away with 
a system in which moscow bureaucrats decide what is produced 
throughout the country and trying to transform the word profit 
from the height of capitalist evil to a measurement of socialist 
success 
ryzhkov also promised to reveal the longsecret soviet defense 
budget in 12 to 18 months after accountants have arranged it in a 
form comparable to us figures apparently for use in arms 
negotiations 
as part of the plan to shift soviet spending from swords to 
plowshares defense factories that produce 60 percent military 
hardware and 40 percent consumer goods will move to a 5050 ratio by 
1991 and 4060 by 1995 he said for example the moscow aviation 
factory soon will produce pasta he said 
ryzhkov whose popularity soared in december when he was seen 
nightly on soviet tv cmmiserating with armenian earthquake victims 
said he found the slow pace of economic reform the most upsetting 
part of his job 
i like to see how the decisions we are taking in the state 
bodies are implemented in the level of real life he said thats 
why he enjoys visiting factories that remind him of the ural 
machinebuilding plant in sverdlovsk where his career began to 
feel the smell of machine parts being manufactured the smell of 
real work he said 
ryzhkov blamed part of the countrys problems on corrupt 
bureaucrats and he made no promises of quick dividends from 
perestroika saying 40 percent of factory equipment must be replaced 
we have to make certain investments we have to have knowhow 
and we have to have time for that he said 
the premier also tackled the notorious shortage of laundry soap 
in moscow we used to sell 80 tons of detergent daily now we 
sell 300 tons daily and still we have lines for detergent then 
he quipped i dont believe the overall washing has increased all 
that much 
he suggested that journalists created a selffulfilling prophecy 
by publicizing a soap shortage until people began hoarding even more 
to eliminate shortages he said wages must stop rising faster 
than retail trade and productivity 
in an unusual discussion of his personal life ryzhkov said he 
answers his own phone in a 13hour to 14hour workday and continues 
work at home as a result he misses the theater and concerts 
the 59yearold premier said his wife ludmila is a mechanical 
engineer who designed excavators at the same factory where he rose 
to director he said she reads extensively on the countries they 
visit and works on behalf of orphans 
ryzhkov said his daughter is a law professor at the academy of 
the interior ministry and her husband also is a lawyer in the 
customs office they have two children ludmila 2 and nikolai 6 
in remarks appropriate to the womens holiday ryzhkov promised 
to reduce the time women waste in food lines and to cut the female 
workforce in hardlabor jobs 
women already hold 25 percent of the management jobs in the 
soviet union and this should expand under perestroika ryzhkov said 
until now administrative methods were more suited to a man 
with a loud voice he said now we have to control the economy 
not with a shout but with an intellect and that will allow women to 
have their say

the strike by machinists at eastern airlines is 
viewed as pivotal for organized labor which is eager to see how the 
government handles the dispute and the implications for workers 
rights in the 1990s 
ironically the unions are looking for help to a railway labor 
law which it once vigorously opposed the law allows the president 
if he chooses to intervene it also allows secondary boycotts in 
strikes involving railroads and airlines 
not since former president reagan ushered in a new hard line 
against labor when he fired 11000 federal air traffic controllers 
in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes in a strike been 
greater than in the dispute at eastern 
employers in the recession years of 1981 and 1982 did not 
hesitate to demand wage concessions from workers and get them 
automatic inflationindexed costofliving adjustments that were a 
fixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from many 
settlements in the 80s 
steel auto and rubber workers counting on 15 to 21 hourly 
wages took wage cuts as did meatpackers and airline workers paid 
half as much 
those who balked copper miners in arizona meatpackers in 
minnesota or pilots and machinists at continental airlines after 
frank lorenzo acquired it found themselves on the street replaced 
by nonunion workers often willing to work for half as much 
the return of national economic prosperity after the recession 
did not reverse the trend 
but through it all two groups of union workers were able to 
preserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative to 
inflation teachers and other state county and municipal employees 
and railroad workers 
the first group did it through a recognition that us 
educational standards were falling by using public sector 
collective bargaining laws enacted under president john f kennedy 
and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services 
rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 national railway 
labor act a law governing labor relations in both railroads and 
airlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power through 
government intervention and maintain transportation vital to 
interstate commerce 
recent uses of the railway labor law have raised union hopes 
the president and congress have broad powers under the railway 
labor law to impose contract settlements on management and unions 
through presidential emergency boards they lack those powers in 
other sectors of the economy 
reagan used the mechanism several times blocking threatened 
railroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids for 
concessions 
and although the 1947 tafthartley act forbids striking union 
members at one company from picketing another company the supreme 
court in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts at 
railroads and airlines 
unions are counting on that combination to defeat eastern 
airlines and lorenzo its principal owner whom aflcio president 
lane kirkland this week called the typhoid mary of union busters 
in the transportation industry 
it was lorenzo who acquired continental airlines in 1981 and then 
declared bankruptcy two years later a move that allowed him to 
cancel all of the companys union contracts eventually all of the 
union workers were replaced 
the supreme court later upheld lorenzos right to abrogate 
continentals labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes 
creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could be 
followed by any company 
the aflcio spearheaded legislation passed by congress in 1985 
changing the law but ever since then lorenzo has been at the top of 
the labor organizations enemies list 
bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debtfinanced 
leveraged buyouts exemplified by lorenzos acquisition of eastern in 
1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labors legislative 
agenda 
kirkland acknowledged the broad implications if eastern 
succeeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by 4000 a 
year and its ramp workers by 8000 annually as demanded in the 
companys last offer before the strike saturday 
there are no doubt those who are cheering him on in management 
and certain circles in corporate america who want to see his tactics 
succeed he said monday this company is not in trouble because 
of the wages it pays labor costs at eastern are lower than other 
airlines operating profitably and efficiently 
this company is in trouble because its in hock to the banks 
some 25 billion kirkland said the interest cost on that debt 
in excess of 800000 a day is virtually equal to the amount 
this company is losing 
this is not an atypical situation in american industry with the 
vast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads that 
have been saddled on otherwise good companies

two soviet far east ports and a nearby region have 
refused entry to a nuclearpowered soviet merchant ship for fear it 
is radioactive and a newspaper likened the vessel tuesday to a 
homeless child 
the 860foot sevmorput launched only months ago had been 
anchored off vladivostok for four days because the city council 
refused entry the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said it said city 
officials decided march 2 not to let the ship dock until they 
receive additional information about its radiation safeguards 
officials of nakhodka and the nearby magadan region also refused 
port calls after tens of thousands of residents protested to a radio 
station the newspaper said 
izvestia the government daily reported on opposition to the 
sevmorput on march 2 a report in a third newspaper saturday said 
said a meltdown in a nuclear reactor on another soviet ship was 
narrowly averted 
the sovietskaya rossiya article indicated residents became 
fearful of the sevmorput because they had not been given details 
about problems with it 
fractures appeared in the 260 million barge carrier soon after 
it began its maiden voyage dec 31 from the crimean port of kerch to 
the far east the newspaper said 
experts rushed in to check whether radiation was released and 
found the ship clean confirming its atomic heart was not 
damaged the article said it did not say how the damage occurred or 
precisely when the incident occurred 
according to the newspaper the ship has good safeguards and 
could even withstand the crash of a jetliner or a collision with a 
huge icebreaker but it added 
a deficit of information piled on top of the invisible shadow 
of the chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation 
in the region detonated a powerful explosion of public 
indignation 
public opposition to nuclear power has grown since the explosion 
and fire april 26 1986 at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the 
ukraine at least 31 people were killed and the plant spewed 
radioactivity that eventually spread around the world 
authorities are closing a nuclear power plant in armenia a 
region prone to earthquakes and have canceled plans to expand other 
plants 
sovietskaya rossiya said the sevmorput was like a sea 
monster uneconomical because of its size it said the ship would 
lose 193 million this year and 229 million in 1990 
it described the vessel to an offended homeless child and 
said every day it is idle costs 88525 
on saturday the newspaper vodny transport said a reactor 
meltdown nearly occurred nov 11 on the icebreaker rossiya while it 
was docked at the northern port of murmansk it said operator error 
was responsible

rep frank annunzio dill says the national 
debt has been reduced by about 750 million through sales of us 
commemorative coins and related programs but more must be done to 
get this terrible debt under control 
annunzio a former chairman of the house banking finance and 
urban affairs committees subcommittee on consumer affairs and 
coinage says a law earmarking profits from sales of commemorative 
coins to reduce the national debt has been a step in the right 
direction but we need to take a lot of steps to pay off this 
debt which now stands at about 27 trillion 
weve got to earmark tax money or even have a surtax i know 
some people wont like to hear that talk about a surtax but weve 
got to get this terrible debt under control its the biggest most 
serious problem facing this country today annunzio said monday 
a law passed in 1982 authorizing the us mint to sell gold and 
silver coins and use proceeds for debt retirement and other special 
purposes is my own small way of dealing with the problem 
annunzio said 
according to the subcomittee which annunzio headed for a decade 
profits from the sales are approaching 960 million 
of that it said 742 million is money to reduce the debt and 
214 million is for special programs support of us olympic 
athletes and restoration of the statue of liberty and ellis island 
the debtreduction figure includes 409 million from profits on 
commemorative coins 200 million from sales of gold and silver 
coins 25 million last year from special collector coin sets and a 
projected profit of 108 million from the 1988 olympic coin program 
there was no coin program before i became chairman annunzio 
said now we have this clicking on all cylinders i just hope 
to god it doesnt go down the drain 
he said private marketers of coins and precious metals opposed 
the legislation when congress first considered it and theyll 
never give up especially now that im gone 
i dont think theres all that much support for private 
enterprise to take over said greg de niro a dealer at the 
maryland coin exchange in silver spring md 
personally as both a dealer and a collector im very happy 
with the way things are now he said tuesday the government 
makes a profit so do we its been a good for everyone 
involved 
annunzio left the coinage panel chairmanship this year to become 
chairman of the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision

motorists angered by having to pay both 
bridge tolls and higher taxes are fighting back dropping everything 
from cherry bombs to bras into toll baskets a couple of the baskets 
have even been shot at 
a year ago jacksonville citizens voted to replace the citys 
many bridge and road tolls with a halfcent sales tax 
the tax has been in place since jan 1 the tolls go on 
either tax us or toll us but not both together at the same 
time were being raped financially raped said sally gooch 38 
whose weekly driving takes her over some of the four pay bridges 
spanning the st johns river 
city officials say residents got just what the voted for if 
they read the fine print 
the tolls remain until state bridge bonds can be refinanced using 
the tax as a basis of repayment instead of the tolls officials say 
the refinancing could take six months if the task isnt done by 
dec 31 the law says the tax will be repealed 
the mayor has vowed the tolls will be gone by september 
many motorists dont buy the vows and explanations 
the 35yearold toll machines are being hit by liquid soap 
cherry bombs razor blades and gum other items found include 
chicken dinner leftovers marijuana bras shrimp beer cans and 
womens underpants 
weve got a real mess out there between now and september 
said lou hazlett regional toll manager for the florida department 
of transportation motorists he said have even opened fire on toll 
machines we had two of them shot just last week he said 
toll collectors arent faring much better 
drivers are throwing plums at them one grabbed a collectors 
arm and then drove off dragging her out of the booth others throw 
their money on the ground when you confront them they say the 
collector didnt reach out far enough said marie belch 
supervisor of the matthews bridge toll plaza 
for a time about 14 percent of those passing through the 
unmanned lanes werent paying the tolls which translated at one 
point to 115000 in lost monthly toll revenue 
officials responded to that by hiring more offduty jacksonville 
police to issue 52 tickets to those who dont pay and officials 
say that has helped 
mayor tommy hazouri vowed last week if i have to stand on the 
road and do it myself those booths will come down in september 
trust me he said 
hazouri who campaigned in 1987 on a plank of getting rid of the 
tolls is being bombarded with satire 
a local radio station started playing tommy sung to the tune 
of darlene 
we voted you mayor of jax remember it was tolls or tax just 
tell us the truth take those dern tolls down tommy please dont 
let us down the song goes 
the florida timesunion the local newspaper runs a small daily 
item called and counting featuring the number of days that 
both the tax and tolls have been in effect 
we call it double taxation and they call it cocollection 
said attorney john bryant an opponent of the tax

president bush said tuesday there clearly has 
to be some linkage between us policy toward the soviet union and 
the soviets behavior in central america 
us officials have long complained that the soviets give 
military aid to the leftist nicaraguan government that the 
administrationbacked contras are trying to oust 
bush administration officials have said they are hopeful the 
soviets might change that approach a change that might be 
encouraged by us willingness to deal in other areas such as trade 
and technology with economic benefit to the soviets 
the president said tuesday in a news conference the more help 
we can get towards that end by the soviets with pulling back their 
large amount of military support the better it would be between 
relations so there is linkage 
he said of the soviets that the united states should give them 
credit when something good happens such as their military 
pullout from afghanistan and the easing of restrictions on soviet 
jews 
i dont know exactly how to help you in terms of how much 
linkage there is but theres clearly got to be some linkage bush 
told a reporter who questioned him on the nicaraguan issue 
he declined to give specifics saying the matter is still under 
policy review by his young administration 
the state departments preliminary estimates are that soviet 
weapons deliveries to nicaragua last year totaled 515 million the 
highest total since 1980 when the soviets first started aid to 
nicaragua 
secretary of state james a baker iii had been expected to bring 
up the subject of ussoviet cooperation in the central american 
peace effort during his talks this week with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze in vienna sources said 
baker has indicated he might entertain the idea of us 
concessions to the soviets in certain areas if they show what the 
us government considers good faith in dealing with nicaragua 
bush on tuesday reiterated his support for keeping the contras 
going with nonmilitary aid while the nicaraguan government is made 
to prove it will live up to democratization promises it makes in a 
peace agreement being worked out by the central american presidents 
i hope there is some understanding on the capitol hill that 
these people must not be left without humanitarian aid we 
simply cannot and i will not leave the contras out there with no 
humanitarian aid at all the president said 
asked about the possibility of military aid which would have dim 
prospects in congress bush said we are talking about how 
best to move the process of democratization forward 
he said he would look for clear statements on democratization 
in the agreement being worked out by nicaraguas president daniel 
ortega and the presidents of central americas four democracies the 
document also would include disbanding the contras 
when baker visited capitol hill last week to consult with members 
of congress on a contra aid package he carried proposals that also 
would offer the sandinistas economic incentives if they show what 
the administration considers progress in such areas as press and 
political freedoms

industrialized nations committed themselves tuesday 
to banning chemicals destroying the ozone layer but they reacted 
coolly to third world demands for money to find substitutes 
china india and other populous developing nations embarking on 
mass production of consumer goods containing chlorofluorocarbons 
reason that since the west invented and produces most of the 
ozonedestroying chemicals the west should pay to replace them 
despite the split the 123 countries at an international 
conference on the ozone layer agreed pressure is on scientists and 
industry to find safe alternatives before more damage is done to the 
fragile atmospheric shield 
william reilly head of the us environmental protection agency 
said the threeday conference that ended tuesday sparked as much 
public discussion as any international environmental issue since the 
1985 chernobyl nuclear accident in the soviet union 
we are all in this together he said were all going to 
have to find ways to collaborate in cleaning this mess up it 
affects us all 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain the conference host 
said all countries including financially strapped third world 
nations must do their part to save the ozone layer 
it is not a case of some countries asking other countries to 
act she said it is a case of every country taking action 
no one can opt out 
chlorofluorocarbons are widely used in aerosol propellants 
refrigerants air conditioners fastfood cartons and computer 
solvents 
they are stable and nontoxic when released into the atmosphere 
but 10 to 100 years later when they rise 1520 miles to the 
stratosphere their chemical bonds are broken apart scientists say 
their chlorine atoms destroy ozone allowing more of the suns 
ultraviolet rays to reach earth causing more skin cancer and eye 
cataracts and suppressing human immune systems 
related chemicals known as halons used primarily in firefighting 
equipment cause the same damage but are 10 times as efficient at 
it 
even if all the chemicals which damage the ozone layer were 
banned tomorrow ozone depletion would continue for more than a 
decade and it would take our planet something like 100 years to 
replenish the ozone already lost said mrs thatcher an oxford 
universityeducated chemist 
chlorofluorocarbons also trap heat and warm global temperatures 
a process known as the greenhouse effect which already is 
thought to be responsible for climate changes 
more than 1 million tons of the damaging substances are produced 
annually mostly by the united states 
several companies are working on substitutes including the 
american chemical firm du pont which is the worlds largest 
manufacturer of chlorofluorocarbons and britains imperial chemical 
industries some are working together to complete toxicity tests and 
environmental assessments required by governments 
du pont says it has candidate alternatives for all major 
markets and hopes to market them by the mid1990s reilly said 
american carmakers told him they plan to use substitutes in 
airconditioning systems of their 1994 models 
the united states and the 12nation european community have 
promised to try to ban those chemicals by 1999 surpassing the 
goals of the 1987 montreal protocol which requires they be halved by 
the turn of the century 
the protocol has been ratified by 33 countries another 20 
countries told the conference they will sign up and 14 are thinking 
seriously about it said britains environment secretary nicholas 
ridley 
japan said it will consent to an international prohibition on 
producing and using environmentally harmful chemicals said japanese 
environment agency director general masahisa aoki 
if an agreement by each country regarding total abolishment can 
be reached by the end of this century japan will agree to it he 
said 
china and india which have not signed the montreal protocol 
urged western nations to create a new international fund to help 
them acquire technologies to replace the chemicals 
prince charles long a defender of the environment backed the 
third world countries call 
while we simply must eliminate cfcs we must not do so by 
forcing developing nations to forego some of the benefits of 
industrialization which developed countries have enjoyed for so 
long said the heir to the british throne

the city said tuesday it is 
turning one of adolf hitlers most ambitious building projects into 
a museum documenting his popularity horrors of the holocaust and 
other aspects of nazism 
the goal is to learn lessons from the past said a city spokesman 
plans call for the museum to be located in a huge coliseum that 
was to have been an imperial congress hall but the nazis never 
finished the construction that began in 1937 
we want to show how the germans were actually fascinated by 
hitler says carlo jahn a historian in charge of the project 
hitler was at fault but not the only one without the 
fascination of the germans for the nazis all the violence could not 
have occurred he said in an interview 
more than 60 percent of germans then thought they were better off 
under hitler said jahn 
nurembergs leftist social democratic city council approved plans 
for the museum saturday 
costs have not yet been worked out jahn said but he hoped they 
would include permanent displays and salaried staff 
we hope to set up an institute supported by the federal 
government bavaria state and public donations because this is not 
just the citys inheritance it is national the historian said 
we want to eventually make the museum a fulltime center of 
studies about the phenomena of the nazis a combination museum and 
research documentation center on those times 
he envisoned history experts using the center to study and 
compare the results of totalitarian nazi politics with other 
political systems 
nuremberg about 125 miles northwest of munich in bavaria state 
was the site of the nazi partys annual rallies 
jahn said hitler chose nuremberg because it was a traditional 
government conference site before the nazis took over and hitler 
wanted to give the impression they had ties with tradition 
to further cement that impression hitler commissioned his chief 
architect albert speer to construct the coliseum and a stadium to 
hold 450000 people at nuremberg 
the large stone facade of the incomplete building is located on 
the outskirts of the city the area was to be the site of columned 
structures stadiums and parks inspired by architecture in ancient 
rome and greece 
hitler wanted the complex to reflect the nazis interest in 
architecture and to commemorate the third reich which he boasted 
would survive a thousand years it ended in ruins in 1945 after 12 
years

about 70 armenians who fled the southern republic 
of azerbaijan because of ethnic violence massed in a government 
office tuesday to demand a meeting with premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
a dissident said 
sergei grigoryants a dissident journalist who is half armenian 
and half russian said the refugees wanted to talk to ryzhkov about 
what they see as government attempts to force them to return to 
azerbaijan 
at least 141000 azerbaijanis have fled armenia and 159000 
armenians left azerbaijan most of them since violence erupted in 
the region in the caucasus mountains in november the violence 
sparked by a territorial dispute between armenians and azerbaijanis 
has claimed 91 lives the government says 
grigoryants said the government has been all but forcing the 
armenian refugees to return to azerbaijan by evicting them from 
hotels and not giving them permanent places to live or new jobs the 
refugees fear they will become targets of the ethnic hatred if they 
return to azerbaijan 
the government contends the refugees would be safe if they 
returned and says it is trying to find new jobs and homes for those 
who wish to stay away 
a group of the refugees showed up friday at the offices of the 
council of ministers the soviet cabinet to demand a meeting with 
ryzhkov grigoryants said an aide promised that ryzhkov would meet 
the refugees in a few days and try to help 
on monday the refugees received word that ryzhkov had refused a 
meeting because the issue was resolved so 70 of them returned to 
the office tuesday to protest and seven announced a hunger strike 
according to the dissident 
the predominantly moslem azerbaijanis and mostly christian 
armenians have been at odds since february 1988 in a dispute over 
the nagornokarabakh district of azerbaijan armenians who make up 
the majority of the districts population complained of 
discrimination under azerbaijani control and demanded annexation 
with the armenian republic they have staged huge demonstrations and 
strikes in armenia

peru on tuesday confirmed its last major source 
of development loans has cut off aid because the nation has fallen 
more than six months behind in debt payments 
one newspaper said the suspension in aid by the interamerican 
development bank closes the circle of perus international 
financial isolation and accused president alan garcia of 
converting peru into a leper in the world of international 
finance 
the suspension follows similar actions by the international 
monetary fund and the world bank since 1986 a year after garcia 
announced he would limit debt payments to 10 percent of his nations 
exports 
a spokesman for the economy and finance ministry speaking on 
condition of anonymity confirmed the validity of a copy of a telex 
published in tuesdays la republica newspaper from the 
interamerican development bank to the peruvian government 
the telex dated march 1 said the international lending agency 
was suspending credit to peru because it was more than 180 days 
behind in debt payments the maximum period allowed under the banks 
regulations 
the world bank has said perus foreign public and private debt 
totals 19 billion a ministry spokesman said peru was 70 million 
behind in payments 
garcia who has accused the international monetary fund of being 
a tool of foreign banks said sunday his government had stopped 
paying the interamerican development bank because the banks 
programmed loans to peru are less than what peru is scheduled to 
repay on its old debt 
he said his governments policy is to have a positive cash 
flow from the lending agency 
government sources told the associated press that the bank had 
rejected recent peruvian requests for new development loans on the 
grounds that the projects presented for approval were hastily 
planned and did not meet technical requirements 
economy and finance minister carlos rivas davila denied the 
interamerican development banks suspension had isolated peru from 
international financial aid 
the fact that there is no access for the moment to idbs 
resources does not mean that peru is isolated from the international 
financial system he said our operations with the andean 
reserve fund the andean development corporation and government 
agencies among others are normal 
but reports of the suspension brought criticism from the news 
media and government opponents 
the circle of perus international financial isolation has been 
closed manuel dornellas one of the countrys most respected 
journalists wrote in tuesdays edition of expreso 
he accused garcia of being responsible for converting peru into 
leper in the the world of international finance 
when garcia took office in 1985 he imposed a ceiling on debt 
payments equal to 10 percent of the nations export income his 
defiant stand was praised by many politicians in latin america 
which as a region owes more than 400 billion to western creditors 
garcia used the money to finance an economic recovery program 
but peru ran out of dollar reserves a year ago and the economy has 
entered its deepest recession of the century inflation reached a 
record 1722 percent last year

president bush said tuesday that he wants to 
find a way to prevent criminal use of semiautomatic assault guns but 
still do whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
the president a lifetime member of the national rifle 
association said he directed william bennett his nominee for drug 
policy coordinator to look into what can be done about the 
proliferation of semiautomatics on city streets 
although he said previously that he opposed banning such weapons 
bush said tuesday that he assigned bennett to work the problem 
and told him 
im not so rigid that if you come to me with a sensible answer 
that takes care of the concerns that ive felt over the years ill 
take a hard look at it and ill work with you to that end 
bush said he spoke to bennett after the nominee was quoted as 
taking a position opposite the president in saying he would consider 
outlawing the weapons as a way to cut down on drugrelated violence 
the semiautomatic ak47 guns have provoked increasing public 
outcry with an escalating number of shootings involving gangs and 
innocent bystanders 
bush said he wants to find what can be worked out with finality 
on ak47s and still do whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
id love to find an answer to that 
the nra has been active in opposing any semiautomaticban efforts 
on capitol hill on the grounds that such limits would also affect 
hunting rifles 
asked what he would tell family members of those who were killed 
and maimed by such weapons which inflict wounds doctors learned to 
treat in the vietnam war bush said i say the same thing i say 
to a person whose family has been maimed by a pistol or an explosive 
charge or whatever else it might be a fire this is bad and we 
have to stop the scourge of drugs 
but he added in terms of curbing semiautomatics it isnt as 
easy as it seems to those who are understandably crying out do 
something do something 
while bush voiced concern about the terror waged by 
semiautomatics his comments coupled with his association with the 
nra left guncontrol activists skeptical 
he hasnt supported anything such as a waiting period to buy 
such guns instead of the current overthecounter purchase said 
stay onders public relations spokeswoman for the national coalition 
to ban handguns i think he got some backlash from his original 
statement opposing a ban on semiautomatics she added i think 
hes just trying to make himself seem a little moderate 
efforts to outlaw semiautomatics have taken a higher profile 
since midjanuary when a gunman took a chinesemade ak47 into a 
schoolyard in stockton calif and shot 35 people including five 
children who were fatally shot 
bush held his news conference on short notice after a winter 
storm caused postponement of a planned trip to pennsylvania and 
delaware that was to have focused on an antidrug message 
on monday bush told a veterans of foreign wars audience that 
the notion that america is a nation at peace is only partly true 
as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault our 
communities 
he pledged to mobilize all our resources to combat drug abuse 
bush has asked congress for 55 billion for the battle against 
drugs with much of the money going to law enforcement

police on tuesday detained more than 30 
people protesting a crackdown on an earlier demonstration 
authorities called for punishment for journalists they said are 
trying to drive a wedge between ethnic latvians and russians 
the developments were in line with the communist partys growing 
intolerance toward a growing nationalist movement in latvia and its 
two neighboring republics on the baltic sea estonia and lithuania 
the russianlanguage newspaper sovietskaya latvia published a 
directive of the latvian partys central committee accusing the 
republics staterun radio television newspapers and magazines of 
onesidedness bias and jumping to conclusions that does not 
weaken but heats up the situation 
it urged communist party organizations to punish party members in 
the media who ignored an order in january to cool the atmosphere 
anticipating the crackdown latvian actors demonstrated monday 
outside communist party headquarters and the official tass news 
agency said 26 were detained 
hundreds of latvians gathered tuesday evening at the riga 
headquarters of the interior ministry which is in charge of the 
police to protest the detentions said one of the demonstrators 
boris sokolov 
in a telephone interview sokolov told the associated press in 
moscow that the demonstrators carried posters saying mondays 
detentions were illegal 
police moved in and ripped down one poster that called interior 
ministry officials todays stalins said sokolov a member of an 
independent political group called the democratic union 
sokolov said he and 33 other demonstrators were detained 
tass quoted a government official as defending mondays 
detentions 
interior minstry officers have nothing against meetings and 
demonstrations provided the organizers comply with the law tass 
quoted latvian interior minister bruno steinbrik as saying 
but it said he added this time picketers unsanctioned 
actions hampered public transport they were asked to disperse but 
some of the protesters started insulting militiamen 
most of the 26 detained monday were freed without charges but 
three will face administrative punishment tass said 
the directive published in sovietskaya latvia did not give 
specific examples of biased reporting but journalists and latvian 
activists said the party leadership was upset by news coverage that 
led to the adoption of limits on the immigration of nonlatvians 
into the small republic and by reports that some of the immigrants 
were jumping queues for housing 
the journalists also have covered protests on ethnic 
environmental and other sensitive issues 
the newspaper did not specify how the journalists would be 
punished 
of latvias 26 million inhabitants 54 percent are latvians and 
33 percent are ethnic russians 
latvia like the other baltic republics of lithuania and estonia 
was absorbed by the soviet union in 1940 one year after a pact 
between the soviet union and nazi germany consigned the area to the 
kremlins sphere of influence 
in january the latvian communist party chief janis vagris 
expressed alarm over rising tensions in the republic he said the 
party itself was feeling the effects of ethnic stratification 
political ferment has increased markedly in the baltic states 
with the liberalized atmosphere fostered by president mikhail s 
gorbachev some residents now openly say they want to gain their 
homelands lost independence

higher prices for last years droughtreduced 
vegetable harvests probably boosted growers receipts slightly from 
the record level of 92 billion in 1987 the agriculture department 
said tuesday 
total output of vegetables probably fell about 4 percent in 
1988 because of declines in potato dry bean and processing 
vegetable production the departments economic research service 
said in an outlook report assuming normal weather output should 
rebound in 1989 
while projecting higher overall income for vegetable farmers last 
year the departments report a summary of another report not yet 
released did not have a figure for projected 1988 income 
the report released tuesday also said that per capita use of 
vegetables which probably declined in 1988 because of smaller 
production is expected to return to predrought levels this year 
utilization probably will continue to be enhanced by general 
economic conditions in the united states the report said with 
real disposable incomes and employment remaining relatively strong 
domestic demand for all types of vegetables should continue robust 
exports of fresh vegetables which soared in 1988 are expected 
to continue rising this year reflecting the decline in the dollar 
and growth in the japanese market the report said 
one reason for the export increase is a rise in french fry 
shipments to pacific rim countries 
potato prices paid to growers are projected to average even 
higher than the departments initial forecast of 549 per 
hundredweight the report said last years average was 435 per 
100 pounds as a result potato farmers are expected to expand their 
1989 acreage

prime minister yitzhak shamir wants egypt and 
jordan to help appoint a palestinian delegation to negotiate peace 
with israel a shamir spokesman said tuesday 
proposed delegates would be subject to israels approval and the 
government would reject any palestinian affiliated in any way with 
the palestine liberation organization said spokesman yossi ahimeir 
with the help of jordan and egypt and with good will it will 
be possible to choose a palestinian delegation which will be a 
temporary representational body until the beginning of autonomy 
ahimeir said in an interview 
shamirs proposal was made public as the issue of peace with 
palestinians caused increasing splits in the coalition cabinet of 
his rightwing likud bloc and the leftleaning labor party 
some labor cabinet ministers have proposed talking to the plo 
under certain conditions others favor choosing palestinian 
negotiators by elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
but shamir rejects both ideas ahimeir said confirming tuesday 
newspaper reports 
he said an interim autonomy plan granting palestinians limited 
autonomy should be established before elections palestinians could 
then hold elections for an administrative council that would 
negotiate a longterm solution he said 
speaking to a visiting socialist international delegation labor 
defense minister yitzhak rabin raised the possibility of elections 
monday as a way to get around the impasse over the plo which israel 
considers a terror organization bent on destroying the jewish state 
with these political figures elected in the territories we 
will conduct negotiations concerning the interim period and 
following a period of time we shall reach a discussion of the 
permanent solution with jordan representatives of the residents of 
the territories rabin said tuesday 
meanwhile energy minister moshe shahal of labor said he supports 
negotiations with any palestinian who agrees to give up terror and 
the claim that palestinian refugees have the right to return to 
abandoned homes in israel and accepts israels right to exist 
within secure borders 
a spokesman for shahal said tuesday that once conditions were met 
the plo is no longer the plo as we know it today 
communications minister gad yaacobi also of labor was quoted by 
the jerusalem post as saying plo chairman yasser arafat could be a 
negotiating partner if he were elected by palestinians in the 
occupied territories 
yaacobi and shahal added their voices to those of labors ezer 
weizman and motta gur both ministers without portfolio 
shamir described shahals proposal as jibberish at a news 
conference tuesday where he restated his refusal to negotiate with 
the plo 
it is our determination not to talk to this body the plo 
because they are opposed to peace with us shamir said

president augusto pinochet plans to call a 
plebiscite in the next three months to propose changes in the 
militarydrafted constitution a government official and a newspaper 
said tuesday 
changes to be ratified by a popular vote in may or june may 
include one that allows pinochet to seek reelection in a december 
presidential vote according to the el diario newspaper 
the newspaper quoted unidentifed government sources as saying 
pinochet is expected to announce the plebiscite saturday as part of 
his annual stateofthe nation address 
when asked at a news conference saturday about reports of a 
second referendum pinochet said only everything is possible 
and refused to elaborate 
but jaime guzman one of pinochets closest political allies 
said tuesday i have firm indications that the president will 
announce a plebiscite to amend the constitution 
in october voters rejected a proposal to extend pinochets term 
until 1997 and set the dec 14 election date the constitution bars 
pinochet from running again 
however a number of rightwing groups have repeatedly asked that 
the constitution be changed to allow the 73yearold president and 
army commander to seek reelection 
last week pinochet refused to rule out a new presidential 
candidacy 
its too early to talk about that said pinochet who has 
ruled since a bloody 1973 coup 
the opposition has demanded constitutional changes since the 
campaign for the october referendum however the specific changes 
they want such as the elimination of one article that bars marxist 
parties and another that appoints onethird of the 35member senate 
have been flatly rejected by pinochet 
consequently opposition leaders have shown little enthusiasm for 
a second plebiscite 
the only constitutional change we want is the one that restores 
popular sovereignty said ricardo lagos who heads a moderate 
socialist party

the american flag is still on the floor at the 
school of the art institute despite a museumgoers arrest a 
lawsuit threats of economic reprisals and protests from veterans 
who vowed tuesday to step up their opposition 
i had 2500 people here sunday and im going to have 25000 
people here protesting next sunday said republican state sen 
walter dudycz a vietnam veteran 
school officials havent been swayed by the furor over a student 
artwork featuring a flag spread on the ground 
we feel that the first amendment is at stake in a very big 
way here said tony brown vice president of the school of 1700 
which is affiliated with the art institute of chicago one of the 
nations most respected museums 
you almost have a charge from the public if youre going to be 
a great institution to take a very serious look at freedom of 
expression he said 
the work that caused the uproar is what is the proper way to 
display the us flag by scott tyler 24 of chicago who calls 
himself dread scott 
the exhibit consists of the flag a photographic montage on the 
wall with pictures of flagdraped caskets south koreans burning the 
flag and a yankees go home sign and a ledger for comments on a 
shelf below the photos 
veterans contend the work invites viewers to trample the flag as 
they go to the ledger and on saturday susan willhofft an art 
teacher from arlington va was charged with felony desecration of 
the flag for stepping on it 
protests began a week after the exhibit opened feb 17 for a 
fiveweek run 
veterans said they consider the flags placement a desecration 
and they were joined by several politicians including republican 
mayoral candidate ed vrdolyak 
i personally shed a lot of blood defending the flag we 
defended it in vietnam were going to defend it here in our city 
said robert kolling who lost a leg in vietnam and was among the 
throngs demonstrating sunday 
dudycz and vrdolyak urged a boycott of the schools corporate 
sponsors and also said they would try to cut off state funds from 
the institution 
the school gets its money from federal state and corporate 
sources said spokeswoman beth sullivan but she said she did not 
have exact figures 
im getting phone calls from all over the country people are 
asking what they can do dudycz said monday 
brown had no comment on the threat to cut off funds 
the school closed the exhibit feb 25 after threats to students 
and the building but it was reopened on friday 
the same day circuit judge kenneth gillis dismissed a lawsuit 
from veterans seeking to take the flag off the floor this exhibit 
is as much an invitation to think about the flag as to step on 
the flag he said 
veterans of foreign wars spokesman robert jones said tuesday his 
group would abide by gillis ruling but he said the vfw would 
petition members of congress and others to complain about the 
desecration 
ms willhoffts attorney david steinberg called her an 
innocent outoftown tourist who was entrapped and said the 
supreme court has overturned three flagdesecration prosecutions 
since 1969 and is considering a 1984 flagburning that occurred 
during the gop national convention 
another work at the school stirred controversy last spring when 
black aldermen stormed the halls to remove a painting of the late 
harold washington that depicted the citys first black mayor wearing 
womens underwear 
school officials have refused to disclose tylers whereabouts 
the works in the exhibit were selected by faculty members

that four others suffered concussions and were taken to the prison 
infirmary 
hilmi baykal a prosecutor investigating the incident confirmed 
the prisoners were on a hunger strike but declined to give any other 
details

private exporters have sold china an additional 
400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part of 2 million 
tons authorized feb 27 for china under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses 
of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the latest sale boosted to more than 78 million tons the amount 
of wheat sold to china for 198889 delivery under the eep 
sims said the latest sales were handled by cargill inc 150000 
tons and louis dreyfus corp 250000 tons 
the wheat was sold for shipment in april and may and will carry 
an average subsidy rate of 2219 per ton or about 60 cents a 
bushel he said slightly more than 16 million tons are still 
available under the current authorization 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 400000 tons would be about 147 million bushels and 
at recent prices of about 41l per bushel would have a farm value 
of around 60 million

president bush on tuesday dismissed suggestions 
that the fight to salvage john towers nomination as defense 
secretary has paralyzed his administration 
i think were on track bush said in answer to a host of 
recent stories depicting an administration in disarray and without 
momentum 
he ticked off a number of initiatives such as foreign policy 
talks with world leaders saying i would simply resist the clamor 
that nothing seems to be bubbling around that nothing is 
happening 
several political figures including some republicans have said 
they believe the long tower confirmation battle has sapped white 
house energy and held up other important business such as key 
decisions about national defense strategy and the appointments of 
toplevel government officials 
but during a white house news conference bush said there were 
plenty of substantive things taking place in the seventh full 
week of his presidency 
if you would just write down all those wonderful things i told 
you that are happening and get it out to that wide readership he 
told reporters it would be very helpful to me 
although bush said he wants to see the pace of nominations and 
appointments move more quickly he cited statistics he said show 
more key nominations made at this juncture than were announced after 
six weeks by the reagan administration in 1981 
david gergen a white house communications director during the 
first two years of the reagan administration and now editor at large 
of us news amp world report harshly criticized bush in an article 
written for the editorial section of sundays washington post 
win or lose on the tower fight president bush now stands 
perilously close to the edge of a cliff gergen wrote 
there is deepening sense in washington that something is badly amiss 
in his administration 
asked about gergens criticism bush said well i think hes 
wrong 
questioned about massachusetts sen edward m kennedys statement 
that democrats in congress should seize the national policy 
initiative bush replied ted kennedy enough said 
bush conceded however that thats one of the allegations 
disarray 
but he said i dont think the american people make up their 
minds on perceptions and he said he has total confidence in 
former new hampshire gov john sununu white house chief of staff 
every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets 
saluted for his brilliance and a month later gets attacked for his 
something else bush said 
bush defended timeconsuming reviews he has ordered in areas of 
foreign policy strategic defense and pentagon budget management 
saying it is a prudent thing to do 
he acknowledged that not having a secretary of defense in place 
at the pentagon was an inhibiting factor in getting the 
strategic review completed in 90 days but said i hope theres not 
going to be any slippage in meeting the may 10 deadline i dont 
want to be footdragging 
bush maintained he has provided congress with more details on his 
budget thinking than had either former presidents ronald reagan and 
jimmy carter 
he said moved quickly on the savingsandloan crisis that he is 
pushing ahead with a reassessment of americas drug problem with a 
host of environmental initiatives and with a system of national 
service for the young 
go back and look at history bush urged reporters it kind 
of goes in cycles but im not deterred at all

the commerce department said tuesday it has 
made a preliminary determination that steel rails from canada are 
being sold in the united states at less than fairmarket value 
in an investigation that began last september with a petition 
from bethlehem steel corp on behalf of the us steel industry the 
department found dumping of rails by algoma steel corp ltd and 
other unspecified companies in canada 
the department is expected to make a final ruling by may 22 if 
the agencys initial determination stands the us international 
trade commission would decide within 45 days whether the imports 
threaten injury to the us steel industry 
if the itc finds that imports with an unfair price advantage over 
comparable domestic products are harming us industry antidumping 
duties are imposed 
imports of steel rails from canada in 1987 were valued at about 
10 million the rails are used in the railroad industry rapid 
transit lines subways and mines

another highintensity flare spewed from the 
sun tuesday but federal officials said it was not as massive as an 
eruption monday that interfered with a radio navigation system and 
some communications 
forecaster mike abbott at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations space environment services center in boulder colo 
said the new flare was classed as an x1 far weaker than the 
earlier one but still pretty significant 
solar flares are massive eruptions that burst suddenly from the 
face of the sun the eruptions send waves of electromagnetic 
radiation and charged particles out into space these waves can 
disrupt communications on earth and trigger brilliant displays of 
the aurora or polar lights 
abbott said mondays flare overpowered instruments aboard noaa 
satellites that are able to measure solar intensity only up to what 
is called x12 initially experts estimated the flare at an x20 
but that has been revised 
a more thorough review of the data came up with an estimate of 
about x15 said abbott thats still an exceptional flare and 
is the most powerful since april 1984 
a powerful burst of xrays and ultraviolet radiation which 
crosses the 92 million miles between earth and the sun in just eight 
minutes was detected about 905 am est monday it disrupted a 
coast guard loran navigation system and some short wave radio 
communications officials said 
at the goddard space center which monitors the solar max 
satellite for the national aeronautics and space administration 
officials reported that a stream of radiation from mondays solar 
flare briefly overpowered the satellite instruments 
the satellite solar max was stunned for about a minute and 
then recovered said carolynne white a nasa spokeswoman the 
solar max satellite focuses instruments on the sun to gather data 
for scientists 
mondays flare may have created a storm of geomagnetic energy 
that could impact the earth sometime late tuesday or early wednesday 
morning said abbott he said the storm is expected to be major to 
severe in the latitudes near both of the earths poles and 
minor in the midlatitudes the storm could last for two to 
three days abbott said 
major to severe geomagnetic storms can block some radio and 
navigation communications between aircraft and ground stations and 
can interfere with some long distance telephone service by 
generating an electrical charge along cables 
the areas of earth apt to be most affected by the major to severe 
storm he said are those above 65 degrees latitude this would 
include much of alaska canada and greenland and the far northern 
parts of asia and europe south of the equator only antarctica is 
above 65 degrees 
geomagnetic storms also create spectacular natural light shows by 
energizing the earths magnetic fields over the north and south 
poles this creates the aurora known north of the equator as the 
northern lights 
radiation from solar flares also can affect orbiting satellites 
but ms white said there were no reports at goddard of any 
instrument problems from solar radiation goddard monitors up to 21 
satellites for nasa 
bursts of solar radiation can affect satellite orbits by causing 
the earths atmosphere to heat and expand slightly this can put 
molecules of atmospheric gases into contact with satellites in low 
orbits and cause the craft to slow slightly and drop lower 
more solar flares may occur at any time during the next 10 to 11 
days noaa forecasters said 
abbott said the solar flares erupted from a region on the sun 
that just rotated into view from the earth on monday the area 
marked by sun spots will take about 11 more days to move across the 
face of solar sphere as the sun rotates 
the probability of there being more solar flares is high 
said abbott the fact that two flares occurred in the sun spot 
region indicates that it is very active and apt to spawn more 
eruptions he said 
the sun goes through phases of intense activity it passed a low 
point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in 
intensity later this year or early in 1990 
a flare occurs when energy stored by the suns magnetic fields 
suddenly becomes unstable and is converted to geomagnetic radiation 
within a few minutes 
noaa said solar telescopes recorded the flare of as a tongue 
flamelike particles rising some 70000 miles from the surface of the 
sun

fcc chairman dennis patrick told a house panel 
tuesday that budgetcaused cutbacks in staff and computer equipment 
this year could cost the treasury 48 million in future revenues 
patrick said the federal communications commission needs 
additional funds in fiscal 1990 to hire more staff and buy more 
computers to relieve a backlog of license and telecommunications 
service applications that increased about 20 percent from 1988 to 
1989 
delays in licensing caused by staff shortages or lack of 
automatiion affect not only applicants but adversely impact the 
gross national product and reduce tax revenues patrick told the 
house appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice and state 
the judiciary and related agencies 
the subcommittee is considering the white house office of 
management and budgets request for 1098 million in funds for the 
fcc for fiscal 1990 that would be an increase of 102 million over 
the fiscal 1989 appropriation of 996 million the fcc had sought 
1119 million 
patrick said the fccs appropriation in fiscal 1988 was the same 
as fiscal 1989 and that the agency began fiscal 1989 on oct 1 
1988 with a 5 million deficit because of pay raises and health 
benefit increases 
to cover that shortage patrick said he imposed a hiring freeze 
and did not replace workers who retired or quit other cuts included 
a 75 percent reduction in automated data processing equipment 
purchases he said 
he said his staff estimated that a oneyear reduction of 5 
million in its fiscal 1989 appropriation if continued beyond fiscal 
1990 could reduce the present value of federal tax revenues by 
roughly 53 million producing a net revenue loss of about 48 
million 
rep joseph d early dmass criticized the cutback in 
automated equipment purchases 
i dont think thats good management he told patrick 
but patrick said the agency had gotten to the point it couldnt 
cut staff any further he said in the first quarter of fiscal 1988 
the agency had a backlog of 10322 applications for new services in 
the telephone industry by the first quarter of fiscal 1989 the 
backlog had grown to 12317 applications or a 19 percent increase 
the backlog in radio applications was 20 percent he said

solar telescopes yielded views of 
flareproducing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon 
tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible 
across western north america 
there was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature said 
ed krupp director of griffith observatory in los angeles where 600 
children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 
percent of the suns surface at 1050 am pst 
it was certainly a lively crowd he said there was a 
festival atmosphere 
its kind of neat said map maker jan mayne who was among 
dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar 
telescopes at the california institute of technology in pasadena 
as the moon passed between the earth and sun to cause the partial 
eclipse those watching through caltechs telescopes could see 
mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun also 
visible were gas jets on the suns surface and a giant group of 
sunspots that on monday produced the most intense solar flare a 
burst of heat and radiation since 1984 
there was a stunning view of that large sunspot group krupp 
said 
the eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a 
diagonal line stretching roughly from mazatlan mexico northeast to 
dallas and chicago 
views were best farther west and north but because the eclipse 
was partial most people didnt notice the slight dimming of sunlight 
you cant tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a 
secondstage smog alert joked one observer at caltech 
several people viewed the eclipse through welders helmets in 
downtown anchorage alaska where the moon obscured 80 percent of 
the sun at 913 am ast 
in san francisco the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 952 
am but the event wasnt visible because of clouds that were so 
thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport 
a slight dimming was noticed in seattle where partly cloudy 
skies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 1010 am pst 
the percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse 
at other locations included 52 percent at 1128 am mst in 
edmonton alberta 46 percent at 1109 am mst in boise idaho 36 
percent at 1110 am mst in salt lake city 35 percent at 958 am 
pst in las vegas 25 percent at 1117 am mst in denver 15 percent 
at 1242 pm cst in minneapolis and a measly 3 percent at 1244 
pm cst in milwaukee 
fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse 
scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through 
inadequate filters including smoked glass and photographic film or 
filters 
alan macrobert spokesman for sky amp telescope magazine said 
there were 245 known eye injuries in the united states after an 
eclipse in 1970 but warnings about the danger reduced the number to 
three during a 1984 partial eclipse 
from any single spot on earth a partial eclipse occurs every 
several years said ken libbrecht as assistant professor of 
astrophysics at caltech 
total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly 
once every four centuries though they are visible about every two 
years from somewhere on earth he said 
the next total eclipse will happen july 11 1991 sweeping across 
hawaii the pacific ocean lower baja california in mexico the west 
coast of central america and finally colombia and brazil macrobert 
said

nbc won the ratings for the 37th week in a 
row but which network is second for the season depends on whose 
compilation of the nielsen ratings you use 
all three networks agree that abc and cbs tied for second place 
for the week ended march 5 but with the season due to end april 
23 the networks disagree on second place for the seasontodate 
nbcs wins go back to last season 
nbc was the unquestioned winner for the week ended march 5 with a 
161 rating and a share of 26 in the ac nielsen co listing 
abc and cbs tied for the past week with 126 and a 20 share each 
ratings point represents 904000 homes with television the share is 
a percentage of the sets in use 
the past week offered no surprises in the listings with nbcs 
the cosby show still in first place abcs the wonder years 
was in eighth place after its move to tuesday night between whos 
the boss in seventh place and roseanne in third place 
nbc which lists the beginning of the season as sept 19 put abc 
in second place after 24 weeks its seasontodate ratings are abc 
129 with a 21 percent share and cbs 126 with a 20 share nbc leads 
seasontodate with a rating of 160 and a 26 share 
cbs counting the season from oct 24 lists itself in second 
place with a 129 rating and a 21 share it gives abc 128 and a 21 
share 
abcs nielsen listings put abc and cbs in a tie with 128 each 
it also counts the season from oct 24 
the difference in the season beginning is due to the writers 
strike last summer which caused a delay in the premieres of many 
series 
nbc set the season opening at the traditional start time because 
it had the summer olympics from seoul korea differences may also 
result from interpretations by the networks of the raw data from 
nielsen 
it appeared that abc would finish in second place for the second

the federal and state governments could save as 
much as 500 million a year if efforts were made to recover some of 
the costs of nursing home care from the estates of medicaid 
recipients and their spouses a congressional report said tuesday 
the report by the general accounting office recommends that 
congress require states to establish assetrecovery programs similar 
to one run by the state of oregon which recovers about 10 for 
every 1 spent on its medicaid program 
if implemented carefully estate recovery programs can achieve 
savings while treating the elderly equitably and humanely the 
report said 
however its a sensitive issue whenever you talk about 
someones right to leave an inheritance said jim linz assistant 
director of medicare and medicaid issues for the gao 
linz estimated total federal and state medicaid savings at 400 
million to 500 million if all states had an estate recovery program 
such as oregons 
medicaid is a more than 50 billion federalstate health 
assistance program for the poor the federal government sets broad 
guidelines for the programs and provides the bulk of the money but 
the states set eligibilty criteria and administer the programs 
most of the elderly who become eligible for medicaids nursing 
home benefit do so by spending down their assets to meet the 
income and asset limits for the program the gao said however the 
program allows a medicaid recipient to retain his home usually a 
persons primary asset as long as a family member is living there 
or the recipient expects to return to the home 
unless a state has an estate recovery program however it cannot 
recover assets that remain at the time the recipient dies or if 
their spouse is living at the time the spouse dies the gao said 
often the only remaining asset is the recipients home 
twentyone states and the district of columbia have programs 
allowing recovery of medicaid benefits from recipients estates with 
annual recoveries totaling about 42 million according to a june 
report by the inspector general for the department of health and 
human resources 
none of the programs approaches the effectiveness of the oregon 
program which recovers an average of 327 per medicaid nursing home 
resident which totals about 4 million annually the gao said the 
next highest recovery rates are 160 per medicaid nursing home 
resident in new hampshire and 109 in massachusetts 
the key elements of oregons program according to the gao are 
procedures for identifying a medicaid applicants assets tracking 
and preserving assets while medicaid assistance is provided and 
recovering from the recipients estate the law also allows for 
recovery from the spouses estate if the state didnt recover from 
the recipients estate 
the gao said advocacy groups for the elderly in oregon say that 
the states program incorporates enough flexibility so that estate 
recoveries dont create undue hardships on the recipients heirs

twentyfive years after the slayings of 
three young men drew the nations attention to the civil rights 
movement a new freedom summer caravan is being planned to 
commemorate the deaths organizers said tuesday 
civil rights leaders from mississippi and across the nation were 
joined by gov ray mabus at the announcement of the caravan which 
will leave philadelphia miss on june 21 and travel to washington 
and new york 
it will be kind of a prayer pilgrimage of reconcilation where 
the spirit of good will which mississippi has recaptured will come 
alive again said james farmer the former chairman of the 
congress of racial equality 
farmer who played a major role in the original freedom summer 
demonstrations in 1964 said mississippi has shed its ugly image 
of hatred and can be a model for the rest of the nation 
he said he realized that when he mabus greeted him in the 
governors office once held by the late theodore bilbo a strident 
segregationist 
i knew then that in this great land of ours all things are 
possible farmer said 
mabus also spoke of change in mississippi today once more 
the officials of mississippi are standing in the schoolhouse door 
but this time we are standing in that door to open it wider and to 
make sure that everybody gets in he said 
the caravan will commemorate the slayings of andrew goodman 
james earl chaney and michael henry schwerner whose bodies were 
found in an earthen dam near philadelphia six weeks after their 
deaths on june 21 1964 
chaney was a 21yearold black from meridian goodman 20 and 
schwerner 24 were white new yorkers who were among the young 
people from around the nation who flocked to the south to protest 
racial discrimination during freedom summer 
julia chaney moss the sister of james chaney said the caravan 
would recreate that moment in time in 1964 to educate the youth 
and reeducate those older of us who maybe have become complacent in 
our lives and to rededicate ourselves to human rights civil 
rights and voter registration 
state rep aaron henry president of the mississippi branch of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people said 
the caravan would begin with rallies in jackson and meridian and 
then head on to philadelphia 
later stops are planned in selma ala washington and new york 
where a rally will be held on june 24 near where chaney is buried 
chaney goodman and schwerner vanished after being arrested and 
jailed in philadelphia on a traffic violation no one was tried for 
murder but eight men were convicted on federal charges of denying 
the three their civil rights 
the incident was fictionalized in the oscarnominated movie 
mississippi burning which has won critical acclaim but also has 
been widely accused of minimizing the role of black mississippians

new warsaw pact proposals to eliminate 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe drew a split response on 
tuesday indicating nato could face a long battle over modernizing 
those weapons in west germany 
on monday nato and the warsaw pact outlined proposals for new 
talks opening thursday on reducing conventional arms and forces from 
the atlantic to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
the north atlantic treaty organization focused on drastic 
numerical reductions in soviet tanks and artillery soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze proposed deep cuts in troops and all 
kinds of weaponry including combat aircraft and battlefield nuclear 
rockets 
shevardnadze also proposed new talks on the tactical nuclear 
weapons which have a 300mile range preceded by moves to withdraw 
them from large parts of west germany east germany and 
czechoslovakia 
western officials said his proposals seemed aimed at west 
germany where there is increasing reluctance to go along with 
american demands for immediate modernization of aging us 
battlefield nuclear rockets 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher did not 
mention shevardnadzes proposal in his speech tuesday to a 35nation 
foreign ministers conference that precedes the formal opening of 
the new talks thursday 
genscher also failed to mention the need to keep a nuclear 
deterrence in the nato arsenal ranged against what the west says 
are far larger warsaw pact land forces in europe 
by contrast french foreign minister roland dumas termed nuclear 
weapons an irreplaceable deterrent 
the maintenance of credible defenses the modernization of this 
or that weapon is necessary dumas said tuesday 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe also said a nuclear 
deterrent is needed when he laid out natos proposals on monday 
us secretary of state james a baker iii held his first talks 
tuesday with shevardnadze agreeing to go to moscow in early may to 
fix a possible summit and resumption of talks to reduce longrange 
nuclear missiles 
both men said later their meeting took place in a good atmosphere 
but baker took issue with shevardnadzes proposals for talks to 
eliminate battlefield nuclear missiles noting that these were 
specifically excluded from the mandate for the new talks 
a us official suggested on monday that shevardnadzes proposal 
was meant to see if moscow could open up fissures in the alliance 
the united states made its own appeal to west german opinion 
monday by announcing it will explore ways for speeding the 
withdrawal of chemical weapons due out by 1992 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany who has irritated the 
americans by asking for a twoyear delay on modernizing shortrange 
nuclear missiles hailed the move and on tuesday urged the soviet 
union to destroy its chemical arms in east europe 
genscher lined up behind the alliance proposals for the new 
talks but signaled he feels east and west should cooperate on 
disarmament 
he said west germany and poland will act as joint hosts in june 
to a conference of military experts from nato the warsaw pact and 
neutral european nations to work on criteria for turning the 
military might massed in europe into purely defensive forces 
after meeting baker shevardnadze noted the differences between 
his proposals and natos but added 
negotiation is negotiation it is a complex process and i 
believe that in this process we will be able to find mutually 
acceptable decisions 
west european newspaper commentators welcomed the new efforts to 
start dismantling military forces on the worlds most heavily armed 
continent 
the liberal british newspaper the guardian suggested however 
that nato was upstaged by the soviets and questioned whether 
alliance nations had yet begun to leave behind the cold war 
atmosphere 
if the dynamism of the soviet side is not recognized and 
critically but positively matched by the west that is a true 
failure of imagination it said 
the belgian newspaper la libre belgique said it sees little 
common ground between nato and warsaw pact positions and wondered 
whether the talks will fail as earlier negotiations to reduce tanks 
and troops in central europe did 
but other commentators and western officials expressed optimism 
because of new soviet willingness to disarm

the senate voted 990 on tuesday to confirm 
career diplomat thomas pickering to be us ambassador to the united 
nations 
pickering who will succeed retired army lt gen vernon walters 
most recently served as us ambassador to israel 
during his 30year career as a foreign service officer he also 
has been ambassador to jordan nigeria and el salvador 
no opposition to the nomination was voiced during a brief debate 
on the senate floor and senators of both parties hailed pickering 
as an experienced and talented diplomat 
several said that he begins his duties at the un with 
opportunities for breakthroughs in settling conflicts in many parts 
of the world 
sen jesse helms rnc the senior gop member of the senate 
foreign relations committee said pickering will confront 
antiamerican antiisraeli and prosoviet attitudes from many un 
members 
he is wading into a real quagmire of antiamerican and 
procommunist bias helms said 
in the roll call only sen quentin burdick dnd did not vote 
no mention was made in the brief senate debate of the controversy 
that developed when during his service as ambassador to el 
salvador pickering accepted a private document from a central 
american official and delivered it to oliver north then a staff 
member of the national security council 
the document apparently later delivered by north to leaders of 
the contra rebels in nicaragua was an offer to provide 1 million 
in military equipment 
during his confirmation hearing pickering said that although he 
delivered the letter to north he did not believe he had violated a 
congressional ban in effect at the time which barred direct or 
indirect aid to the contras 
he said he delivered the letter to north outside of normal state 
department channels only because he knew north was the reagan 
administrations liaison with the contras

the government and the opposition have 
overcome barriers to a compromise and an accord on political and 
social reforms should be signed april 3 lech walesa said tuesday 
i am very satisfied the founder of solidarity said after an 
eighthour meeting with the interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak and other government and communist party officials 
opposition spokesmen said agreement was reached on legalizing the 
banned independent students association known by its initials nzs 
which had become a sticking point in the monthold round table 
negotiations 
the news came on the eve of the anniversary of student riots 
march 8 1968 on tuesday city officials in warsaw took the unusual 
step of issuing permits for two commemorative marches by students 
we are finalizing the round table walesa said all basic 
problems like union pluralism will be achieved in time in 
line with our commitments 
authorities proposed negotiations with the opposition led by 
walesas union because of strikes in 1988 and fears of further 
social problems due to shortages low wages and inflation running at 
an annual rate of about 60 percent 
among the goals walesa and other opposition leaders set were 
restoration of legal status to solidarity the independent farmers 
union rural solidarity and the student association 
all were formed in the labor turmoil of 1980 when solidarity 
became the first free union in the soviet bloc they were outlawed 
after martial law was imposed in december 1981 but have continued to 
function 
officials indicated soon after the talks began feb 6 that 
solidarity and rural solidarity would be legalized but the student 
groups fate remained in doubt 
a joint communique carried by the official news agency pap after 
tuesdays meeting said there were conditions for a further 
rapprochement of stances on the key issues of dialogue and 
directions of proposed political economic and social reforms 
including the registration of the nzs student union 
piotr konopka a solicarity spokesman said it seems that this 
is an unequivocal decision on registration of nzs this is good news 
for the students but its also good news for us because all the 
people taking part in the talks on our side have emphasized that 
registering nzs was one of the key problems 
no other agreements were mentioned in the joint statement it 
also said nothing of such issues as the form for parliamentary 
elections in which the opposition would participate and an 
opposition demand that wages be indexed to the cost of living 
walesa said he and kiszczak might have to meet again but the 
working groups on specific topics should finish by march 20 the 
period between then and april 3 would allow each side to study the 
tentative agreement he said 
about his meeting with kiszczak who leads the government 
delegation walesa said we are removing obstacles that have 
appeared here and there but we are only removing them politically 
and the rest must be worked out at the tables because the experts 
are there 
janusz onyszkiewicz national spokesman for solidarity said i 
imagine the final agreement will be in the form of a resolution 
including general declarations maybe accompanied by annexes with 
details signed by all the participants at the round table 
walesa spoke to reporters outside the roman catholic episcopate 
in warsaw after returning from the meeting accompanied by advisers 
he boarded a train soon afterward for gdansk the baltic port where 
he works as a shipyard electrician and founded solidarity during a 
strike in august 1980 
government spokesman jerzy urban said the walesakiszczak meeting 
included attempts to separate out subjects on which we can reach 
agreement in order to leave for the future subjects on which we 
havent reached agreement 
at a news conference he listed requirements for an accord as 
working out a document about what links poles an agreement on 
nonconfrontational elections and practical implementation of trade 
union pluralism

a house subcommittee approved legislation 
tuesday to impose a uniform closing time for polls across the 48 
contiguous states 
the elections subcommittee of the house administration committee 
approved the measure on a voice vote rep al swift dwash and the 
subcommittee chairman said he expected congress will approve the 
bill this year 
the measure similar to ones twice approved by the house now 
goes to the full committee 
election officials in the west have complained that voters in 
their states sometimes decide not to vote when the winner of a 
presidential election is known before their polls close and that the 
drop in turnout has affected the outcome of close local races 
under the bill polls would close simultaneously in the 48 
contiguous states at 9 pm est in the pacific time zone daylight 
saving time would be extended for a maxiumum of two weeks in 
presidential election years the extension would allow polls in that 
time zone to close at 7 pm pdt 
alaska and hawaii are exempt from the legislation 
swift said the need for a uniform poll closing time became 
apparent after the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections when the 
television networks using exit polling data projected the winners 
before western polls closed 
in 1988 however the problem was different as president bush 
rolled up a large electoral college majority before western 
polls closed said swift 
had this legislation been in place all of the polls would have 
been closed before a winner was known said swift 
swift said that studies have shown voter turnout can drop by up 
to 2 percent when a winner in the presidential contest is known 
before the polls close 
this can be a crucial in tight local elections said swift

dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways 
and means committee told president bushs budget director on 
tuesday that any major reduction in the federal deficit would 
require a tax increase 
i dont want to raise taxes but i cant see how we can achieve 
a significant amount of deficit reduction on the spending side 
only rostenkowski said as his committee heard testimony from 
richard darman director of the office of management and budget 
rostenkowski also told darman that there was little chance of 
enacting two administration taxincreasing proposals broadening the 
medicare tax to all state and local employees and blocking an 
automatic reduction in the airport excise tax those simply do not 
have the votes to pass he said 
the white house refuses to consider those levies as tax boosts 
in response to questions by the committee darman said he might 
consider other revenueraising measures as something other than tax 
increases 
for example applying the telephone excise tax to wire services 
now exempt might be considered loophole closing he said other 
changes might be considered user fees 
but he said bush had shown no indication that he was softening 
his opposition to new taxes 
if someone were going to change his bushs mind it would 
take a major effort he said 
at a hearing of the senate appropriations committee sen j 
bennett johnston dla complained to treasury secretary nicholas 
brady that the administration was using rosy economic assumptions 
and other gimmicks to make its budget proposal fall within the 
grammrudman deficitreduction targets 
johnston said the administration hadnt offered a realistic plan 
that could serve as a starting point for serious negotiations 
and that the grammrudman targets might have to be relaxed even if a 
credible plan were advanced 
he said it was doubtful that enough taxes and real budget cuts 
with real economic assumptions could be enacted to meet the 
grammrudman targets for fiscal 1990 
brady defended the administrations economic assumptions as 
realistic and said that while grammrudman was imperfect it is a 
form of sanity that has been reassuring to financial markets 
anxious to see progress toward deficitreduction 
like darman brady said he would oppose changing the grammrudman 
law and its 100 billion deficit limit for fiscal 1990 the 
administration claims it has met the target without increasing taxes 
i feel very strongly that we should not move the goal lines 
he said i think we do have a starting point i have optimism 
that were going to reach the goal line without moving it 
darman and brady plan to resume discussions this week with 
congressional budget writers the administrations goal is 
fullscale negotiations on the budget for fiscal 1990 which begins 
oct 1 
congressional democrats complained that the administration has 
been slow to provide information on policies it would favor in a 
deficitreduction plan especially the cuts required in domestic 
programs 
bush in a news conference tuesday repeated his assertion that 
he has provided capitol hill with more detail than other presidents 
did at the beginning of their administrations 
more detail has been sent to the hill at this time in our 
administration let me clarify that than at any time for either 
the reagan administration 1981 or the carter administration in 
77 he said they hadnt gone up with near this amount of 
detail to the hill

matheney had been freed hours earlier on an eighthour furlough 
from an indiana prison where he was serving time for beating his 
wife and confining the couples two children authorities said 
within hours of the womans death matheney surrendered to police 
and was taken into custody murder charges were filed tuesday

the government on tuesday urged the 
soviet union to remove its chemical weapons from eastern europe and 
destroy them 
the appeal followed a us proposal to speed the removal of 
chemical weapons from west germany 
chancellor helmut kohl in a news release said the soviets and 
united states have a unique opportunity to make significant progress 
in ending the threat of chemical warfare 
the united states has taken a step that the soviet union and 
its allies should now follow without delay kohl said 
referring to the us proposal he said i call on the soviet 
union in turn to pull out its chemical weapons stationed in eastern 
europe and to destroy them 
west german opposition leaders have said the us proposal was 
vague and disappointing 
on monday secretary of state james a baker said president bush 
wanted to explore ways to accelerate the removal of us chemical 
weapons from west germany 
the united states is prepared to lead in dealing with this 
problem baker said but the early removal of the chemical weapons 
will require safe storage and the development of practical plans 
to destroy them 
he also said the soviet union has enormous stocks of such weapons 
threatening western europeand he urged soviet leaders to join in the 
mutual destruction of these frightening weapons 
in canberra australia foreign minister gareth evans said 
tuesday that australia will be the host of an international 
conference to halt the proliferation of chemical weapons 
the meeting is tentatively scheduled for the latter half of the 
year but evans did not say how many countries might attend a 
government spokesman said all the major players are expected 
the momentum is there in terms of the will to get these 
horrifying weapons out of business once and for all evans 
said 
he said the conference initiative followed talks with baker about 
how to build on the momentum generated by the paris conference on 
chemical weapons attended by 149 countries in january 
kohl said he was hopeful chemical weapons could be withdrawn from 
west germany and eastern europe ahead of a 1992 deadline agreed upon 
by both sides in 1986 
he said he assumed that only technical matters had to be dealt 
with in securing the early removal of chemical weapons from west 
german soil 
horst ehmke a leader of the opposition social democratic party 
questioned the us plan 
he said the removal of aging chemical weapons meant nothing if 
they might someday be replaced by a new generation of binary 
chemical weapons 
the only event to celebrate will be an agreement in geneva for 
the worldwide destruction of chemical weapons ehmke said 
binary chemical weapons use two chemicals that when combined 
produce a deadly gas 
government spokesman friedhelm ost said monday that west germany 
agreed to allow the united states to deploy the new binary chemical 
weapons if there should be a threat of war 
kohl in a television interview said he would oppose replacing 
the aging weapons in west germany in an era of declining tensions 
we will do everything in our power to ensure that these weapons 
disappear he said we dont need them

susan butcher who won the last two 
iditarod dogsled races with rick swenson on her heels chased 
swenson on tuesday as the two winningest mushers in race history 
fought for the early lead in the 1100mile trek 
joe runyan of nenana actually was farthest along the trail early 
tuesday but he had not yet taken his mandatory 24hour rest stop 
while swenson butcher and five others declared theirs at rohn 
which is 266 miles from the start in anchorage and 902 miles from 
the finish line in nome 
swenson butcher and deedee jonrowe of willow were expected to 
start racing about noon ast tuesday 
historically iditarod frontrunners have faded badly by the time 
they reached nome more than 1100 miles from the start 
in past years butcher who has won the last three races and 
swenson the only fourtime winner have been content to bide their 
time making their moves much later in the race 
but this year swenson and butcher went straight to the front he 
led butcher into rohn by 13 minutes 
it just worked out that way swenson said of their quick 
start the thing is there was no one else that was going to go 
the two intense outspoken competitors used to be neighbors in 
manley but swenson has moved to two rivers their rivalry has grown 
to epic proportions throughout the state 
i think i can beat her but shes got a good team and she 
might beat us all swenson said he said his team this year is 
better than the one that was runnerup to butcher last year 
on monday three people escaped serious injury when a 
singleengine airplane chartered by an anchorage tv station crashed 
while covering the race 
the field of mushers dwindled to 46 monday night when 83yearold 
norman vaughan called it quits at skwentna just 151 miles into the 
race two other mushers dropped out earlier at big lake only 71 
miles along the way 
inpired by a dogsled relay of serum to nome for a diphtheria 
outbreak in 1925 the iditarod was founded in 1973 the winner this 
year is to get 50000 of the 250000 purse the remainder will be 
shared by the next 19 finishers 
most of the iditarod mushers are from alaska others are from 
montana minnesota wyoming new york france and japan

president bush should be given more time to 
organize his administration and put together his policies and 
programs a longtime bush friend from texas said tuesday 
robert w blake said he was pleased and surprised to hear that 
bush at a news conference earlier in the day had cited a fellow 
from lubbock as an objective spokesman on the bush presidency 
when asked at the outset of the news conference about 
commentaries that his administration is in disarray in part because 
of the protracted fight with the senate over defense 
secretarydesignate john tower bush said my response is that 
its not adrift and there isnt malaise 
and i talked to a fellow from lubbock texas the other day 
which is the best phone call ive made the president said and 
he said all the people in lubbock think things are going just 
great 
blake who is involved in the oil and gas industry said in a 
telephone interview from lubbock that bush had called sunday 
hes only had 45 days blake said tuesday saying he has 
known bush since 1951 and came to know him better during bushs 
illfated 1964 senate campaign against democrat ralph yarborough 
all they do is criticize him blake said but hes upbeat 
you will not find george bush when hes down he just called we 
talked back and forth like friends do i just feel like they ought 
to give him a year to 18 months to get things done 
blake who served on bushs national campaign finance committee 
last year and has made several donations to bushs campaigns said 
he knows no one would would work any harder than george bush 
he said he told bush not to worry about the tower problem 
i said you pick him and then you have no more control over 
it blake related

a senior un official on tuesday called 
for a month of peace in the wartorn south to enable the transport 
of 100000 tons of food and medicine to about 2 million people 
facing starvation this summer 
james grant director general of the un childrens fund and 
personal representative of un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said the international community was in a race against time 
to position and distribute the supplies in the south before the 
rainy season starts in may 
the operation will cost an estimated 20 million for food that 
has not yet arrived in sudan 48 million for transportation and 
about 12 million for other expenses in sudan said james ingram 
executive director for the un world food program 
he said this amount does not include the worth of the bulk of the 
food already in sudan nor money for medication or immunization 
programs or vital structures like digging wells 
this is a race against time a race to avoid the repetition of 
the disaster which happened when the rains blocked the 
transportation of foodstuff grant said he said more than 250000 
people died last year when food was blocked up to onehalf of them 
children 
grant said 225 million southerners in government and rebelheld 
areas needed food and medication in varying degrees this summer and 
that 100000 people could die if the operation failed 
he spoke on the eve of a unorganized conference in which 
western donor governments nongovernmental relief agencies and the 
sudan governments are participating to organize the ambitious rescue 
operation 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army is not representated 
ingram described the operation as very very daunting and 
stressed there was an absolute need for a month of peace 
grant said he had indications the rebels might agree to such a 
proposal 
we are in some consultation with them i believe the prospects 
of developing a month of tranquillity is something which can emerge 
in the next few day he said 
sources close to the conference said the donors especially the 
united states would strongly pressure the khartoum government to 
enter peace talks with the rebels 
on monday us state department spokesman charles redman urged 
prime minister sadek mahdis government to talk peace 
the sudanese government and the rebels both have used food as a 
weapon in the 6yearold war in the south western relief officials 
estimate that in 1988 alone about 560000 southerners died of 
starvation or while fleeing the war 
the rainy season starts in may and lasts until the end of 
september it turns roads into swamps and makes airstrips unusable 
referring to previous international efforts to bring relief to 
the south grant said they were far too short to carry people 
through once the rains start in the spring 
ingram said that starting wednesday a sixweek program would 
begin to transport 3000 tons of food and supplies to the south in 
hercules c130s

the bush administration has completed a review 
of third world debt strategy but is still deciding what approaches 
to take to the problem officials said tuesday 
treasury secretary nicholas brady refused to answer specific 
questions about a published report detailing elements of the plan 
the administration has under review he told reporters after 
congressional testimony on the bush budget that questions about 
third world debt would be answered at an upcoming hearing 
art siddon a treasury department spokesman said the treasury 
department had completed its review and officials were examining 
possible changes but that no final decisions had been made 
siddon said he could not comment on a washington post story which 
said the administrations plan would put heavy emphasis on 
encouraging banks to voluntarily forgive part of the debt owed to 
them by developing nations 
the newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying that the plan 
under consideration by the administration would emphasize reducing 
the size of outstanding debt and would tap the resources of the 
international monetary fund and the world bank to make it more 
attractive for banks to forgive a portion of their loans 
in a speech last week brady termed third world debt perhaps 
the most difficult of the major issues facing the new 
administration 
unlike the federal budget deficit or even the savings and loan 
industry crisis this is not a problem that we in the us have the 
power or the resources to solve by ourselves brady said in a 
speech to the american bankers association 
the new administration is receiving pressure from us allies to 
go beyond the baker plan formulated by secretary of state james 
a baker iii in 1985 when he was treasury secretary in the reagan 
administration 
under the baker plan the international banking community was to 
provide about 30 billion in new loans to third world debtors who 
agreed to make economic reforms 
however the amount of new bank lending fell far short of the 
goals and as a result there has been growing pressure for a new 
approach that would reduce the debt burden 
that pressue intensified last week after riots in venezuela which 
were touched off after the newly elected government of president 
carlos andres perez announced austerity measures as part of an 
agreement with the international monetary fund to get more loans for 
the debtstrapped country 
in another development tuesday the twentieth century fund 
released a report calling for the bush administration to support 
major new initiatives to resolve the debt crisis 
the long shadow cast by the debt crisis covers far more than 
the economies of the debtor countries the report concluded it 
threatens democratic institutions in debtor countries strains 
northsouth relations and poses serious political risks for 
creditors as well as debtors 
the report prepared by a 12member task force of business 
leaders politicians and academics recommended extention and 
flexible rescheduling of existing interest payments as ways of 
reducing the 13 trillion debt burden carried by the third world 
john gaines heimann vice chairman of merrill lynch capital 
markets and the head of the task force said he hoped the bush 
administration would go further than the baker plan in addressing 
the debt problem 
the administration seems to be taking a very pragmatic point of 
view and i hope that is evidenced in their set of recommendations 
he said 
the twentieth century fund is a nonpartisan research group which 
has conducted a twoyear study of third world debt

the communist party has lost members and 
may suffer more defections as hungary approaches multipleparty 
politics party officials said tuesday 
a justice ministry official said the new constitution to be 
enacted by parliament will guarantee independent parties the right 
to exist but the first open elections under the charter will not be 
held until 1995 
party officials also are preparing to sponsor an eastwest 
conference in budapest of christian democrat liberal socialist and 
communist parties to discuss the concept of a common europe 
janos berecz secretary for ideology told reporters after a 
central committee meeting about 3000 members left the party during 
the recent debate over the 1956 hungarian revolt 
imre pozsgay a reformer and member of the ruling politburo 
caused controversy by saying the revolt crushed by the soviets was 
a popular uprising not a counterrevolution as in the official 
version 
he based his assessment on a report of a party committee 
reviewing hungarys postwar history a subsequent central committee 
session issued a statement saying the revolt began as a popular 
uprising but became a counterrevolution 
tuesdays meeting adopted a manifesto that appears designed to 
inform and reassure rankandfile party members who have become 
confused about widely publicized political and economic reforms at a 
time of inflation declining living standards and a rising deficit 
berecz told the central committee reform was the only course for 
hungary we communists have no other alternative because during 
the elections the nation will decide in favor of the party of 
consistent reforms in their own interests he declared 
he said the partys membership might continue to decline but it 
would gain new meaning for the public by professing the values of 
freedom justice and solidarity 
we should expect that the competition of the various 
political movements will impose an encouraging or even compelling 
force on us he said of alternative parties and groups organized 
in recent months 
many of those hope to win seats in parliament when the 
multipleparty system becomes reality 
geza kileni of the justice ministry told journalists the new 
constitution to be submitted to a referendum next year will not 
mean open politics immediately and that the transition could last 
several years 
he said the first parliamentary elections based on the new 
charter would be in 1995 but a multipleparty system would be 
established before that 
trade unions interest groups and possibly others will be allowed 
to enter candidate in next years elections but the rules have not 
been determined he said 
party spokesman laszlo major said the conference on a common 
europe should be held in early summer and that 22 parties from 
east and west would be represented including the liberals and 
progressive conservatives of canada and the us democratic party 
he said only parties from the soviet union poland and yugoslavia 
would attend from eastern europe

the district of columbia council taking 
emergency action in an attempt to curb drugrelated violence in the 
nations capital voted tuesday to require that people who use guns 
when they commit a crime in the city must be sentenced to five years 
in prison 
it approved a bill also aimed at improving the citys 
beforetrial detention program by allowing judges to refuse to 
permit bond for people accused of violent crimes even if they have 
no criminal record 
this is an emergency bill and requires a lot of debate but 
these are emergency times said james nathanson a member of the 
council the people of this city are telling us we have to do 
something 
the emergency measure which will remain in effect for 90 days 
before being reviewed came as the city sought to slow the pace of 
drugrelated killings police blame about 60 percent of last years 
record 372 killings on drugs so far this year 98 people have been 
slain in the district 43 more than during the matching period in

the legislation also attempts to stem a flow of illegally 
purchased weapons into the nations capital according to police 
statistics 3863 weapons were seized on city streets during 1988 
compared with 2225 the year before 
the bill survived a challenge from several council members who 
complained that it would clog the citys already overcrowded court 
and prison systems and objections from others who said it needed 
more debate 
mayor marion barry jr proposed the measure almost two weeks ago 
saying the city should start an allout assault on weapons 
since then city police and court officials have twice met to 
discuss the bill 
the emergency measure strengthens the citys handgun law already 
considered one of the toughest in the nation the old law set 
maximum punishment at one year in jail and a 1000 fine for anyone

china imposed martial law on the tibetan capital 
of lhasa after three days of bloody riots protesting chinese rule 
and an american traveler said thousands of soldiers flooded the city 
early wednesday 
tibetan mobs had ransacked chineseowned stores and burned their 
contents stoned government buildings and attacked chinese in 
demonstrations for independence and an end to chinese rule in the 
remote mountain area 
official accounts said at least 12 people were killed and more 
than 100 wounded unofficial reports had up to 75 people killed and 
300 injured 
police imposed a temporary curfew and cleared the streets tuesday 
afternoon threatening to shoot anyone found in the central square 
or in the tibetan section nearby the traveler said by telephone 
from lhasa 
at midnight jeeps carrying loudspeakers sped through the city 
ordering residents to stay inside and informing them martial law had 
begun he said 
it was the first time since the 196676 cultural revolution that 
martial law had been publicly announced in china 
dozens of trucks packed with soldiers of the peoples liberation 
army later entered lhasa the american reported 
soldiers were patrolling in the streets said a report by 
xinhua the official chinese news agency quoting maj gen zhang 
shaosong political commissar of the tibet regional military command 
theres a lot of sirens going and a lot of troop movement 
outside said the american who spoke on condition of not being 
identified for fear of police reprisals 
he said he was speaking from a hotel in the center of lhasa and 
had stopped looking out the window after a soldier came to the 
window and blocked his view 
now im here with a blanket over my head in the office hoping 
that no one will notice he said speaking in a muffled voice so 
as not to attract attention 
xinhua said the whole city and parts of two adjoining counties 
would be cordoned off and all meetings parades strikes 
petitions and any other gathering are banned the order also gave 
security forces vast powers to stop vehicles and pedestrians in the 
city of 70000people 
no foreigners were allowed to enter lhasa without permission and 
those in the area without permission were required to leave the 
order said the american who said he had not been informed of the 
rule estimated there were about 80 foreigners in lhasa 
the nationally televised nightly news announced martial law 
tuesday evening saying the lhasa city government had been 
authorized to take any measures necessary to restore order 
any person who defies martial law or who instigates others to 
do so will be severely punished said the order approved by 
chinas cabinet and signed by premier li peng 
xinhua said martial law had been imposed because separatists 
have been constantly causing disturbances in the city over the past 
few days 
in geneva chinese delegate li zuomin told the un human rights 
commission the riots were triggered by a few separatists who do 
not wish to see progress and better living standards in tibet and 
by terrorists sent from outside he said the violence endangered 
the security and sovereignty of china and forced authorities to 
take corresponding measures 
on sunday and monday clashes between police and tibetans left 11 
tibetans and one chinese policeman dead along with 100 wounded 
official reports said on tuesday westerners quoted tibetans as 
saying as many as 75 died and 300 were wounded including an 
instance in which chinese militia burst into homes and killed at 
least five people 
two groups of about 100 tibetans marched tuesday near the main 
square and on beijing road the main thoroughfare police then 
cleared the streets the american said sounds of gunfire crackled 
in the afternoon 
all the tibetans just disappeared everybody just evaporated 
said the american who was given shelter in a tibetan house but by 
nightfall tibetans began to venture outside again and a bonfire 
blazed on beijing road after tibetans ransacked and burned another 
chinese store 
martial law was not imposed in outbreaks of proindependence 
violence in lhasa in the past 18 months that left scores dead and 
hundreds hurt 
the government last imposed martial law during the ultraleftist 
cultural revolution in 196676 when bands of red guards fought armed 
battles on the streets of dozens of cities a form of martial law 
was declared on all of tibet on march 23 1959 after an aborted 
uprising against chinese rule 
china claims tibet has been part of china since the 13th century 
many tibetans say tibet should be independent and led by the 
traditional tibetan leader the dalai lama who fled in exile during 
the aborted uprising in 1959 
on monday the dalai lama appealed to world leaders to persuade 
the chinese to find a peaceful solution to the protests 
the dalai lama has proposed that china grant tibet autonomy in 
its internal affairs in exchange for the stationing of chinese 
troops on tibetan soil and the management of tibets foreign 
relations by beijing china has rejected the proposal but is 
considering the dalai lamas proposal of negotiations 
in india the dalai lamas administration said tuesday it was not 
surprised by the imposition of martial law 
for all practical purposes lhasa was already under martial law 
the chinese have only formalized it said tashi wongdi the 
tibetan leaders chief representative in new delhi when contacted 
by telephone

this city took some of the wind out of 
peoria ills perennial bluster of being everytown usa when 
president bush said the people of lubbock think hes doing a fine 
job 
when reporters questioned bush tuesday about criticism that his 
administration was adrift he replied 
i talked to a fellow from lubbock texas the other day which 
was the best phone call ive made and he said all the people in 
lubbock think things are going just great 
so what do lubbockites really think about that texan in the white 
house 
i really havent been paying that much attention said 
shirley hubbard a convenience store clerk 
theyre congress giving him a hard time about john tower 
but i say stick with it said retiree william berns he knows 
what hes doing 
while the majority of people questioned about bush by a reporter 
outside the post office approved of his leadership thus far most 
wouldnt give their names 
hes a texan and he understands us said one man 
matt malouf who wrote a letter to the lubbock avalanchejournal 
last week defended bush and blasted the senate for its handling of 
towers confirmation as defense secretary i would rather be ruled 
by the first 100 names in the lubbock phone book than these clowns 
who now reign in the senate 
in choosing lubbock as his example of middle america bush picked 
an easy sell 
this city on the south plains has a population of 186400 and 
more than 150 churches many of them large and conservative 
residents of lubbock county gave the gop ticket 69 percent of the 
vote in november 
here the agrigulturebased economy rises or falls on the 
strength of the annual cotton crop two consecutive strong harvests 
gave this city the lowest unemployment rate in the state at 52 
percent 
lubbock is also the home of one of bushs dearest friends 
independent oil investor robert w blake who was the caller bush 
was referring to when he said lubbockites were behind him 
blake said tuesday he was surprised and pleased to hear bush 
citing him as an objective spokesman on the bush presidency the 
two had spoken on sunday 
hes only had 45 days blake said saying he has known bush 
since 1951 and got to know him better during bushs unsuccessful 
1964 senate campaign against democrat ralph yarborough 
all they do is criticize him blake said but hes upbeat 
you will not find george bush when hes down he just called we 
talked back and forth like friends do i just feel like they ought 
to give him a year to 18 months to get things done 
lubbock mayor bc peck mcminn said people here are pretty 
representative of how the runofthemill people feel across the 
country not the political hype or anything but the rocksolid 
thinkers are pretty representative of how the situation is going

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan told congress on tuesday that he sees no reason to change 
the new catastrophic care program financed by a surtax on elderly 
americans 
were aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed 
about the financing provision but we are also concerned about 
the many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped out 
financially by the tremendous costs of illness sullivan said 
we feel that because this legislation has just been enacted we 
dont have much experience with it yet wed like to follow this and 
see if adjustments need to be made he told the house ways and 
means committee 
leaders in the house and senate also have been generally 
unsympathetic to the complaints from senior citizens who oppose the 
financing provision of the program which helps the elderly and 
disabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threaten 
their financial stability 
for medicareeligible americans those who are over 65 or 
disabled whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least 150 
a year in federal income taxes the surtax is 15 percent of their 
income tax this year next year it is 25 percent and it could rise 
by as much as 1 percentage point a year after that 
sullivans testimony to the house panel was his first before a 
congressional committee since his confirmation to the bush cabinet 
by the senate last week 
we welcome you to the reality of budget deficits said rep 
dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the committee youll find 
us as agreeable as the budget permits 
the secretary was asked many of the same questions he had been 
asked at his confirmation hearing before the senate finance 
committee and a subsequent hearing before the senate labor and human 
resources committee at those hearings he deferred on many of the 
budget questions that were raised saying he had not participated in 
detailed budget discussions with bush administration officials 
rostenkowski said president bushs proposal to reduce medicare 
spending in fiscal 1990 by 5 billion is unacceptable and the 
effects of the deficitreducing grammrudman law are preferable if 
grammrudman cuts were made medicare spending in 1990 would be 
reduced by about 2 billion 
sullivan however said the acrosstheboard cuts of the 
grammrudman law would tie our hands to utilize funds that are 
available in the most productive way 
the secretary also assured the panel that the administrations 
proposed cutbacks chiefly freezing and scaling back increases in 
payments to hospitals and physicians were designed not to affect 
benefit levels

the communist party leadership in the 
republic of slovenia has issued an unprecedented call for ending 
singleparty rule in yugoslavia newspapers said tuesday 
the party leadership in slovenia the most westwardlooking of 
yugoslavias six republics has long advocated the necessity of 
radical reforms in overcoming the countrys worst social and 
economic crisis 
this was the first time however that the partys ruling 
presidium has come out openly in favor of ending oneparty rule 
the end must come to socialist communist and all other 
fundamentalisms said a document formally adopted monday by 
slovenias party presidium 
the document published tuesday by the vecernje novosti daily 
was intended to serve as a guideline for upcoming political and 
economic reforms in yugoslavia 
it alluded to traditional beliefs based on a literal 
interpretation of marxismleninism and regarded as fundamental to 
communist faith 
instead of singleparty rule political pluralism should 
be affirmed the document said 
the party will support freedom democracy political pluralism 
economic efficiency and the creation of an affluent society 
within europe vjesnik another daily quoted the statement as 
saying 
yugoslavia has been a singleparty state since 1946 when the 
communist party abolished all forms of opposition recently 
however a number of alternative groups including a fullfledged 
social democratic party have been set up in slovenia and in the 
neighboring republic of croatia 
the founding of independent alternative groups has met with 
vehement opposition in yugoslavias largest republic of serbia 
where thousands of university students demonstrated last week 
demanding an end to the groups in slovenia and croatia 
serbias hardline party leadership is generally believed to have 
orchestrated the demonstrations it has repeatedly called for 
abolition of the independent groups

iran broke relations with britain on 
tuesday because it refused to suppress the satanic verses whose 
author is under a death sentence by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for 
blaspheming islam 
khomeinis fundamentalist shiite moslem regime which has put a 
price of 52 million on novelist salman rushdies head said it was 
determined to defend islam from foreign insults 
britain said the 88yearold patriarchs order that his followers 
kill rushdie a british citizen violated the principles of 
international relations and the diplomatic rupture was entirely of 
irans making 
iran decided feb 27 to sever diplomatic ties unless britain met 
its demands expressed as follows in a parliamentary resolution 
if the british government does not declare in a maximum period 
of one week its opposition to the unprincipled stand against the 
world of islam the islamic republic of iran and the contents of the 
antiislamic book the satanic verses the foreign ministry of the 
islamic republic of iran is obliged to break all bilateral political 
ties 
moslems object to what they see as rushdies portrayal of the 
prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and his implication that 
mohammed wrote the holy koran rather than receiving it from allah 
rushdie says the novel published last year is a secular study of 
good and evil that is not meant to offend moslems 
more than a dozen countries have banned the book including 
egypt india pakistan and iran riots it inspired in india and 
pakistan have taken at least 19 lives 
rushdie 41 was born in bombay india to moslem parents but has 
said he no longer practices religion he has been in hiding since 
khomeini pronounced the death sentence and iranian clerics offered 
the reward 
in london the foreign office said tuesday that british officials 
had not received formal notification from iran and learned but 
learned of the action through news reports and a tehran radio 
broadcast 
hussein musavi the iranian premier said on irans state radio 
that britain had made a big mistake and moslem countries would 
not permit their beliefs to be insulted 
we are prepared to employ all our might in order to defend the 
borders of our beliefs he said 
an iranian statement accused britain which khomeinis clerics 
consider their worst western enemy after the great satan united 
states of being in the front line of plots and treachery against 
moslems for two centuries 
the world oppressors and the west which find genuine islam 
against their objectives and their plots have risen against islam 
and in this antiislamic campaign the role of the british government 
is salient said the foreign ministry statement distributed by 
the official islamic republic news agency 
after khomeini ordered rushdie killed britain closed its embassy 
in tehran and its 11 european economic community partners along 
with canada norway and sweden recalled their ambassadors to iran 
the confrontation with britain quashed attempts by more moderate 
elements in tehran to open up to western europe in hopes of trade 
and economic assistance in rebuilding after the 8yearold with 
iraq a ceasefire in the war was reached last august 
a foreign office issued tuesday in london said the present 
situation is entirely of irans making incitement to murder is a 
violation of the most elementary principles and obligations that 
govern relations between sovereign states 
it is irans actions which have removed the substance from our 
relations and made it impossible to conduct normal business 
the dispute arose as relations between britain and iran were 
returning to normal in december britain reopened its embassy in 
tehran which had been closed for eight years 
sweden whose envoy returned to tehran over the weekend will 
resume handling british interests in iran 
relatives of the three britons missing in lebanon expressed 
dismay the three are believed held by shiites loyal to iran and 
another briton roger cooper is imprisoned in tehran on espionage 
charges 
the british foreign office said iran canceled a scheduled visit 
to cooper on tuesday by a swedish diplomat 
we will have to sit back and wait rather dismayed said john 
waite a cousin of anglican church envoy terry waite nothing can 
ever be resolved unless there are discussions with the other side 
that was the whole basis of terrys life 
terry waite 49 disappeared jan 20 1987 while trying to 
negotiate the release of two american hostages nine americans are 
among the 15 foreign captives in lebanon 
prime minister margaret thatcher and sir geoffrey howe her 
foreign minister have said they realize the novel offends moslems 
they insist the death threat be dropped however and reject demands 
that the book be banned and its author prosecuted 
in other developments 
indonesias attorney general sukarton marmosudjono said the 
book would soon be banned in that country 
at least 700 schoolchildren marched in dhaka bangladesh to 
protest the novel and president hussain mohammad ershad said 
rushdie should be put on trial 
in canada two buildings at the university of alberta campus in 
edmonton were shut down for several hours monday because of a bomb 
threat protesting a scheduled discussion of the satanic verses 
officials said no bomb was found

from the cathedral of chartres soaring gothic 
vaults to picassos weightless desmoiselles davignon works of art 
have long been associated with flight 
now boston artist lowry burgess sculpture boundless 
aperture is scheduled to take off with the space shuttle discovery 
and give art a lift quite literally out of this world 
the 7pound cubic sculpture part of the artists 20year effort 
to stretch the human imagination is the nations first and possibly 
last interstellar art offering 
if any art went up previously it was done without our knowledge 
and we certainly dont approve of it said tony maull who was 
staff director for the nasa committee that approved burgesss work 
for flight and there is no intention to send any other objects up 
at this time 
burgess conceived his boundless aperture sculpture more than 
two decades ago as part of a larger project entitled the quiet 
axis that includes one sculpture embedded in the pacific ocean 
floor off easter island and another placed in the hindu kush 
mountains in central afghanistan 
boundless aperture consists of a 6inch cube inside of which 
floats another cube bearing colorful holographic plates inscribed 
with poetry on its return it will be placed inside a rock 
outcropping on the decordova museums grounds in lincoln mass 
the artist allows that his latest sculpture is fairly esoteric 
but insists that anyone can appreciate space art 
there are more art enthusiasts out there than the people at the 
museums he said a lot of people are very eager to see a 
cultural dimension to the space effort its humanizing

a democratic senator said tuesday he had seen 
defense secretarydesignate john tower under the influence of 
alcohol in the senate making the dramatic claim shortly after 
president bush insisted that not one senator has firsthand 
evidence that tower had a drinking problem 
senate majority leader george mitchell meanwhile flatly 
predicted the nomination would be rejected when it comes to a vote 
even so sen christopher dodd of connecticut became the second 
democrat to support confirmation 
i owe john tower the same fairness and careful judgment he used 
22 years ago dodd said referring to towers 1967 defense of tom 
dodd then a senator and the father of the current senator the 
elder dodd was censured by the senate for improper use of campaign 
funds 
despite dodds decision democrats showed increasing confidence 
in their ability to prevail and as republicans complained bitterly 
about the tactics of a key democratic opponent to the nomination 
sen sam nunn of georgia 
in a riveting exchange on the fourth day of increasingly heated 
debate sen dennis deconcini dariz said he saw tower under 
the influence of alcohol while on the senate floor tower was a 
senator from 1961 to 1984 
but inebriated to the point that he could not operate 
interrupted sen arlen specter rpa 
i have not seen him inebriated to the extent he could not 
perform his duties replied deconcini who said later he had seen 
tower under the influence several times 
but tower in a statement denied the charge saying i have 
never been inebriated on the senate floor 
bush in a session earlier tuesday with white house reporters 
repeated his oftstated insistence that no senators had firsthand 
information that tower was hampered by a drinking problem 
i havent had one single senator not one who served with 
him over the years say i have seen him my firsthand evidence is 
this man is ineligible because of his consumption of spirits 
bush said 
mitchell said that despite the decision monday of southern 
democrat howell heflin of alabama to support tower the nomination 
will lose 
i believe that when the vote occurs the nomination will be 
rejected and it is obvious if the republicans had the votes they 
would now be demanding the vote take place mitchell told 
reporters 
i frankly see no benefit to anyone in unnecessarily and 
needlessly prolonging this matter he said 
but senate minority leader bob dole of kansas said this has 
just barely started 
he left open the possibility of asking the senate to let tower 
answer the charges against him on the floor itself but he seemed to 
concede it would be a lastditch attempt to stave off defeat and 
democrats said tower had ample opportunity to defend himself before 
nunns committee 
if we can see 50 votes we dont need to make the request 
dole said but if we need one or two the answer is yes yes 
were going to make the request id like to hear john tower defend 
his record in the senate 
an associated press survey shows 47 democrats and sen larry 
pressler rsd leaning against or solidly opposed to confirming 
tower and 40 republicans and two democrats either leaning for or 
supporting confirmation 
democrats hold a 5545 edge in the senate 
a partisan squabble kicked off the day as dole and other 
republicans complained about a decision by nunn to direct staff from 
a separate subcommittee that he heads to investigate new allegations 
of excessive drinking against tower 
we are disturbed by this partisan unit under the control of 
nunn dole said i didnt send out any strike force sam nunn 
did 
nunn defended his weekend move saying the fbi had told him its 
agents had completed the probe and he had no other choice but to 
send senate staff but he said he was dropping the investigation 
after white house counsel c boyden gray had assured him the fbi 
will look into any new allegations 
but that was merely a prelude to the fireworks later in the day 
sen ernest hollings dsc complained bitterly about comments 
dole made on a network interview program in which he referred to the 
vicious personal attacks on tower including hollings use of 
the words crocked sloshed and comatose from the fbi 
report 
in turn dole bristled at the south carolina democrats use of 
the term mr alcoholic abuser in reference to tower wheres 
the vicious attack said the republican leader 
mitchell tried to cut short the debate when he repeated senate 
rules that lawmakers cannot cite excerpts from the fbi report but 
instead he himself got caught up in an angry exchange with sen 
warren rudman rnh over conclusions drawn from the report 
bush repeated his support for tower and termed the nominees 
pledge to swear off alcohol if confirmed by the senate as a 
failsafe guarantee 
i think hell measure up to that qualification indeed he has 
said hell never touch another drop of liquor and youll have 25000 
people in the pentagon making sure thats true bush told an 
impromptu white house news conference

a savings and loan which lost 10 million lost 
quarter has been ordered by the state to sell a 12 million painting 
bought as office furniture and hung in the chairmans home 
centrust savings bank recently bought portrait of a man as 
mars by flemish master peter paul rubens from sothebys auction 
house paying a 12 million commission in addition to the 12 
million purchase price 
in a march 3 letter the florida office of comptroller expressed 
its displeasure with the purchase and ordered the miamibased bank 
to sell the painting within 30 days 
the state has not yet heard what centrust plans to do about the 
order wendy mitchler a spokeswoman in the thrift supervising 
office in tallahassee said tuesday 
however she said it was rare for savings institutions to oppose 
the comptroller because the office supervises all statechartered 
thrifts 
bank chairman david paul said neither he nor his thrift did 
anything wrong and called the dispute a tempest in a teapot 
alex hager the chief of the thrift supervision office said that 
for the bank to hold the masterpiece creates the likelihood of an 
abnormal risk or loss and called the purchase inherently 
speculative 
hagers letter said the comptrollers office did not understand 
how centrust which has lost money for the past two quarters could 
justify buying the painting 
he questioned why paul who is active in miamis art circles was 
keeping the painting in his home 
your letter indicates that the painting although currently 
displayed in your personal residence was acquired as furniture and 
fixtures of centrust and is reflected on the balance sheet as an 
asset of the institution hager wrote 
paul said the rubens is in his home only because new executive 
offices in centrust towers have not yet been completed 
he said the purchase was part of a wise pattern of investing 
noting that the average painting has appreciated 15 percent a year 
recently 
centrust which has assets of 102 billion and 68 offices around 
florida valued its entire art collection at about 20 million the 
comptrollers office has a higher estimate of 30 million 
we have been very careful to put together with the help of the 
curator of sothebys a museumquality art collection paul said 
were no different than the major banks

the government has concluded that 
everything indicates that more than 4000 polish army officers 
massacred at katyn were killed not by the nazis but by soviet secret 
police a spokesman said tuesday 
chief government spokesman jerzy urban said however the 
evidence is circumstantial and poland continues to press for speed 
in the soviet review of one of the most emotional blank spots in 
sovietpolish history 
it was the strongest government statement yet pointing to soviet 
culpability although an official newspaper last month published a 
wartime polish red cross report indicating the officers were killed 
on soviet territory well before the 1941 nazi invasion of the soviet 
union 
urban has said the inscription on a monument in warsaw blaming 
the nazis will be changed 
we think that everything indicates that the crime was committed 
by the stalinist nkvd the secret police force that preceded the 
kgb urban said 
the soviet historians are analyzing this material and are right 
to state that its only circumstantial evidence 
the officers had been deported to the soviet union hitlers army 
uncovered their bodies in spring 1943 in the katyn forest 12 miles 
west of smolensk in the western soviet union 
official soviet and polish histories long held the officers were 
killed by the nazis in 1941 but many poles and western historians 
blamed the soviets 
poland and the soviet union formed a joint commission in 1987 to 
consider the evidence on katyn and other historical questions the 
polish side has submitted its material and indications have emerged 
of growing impatience with the soviet review 
urban said poland understands the soviets want to review material 
in their own archives but we are for speeding up the process of 
looking for them 
poland was attacked first by the nazis from the west and then 
from the east by the soviet union in september 1939 many poles and 
western historians say the soviets killed the polish officers in the 
spring of 1940 when the soviet union and nazi germany were still 
observing a nonaggression pact

a 19yearold navy recruit died during training 
last year because he was intimidated because the service neglected 
safety procedures and because higherups pressured the facility to 
turn out more graduates congressional investigators said tuesday 
and the general accounting office said the recruit lee mirecki 
of appleton wis was not the only sailor to die from such lapses 
in navy training schools around the country over the last two years 
investigators said safety problems contributed to five of 16 
deaths in navy training programs 1986 and 1987 the gao said some of 
the flaws have still not been corrected 
mirecki the agency said had panicked during a swimmingpool 
drill known as sharks and daisies in which swimmers must free 
themselves from an instructor who simulates a drowning person and 
grabs the recruit from behind 
mirecki was counseled given a medical examination and found 
not physically qualified for the course because of a phobia of 
being held under water 
despite the findings he was enrolled in the class a second time 
and forced into the pool again 
the gao said mirecki left the pool and clutched an equipment 
rack shouting i quit and please dont put me back in the 
water 
but instructors dragged him back to the pool he struggled and 
was eventually pulled out unconscious but could not be revived 
an autopsy led authorities to believe mirecki died of heartbeat 
irregularity caused by extreme fear fatigue and insufficient oxygen 
the schools lead instructor was found guilty by a general 
courtmartial of negligent homicide demoted and confined for 90 
days eight others associated with the class were given 
administrative punishments including demotions and reprimands 
rep toby roth rwis who requested the investigtion along with 
other members of the states congressional delegation called 
mireckis death a tragedy waiting to happen 
this gao report is a catalog of failures by the navy which led 
to lee mireckis death and others roth told a news conference 
he vowed to see that the remaining problems are resolved and 
asked vice admiral john disher head of the services training 
system to contact families of recruits who died in training to 
tell them what really happened 
the gao said it had discussed its findings with the navy and 
reported that officials generally agreed and were receptive to 
suggestions on how to improve training safety and death and mishap 
investigations 
roth said he believed the navy initially covered up the reason 
for mireckis death thinking this would go away like so many 
other cases in the past but the persistence of mireckis family 
and classmates roth said brought the truth to light 
the gao said that some improvements have been made at the school 
the sharks and daisies drill has been dropped instructors are 
better trained safety equipment is kept by the swimming pool and 
there is a clearer policy regarding students rights to drop out of 
a course 
but the gao said that there remains great pressure on students 
not to drop out of a course because it is made clear to them that 
doing so will adversely affect their careers and that there still 
is no system to alert instructors to students with a history of 
problems 
the bottom line roth said is that navy instructors still 
are not trained to conduct highrisk training and that students 
still are not screened to make sure they can handle the dangers 
in mireckis case roth pointed to gao findings that he had 
untrained and unsupervised instructors and was prevented from 
dropping out because of pressure on the school to increase the 
number of graduates it turned out 
the gao also faulted the navy for its investigation of mireckis 
death and said the service doesnt always investigate such deaths as 
thoroughly as it should 
in addition the investigators wrote that the ability of these 
investigations as presently conducted to identify and address safety 
issues is questionable

an aide to gov buddy roemer raised hopes 
tuesday for a compromise in a 15yearold federal desegregation 
lawsuit against louisianas colleges and universities 
the courtappointed special master overseeing the integration 
effort had scheduled a morning hearing but called off the session 
after meeting with lawyers attorneys were to meet with him 
wednesday in private a secretary said 
john kennedy counsel to roemer and state sen william 
jefferson attorney for the southern university system said earlier 
tuesday that lawyers in the case were getting closer to a 
settlement but neither would give details or predict that a 
settlement would be reached 
nor could they be reached later for comment calls to their 
offices and hotels were not returned 
asked about speculation that a proposed settlement had been drawn 
up john keller chairman of the board of regents said i would 
be pretty sure theyve gotten pretty far but not sure they have 
gotten that far 
thomas todd a lawyer representing grambling state university 
alumni said the delay did not mean that settlement was imminent 
theres nothing to be read into this negotiations are always 
continuing they never stop but there are a lot of technical things 
that have got to be done in conjunction with a hearing like this 
said todd one of those is negotiation 
the us justice department filed the lawsuit against the 
lousiana system in 1974 
louisiana the justice department southern university and the 
grambling state university alumni association all have proposals 
before special master paul verkuil appointed by a threejudge 
federal panel to supervise desegregation of louisianas 13 state 
universities and six twoyear colleges 
grambling as one of the nine schools run by the board of 
trustees for state colleges and universities backs the states 
plan but its alumni association like southern objects to what it 
sees as moves that would eliminate traditionally black schools and 
deprive underprivileged black youngsters of the help they need to 
adapt to college life and courses 
those moves include a keystone of the states plan consolidating 
the boards that govern southern the louisiana state university 
system and nine regional colleges and the board that oversees 
those three boards into one superboard 
roemer said he would not budge on the superboard issue but might 
accept the establishment of weaker advisory boards without the 
power to hire fire or set budgets 
the states plan also calls for a statewide community college 
system which southern and the grambling alumni contend would keep 
many blacks from ever making it into a fouryear university 
the justice southern and grambling alumni plans depend heavily 
on moving programs from predominantly white schools to schools that 
are predominantly black an arrangement kennedy says failed in other 
states that tried it 
verkuil is president of the college of william amp mary in virginia 
and a former dean of tulane universitys law school

a pair of senators introduced legislation 
tuesday to permanently ban cigarette smoking on all domestic 
flights a bill that immediately received the endorsement of surgeon 
general c everett koop 
the measure would expand the current prohibition against smoking 
which covers flights of two hours or less and is due to expire in 
april 1990 
the time has come to protect the health and safety of all 
airline passengers said sen frank lautenberg dnj who 
cosponsored the bill with sen orrin hatch rutah 
at the senators news conference to announce the proposal koop 
said such a ban is long overdue 
he cited a recent study by the national cancer institute which 
found that passengers in nonsmoking sections of airliners had 
similar levels of nicotine in their saliva and urine to travelers in 
smoking areas 
the bill would leave intact the 1000 fine that can be levied 
against those violating the smoking ban and the 2000 penalty for 
people caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms

though the ancient incas thrived on this 
andean nations stingy soil peru today has farming woes that drain 
its funds and leave it short of food 
analysts say the major culprit is a land reform program south 
americas largest that has failed to keep modern perus feeble farm 
production growing at the same pace as the population 
agriculture was mortally wounded by the agrarian program 
perus leading newspaper el comercio said in a recent editorial 
bemoaning the 20th anniversary of the event 
many people think the spreading chaos in peru marked by the 
flight of hundreds of thousands of highland peasants to city slums 
a deep economic recession and a leftist guerrilla insurgency has 
been aggravated by the failure of land reform 
politicians and agronomists alike are frantically seeking 
solutions and they hope recent legislation will help 
the issue is reflected by the castle an ornate mansion on a 
former cotton barrons estate it sits like a fading symbol on the 
outskirts of canete an oasis town on the desert coast 100 miles 
south of lima the capital 
like hundreds of other large farms the estates 1500 acres were 
expropriated and organized into a cooperative for the 100 peasant 
families who had worked the land as virtual serfs 
today the castle lies abandoned and deteriorating much like the 
agrarian reform instituted by the leftist military ruler at the 
time gen juan velasco 
but its surrounding fertile farmlands have begun to reflect their 
former glory since the government allowed the cooperatives to be 
divided up among their members 
under velasco we all made good money but no one wanted to 
work said jubilio ensiso 42 one of the castles farmers 
theyd spend just four or six hours in the fields 
now we put in twice that because we are working for ourselves 
he farms 11 acres of corn cotton and pumpkins 
velascos land reform program sought to break the aristocracys 
grip over the countryside his aim was to distribute income and 
increase farm output 
about 22 million acres were redistributed more land than in any 
reform program outside of cuba 
productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience 
took control analysts say the program eventually failed in a morass 
of inefficiency due to poor planning and execution 
fewer than 20 percent of perus landless peasants actually 
received land according to the institute for peruvian studies a 
private social research center 
since the program began in 1969 farm output has grown slightly 
more than 1 percent yearly while the population grew by 25 percent 
a year 
as a result successive governments have had to increase imports 
of food staples the 1988 foreign grocery bill reached 600 million 
onequarter of perus export earnings 
the problem was aggravated when the debtstrapped government of 
president alan garcia late last year ran low of foreign currency to 
pay for the imports 
sporadic shortages of wheat dried milk and other staples have 
plagued peru since then and the government has asked other nations 
for emergency food 
modern farming woes contrast sharply with the success of the 
incas who routinely had a surplus after feeding a population 
estimated at more than half of perus current 21 million 
though the spanish destroyed the incas highly organized society 
some of their agricultural expertise including desert irrigation 
canals and mountain terraces is still widely applied by peruvian 
peasants today 
the incas were probably the best agronomists in the world they 
had to be to survive said marc dourojeanni a professor at limas 
national agrarian university 
dourojeanni says just 3 percent of peru which is roughly the 
size of texas arizona and new mexico combined is suitable for 
cultivation 
five years ago the government drastically modified the failing 
reform program and began allowing cooperatives to cut their lands 
into parcels with equal sections going to members to reap whatever 
profits they could 
farmer ensiso says output since then at the former cotton estate 
here has grown about 20 percent since then a figure he says is 
generally true of other cooperatives that divided up their lands 
perus total farm production rose 7 percent in 1988 compared 
with a 9 percent decline in the economy as a whole 
specialists say the agricultural troubles are far from resolved 
but agree the modifications in land reform are helping

despite 10 years of peace israelis living 
in egypt still face resentment and are forced to keep a low profile 
for reasons of politics and security 
foreign minister moshe arens on a rare trip to egypt by a senior 
israeli official tried to raise israeli visibility recently by 
visiting this stateowned farm where israeli experts are involved in 
an irrigation project 
this project is a big success arens said and being a big 
success it will become well known 
the project was started in 1986 but was kept quiet until the 
foreign minister came with a busload of journalists 
egypts agriculture minister yussef wali noted that while the 
project had not been publicized in egyptian media it is highly 
visible to egyptians because it is about 60 miles north of cairo on 
a main highway to alexandria on the mediterranean 
it is seen by thousands of people and this is real publicity 
for the project wali said 
the farm however has no sign to show that israeli experts are 
there watching over such crops as chilis sweet peppers tomatoes 
and cucumbers 
a large greenandwhite billboard however announces saudi 
arabian cooperation in other aspects of the farm 
mark zuk 38 one of a halfdozen israeli agriculture advisers 
here said he had no specific instructions to hide his presence but 
he added that political events sometimes made the atmosphere tense 
and he avoids sensitive topics one such topic is the 15month 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip where israeli soldiers have killed more than 390 arabs 
we never talk about political subjects zuk said they 
dont bring it up and neither do i i feel comfortable with the 
people i am working with and dont feel any rejection 
thousands of israeli tourists have visited egypt since israel 
signed the peace treaty march 26 1979 that ended three decades of 
war about 100 israeli embassy staff members and their families now 
live in cairo but only about a dozen nonofficial israelis work in 
egypt on a fulltime basis 
ovadia keidar 48 an israeli agronomist who lives in cairo with 
his wife and three of his five children said the relationship 
between israelis and egyptians remains tentative complex and often 
emotional 
the peace agreement is not something that you can switch on and 
off you make the peace gradually breaking through one barrier and 
then another i believe that peace will survive the occasional ups 
and down what we have to do is understand each other 
keidar was born in egypt speaks arabic fluently and has a good 
knowledge of the country his family was forced out of egypt after 
the 1956 suez war and keidar became a settler in the sinai desert 
after it was captured by israel in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
he then fought as an israeli soldier on the egyptian front in the 
war of 1973 was uprooted from his sinai settlement by the 1979 
peace agreement and returned to work in cairo five years ago 
in the beginning he said he was afraid for his safety but 
eventually decided to stay 
if i couldnt start here who could he said 
keidar said his battle for acceptance has produced mixed results 
he recalled that when his daughter was 5 years old she was excluded 
from the birthday party of her best friend because her friends 
parents didnt want an israeli in their home 
she was very hurt and sad he said 
when his daughter turned 6 keidar had a birthday party in a 
restaurant and his daughters friend attended 
we met the parents there and became friendly he said one 
of the parents studied with my cousin 
the keidars now visit the egyptian family in their home but the 
egyptian family who are related by marriage to palestinians have 
yet to visit the keidar home 
there are still some barriers because of the palestinian 
problem but i can understand them said keidar adding he 
believed relations would remain uneasy with egypt until there was a 
negotiated settlement of the future of the west bank and gaza strip 
the low point in egyptianisraeli relations came oct 5 1985 
when seven israeli tourists were killed when an egyptian policeman 
opened fire on a beach party at ras bourka in the sinai the 
policeman suleiman khatir was sentenced to life in prison he died 
in jail as a result of what authorities said was a suicide 
earlier the same year an israeli embassy employee albert 
atrakchi 30 was assassinated by a gunman in cairo 
the only resident israeli correspondent in egypt yoram mizrachi 
of the liberal newspaper haaretz moves frequently to avoid being 
targeted after the egyptian weekly al ahali described him as a 
dangerous man and published his address 
other israelis he said use bodyguards because of resentment 
among egyptians 
mizrachi who has been in egypt about six months recalled that 
egyptian journalists once demanded he leave a news conference 
one of them called out that there was an israeli present and 
they would not participate if i did so i left 
mizrachi said however he was able to move freely to cover the 
news visiting neighborhoods throughout cairo and even the 
palestinian liberation organization 
a former commander of israeli troops in south lebanon mizrachi 
recently interviewed plo chairman yasser arafat risking censure and 
possible prosecution at home for dealing with the outlawed group

as baby m turns 3 this month the 
controversy that surrounded her birth to a surrogate mother has 
diminished little 
more than 60 bills have been introduced in state legislatures and 
three in congress to ban regulate or study surrogacy since the 
march 27 1986 birth to mary beth whitehead of the little girl she 
was paid 10000 to carry 
melissa as baby m now is named lives with william and elizabeth 
stern in tenafly with one sixhour visit a week from her biological 
mother her parents wont talk about the case their daughter or 
the woman who bore her and is now engaged in a 22city promotional 
tour for her book a mothers story 
i really thought this was something special said mrs 
whiteheadgould now married to dean gould whose child her fifth 
she is expecting in july i really thought it was a way for an 
emptyarmed couple to have a child 
i really was naive she said recently she criticized the 
clinic where she was inseminated with sterns sperm for inadequately 
explaining the process and how she might feel but realizes she 
should have asked more questions 
i thought it was something so wonderful you dont think of the 
bad i didnt want to hurt the sterns it was very hard to tell 
them no you cant have the baby she named sara the name on 
the birth certificate mrs whiteheadgould returned the 10000 to 
stern 
the case alerted the public to in vitro research said robert 
d arenstein a new york lawyer for mrs whiteheadgould who has 
been working for the past year with the washingtonbased national 
coalition against surrogacy 
you just cant take somebodys baby away from them all these 
things had never been addressed in a contract arenstein said 
the coalition sees surrogacy as a creation of tragedy said 
its lawyer andrew kimbrell the group was established partly to 
provide lowcost legal aid to women involved in surrogacy contracts 
and as a support network for them 
among supporters of surrogacy is gary n skoloff a lawyer for 
stern 
one out of seven married couples in the united states are 
infertile skoloff said since medical science has now figured 
out a way for a couple to have a child through artificial 
insemination it ought to be legalized but be wellregulated 
if adoption can be wellregulated then surrogacy can be 
wellregulated 
the new jersey supreme court while awarding custody of baby m to 
william stern last year outlawed surrogacy for pay in the state 
state sen catherine costa has introduced a bill to regulate 
arrangements for surrogacy contracts 
louisiana nebraska and kentucky have declared surrogacy 
contracts void and unenforceable michigan also assesses criminal 
penalties for paid surrogacy an indiana law prohibits the state 
from enforcing a surrogacy contract in florida surrogacyforhire 
is illegal but a woman can voluntarily bear a child for someone 
else and be reimbursed for medical and some living expenses 
at least three bills have been introduced in congress to ban 
surrogacy to prohibit federal enforcement of the contracts and to 
bar use of federal money to help veterans get children through 
surrogacy 
the american bar association without endorsing surrogate 
motherhood last month offered a blueprint for legalizing surrogacy 
it suggested that contracts be limited to married couples and a 
surrogate mother who would have 180 days to change her mind after 
conception a judge would have to approve the pact before 
conception and the egg or the sperm would have to come from the 
couple 
skoloff believes surrogacy will be debated until its legalized 
in three or four states where all couples will go the whole idea 
is to protect kids and having no statute is giving them the least 
amount of protection he said 
a mothers story written with investigative journalist 
loretta schwartznobel and published by st martins press inc 
begins with the birth and is limited by court order only to baby ms 
second birthday 
the sterns tried to block the book arguing it would exploit the 
child mrs whiteheadgould 31 said she wrote the book so her 
daughter would know her side of the story and to help her other 
children cope with the case 
its pretty much over for me she said but i hope if one 
woman reads this she will think again about her doing it

its probably the first time during the course of 
an interview that the star has been told get out of the trash 
no the star is not geraldo rivera she is cinnamon a red 
doberman pinscher a rescue dog whose job it is to search through 
forests lakes or earthquake rubble to find people 
the only thing cinnamon loves more than people is doughnuts 
notes cinnamons owner and trainer shirley hammond explaining why 
cinnamon keeps dipping her nose into the conference room trash can 
seeking the discarded remains of a pastry 
cinnamon is one of the dogs taken to mexico city to help find 
victims buried beneath the massive 1985 earthquake 
and she is among the remarkable working dogs featured in the 
national geographic special those wonderful dogs airing 
tonight on pbs 
those wonderful dogs is a fascinating and lovingly 
photographed film that will please doglovers enormously but doesnt 
get overly sentimental it was written and produced by barbara 
jampel richard kiley provides the narration the special is 
dedicated to the memory of film editor john dabney who did such an 
excellent job of putting it all together 
other dogs featured in the special include sheepdogs combat 
dogs dogs who assist the disabled and sled dogs 
the special ranged as far as new zealand to observe a team of 10 
sheepdogs who help one couple manage a huge remote sheep farm 
without the dogs says farmer grant calder wed be broke in 
12 months he observes that his dogs are willing to work till they 
drop and all they seek in return is approval from their master 
there are two different kinds of sheepdogs the ones who nip at 
the heels of the sheep and headers who control the sheep from 
in front by staring into their eyes once the sheep are in the pens 
the dogs run across the backs of the packed herd to move them along 
the special moves on to alaska where susan butcher takes the 
filmmakers through the training regimen that has produced her 
champion sled teams regular winners of the 1100mile iditarod sled 
race 
one of the most touching segments is set in a more mundane 
environment a typical american home where lives 17yearold mike 
knowlton a victim of spina bifida who uses a wheelchair and his 
yellow labrador retriever zest 
zest is a product of californiabased canine companions for 
independence similar to a seeing eye dog she helps her owner by 
pulling his wheelchair turning off light switches picking up 
dropped objects and serving as an icebreaker mike says he used 
to be too shy to approach other students at his school but now they 
come up to him to pet the dog 
if you grew up on lassie hammond will disappoint you when 
she insists that rescue dogs like cinnamon arent aware that they 
are saving peoples lives but are only playing a hideandseek game 
hammond is a founder of the california rescue dogs association 
whose members found dozens of survivors beneath the rubble of the 
mexico earthquake cinnamon herself was responsible for finding 
eight people hammond says 
cinnamon also searches for people who have wandered into 
wilderness areas and become lost she even locates drowning victims 
riding in a boat and detecting the gases emitted by a body beneath 
the water 
maybe cinnamon doesnt know shes saving lives but she does have 
a different signal when she finds a live person she wags her 
behind than the more subdued scratching at the surface when she 
finds a dead person 
rescue dogs have to be trained to ignore their natural instinct 
to jump off unstable surfaces they are taught to walk a horizontal 
ladder so they become more aware of the position of their hind feet 
rescue dogs are selected for their love of all people hammond 
said many dogs will search all day for their beloved owner but 
dont care about strangers hammond said she picked cinnamon now 
8 out of litter of pups because she was the one most eager for 
human contact sure enough though she had only just met her 
interviewer she happily administered a facewashing

nobody loves to hate people like people 
love to hate auto mechanics 
if your car is broken you need it fixed right away but you 
sometimes cant get it fixed right away and it costs too much when 
it is fixed if it was fixed right 
and you cant really understand what that mechanic is saying 
anyway is all that gobbledygook just the cover for a ripoff 
its all a matter of communication according to the head of an 
awardwinning school for auto mechanics who says communication 
skills and ethics are just as important in the curriculum as gaskets 
and spark plugs 
one of the most difficult things is to be able to communicate 
in a twoway fashion said richard diklich coordinator of the 
automobile technology program at longview community college 
there is a basic element of distrust on both sides ive found 
that customers often dont want to have their cars fixed because it 
is going to be an inconvenience and expensive so they let it go and 
the problem gets worse and it becomes more expensive 
the longview auto tech student spends about twothirds of the 
time working on mechanics and about onethird in liberal arts 
classes 
we try to work with the technical student on communication 
skills consumer attitudes work ethic and attitude as a part of 
what we do diklich said 
students study for example composition and reading or speech or 
american history along with courses on diagnosis and repair of 
automotive brake systems 
longview this year won the annual competition of the motor 
vehicle manufacturers association and the american vocational 
association industry planning council the school had finished 
second in the prestigious competition last year 
students enrolled at longview have the option of following one 
program that is closely linked with general motors ford or toyota 
they get half their training at the school and spend half their time 
working in the shop at a manufacturers dealership they later find 
jobs working for a dealership 
students can also get a more general training that qualifies them 
to work in other repair shops such as service stations 
on a tour of the schools new 22000squarefoot building 
instructor bill fairbanks shows off a huge garage with several ports 
for cars the latest in diagnostic equipment wellequipped 
classrooms and wellstocked parts rooms 
they wont find anything out there in equipment that we dont 
have here said fairbanks 
the parking lot at longview is filled with cars donated to the 
school for students to work on including a late model cadillac with 
the latest in onboard computer technology 
the technology of the car has increased said diklich the 
amount of material we have to teach has more than doubled since the 
1970s but they come from the high school and now have had 
experience with computers and with electronics it is still 
basically using diagnostic procedures to find out what is wrong 
demand for qualified mechanics is high particularly in rural 
areas general motors estimates a shortage of 125000 mechanics 
qualified to work on its cars 
training has become more necessary diklich said the 
manufacturers recognize this and they have begun looking to the 
colleges and universities for help the manufacturers can train the 
current model technology but they cant develop the background for 
the future

the younger son of martin luther king jr became 
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his 
fathers church on what would have been the civil rights pioneers 
60th birthday 
dexter scott king declared that he the son of a son of a 
movement was ready to take a leadership role out rolled the 
resonant vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to 
demand their share of the american dream 
for many it was as if mlk himself had come home 
but dexter king is a quiet man with a small circle of friends 
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to 
politics he was planted squarely in his fathers shoes with a 
degree of reluctance 
i was tapped it was simply an issue of something that was 
inevitable he said it surprised a lot of people including 
myself because its not the kind of thing that you can readily 
prepare for 
i had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not 
belong to me and although all of us like to think that we have a 
choice in what our roles will be i have to think of my fathers 
role 
dexter kings jan 14 appointment as president of the king 
center aimed at keeping his fathers legacy alive was a relief to 
the civil rights community pressure within the movement for someone 
to take up the torch had been heavy 
when coretta scott king made the announcement she pointed out 
that dexter at 28 is about the same age his father was when he led 
bus boycotts in montgomery ala that sparked the civil rights 
movement 
being the son of the civil rights leader makes dexter uniquely 
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle she said 
atlanta mayor andrew young a member of the centers board of 
directors and a longtime contemporary of martin luther king jr 
said dexters selection showed we are moving forward carrying on 
with another generation 
king says he doesnt want to have to fight with his fathers 
image 
i have never felt like i or anyone else can walk in his shoes 
i can only follow and complement what hes already done ive never 
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership there are certain 
things you just cant inherit 
yet there are things he did inherit among them the calm pensive 
demeanor that was his fathers trademark not the speaking style 
that went to younger sister bernice but dexter king does sound and 
look like his dad 
what he did was exclusive to him i can only be my best self 
and if being my best self means that i achieve great things and 
become a great leader then i will be commended on that basis 
but not because people say youre going to follow in your fathers 
footsteps 
larry carter dean of the martin luther king jr international 
chapel at morehouse college sees dexter king as a peaceful man who 
will function well as president of the center he seems natural 
for that based on my assessment of his temperament hes very 
polite hes very considerate 
hes not a riproaring orator like his sister bernice but hes 
capable of passion and has believability 
carter who has known king for about four years said he never 
knew whether the mlk image was a problem for dexter king he never 
let it show 
king who attended morehouse his fathers alma mater but has 
not graduated is founder and president of visionary development 
corp a business and development consulting firm he also directs 
the centers office of special events and entertainment and produced 
a record marking the first federal king holiday in 1986 
king said he was first considered for president of the king 
center two years ago when there was some talk amongst the board 
members and my mother about moving one of the four king children 
into a leadership role 
but yolanda 33 serves as the centers producing director of 
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with attallah shabazz 
daughter of the late malcolm x martin luther king iii a retiring 
softspoken 31yearold is a fulton county commissioner and 
bernice 25 is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology 
at emory university in atlanta 
at that time i was not specifically targeted king said 
recently our immediate family more or less talked about the 
fact that my mother is not getting any younger 
he explained that the changes effective april 4 the 21st 
anniversary of his fathers assassination would free my mother 
up and allow us to work as a team king will manage the centers 
administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and 
chief executive officer 
some of the goals he has set for the king center include getting 
young people excited about a movement they are too young to 
remember he also wants to disseminate the centers message and 
nonviolent teachings 
another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial 
base he said with an endowment that allows us to 
institutionalize our work so that were not just trying to hang on 
day by day or donation by donation 
he hopes it wont be too lonely at the top 
i dont know a lot of young national and international leaders 
but i will be thrust into that role it is lonely and it is 
frustrating because you really want to have people around you who 
can really understand where youre coming from

housing discrimination against families with 
children is illegal starting sunday but nokids communities are 
fighting to protect their lifestyles even as experts laud the new 
law for addressing a national crisis 
there will be resistance and claims of reverse 
discrimination but the fact of the matter is congress has decided 
families with children have a great need for housing and this law is 
designed to help them said jim morales staff attorney for the 
san franciscobased national center for youth law 
a 1980 department of housing and urban development study found 
that 75 percent of rental units nationwide banned or restricted 
children other surveys found 90 percent of apartment complexes in 
some communities closed to children 
we just found an epidemic of discrimination against families 
with children all over the united states it was really tragic 
said us rep don edwards dcalif a cosponsor of the fair 
housing amendments act of 1988 signed into law by president reagan 
in september 
the act bans discrimination against families with children with 
some exemptions and adds the handicapped to housing law prohibiting 
discrimination on the basis of sex religion national origin color 
and race 
blatant and legal cases of discrimination against families with 
children are happening all over the country and in all types 
of communities said lisa mihaly of the washingtonbased 
childrens defense fund 
in zephyrhills fla beverly and thomas elmer were forced in 
january to evict their 14yearold daughter staci rather than go to 
jail for contempt of court in a dispute over deed restrictions she 
can visit their mobile home in a subdivision of 17 families north of 
tampa but must live with a married brother until she turns 15 next 
month pets are allowed but not children under 15 
im not surprised the constitution isnt made for kids 
staci said 
in margate fla jamie swartz 9 was threatened with eviction 
when she moved in with her father and stepmother after her mother 
died after months of uncertainty jamie got a reprieve in january 
when the condominium board decided not to take action while the new 
federal housing act was researched 
a portland ore couple were forced to send their 3yearold 
son to live with friends because of a dispute with neighbors at 
apartments that had been converted into condominiums with a 
nochildren rule 
of course we couldnt just banish him into a black hole and 
he returned for clothes and toys said his mother linda benyahich 
after neighbors saw him she got a call from the boards lawyer who 
said if he came again for any reason they were going to send the 
sheriff out to remove him 
in monroe nj a judge mediated an agreement allowing 
46yearold ann romer to be a guest for 60 days in the condo she and 
her husband theodore 60 bought at the rossmoor condominiums the 
condo association had not allowed the couple who live in new york 
city to buy property because mrs romer wasnt 48 the judges 
sept 15 agreement allowed them to buy the weekend home 
the new housing rules allow age restrictions in retirement 
communities if all residents are over 62 or if at least 80 percent 
of the households have at least one member over 55 and special 
services are offered for older people or in housing sponsored by 
state and federal programs for the elderly 
under a transition provision those who are under the minimum age 
and were living in an elderly development as of sept 13 1988 will 
not have to give up their residence nor will the community 
jeapordize its exemption 
leon rubin defends the childfree lifestyle he enjoys at a 
margate condominium that is changing its documents to remain exempt 
his sentiments are widely shared especially among mostly elderly 
developments 
rubin president of the oriole gardens condominium association 
said many of his neighbors are infirm and under nurses care and 
besides no one would like to have a squirrely kid next door 
crying in the middle of the night 
this is our lifestyle im satisfied with what we have now 
while retirement communities are essentially exempted 
adultsonly developments around the country will be affected by the 
act 
attorney gary poliakoff of fort lauderdale contends the act 
encourages discrimination against the 18 to 55yearolds who live 
in adult communities and probably wont open much existing housing 
to children 
poliakoff whose firm represents 1700 florida communities says 
most of those affected have smaller units recreational facilities 
designed for adults and a surrounding social infrastructure thats 
not oriented to families 
mobile home parks also present a special situation 
the people who make up our membership are not elderly in the 
usual sense theyre active retirees social and dont want to live 
next door to children said federation of mobile homeowners of 
florida spokeswoman kathleen conture 
some may have to under the new law mobilehomepark owners and 
apartment managers now face having to make developments kidfriendly 
with playgrounds and safety fences or figure out if they qualify for 
exemption as retirement havens 
in areas with age restrictions reaction to the act has been 
mixed but some people are clearly upset they may have to give up 
adultonly living 
we dont think that you can just take a whole neighborhood and 
say we dont want to live with children said edwards children 
have rights too 
sixteen states have barred housing discrimination on the basis of 
familial status but experts say the laws are generally weak and 
contain huge loopholes 
the california supreme court in 1982 prohibited discrimination 
against families with children in apartment rentals and later 
extended that to condos mobile home parks have been exempt a 
provision the federal law will override 
but families still face subtler discrimination such as limits on 
the number of occupants complexes with segregated areas for adults 
and families with children and other restrictive rules said 
morales about a third of the housing complaints received by 
californias department of fair employment and housing involve 
children he said 
enforcement of the 1988 act will rest with the states if their 
housing law is substantially equivalent to federal law and 
enforcement mechanisms already in place are recertified by hud the 
federal housing agency will handle cases in those states that arent 
equipped to deal with housing complaints 
the period to file a complaint has been extended from 180 days to 
a year and an administrative law judge will now be able to hear a 
case and award actual damages injunctive relief or top civil 
penalties of 50000 
at the federal court level a 100000 cap on punitive damages 
has been eliminated and the federal government previously only 
able to seek injunctive relief will be able to seek civil penalties 
up to 100000 against violators 
everybody needs to be educated about what the law says said 
mihaly i think well begin to see fairly dramatic changes

from feudal tibet to hill tribe 
villages in thailand an american family has offered medicine fruit 
trees primer readers and the bible to impoverished asians for 
nearly seven decades 
members of the morse missionary clan also rescued downed pilots 
in world war ii suffered torture at the hands of chinese 
revolutionaries and hid for six years in a jungle valley from 
burmas military rulers 
along the way they picked up a dozen languages and about that 
many diseases in a fourgeneration odyssey across a vast wild swath 
of asia 
today the morse family has grown to 75 members and more than 
half live in northern thailand a tolerant haven for many western 
missionaries forced by political upheavals to uproot from other 
corners of asia 
while trying to spread christianity the morses carry out basic 
development work with groups like the lisu tribe and attempt to help 
the tribes cope with rapid economic and social changes sweeping the 
hills more than 400 hill tribe children christian buddhist and 
animist live in a morserun hostel when they come down from their 
villages for schooling in this northern hub 
since we grew up like them in very basic conditions we can act 
as liaisons between where they have been and where they are going 
says 40yearold david morse we hope to be a moderating 
influence we hope that they dont jump from the jungle into the 
21st century without being ready 
the work david adds is in some ways more complex than the 
stark lifeordeath situations that faced his grandfather and 
family patriarch justin russell morse when he and his wife 
gertrude left their native oklahoma for tibet 
while todays morses shop in chiang mai supermarkets family 
chronicles say j russell had to take along a fivemonth supply of 
candles on the journey to tibet in 1921 the trip took four months 
with gertrude clutching an infant son while being carried along 
mountain ledges in a sedan chair shouldered by opiumsmoking coolies 
today a lot of missionaries regard what they do as a job they 
can quit theyre softies by comparison says ron another 
grandchild papa morses generation went out for life 
j russells sons recalled in interviews that the family put up 
with the vermin desolation and banditry of tibet but found the 
medieval buddhist world impenetrable to their message in 1927 
they left for the triborder area of tibet burma and china a 
region of dank jungles remote tribes and towns razed by civil war 
they also parted with the united christian missionary society and 
have since remained a onefamily missionary outfit dependent on 
support from individual churches in the united states and canada 
during world war ii the morses in touch with the allied 
command recommended flight paths through the rugged borderlands 
urged tribespeople to aid downed pilots and themselves rescued 
several airmen j russell and two of his sons later were decorated 
by the us military 
j russell remained in china through the 1949 victory of mao 
tsetungs communists but was arrested in 1951 jailed and tortured 
fifteen months later he was released without explanation and 
deported to hong kong arriving with 170 in his pocket 
the family regrouped in putao northern burma where diseases and 
famine were ravaging the lisu and rawang with authorities unable to 
offer much assistance 
the morses say that besides setting up a clinic j russell and 
family members laid out new sanitationconscious villages and 
planned irrigation canals a literacy drive was started and son 
robert now a wellregarded linguist worked on setting five tribal 
languages into written form where none had previously existed 
a fruit industry which still thrives today was initiated with 
j russell experimenting with a variety of trees he trained a corps 
of grafters presenting successful ones with pocket knives that 
became local status symbols 
the morses and some of their colleagues like to describe those 
days as the golden age of missionaries in asia despite the hardships

to the untrained eye the computergenerated 
aerial map shows only a triangle of red next to a field of blue but 
the image produced by heatsensing scanners developed by nasa is of 
a 17thcentury spanish mission 
its fantastic said archaeology curator jerry milanich of 
the florida museum of natural history i never saw anything so 
magical in my life 
the scanners picked out what is left of the mission santa fe de 
toloco in a cow pasture dotted in spring with tiny purple flowers 
researchers have found what they believe are the kitchen priests 
residence church and cemetery 
the daedalus multispectral scanner developed by the national 
aeronautics and space administrations space remote sensing center 
differentiate soil from clay and other early construction materials 
by differences in heat absorption 
computers create images showing differences as small as a 
halfdegree 
the instruments will revolutionize archaeology milanich said 
noting they saved 10000 and five years work if we started 
digging trenches it would take forever and we might destroy an 
important part of the site he said 
the pasture near the santa fe river in alachua county north of 
the university of florida gainesville campus is where missionaries 
tended crops celebrated mass and tried to spread the gospel to six 
nearby indian villages 
it was one of more than 40 mission outposts that dotted la 
florida beginning in the mid1500s santa fe de toloco stood here 
more than a century until 1702 when british soldiers and their 
indian allies burned and looted it leaving ruins that eventually 
were hidden by grass and flowers 
on christmas eve 1986 a team led by university of florida 
graduate student ken johnson stumbled on pottery spikes and clay 
using spanish documents they were able to narrow to within 10 miles 
the location of santa fe de toloco

theres a pitcher at mississippi state 
university with a 200 mph fastball and a batter that can hit 
anything the pitcher tosses 
not on the baseball diamond the battery is in the aerospace 
engineering department where scientists have been busily 
researching baseball bats for the past year for three manufacturers 
worth easton and spalding 
our purpose is to explore how different materials react with 
the ball said professor keith koenig who with leslie hester 
designed and built most of the machines used to test the bats they 
modified some others like the 200mph air cannon koenig sets up 
most of the experiments and interprets the results while hester is 
responsible for the hardware but mostly they play ball 
we shoot the balls out of the air cannon at about 150 miles an 
hour and measure the ball speed we can measure with computers 
the ball speed into the bat and away from the bat the bat movement 
the bat stresses and the direction the ball goes koenig said 
they use different materials for bats such as aluminum 
graphite ceramic and wood to test reactions 
what have they learned 
well some information is proprietary we dont even share 
among companies koenig said but an example would be the big 
difference in how a ball comes off a bat when hit near the handle 
some balls travel farther or are harder to field when hit off a bat 
handle however when a ball strikes the same bat near the head the 
ball doesnt perform nearly so well 
this knowledge would help the batter who crowds the plate 
koenig said he would like to know which bat performs well when he 
hits off the handle thats something the bat manufacturers would 
like to know too

scientists this spring plan to launch a 
particle beam accelerator on a 10minute suborbital flight to help 
study whether devices that generate neutral particle beams might be 
useful in spacebased weapons 
electrically charged particle beams would be bent by the earths 
magnetic field lines but neutral beams should fly straight 
according to scientists who have been working on such devices for 
antimissile defense since 1975 
the launch of a 40foot aries rocket from white sands missile 
range carrying a 10footlong particle accelerator will be the first 
test in space by the los alamos national laboratory scientists 
at altitudes above 75 miles the accelerator will shoot 1200 
pencilshaped bursts of hydrogen atoms toward the ground the beams 
will cause the air along their paths to glow so they can be tracked 
through the night sky however the beams wont reach the ground 
below 75 miles they collide with thicker air become electrically 
charged and are deflected by the magnetic fields 
forty scientists engineers and technicians have been working on 
the experiment called beam experiment aboard a rocket or bear the 
team proved accelerators could be made small enough to be boosted by 
a rocket at least for a lowenergy experiment the payload 
including the accelerator datagathering devices and means of 
controlling the rockets altitude is 44 inches in diameter less 
than 24 feet long and weighs 1 tons 
critics have said the technology is still immature that a 
spacebased accelerator would be vulnerable to antisatellite 
weapons and that each one might require a billion watts of 
electrical power

a new technique that bounces laser 
light off brain cells to monitor the amount of oxygen reaching a 
fetus could help prevent brain damage and reduce the number of 
caesarean sections a researcher says 
the technique has shown good results in tests on 12 patients at 
the university of bonn gynecological hospital said dr stephan 
schmidt who heads the research team its main advantage is that 
its a gentle monitoring method which can give continuous readings 
without touching the fetus 
we still have a long way to go before we make definite 
conclusions but the preliminary results are very promising 
the relatively cheap technique schmidts model costs about 
43000 beams extremely low levels of harmless infrared light into 
the fetal brain the light reflected back provides information about 
the supply of oxygen in brain cells the information is displayed 
graphically on a desktop computer 
it is extremely important to us to be able to gauge the level 
of oxygen in the tissue cells as often as possible schmidt said 
earlier techniques required blood samples from the fetus which 
has the disadvantage of being a singlepoint test and has to be 
repeated at short intervals 
a continuous record is far more preferable and less 
cumbersome 
in 20 out of 100 cases he said heart monitors indicate the 
possibility of oxygen deficiency but only five of those 20 have 
symptoms that would actually require caesarean delivery he said 
with our technique we hope to be able to determine which of those 
infants do not really require a caesarean section 
oxygen deficiency is the most common cause of death before 
during and just after birth and is the main contributor to fetal 
brain damage he said

eastern is seeking 150 million in wage and benefit concessions 
to help stem mounting financial losses easterns last offer called 
for a top hourly wage of 16 for mechanics and 1154 for ramp 
service workers mechanics would get an extra 50 cents an hour in 
september 1993 under the proposed 4year contract eastern 
mechanics now earn a top wage of 1883 an hour and ramp service 
workers 1560 an hour 
the machinists want 50 million in raises an 8 percent hike but 
last week offered to delay increases for 15 months

the machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal talks 
began in october 1987 eastern pilots and flight attendants a year 
earlier reached concessionary agreements that slashed pay by 20 
percent 
the national mediation board intervened in the dispute in january 
1988 but no progress was made during a year that included massive 
layoffs and costcutting the dispute reached loggerheads last month 
after eastern rejected binding arbitration and the mediation board 
declared a 30day coolingoff period before a strike 
more than 97 percent of the machinists on feb 15 authorized a 
strike president bush refused to intervene to delay the strike 
easterns last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13 
percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions the 
machinists rejected it friday and the strike began at 1201 am

media firms basked in limelight borrowed from the 
18 billion merger planned by time inc and warner communications 
inc as investors apparently expecting further consolidations in 
the industry bid up stock in media companies 
the biggest winner in mondays trading was cbs inc whose shares 
soared 6 to close at 17212 on the new york stock exchange gulf 
and western corp owner of paramount pictures corp rose 250 to 
close at 4587 while walt disney co rose 112 to 7762 a 
share 
securities analysts said they expected more consolidations in the 
media business although not as big as the deal announced saturday 
to create time warner inc the largest media concern in the world 
its a unique opportunity and i cant see that youre able to 
replicate it said john reidy an analyst with drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
time and warner said the new company would have projected annual 
revenues of 10 billion surpassing the current world 
communications leader west germanys bertelsmann ag which reported 
6 billion in 1987 revenue 
that is exactly what time chairman j richard munro had in mind 
as he and warner chairman steven ross discussed a merger over the 
past two years 
we believe that by the mid1990s the media and entertainment 
industry will be composed of a limited number of global giants 
munro told securities analysts last november time intends to be 
one of these companies 
who are the others mainly foreign publishing and broadcasting 
giants such rupert murdochs news corp and maxwell communication 
corp and electronics behemoth sony corp that have scooped up 
us media concerns in a torrent of deals made possible over the 
past several years by their own riches and the weak us dollar 
in his speech to analysts munro said the spurt of acquisitions 
mergers and join ventures among media companies in recent years has 
given these businesses the sheer size required to compete 
efficiently on a global basis 
for example ross said in an interview his companys deal with 
time would give warner better access to foreign markets for its 
video business he predicted the greatest impact of the deal would 
come in time and warner overseas operations 
analysts said they expected foreigners to continue buying us 
companies 
reidy of drexel burnham lambert noted that sony which bought 
cbs records last year has expressed interest in owning a motion 
picture company including columbia pictures 
bertelsmann is not as well known in this country as some other 
big media names such as murdoch or robert maxwell but it owns the 
publisher doubleday amp co and rca records reidy suggested 
bertelsmann might also move into the film business 
news corp owns newspaper magazine and book publishing 
operations in australia britain and the united states his american 
holdings include triangle publications inc the publisher of tv 
guide harper amp row publishers inc 20th century fox film corp 
and fox broadcasting network 
murdoch has no plans to slow down although news corp which had 
43 billion in 1988 revenue has become burdened by debt because of 
its many acquisitions murdoch also plans to raise 1 billion or 
more for buying other communications companies around the world 
londonbased maxwell communication corp had 26 billion in 
revenue in 1987 robert maxwell motivated partly by a rivalry with 
murdoch wants to see that figure swell to 5 billion to 9 
billion and he has said he intends to keep acquiring businesses 
until he reaches that goal 
last year he won a long battle for macmillan inc and also agreed 
to buy dun amp bradstreet corps official airline guides 
american companies expect to join the consolidation 
francine blum an analyst with wertheim schroder amp co said gulf 
amp western and walt disney are candidates for consolidations among 
us firms 
she also said she expected to see alliances between movie studios

after years of decline the philippine 
economy shows signs of revival and business leaders hope that the 
modest boom heralds desperately needed stability for president 
corazon aquinos government 
serious problems still face the aquino administration including 
a burgeoning population environmental destruction and the fact that 
millions of filipinos have not yet benefited economically from the 
turnaround 
the philippines which had been east asias secondmostdeveloped 
nation after japan now lags far behind other noncommunist 
southeast asian economies after 20 years of misrule under ousted 
president ferdinand marcos 
government figures show that more than 60 percent of the 58 
million filipinos live below the poverty line millions still leave 
each year in search of employment abroad 
nonetheless the economy has grown during each year since mrs 
aquino took power in the february 1986 uprising against marcos her 
rise to power followed two straight years of negative growth and 
soaring inflation 
throughout the capital construction projects have resumed and 
department stores are jammed with shoppers on weekends and holidays 
mrs aquino abolished the ruinous state monopolies on sugar and 
coconut export which marcos and his associates used to corner those 
markets and moved slowly to remove government from private business 
last year the gross national product grew by 67 percent while 
inflation remained under 9 percent according to government figures 
unemployment fell from 112 percent in 1987 to 96 percent due 
mostly to a boom in construction that absorbed outofwork farmers 
agriculture which provides the livelihood of about 65 percent of 
filipinos grew 34 percent despite several destructive typhoons 
economists say most of the economic growth is due to consumer 
spending up 51 percent in 1988 thanks in large measure to a 
relaxation of import restrictions and a drop in world petroleum 
prices 
but the favorable figures have led to renewed optimism within the 
foreign and filipino business community that the country may at last 
be on the road to recovery 
in sharp contrast to the waitandsee attitude so prevalent 
just two years ago businessmen entrepreneurs and consumers took 
positive and decisive steps to keep the philippine economic recovery 
on the right track said the influential makati business club in a 
report 
in 1988 the board of investments approved 147 billion worth of 
investment projects up 216 percent over the previous year about 22 
percent of the total came from foreign investors 
last friday toyota and mitsui inaugurated a new auto 
manufacturing plant in suburban paranaque that will be halfowned by 
filipinos 
trade secretary jose concepcion said total exports last year 
reached 707 billion south korea and hong kong broke through that 
barrier 12 years ago but nevertheless the figure represented a 24 
percent increase in philippine exports over the previous year 
the boom has not been limited to manila which traditionally 
outpaces the rest of the island nation last year the economy in 
cebu city and surrounding islands grew by 75 percent 
in davao city exports of wood and processed foods topped 450 
million last year construction in the southern city tripled from 
1987 levels and banks reported a 35 percent increase in business 
loans 
western diplomats and filipino commentators believe political 
stability has been the key to the economic rebound after a series 
of failed coups in 1986 and 1987 including the abortive putsch on 
aug 28 1987 that killed 53 people there were no serious armed 
attempts against mrs aquino last year 
rumors of new rightwing conspiracies periodically sweep manila 
but there has been a growing sense here that mrs aquino will finish 
her term in 1992 
a dramatic upsurge in street killings by communist rebels in the 
capital tapered off last year because of a police crackdown and a 
public backlash to the carnage 
in addition the wave of strikes which swept manila cebu and 
other industrial areas in the months after marcos downfall declined 
sharply in october 1987 mrs aquino ordered a crackdown on illegal 
strikes barricades that blocked pedestrian and vehicle traffic were 
torn down and strike leaders were frequently arrested 
according to the labor department those measures reduced the 
number of strikes from 484 in 1987 to 296 last year government 
figures show production time lost because of strikes fell by 20 
percent in 1988 over the previous year

the controversy over beaming a 
commercially sponsored television news show for teenagers into 
classrooms doesnt seem to bother the students and teachers who 
watched channel ones debut at central high school 
the students said they liked the idea of seeing the news 
something a few of them conceded they dont watch enough of at home 
and enjoyed the features such as a look at the life of soviet teens 
teacher mary simpsons only complaint was that the show was a 
litte fast although the pace didnt seem to bother her students 
she said those complaining about the commercials are mistaken 
we cant get something for nothing she said 
the first show in a test run of the project included paid pitches 
for levis 501 jeans snickers candy bars and head amp shoulders 
shampoo the program premiered in five high schools monday 
whittle communications lp the knoxvillebased media concern that 
produced the program plans to sell up to two miutes of commercial 
time on each 12minute show to pay for the hardware it is giving 
schools to show it 
ad time already has been sold on the remaining 24 shows in the 
test for products such as breath mints acne medications snack 
chips and cosmetics 
procter amp gamble co has bought time in four product categories 
to see if the program is a viable vehicle for reaching 
teenagers while helping helping schools provide a topical 
educational program said sydney mchugh a company spokeswoman 
the presence of paid advertising on the show has enraged some 
education groups who say big business should be barred from making 
sales pitches to students in the classroom 
but central high students said the ads did not bother them 
its fine with me said shelley bible a 14yearold 
freshman you get more pressure from other students than you do 
from the commercials 
toi mccane a 17yearold senior said the commercials are just 
the same thing you get on the news at night 
the show also debuted monday at mumford high school in detroit 
gahr high school in cerritos calif eisenhower middle school in 
kansas city kan and billerica memorial high school near boston 
the sixth test site withrow high school in cincinnati was 
closed by bad weather monday but was expected to join the test 
today 
whittle communications has years of experience in producing 
adfilled magazines and posters aimed at the student market but 
this is the companys first venture into television 
groups such as the national parentteacher association and the 
national association of secondary school principals have opposed it 
they are trying to make it a part of every school day and this 
medium has a much stronger impact than any other said tari 
marshal a spokeswoman for the national pta 
but whittle chairman christopher whittle said that schools could 
simply not afford the equipment and the level of programming that he 
is providing 
the six test schools each were given about 50000 in television 
monitors video recording equipment and a satellite dish to receive 
the daily news show they will keep the gear no matter how the test 
goes 
if the test proves successful whittle hopes to expand it 
nationally to as many as 8000 schools in the fall of 1990 
in exchange for the equipment which may be used for other 
purposes the schools agree to run the news show each school day 
the first show started off with some flashy graphics and then 
two youthful anchors read news headlines 
the news coverage included segments on sen john towers troubled 
nomination as defense secretary the eastern airlines strike and 
threats against author salman rushdie as well as a piece on the 
controversy over the new show an antidrug ad was run as a public 
service 
in connie wilkess senior home room class at central high all 20 
students appeared to watch the show closely figeting only for a 
commercial 
at the eisenhower middle school more than 700 students watched 
the inaugural program principal stan jasinskas said 
so far most of the reaction seems to be positive he said 
jasinskas said the program may help improve students knowledge 
of world events 
as far as the commercials he said he thought the school would be 
able to help the students be more analytical in their approach to 
them 
whittle gave the first show high marks for ontent but said some 
work remains to be done on the pacing of the broadcast he also said 
his anchors ought to loosen up a bit

exchange today after a plunge in early trading while the dollar 
rose sharply against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which shed 963 points 
monday rose 6108 points or 019 percent today to close at 
3193794 after a drop in early trading the nikkei started upward 
at midmorning 
the indexs early decline followed news that hisashi shinto 
former chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone japans largest 
company and his former secretary were arrested monday on bribery 
charges in connection with a major stock scandal involving top 
politicians dealers said 
but the nikkei started to recover from its setback following 
finance minister tatsuo murayamas comment that the yens weak 
performance had nothing to do with the stock scandal said kenji 
ishizuka a trader at daiwa securities 
murayama told reporters today that the yens decline did not 
have anything to do with shintos arrest its a market after 
all and who knows why it moves 
ishizuka said investors interest in steel and construction 
issues contributed to the indexs rise volume traded on the first 
section was estimated at 1 billion shares 
in currency dealings the dollar finished at 12903 yen up 140 
yen from mondays 12763yen close the currency started opened at 
12925 yen and ranged between 12887 yen and 12928 yen 
after gaining 212 yen over four days last week the dollar had 
declined by 049 yen on monday 
dealers attributed the dollars higher opening in tokyo today to 
its gains on overseas markets overnight but the rate did not move 
much once trading started in tokyo said minori takeuchi of chemical 
bank in tokyo 
hardly anybody was participating in the afternoon session after 
failing to lead the market anywhere because buying and selling were 
equally mixed she said 
only speculative investors were trading adjusting their dollar

the bush administration is considering ways to 
ease concerns in congress that its savings and loan plan would 
permit regulators to dump billions of dollars of repossessed real 
estate onto fragile texas markets according to an industry official 
kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers association of america said monday that an element of the 
administration is examining proposals to combine federal and state 
money to pay for a real estate maintenance program 
as part of the program some of the real estate could be used for 
day care centers food programs or in some other way that meets 
president bushs kinder gentler social objectives he said 
thought is being given to it very very high level thought 
guenther said 
in other sampl developments monday 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee introduced the administrations sampl proposal in the 
house it was referred to gonzalez committee defusing a 
jurisdictional dispute between the banking panel and the house ways 
and means committee that could have delayed congressional action 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of ways and means had 
sought joint jurisdiction arguing that a key element of the sampl 
plan provided for selling 50 billion in government bonds and that 
his panels turf covered revenue raising 
six washingtonbased think tanks ranging from the conservative 
heritage foundation to the liberal brookings institution issued a 
statement saying the bush proposal doesnt provide enough money or 
reform 
gonzalez and other legislators from texas are worried that if 
regulators try to sell off repossessed real estate too fast it 
could collapse the already weak real estate market in the state 
the federal deposit insurance corp the commercial bank 
regulator which under bushs restructuring plan also would take the 
lead in resolving sampl problems has historically sold repossessed 
property faster than sampl regulators 
guenther described the possible addition of a property management 
program to the administration plan as a contingency rather than a 
bush initiative 
if the congress moves in this direction they have to be 
prepared he said 
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the administration wants to preserve regulators discretion to 
judge the best time to sell 
i dont think anyone anticipates that real estate would be 
dumped the official said but we would prefer the flexibility 
to sell as market conditions dictate and permit thats the best way 
to protect the taxpayers interest as well as that of local 
markets 
two texas republicans sen phil gramm and rep steve bartlett 
both members of the banking committees said in telephone 
interviews they agreed it would be unwise to dictate when or how 
regulators can sell property both expressed confidence that fdic 
chairman l william seidman would not sell at belowmarket prices 
in a speech last week seidman said if we cant obtain todays 
fair price well hold on but he warned that withholding sale of 
property for too long would create an overhang on the real 
estate market and hurt local economies 
the six groups offering a critique of the bush plan were the 
national taxpayers union foundation the cato institute american 
enterprise institute the competitive enterprise institute the 
heritage foundation and the brookings institution 
they said bushs plan to raise 50 billion for sampls over three 
years does not provide money fast enough they said the government 
should spend 50 billion by the end of the 1989 fiscal year on sept 
30 and then decide how much more it needs 
the groups urged congress to fight industry attempts to weaken 
the stricter capital standards of the bush plan and advised it to 
add the following reforms marketbased accounting riskbased 
deposit insurance premiums and limits on deposit insurance it said 
congress should not attempt to turn back the clock by restricting 
sampls mostly to home mortgage lending

aviation security has improved but federal 
agents still managed to slip 156 weapons through airport security 
resulting in 118 million in fines against domestic airlines the 
federal aviation administration announced 
the agency said the detection rate for all airlines checked was 
931 percent compared to 882 percent in july 1988 and 789 percent 
in the first such tests of the system in 1987 
in a separate transportation department report monday airlines 
showed improvements in the number of flight delays baggage problems 
and passengers with reservations who were bumped off flights 
fines against airlines in the weapons tests resulted when airport 
security failed to detect fake guns knives explosives or other 
weapons in handcarried luggage or in the clothing of federal agents 
the largest fines were 186000 against american airlines for 24 
alleged violations 151000 against continental airlines for 20 
136000 against eastern for 18 and 132000 against usair for 15 
other fines ranged from 1000 for single violations to 92000 
faa fines for security lapses have totalled nearly 4 million 
since the program began two years ago the faa said about 50 
airlines have been cited for 557 detection failures 
the agency said it ran more than 6800 checks of airline security 
systems during 1988 it said the latest fines resulted from 
incidents over the past year 
under faa rules airlines are responsible for screening 
passengers and their carryon luggage at airports where security is 
contracted by several airlines each carrier is held responsible for 
any failure 
in a monthly report by the transportation department the 13 
largest us carriers reported that 767 percent of their flights 
operated on time in january compared with 761 percent in december 
1988 and 692 percent in january 1988 delays caused by mechanical 
problems are not counted in the monthly air consumer survey 
mishandled baggage reports filed against the airlines in january 
declined from an average of 858 per 1000 passengers in december to 
786 in january 
the airlines also reported that in 1988 the number of passengers 
denied seats for which they had reservations was 297 per 100000 
in 1987 airlines reported 399 passengers per 100000 were 
bumped 
consumer complaints were up slightly in february however to 
1138 compared to 1086 in january the department said adding 
that this is a 51 percent decline from february 1988 when complaints 
reached 2308

although organized labor says it did not pick 
the fight the nations unions are looking to how the government 
handles the eastern airlines strike as the gettysburg for workers 
rights in the 1990s 
not since former president reagan fired 11000 federal air 
traffic controllers in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes in 
a strike been greater 
reagans action emboldened employers in the recession years of 
1981 and 1982 to demand wage concessions from workers and get them 
automatic inflationindexed costofliving adjustments that were a 
fixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from many 
settlements in the 80s 
steel auto and rubber workers counting on 15 to 21 hourly 
wages took wage cuts as did meatpackers and airline workers paid 
half as much 
those who balked copper miners in arizona meatpackers in 
minnesota or pilots and machinists at continental airlines after 
frank lorenzo acquired it found themselves on the street replaced 
by nonunion workers often willing to work for half as much 
the return of national economic prosperity after the recession 
did not reverse the trend 
but through it all two groups of union workers were able to 
preserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative to 
inflation teachers and other state county and municipal employees 
and railroad workers 
the first group did it through a recognition that us 
educational standards were falling by using public sector 
collective bargaining laws enacted under president john f kennedy 
and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services 
rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 national railway 
labor act a law governing labor relations in both railroads and 
airlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power through 
government intervention and maintain transportation vital to 
interstate commerce 
now however the labor movement is looking to the railway labor 
law it once vigorously opposed to lead it out of a decade in which 
it lost more than a fourth of its members recent uses of the law 
have raised those union hopes 
the president and congress have broad powers under the railway 
labor law to impose contract settlements on management and unions 
through presidential emergency boards they lack those powers in 
other sectors of the economy 
reagan used the mechanism several times blocking threatened 
railroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids for 
concessions 
and although the 1947 tafthartley act forbids striking union 
members at one company from picketing another company the supreme 
court in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts at 
railroads and airlines 
unions are counting on that combination to defeat eastern 
airlines and lorenzo its principal owner whom aflcio president 
lane kirkland on monday called the typhoid mary of union busters 
in the transportation industry 
it was lorenzo who acquired continental airlines in 1981 and then 
declared bankruptcy two years later a move that allowed him to 
cancel all of the companys union contracts eventually all of the 
union workers were replaced 
the supreme court later upheld lorenzos right to abrogate 
continentals labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes 
creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could be 
followed by any company 
the aflcio spearheaded legislation passed by congress in 1985 
changing the law but ever since then lorenzo has been at the top of 
the labor organizations enemies list 
bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debtfinanced 
leveraged buyouts exemplified by lorenzos acquisition of eastern in 
1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labors legislative 
agenda 
kirkland acknowledged the broad implications if eastern 
succeeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by 4000 a 
year and its ramp workers by 8000 annually as demanded in the 
companys last offer before the strike saturday 
there are no doubt those who are cheering him on in management 
and certain circles in corporate america who want to see his tactics 
succeed he said monday this company is not in trouble because 
of the wages it pays labor costs at eastern are lower than other 
airlines operating profitably and efficiently 
this company is in trouble because its in hock to the banks 
some 25 billion kirkland said the interest cost on that debt 
in excess of 800000 a day is virtually equal to the amount 
this company is losing 
this is not an atypical situation in american industry with the 
vast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads that 
have been saddled on otherwise good companies

for a fish getting to spend time in one 
of keith jones aquariums must be about as good as can be 
there in complete safety a fish gets firstclass accommodations 
for several weeks his only chore being to perform taste tests for a 
fellow who appreciates fish 
its like taking them to baskinrobbins said jones we ask 
them to tell us which samples they dont like which ones they like 
and which ones they really like theres no stress we keep them 
well fed and the water clean they dont live a bad life 
theres a sinister motive though from a fishs point of view 
jones is a fish biologist for berkley inc of spirit lake which 
makes fishing lures his job is to isolate the chemicals that fish 
identify as food and then make them into lures 
im somewhat of a unique species he said i dont know of 
a single other fishing lure company that has a fish biologist on 
staff 
he also has discovered that fish do not necessarily like a 
repugnant bait 
theres a mistaken impression that the stinkier the bait the 
better thats a gross error thats not how it works the chemicals 
that catfish rely on as a signal for food has nothing to do with how 
stinky it is he said 
some stinky baits like old cheese do contain elements that are 
quite appetizing for catfish but it doesnt contain very much of 
them and the part that does is probably not the stinky part 
the fish tests are simple 
you take little cotton pellets the same as you would find in a 
dentists office by themselves theyre neutral fish neither like 
them nor dislike them 
if you put one in water a rainbow trout might attack it once 
inside the mouth the next thing that happens depends on what the 
fish perceives it to be if hes neutral towards it or doesnt like 
it he spits it out in a split second if he likes it he might mull 
it over chew it up and then spit it out the ones they really like 
theyll go ahead and swallow 
the cotton doesnt hurt the fish its just like a high fiber 
diet 
he said he has isolated some tasty chemicals for several species 
the substances are marketed either in a liquid that is dropped on 
the lure or as a puttylike glob that becomes the lure itself 
there is still years of work however to identify all of the 
chemicals that fish interpret to be food but theoretically the 
perfect lure would put the beginning fisherman on the same plateau 
with the pro 
we havent quite reached that level yet jones said we 
have a standard joke around here if you want to improve the fishs 
odds try fishing with one arm tied behind your back or use a 
barbless hook

the supreme courts refusal to intervene in an 
acid rain dispute between the northeast and the industrial midwest 
leaves the problem of interstate air pollution up to president bush 
and congress 
for nearly a decade a group of northeastern states has waged a 
legal campaign to try to get the environmental protection agency to 
crack down on industrial polluters as far away as illinois claiming 
pollution from those states is ruining their lakes and forests 
on monday the supreme court decided against considering the 
case it let stand a federal appeals court decision agreeing with 
the epa that the states had not shown that their pollution problems 
stemmed from emissions hundreds of miles away 
but some environmentalists and epa officials suggested monday 
that the legal fight may no longer have the importance it once had 
anyway congress is expected this year to enact new federal 
legislation specifically addressing acid rain pollution 
environmentalists hope the legislation will curb emissions of sulfur 
dioxides and nitrogen oxide from coalburning power plants and 
factories 
these pollutants often travel hundreds of miles and fall to the 
ground as highly acidic rain destroying freshwater life and forest 
vegetation in areas where the air otherwise is considered largely 
free of pollution the new england states have been among those 
complaining about acid rain caused by the industrial midwest 
in the early 1980s petitions to the epa by maine new york and 
pennsylvania claimed that soot smoke and sulfur dioxide were 
blowing from the industrial midwest and making it impossible for 
them to meet federally required air pollution requirements 
they cited pollutants from coalburning utility plants and 
factories in illinois indiana kentucky michigan ohio tennessee 
and west virginia 
but the epa argued that the complaining states were responsible 
for maintaining their own air quality and that they had not produced 
sufficient evidence that the pollution stemmed from smokestakes in 
the states cited the epa also argued that federal law is not 
specifically designed to cover such longrange pollution 
last july a federal appeals court agreed and deferring to the 
agencys expertise said the epas position was reasonable 
although new york did not pursue the matter to the supreme court 
maine and pennsylvania were joined in the petition before the high 
court by vermont new hampshire new jersey and connecticut 
the case has never specifically cited acid rain because there is 
no federal acid rain legislation instead it has focused on the 
amount of certain pollutants that were found in the air 
according to a national acid rain assessment program the 
industrial belt stretching from west virginia to illinois accounts 
for high emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxide 
federal clean air legislation enacted in 1970 directed that 
industrial and utility smokestakes be heightened a requirement 
which improved air quality near such plants but sent the emissions 
higher into the air where they traveled farther 
scientists believe that about twothirds of the sulfur dioxide 
emissions in the united states come from coalburning electric power 
plants and another 11 percent from industrial fuel combustion 
nearly half of all nitrogen oxides are believe to come from electric 
power plant and industrial fuel combustion while nearly 38 percent 
comes from transportation

no doubt that last years yieldshriveling 
drought in north america had much to do with the sharp decline in 
world grain supplies but an agriculture department economist says 
that us domestic farm policy also played an important role 
frederic surls of the departments economic research service said 
last summers drought abruptly changed the world grain situation 
after a decade of surplus and low prices to a period of tight 
supplies and rising prices 
part of the drop in world stocks over the last two years was 
intentional he said production consistently exceeded 
consumption through most of the 1980s two years ago world and us 
stocks reached a record both in total and in relation to use a 
major concern at that time was to balance supply and use by 
stimulating consumption and discouraging production 
as part of the answer the united states took large amounts of 
cropland from production wheat farmers for example had to idle 
275 percent of their base acreage for both the 1987 and 1988 crops 
in order to qualify for government supports 
larger reductions also applied to corn and other coarse 
grains the conservation reserve program aimed at idling up to 45 
million acres of fragile cropland by the end of 1990 also took huge 
bites 
mainly as a result of these government actions and lower prices 
there was a 14 percent drop in the acreage planted to wheat and 
coarse grains between 1986 and 1988 surls said in the march issue 
of agricultural outlook magazine 
at the same time low world prices discouraged production in 
other exporting countries particularly argentina australia and 
canada he said so competitor production also leveled off and 
foreign stocks which were near a record at the end of 198687 
began to drop during 198788 
surls said that at this point there was an additional and 
dramatic role by the weather 
in 1987 a poor monsoon in asia sharply lowered world rice 
stocks he said record drought in north america in 1988 was 
responsible for a sharp drawdown of wheat and coarse grain stocks 
but surls added there were no serious crop setbacks in most of 
the rest of the world foreign grain consumption increased despite 
tighter exporter supplies 
world grain stocks at the end of the 198889 season are expected 
to be down 30 percent from a year ago to 279 million metric tons 
the lowest in more than a decade most of the decline is in the 
united states which held an average of 34 percent of the worlds 
total between 1977 and 1987 
just two years ago the united states grain inventory was a 
record 204 million tons or 45 percent of the worlds total by the 
end of this year the us will hold only 74 million tons or 27 
percent of the total foreign stocks are down too but their 
decline has been much smaller 
surls said the current situation in some ways is similar to 
197273 but that was when the soviet union came into the us 
market in a big way and the drop in stockpiles was due to exports 
not production shortfalls 
the dramatic growth of consumption and depletion of world 
stocks in the early 1970s created widespread pessimism about the 
worlds ability to feed itself he said projections of 
longterm chronic shortages and higher prices became common 
but grain production surged back inventories grew again and 
real prices resumed their longterm decline surls said 
attention then returned to the excess capacity of us and world 
agriculture 
surls said it is too early to say a great deal about world crop 
prospects for 198990 but he offered some points to consider 
the best estimate of world grain yields in 198990 is for them 
to be near the historical trend or close to it although based on 
weather to date north american winter wheat yield potential may be 
reduced 
substantial excess production capacity will be brought back into 
use this year in the united states acreage reduction requirements 
for both wheat and coarse grains have been lowered to 10 percent 
and plantings will be up overseas acreage probably will rise in 
response to higher world market prices 
production is likely to rise substantially while the increase 
may stop the drawing down of world grain inventories the actual 
rebuilding of stockpiles probably will be small because consumption 
will be close to production 
the rebuilding of world grain stocks probably will stretch over 
several years even with yields back on track the worlds grain 
supplydemand situation will keep prices up relative to those of the 
mid1980s 
if the world experiences short crops this year particularly for 
wheat there will be only limited reserves a significant shortfall 
would mean sharply higher prices and reduced world consumption 
finally the longerrun concerns of some observers about 
slowing growth in food production are not likely to be important for 
198990 he said as recently as two years ago the world 
situation was one of excess capacity the underlying longrun 
tendency is still for production to exceed consumption unless real 
prices fall

farmers will have another opportunity this 
summer to put highly erodible land in the governments conservation 
reserve program says agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
yeutter said monday the ninth crp signup period will be july 17 
through aug 4 and that farmers who want to offer land under the 
program should contact local offices of the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
under the program farmers agree to take land from production for 
10 years in return based on bids they submit farmers who are 
accepted receive annual rental payments from the government and 
onetime assistance to pay half the cost of planting trees shrubs 
and grass to guard against erosion 
the eighth round of applications was completed on feb 24 but 
yeutter said the final results will not be ready until june 
meanwhile he said the maximum acceptable rental rates for land 
offered by farmers will be the same as in the seventh signup 
those are the maximum payments under the crp for land put into 
the program the rates vary by state and often within single states 
themselves from a maximum of 30 per acre annually for 
lessproductive land to as much as 115 per acre each year for 
better land 
a total of 282 million acres was accepted into crp through the 
first seven signups with the annual payment averaging around 49 
per acre 
the goal of the crp as set by congress in the 1985 farm law is to 
have 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland 
taken from production by the end of 1990

one former aerospace worker says she got lost 
driving on a road she used every day another cant always remember 
her childrens ages and a third likens her mood swings to a 
roller coaster up and down 
the aerospace employees all told a senate panel monday they 
suffered chronic physical and mental illness from exposure to 
hazardous chemicals 
an official for boeing co which employed two of the workers 
said the company was concerned for the safety of employees exposed 
to hazardous chemicals but the chairman of the senate environment 
subcommittee on toxic substances harry reid rebuked the aerospace 
company 
the nevada democrat said he felt boeing was minimizing the 
effects that hazardous materials can have on workers by pleading 
ignorance to the danger and emphasizing disagreements in the medical 
community 
boeings vice president for human resources joseph peritore 
told the subcommittee there was no evidence to link an acidic resin 
formerly used by the company with workers health problems 
peritore said the company nonetheless out of concern for 
workers health discontinued use of the material even though it was 
determined that the material presented no significant health 
hazard 
peritore said boeing not only met but significantly exceeded 
regulatory standards and testified that the medical community was 
divided 
the fact that we believed the material was safe became 
irrelevant said peritore in the highly charged atmosphere that 
existed we felt the only way to alleviate our employees concerns 
was to remove the material from the shop altogether and we did 
one witness deborah forbessutherland 39 of westlake village 
calif said she began working 16 years ago for js switzer a 
company that distributes aerospace chemicals 
telling the panel she almost died a year ago ms 
forbessutherland said that when asked by customers if the chemicals 
were safe she unwittingly told them yes if you dont eat them 
on your breakfast cereal i lied to those people 
former boeing employee bonnie faye schrum of renton wash said 
chemical exposure caused her coworkers to pass out vomit act as 
if they were drunk at work and feel like their head was going to 
explode 
we were discouraged from reporting this to the company 
medical department she testified and said workers were threatened 
with dismissal after complaining you either worked with these 
chemicals or you did not have a job she said 
im not the same person i was five years ago she testified 
i cant pump gas i cant go to the grocery store without getting 
sick i cant sleep at night i cant eat i have no energy i dont 
know my kids i dont know their ages 
beverly mccormick of north bend wash said she became 
disoriented from exposure to chemicals at boeing and once got lost 
while driving down a highway i drove every day 
lori liberty of encino calif who appeared at the hearing 
wearing gloves said she was poisoned by chemicals while working 
at lockheed in burbank calif and has been unable to work for two 
years 
ms liberty 33 said she has suffered from severe headaches 
impaired speech bleeding fingers nails that fall off and moods 
that were like a roller coaster up and down 
afraid to have children because shes worried about birth 
defects ms liberty told senators she takes 14 to 20 tablets daily 
for her various ailments including medicine for depression and 
sees specialists ranging from psychiatrists to a toxicologist 
i dont think i can ever go back to the job i enjoyed she 
said blaming the company for improper ventilation failure to warn 
workers of dangers a lack of protective devices and using her as a 
guinea pig to try out new chemicals while tubes were attached to 
her to measure exposure 
she contended the company threatened to fire her when she 
complained 
dale h daniels executive vice president for lockheed 
aeronautical systems co said the company recognizes that raw 
materials and processes in the workplace pose potential health 
threats 
however he added when employees are properly trained and 
utilize the proper protective equipment together with adequate 
engineering controls the employees can work safely

rockwell international corp has been fined 
55 million for doublebilling the pentagon and the punishment 
will serve as a warning to other defense contractors us attorney 
robert c bonner says 
were quite pleased and we hope that a fine of that magnitude 
will send out a message to the defense industry that the federal 
courts are taking defense procurement fraud very seriously bonner 
said 
us district judge consuelo b marshall on monday fined the 
aerospace giant for overbilling the pentagon for a navigation 
satellite system the judge also ordered rockwell to pay restitution 
of 446248 and placed the company on probation for five years 
rockwell had pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt of court 
but maintained that two highlevel employees not the company were 
responsible for the overcharges and a subsequent coverup the 
company said it would appeal the fine 
the el segundobased company was fined for conspiring with some 
of its managers to overbill the air force by nearly 500000 on the 
12 billion navstar navigation satellite system between 1982 and 
1984 
rockwell issued a statement reiterating its contention that the 
overbilling was the responsibility of renegade employees acting in 
what they perceived to be the companys benefit 
rockwell was sentenced today because of our responsibility 
under the law for the acts of our employees it said we accept 
that responsibility but we continue to believe that the company 
itself should not have been indicted 
a rockwell manager robert zavodnik 47 has pleaded guilty to 
lying to the government and conspiracy in the case he was sentenced 
last month to a year of probation his supervisor donald carter 
60 was acquitted of the charges by a federal jury 
the largest fine imposed on a defense contractor was 115 million 
in 1988 against sundstrand corp 
the rockford ill manufacturer of electronic mechanical and 
hydraulic systems for aircraft was fined for its guilty plea to 
four counts of defrauding the defense department by overbilling on 
aircraft parts the company admitted it had billed the department 
for things like babysitting country clubs and servants for its 
executives

biologist mark masteller leaned into 
a razorsharp wind and struggled through crusted snow in search of 
yellow patches that one day may allow scientists to predict 
nutritional problems in wildlife 
caribou scramble to escape the helicopter ferrying masteller and 
wildlife technician john burch onto the frozen tundra in this remote 
section of denali national park 
casting this way and that masteller and burch checked 
urinestained snow that may have been left by the fleeing animals 
thats too old i think said masteller that too heres 
a good one he dropped to his knees pulled out a stainless steel 
spoon and began stuffing freshly soiled snow into a plastic bag 
the two are gathering material for a predatorprey study 
conducted by l david mech a wolf researcher and layne adams a 
national park service biologist 
the work is aimed at finding some way for researchers to 
determine the condition of wildlife by measuring the ratio of 
chemicals normally found in urine urea nitrogen and creatinine 
increased urea nitrogen would indicate the animal was 
metabolizing more protein either from food or from its own muscle 
mass for large hoofed animals in winter metabolic rates decrease 
and food intake is reduced everincreasing amounts of urea nitrogen 
in the urine indicate the animal may be in trouble 
using hand signals to direct the helicopter pilot burch listens 
to electronic beeps picked up by antenna to zero in on randomly 
selected radiocollared caribou mostly the biologists seek out 
cows bulls are too depleted by the rut before winter to give valid 
samples later 
once they deplete their fat reserves then they start 
metabolizing protein at a more extensive rate said glenn 
delgiudice a wildlife biologist specializing in nutrition and 
physiology 
because they start burning up their body protein you start 
seeing high levels of urea nitrogen in the urine almost like they 
become meateaters almost like wolves 
delgiudice and biochemist ulysses s seal both of the veterans 
administration medical center research center in minneapolis are 
running the study of frozen urine from denali national park home of 
mount mckinley 
were in the early phases of the research we would like to get 
it more quantifiable delgiudice said one of the things that 
this will allow increasingly in the future is some forecasting 
ability for wildlife managers weve got a ways to go but its 
looking very very promising 
i think its going to enable us to detect subtle changes before 
gross deterioration occurs he said 
for alaska and other states with freeroaming herds of wildlife 
the research could have farreaching effects and there is no 
reason it wont apply to every large herbivore adams said 
practically applied it would allow for comparisons between 
herds and track trends of animals condition over time he said 
if you can determine changes in winter physical condition 
conceivably you could track that and it would allow you to adjust 
management strategies

vice president dan quayle has come up with 
enough government money to keep the landsat earthwatching 
satellites operating at least until a review of the program can be 
completed his spokesman says 
the earthsensing satellites were due to be turned off march 31 
when the national oceanic and atmospheric administration would run 
out of money to keep them going 
noaa needed 94 million to operate the satellites until the 
fiscal year ends on sept 30 
but emergency funding will come from departments that use landsat 
images state defense agriculture and commerce as well as the 
office of management and budget said quayle spokesman david 
beckwith landsats scan the earth with seven kinds of instruments 
giving detailed images of the land and vegetation 
beckwith said a review is being made of the satellite system 
the plug wont be pulled before the review is completed 
beckwith said the review will be completed prior to 
congressional oversight of the fy 1990 nasa budget 
a house science space and technology subcommittee was conducting 
a hearing this afternoon on the landsat 
quayle is the new chairman of the national space council which 
studies the national space programs 
beckwith said he did not know how much money would be necessary 
to keep the system operating until the end of the fiscal year but 
it could be less than 94 million if we can implement some cost 
economies 
the reagan administration proposed no money for the current and 
future fiscal years but congress restored enough to keep the 
satellites operating until the end of the month 
the earth observation satellite company known as eosat 
currently operates two satellites landsats 4 and 5 which provide 
photos for mineral exploration checking soil conditions and 
vegetation urban and rural planning monitoring volcanoes and 
tracing ocean currents both satellites are well past their expected 
lifetimes and are not fully operational but they are providing 
useful information 
an improved satellite landsat 6 is under construction that 
project will continue because money was provided to complete and 
launch that satellite

former michigan national corp chairman 
stanford stoddard is free to reenter the banking business under a 
federal appeals court opinion lifting a ban by the federal reserve 
board 
the decision was a victory for the 58yearold birmingham banker 
in his fouryear struggle to fight civil charges that he misused 
bank funds 
this should have ended four years ago it should never have 
started stoddard said monday i think my honesty ranks with 
that of any officer who has ever served a bank in michigan or the 
us i am guilty of mistakes in judgement but i am not guilty of 
dishonesty 
an attorney for the federal reserve said monday that the opinion 
overturning its ban on stoddard would hinder efforts to clean up 
abuses in banking 
the federal reserve board in january 1988 removed stoddard from 
his position as officer and director of the detroitarea 
bankholding company and forbade him from engaging in future banking 
activities 
stoddard however had resigned in july 1984 from his position as 
the head of the bank his father founded he left the banking company 
nearly a year before the comptroller of the currency began 
proceedings to remove him in an investigation of misuse of bank 
funds 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in an 
opinion issued friday vacated the federal reserve boards order 
saying the boards decision to dismiss stoddard after his 
resignation presents a linguistic and metaphysical 
impossibility 
one cannot remove what isnt there said the opinion written 
by judge james buckley 
a federal reserve attorney douglas jordan said from an 
enforcement standpoint it creates a certain problem when someone 
can resign and therefore elude jurisdiction 
the board had argued that congress intended the removal provision 
as a way of barring people who engaged in misconduct from returning 
to the banking business 
stoddards attorney keith fisher said his client seriously 
wants to get back into the banking business 
in the current climate of troubled institutions all over the 
country someone of his enormous experience and talents would be 
quite useful to any number of institutions fisher said 
the comptroller of the currency in recommending action against 
stoddard said the bank officer used 167385 of the institutions 
funds for improper purposes 
the agency said stoddard used the money for renovation of 
buildings that were or were to become mormon churches improvements 
to his residence vacation home and florida condominium payment of 
bills for a wedding reception for his children and friends and 
extensive personal secretarial and errand services

prime minister margaret thatcher said today that 
all countries including poor third world nations must curb 
ozonedestroying chemicals that she said threaten life on earth 
simply to carry on as we are is not an option said mrs 
thatcher at the end of a 120nation conference on phasing out the 
use of chlorofluorocarbons the chemical compounds are used in 
aerosol products refrigerators and air conditioners 
her speech came after prince charles on monday called for a 
complete ban by centurys end of the synthetic chemicals 
the meeting began sunday and 20 countries have since joined the 
31 that signed the 1987 montreal protocol requiring that production 
of the compounds chemicals be cut in half by the turn of the century 
mrs thatcher acknowledged that action on the compounds was 
likely to begin in industrial nations 
however she added it is not a case of some countries asking 
other countries to act it is a case of every country taking 
action 
she said the worlds people must change their customs and 
habits in what they buy and what they do in order to overcome 
one of the greatest challenges to life on earth 
the compounds are stable and nontoxic when released into the 
atmosphere but when they rise 1525 miles to the stratosphere 10 
to 100 years later they break apart and their chlorine atoms 
destroy the ozone shield that protects the earth from the suns 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
the compounds also trap heat and warm global temperatures 
causing potentially major climate changes in a process known as the 
greenhouse effect 
in other remarks today us environmental protection agency 
chief william reilly told reporters i think we are all in this 
together we are all going to have to find ways to collaborate and 
clear this mess up it affects us all 
delegates from china and india on monday urged the industrial 
nations to create a fund to help developing nations replace the 
compounds with safe substitutes 
vladimir zhakarov head of the soviet delegation told the 
conference monday that his country needs more scientific evidence 
that cfcs destroy the ozone layer before it will agree to speed up 
its phaseout of such chemicals 
if we take a decision which is not wellgrounded we can 
interfere and destroy the economies of the developing countries 
he said 
the united states and the 12nation european economic community 
have said they will press for a total ban on the compounds by the 
end of the century 
prince charles said monday that there is surely an 
overwhelming scientific case to change the montreal treaty from a 
reduction to complete elimination 
the heir to the british throne who banned aerosols with the 
compounds from his households last year urged a consumer boycott of 
products containing the chemicals

apple computer inc hoping to get back on 
track after recent pricing blunders and a projected drop in earnings 
this quarter is unveiling a more compact but equally powerful 
macintosh computer and two large extrasharp monitors 
the macintosh iicx was scheduled to make its debut today in a 
glitzy teleconference broadcast from a san francisco hotel to 
customers resellers reporters and analysts in chicago new york 
los angeles dallas atlanta washington toronto sydney and 
hannover west germany 
the macintosh iicx the third member of the macintosh family 
announced in the last six months features the motorola 68030 and 
68882 microprocessors takes up less desk space than the earlier ii 
and iix models and can be serviced and reconfigured more easily 
i think the iicx is a product that should have been in the 
marketplace sooner said bruce lupatkin an analyst with hambrecht 
amp quist inc in san francisco its probably the most appealing 
offering in the mac family and should do well 
he said sales of the macintosh iicx should begin making an impact 
on apples earnings in the next quarter since the company is set to 
ship the computers immediately 
lupatkin had some reservations about the new computers price 
the product is priced a little bit expensively he said 
but i think it would have sported a much higher price had apple 
not had the difficulty it had when the company raised prices last 
fall in response to a memory chip shortage the result of that price 
hike was a sharp drop in mac ii sales that is expected to hurt the 
company this quarter 
apple said in january it expects its second quarter ending march 
30 will see earnings in the range of 35 cents to 45 cents per 
share compared with 61 cents per share for the same period last 
year in the first quarter ended dec 30 the company earned 1405 
million or 110 per share 
the iicx which may eventually make the mac ii obsolete is just 
over 12 inches wide compared with 18 inches for other mac ii 
computers 
it will be available in four configurations 
with one megabyte of memory and one floppy disk selling for 
4669 
with one megabyte of internal memory and a 40 megabyte hard disk 
drive selling for 5369 
with four megabytes of memory and an 80 megabyte hard disk for 
7069 
a similar computer with four megabytes of memory an 80 megabyte 
hard disk and aux apples version of the atampt unix operating 
system for 7552 
one of the new highresolution monitors apple will show off has a 
21inch twopage monochrome screen that measures 15 inches 
horizontally by 113 inches vertically it allows user to display 
two pages sidebyside along with menus and scroll bars the monitor 
carries a suggested retail price of 2149 its companion video card 
is priced at 599 
the new portrait display priced at 1099 has a 15inch 
diagonal flat screen that can show an entire page of text and 
graphics including menus and scroll bars

back some of mondays gains 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 196 to 229286

mondays advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a 
group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing 
of economic growth in february 
that was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation 
outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates 
might ease 
but analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might 
get some contradictory evidence later this week when the labor 
department issues its statistics on the employment situation for 
february 
advance estimates call for the report due out friday to show an 
increase of about 250000 in nonfarm payroll employment

us workers productivity edged up at a tiny 
annual rate of 01 percent from october through december while unit 
labor costs a major inflation measure for business shot up by 56 
percent the government reported today 
the 01 percent rise in nonfarm business productivity output 
per hour worked continued a sawtooth pattern in effect for all of 
last year with a strong gain in one quarter followed by a poor 
showing in the next quarter 
productivity had risen at an annual rate of 34 percent in the 
first quarter of 1988 only to plunge at a rate of 24 percent in the 
second quarter it then rose at a 2 percent rate in the 
julyseptember quarter only to slow to the miniscule 01 percent 
advance in the final three months of the year 
of particular concern to economists were signs that tight labor 
markets and high factory operating rates were beginning to show up 
in inflationary pressures 
unit labor costs which reflect changes in hourly compensation as 
well as changes in productivity rose at an annual rate of 56 
percent in the fourth quarter almost double the 37 percent rate of 
increase in the third quarter 
it was the biggest increase in unit labor costs since a 68 
percent rise in the second quarter last year 
the figures released today represented only slight revisions from 
an initial productivity report issued a month ago the 56 percent 
rise in unit labor costs was unchanged from the prior report 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan cited the sharp 
escalation of unit labor costs as one factor behind the central 
banks recent antiinflation moves the fed is hoping that by 
pushing up interest rates it will dampen demand enough to cool an 
overheated economy and prevent an inflationary wageprice spiral 
from taking hold 
for the year as a whole productivity increased 14 percent 
matching the average annual gain since the end of the 198182 
recession 
while the increase was up slightly from a 08 percent rise in 
1987 it was still far below the 2 percent annual gains the bush 
administration is counting on in future years to shrink the 170 
billion budget deficit to zero by 1993 
meeting the bush targets for productivity is considered essential 
to reaching the administrations optimistic projections for overall 
growth of the economy without triggering higher inflation rates

the fair trade commission raided trading companies 
and their beef trade association tuesday to investigate an alleged 
cartel to push up prices of imported beef officials said 
inspectors went to 29 trading companies including mitsubishi 
corp mitsui and co and c itoh and co ltd and to the japan 
beef importers association said ftc spokesman mitsuru suzuki all 
29 companies belong to the 36member semigovernmental livestock 
industry promotion corp 
we have kept our eyes on them for almost four years he said 
adding that the ftc suspected the traders since 1984 had been fixing 
the share of imported beef each would sell to the lipc before actual 
bidding took place 
by fixing each companys share the cartel prevents free 
competition in the market and raises beef prices suzuki said 
the illegal practice no longer exists but investigations under 
the anticartel law can go into past actions suzuki said 
a group of 36 beef importers arranges imports pays tariffs and 
sells their imported beef to the lipc which controls some 90 
percent of beef imports 
japan imported 214000 tons of beef in 1987 and 175000 tons were 
sold through the lipc 
when the issue of a suspected illegal cartel was raised last 
august the lipc conducted its own investigation of member companies 
at government order said shinzo nakatani of the lipc 
we couldnt find anything that indicated the existence of 
preliminary arrangements to fix shares he added 
an official at the ministry of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries said officials in the ministrys livestock department were 
surprised to learn of the ftc raid 
the ministry said in a statement that it would take strict 
measures based on results of the ftcs investigation

grain and soybean futures were trading mostly 
lower this morning against expectations after a mixed opening on 
the chicago board of trade 
much of the selling pressure was coming from the soybean complex 
where some large speculators were cashing out after bidding soybean 
meal prices up sharply late in mondays session 
but the soybean markets early losses were limited by buying 
linked to a trade journals report that the soviet unions imports 
of soybean meal halfway through the current marketing year were 
nearly double those of the same period a year ago 
wheat futures were nearly unchanged in early trading following 
reports that the agriculture department as expected had accepted 
chinas bid for 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 435 a bushel corn was 1 
cent lower to cent higher with march at 278 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to 1 cent higher with march at 209 a bushel soybeans

aboard delta flight 839 ap passengers and flight attendants 
on one delta air lines flight expressed exasperation today over a 
potentially timeconsuming job action implemented by pilots 
nationwide in support of strikers at rival eastern airlines 
the pilots union covering most us carriers ordered members to 
take enhanced safety procedures starting today because of safety 
concerns it said have arisen out of the 4dayold strike at the 
troubled miamibased eastern 
but if the views of people aboard a delta flight from miami to 
atlanta were any indication that wasnt the pilots only motive 
i think they are doing it more out of sympathy said 
passenger franco licenzi an engineer from miami after the cockpit 
crew delayed takeoff for nearly a half an hour on the threequarter 
full flight because of what the captain called cargo loading 
a delta flight attendant who did not wish to be quoted by name 
said the same cargo loading delay had waylaid the flight for 20 
minutes on an earlier atlantato miami run the pilots declined to 
talk with an associated press reporter aboard and made no 
announcement to other passengers regarding the job action 
its just going to aggravate people all day long said the 
flight attendant a 10year delta veteran whats the point of 
it 
she said i think its solidarity for their union its just 
theyre little way of getting even 
passenger melton johnston a merchant marine ship captain en 
route to bermuda said of the eastern strike and the pilots 
sympathy action i think its in poor taste nobody wins 
the eastern strike has been a boon to atlantabased delta which 
in ordinary times is a highly profitable carrier that gets good 
marks from passengers for service thousands of erstwhile eastern 
passengers have been rebooked on delta flights since the strike 
began saturday 
despite the delay today at least some passengers appeared not to 
mind and directed their criticism toward eastern which has been 
reeling from financial losses and chronic complaints about service 
i hope eastern goes out of business and delta can buy their 
routes said a plastics company sales manager from chicago who was

ford motor co on tuesday agreed not to use 
vittorio ghidellas consulting services before july 1 following 
consultations with fiat the italian auto executives former 
employer 
a fiat spokesman said the decision was taken after talks in turin 
between representatives of the two auto giants in line with their 
good and correct relations 
ghidella who resigned late last year as operative head of fiats 
auto sector was expected to have started his relationship with ford 
by midfebruary 
fiat objected to this arrangement because ghidella who formally 
quit the italian group on dec 31 had a contractual obligation not 
to work for the competition for six months following the end of his 
relationship with the turinbased auto maker 
ghidella who had played a key role in the impressive turnaround 
of fiats auto sector in the 1980s resigned following a dispute 
over fiats strategy with cesare romiti the managing director of 
the fiat group which is controlled by the agnelli family 
ghidella had emphasized fiats need to put more emphasis on the 
auto sector to overcome growing competition from japanese 
manufacturers ford hired him to advise it on a wide range of 
automotive initiatives particularly in europe 
three years ago the italian and the us company battled for the 
takeover of alfa romeo the italian maker of luxury and sports cars 
fiat prevailed following several months of tense negotiations

president bush today stood by his determination 
to stay out of the eastern airlines strike as his transportation 
secretary appealed to congress not to force government intervention 
it would be inappropriate for the government to intervene and 
impose a solution bush told reporters at a white house briefing 
adding that the dispute should be resolved through the free 
collective bargaining process 
the president vowed to immediately seek legislation prohibiting 
secondary boycotts should the eastern dispute spill over to other 
airlines or railroads he urged the airline pilots union not to 
make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute 
meanwhile transportation secretary samuel skinner appealed to 
congress not to force government intervention in the strike by 
requiring the administration to impose a 60day coolingoff period 
it is far superior to allow the economic realities of the 
dispute to dictate the outcome skinner told the house public 
works and transportation subcommittee on aviation 
skinner also called on pilots for other carriers not to take any 
action supporting the eastern strike the air line pilots 
association had asked its 40000 members to closely follow rules 
that could result in slowdowns at major airports 
at the capitol house speaker jim wright dtexas called on bush 
to provide national leadership by convening an emergency board 
to help settle the eastern strike he said the national mediation 
board has recommended such a panel 33 times in the last 
halfcentury and in each case the president has accepted the 
recommendation 
for president bush summarily to reject the boards 
recommendation and simply let things drift as he has indicated his 
intention to do would be unprecedented wright said in a 
statement he read to reporters 
he said bush can do as previous presidents have done as 
president kennedy did in the steel crisis thats leadership 
wright said failure to establish an emergency board and set a 
coolingoff period could at worst be a serious blow to the 
economy the loss of jobs for thousands of americans and the further 
concentration of monopoly and erosion of competition in the airline 
industry the nation cannot now afford such a risk 
skinner testified that government action could neither solve the 
dispute nor save eastern from bankruptcy but he said he hoped the 
airline and union would reach agreement on their own 
the secretary said eastern flew only 62 of its scheduled 1057 
flights on monday he said pan american added 20 flights and delta 
five to make up for the cancelled eastern routes but there were 970 
fewer flights throughout the nation overall because of the shutdown 
the subcommittee is considering a bill that would direct bush to 
set up an emergency panel to study issues in the strike bush could 
veto the measure but congress has the power to override his 
disapproval 
if enacted the bill would stop the strike for at least 60 days 
while the panel investigates issues on both sides bush refused to 
take that action before the 1201 am saturday end of a federally 
imposed coolingoff period 
skinner said a presidential emergency board would be wholly 
inappropriate 
the plain fact of the matter is that a strike at eastern alone 
does not substantially disrupt this nations transportation 
system he said but skinner said if a boycott of other airlines 
takes place the administration is prepared to introduce a bill to 
outlaw such activities 
skinner said the administration opposes a measure that would 
force an end to the strike because it believes in free enterprise 
and wants to ensure that us industries remain as competitive as 
possible to maintain our place in the world 
he said the economic deregulation of transportation has reaped 
untold benefits 
the white house has said it might submit a bill that would ban 
eastern airlines employees from picketing other airlines 
but key democrats said they would ask the aviation subcommitteeto 
to give quick approval to legislation directing bush to set up an 
emergency panel to study issues in the strike 
the creation of a panel would also compel eastern for 60 days to 
continue paying salaries in effect prior to the walkout the 
airline which shut down nearly all its operations on monday claims 
it was losing 1 million a day and cannot afford to operate without 
150 million in annual pay cuts 
bush followed management urgings in refusing to step in 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that as long as 
easterns striking machinists union members refrain from picketing 
other airlines or railways we wouldnt find it necessary to send 
up the legislation barring such secondary action 
but fitzwater said the administration is prepared to move 
rapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs 
the spokesman said bush is receiving daily briefings on the 
situation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by the 
company and the union in negotiations rather than through government 
intervention 
but rep james oberstar dminn suggested that the emergency 
panel legislation he and committee chairman rep glenn anderson 
dcalif drew up might give cover to the administration for the 
action bush refused to take 
oberstar aviation subcommittee chairman did not contend that 
the strike had reached emergency proportions but he called it 
part of a longterm problem with broad implications for the 
airline industry 
if not an emergency this is a matter of great public 
interest he said 
skinner said monday that the private labor dispute should be 
allowed to follow its normal course without boycotts of other 
companies 
both sides need to get this issue resolved and get on with the 
business of this country and serving its customers skinner said 
the secretary said he called the heads of other major airlines 
and asked them to help passengers affected by eastern cancellations

industry assist contract that would bring experienced lockheed 
workers to the 747400 production line in everett for up to six

stock analysts discounted the speculation saying it was unlikely 
boeing would want to take on new challenges when it already faces 
delays and production problems in its commercial airplane division 
lockheed a major aerospace defense contractor based in 
calabasas calif stopped making commercial jets in the mid1980s

might ease

get some contradictory evidence later this week when the labor

eastern airlines today laid off an additional 2500 employees 
because it has no work for them in the fourth day of a machinists 
strike that has crippled the airline but failed to disrupt air 
traffic nationwide 
we simply dont have any business on the books today joe 
leonard eastern executive vice president said at a news 
conference our competitors have simply been sucking up the 
traffic our traffic since march 4 
leonard said the airline was forced to halt nearly all its 
operations because its pilots had firmly supported the 8500member 
machinists union which represents mechanics and ramp service 
workers 
if our pilots had come to work this strike would be over he 
said we could have easily flown through a machinists strike 
the nations airline pilots today began a job action that had 
threatened to clog air travel on most airlines but few delays were 
reported by noon 
eastern airlines on monday sent more than 7000 nonstriking 
employees home and leonard said today that just 1500 employees 
remain working down from from 31200 before the strike the airline 
had announced monday it sent home 5000 workers but today leonard 
said the figure actually was 7000 
leonard reiterated that a move to bankruptcy court was a last 
resort and said we dont have any plans to throw in the towel 
flights were slightly delayed at some airports this morning but 
officials said it was too early to know whether to blame bad 
weather normal delays or a nationwide pilots effort to strictly 
adhere to all regulations 
the reports we have are that there has been no effect on 
operations said capt roger hall a national spokesman for the 
air line pilots association the union continues to contend it is 
not conducting a slowdown but is adapting to highly unusual 
circumstances it says threaten safety 
this morning in washington president bush said pilots should not 
make the innocent traveling public a pawn and stood by his 
opposition to government intervention to stop the machinists union 
walkout 
in new york today unions representing workers at three suburban 
rail lines that serve more than 300000 commuters appealed a court 
order barring them from honoring any picket lines the machinists set 
up at railways a hearing was set for wednesday 
lawyers for the machinists and the brotherhood of railroad 
signalmen asked the 2nd us circuit court of appeals to overturn an 
order by us district judge robert p patterson patterson today 
extended his order which had been effective until 3 pm est 
wednesday to midnight friday it bars workers at those commuter 
lines from walking off the job in sympathy with strikers 
the eastern strike which began saturday and culminated a 
17month labor dispute grounded most of the airlines flights 
stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nations 
seventhlargest airline to the brink of collapse the airline wants 
150 million in concessions the machinists want 50 million in 
raises 
we cannot run an airline with unpredictability eastern 
spokesman robin matell told reporters in miami we cannot continue 
to inconvenience passengers we cannot afford the steady financial 
drain 
matell said eastern would continue only its most profitable 
routes its shuttle between washington new york and boston and 
three round trips weekly between miami buenos aires argentina and 
santiago chile 
fullpage advertisements for eastern today in the new york times 
the washington post and the boston globe urged fly us with no 
reservations and promised that the shuttle is operating every hour 
henry duffy president of the alpa asked its 40000member 
pilots nationwide beginning at 6 am est today to adhere to rules 
to ensure the safety of the system which he said had been 
weakened by the eastern disruptions 
as the workday began air traffic was not crippled 
everythings quiet said mildred schneider spokeswoman for 
the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates the 
three major new yorkarea airports asked if pilots were conducting 
a slowdown she said no one has given me that indication 
the us department of transportation set up a special control 
center in washington to monitor the alpa action by 1030 am est 
no unusual delays were reported said spokesman hal paris adding 
we wont have anything until this afternoon probably late 
afternoon 
by 830 am est no delays were posted on flightstatus boards 
at counters of major carriers at miami international airport 
national airport flights began as usual at 7 am and some 
flights took off said dave hess spokesman for the metropolitan 
washington airport authority we wont have a handle on this until 
midday he said about any possible disruption 
if there a slowdown here we cant see it said john braden 
spokesman at hartsfield atlanta international airport we have so 
much excess capacity because easterns not flying we can absorb any 
such delays anyway 
federal aviation administration inspectors have been monitoring 
eastern closely and have found no safety lapses said anthony 
broderick faa associate director he said the agency was prepared 
to deal with the pilots action 
on monday eastern asked a federal judge in miami to order its 
pilots to cross machinist union picket lines a hearing was 
scheduled today 
eastern canceled almost all flights monday although some 
northeast shuttle flights left despite a snowstorm in the new york 
city area pan am corp doubled its rival hourly shuttle service to 
take advantage of easterns troubles 
matell said the 5000 to 6000 idled nonunion employees were 
notified immediately of their nowork status and would receive 
lumpsum payments from 270 to 640 depending on their wages they 
include ticket and reservations agents clerical workers customer 
service workers and some managers 
my father went to work for eastern in 1949 the year i was 
born said gate agent steve moss in atlanta this company has 
raised me from a child and all i can say is that now im ashamed 
about what the current management has done to eastern 
some of those laid off joined striking eastern machinists on 
picket lines 
matell said about 200 pilots out of 3600 were flying but the 
pilots union put the number at 88 
were not the ones who sought the strike said john j bavis 
head of the eastern air line pilots association local this is a 
strike that mr lorenzo called 
the antiunion reputation of frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp has galvanized easterns unionized employees 
easterns 5900 flight attendants also have honored the 
machinists strike 
before the strike miamibased eastern claimed losses of more 
than 1 billion during the last decade and 1 million daily it 
also said it had 25 billion in debts stemming from its acquisition 
by texas air corp in 1986

compaq computer corps only foreign 
factory soars above the scottish countryside outside glasgow a 
giant glassmetal structure that looks unique it isnt 
the compaq plant is modeled on the companys houston 
headquarters its parent company is one of 275 american businesses 
operating in scotland 
the scots historically have been highly successful in attracting 
foreign businesses although the pace of overseas investment has 
slackened in the past few years they hope the pace will accelerate 
again ahead of 1992 when the european economic community is to 
become one barrierfree marketplace 
investment has meant a great deal to scotlands hardhit economy 
in the 1980s creating jobs where the unemployment rate is 103 
percent but foreign owners of scottish factories have been 
criticized for creating a segment of the economy that thrives on 
lowskilled assembly jobs 
for the large companies 1992 will not come as a big surprise 
they were already here what we are talking about here are the 
small to mediumsized companies for whom expansion in europe would 
be the next logical step said robert crawford a scottish 
development agency official 
many companies are establishing a presence in europe by setting 
up manufacturing operations or arranging joint ventures and 
licensing agreements to ensure theyre not shut out of the single 
european market of 320 million consumers when 1992 arrives 
the largest share of investment in scotland has come from the 
united states much of it in electronics which has created a 
silicon glen 
it is the largest such concentration in europe stretching from 
prestwick to dundee in the central part of scotland where most of 
the 51 million population lives 
investment in 198788 totaled 580 million and created more than 
6700 jobs vs a 12 billion invesmtment credited with creating 
nearly 8200 jobs in 198485 government statistics show the us 
share in the latest year totaled 194 million which created or 
safeguarded about 3600 jobs 
scotland tries to attract companies in electronics and health 
care where it already has a substantial infrastructure that gives 
investors easy access to components and research 
scotland also sells the experience of existing american companies 
were very very comfortable with the decision that took compaq 
to establish in scotland said eddie mcgowan a compaq manager he 
said the company already has expanded operations at the 10monthold 
plant 
scotlands promoters also boast that the work force is cheap 
compared with those of west germany and other european countries 
moreover they say scots are highly educated and readily available 
because of the high jobless rate 
the english language also is a big factor in attracting american 
investors experts said 
its not just language its language and culture the 
americans find the work force very similar to the work force in 
america crawford said 
nonetheless many overseas entrepreneurs remain skeptical of 
doing business here for one thing scotland is remote separated 
from the european continent by water critics also contend the 
scottish workforce is not as cheap flexible and well educated as 
the government officially proclaims 
gordon hughes a professor at the university of edinburgh said 
large japanese companies such as nissan motor co and sony corp 
have preferred to establish factories in northeast england and wales 
another problem is what business executives call a history of 
union stubbornness in scotland ford motor co for example 
abandoned plans to build an electronics plant in dundee last year 
because of labor opposition to a single union there 
we certainly have lost a lot of economic opportunity because of 
union intransigence said john davidson scottish director of the 
confederation of british industry 
in addition some critics worry that foreign companies arent 
transplanting their decisionmaking and research work to scotland 
others say only a narrow range of overseasbased industries are 
setting up here leaving the scots vulnerable if those industries 
suffer downturns 
theres been a high mortality rate of plants that came here in 
the 1960s and 1970s that didnt survive the 80s when the 
electronics industry slowed down hughes said

president bush on tuesday virtually ruled out 
intervening in the eastern airlines strike saying mantoman 
negotiation is preferable to a governmentimposed settlement 
while he didnt flatly rule out stepping in to end the walkout 
bush said his policy will hold firm despite pressure in some 
congressional quarters to force him to act 
the president had spare time in his schedule tuesday because 
inclement weather forced him to cancel a planned trip to lancaster 
pa and wilmington del for speeches on his plans to attack drug 
abuse 
as he stepped to the white house podium bushs transportation 
secretary samuel skinner was on capitol hill urging lawmakers not 
to pass legislation that would force bushs hand on the eastern 
strike under a provision of the railway labor act he could stop 
the walkout for 60 days while a presidentiallyappointed panel 
investigated the dispute 
house speaker jim wright responded that bushs refusal to halt 
the strike by appointing an investigative panel would be 
unprecedented noting that over the last halfcentury 33 such 
boards have been named in transportation disputes 
bush however used his opening news conference statement to 
restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the best 
means of resolving the strike 
he exhorted eastern management the machinists union and other 
unions to conduct headonhead mantoman negotiation and said 
he thought that would be better and more lasting than an 
imposed government settlement which could cause the airline to 
totally shut down 
bush urged pilots threatening a sympathy slowdown in support of 
the strike not to make the innocent traveling public a pawn in 
this dispute he reiterated that if the machinists try to shut 
down rail service he will ask congress to ban such secondary 
boycotts 
it is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in from 
long island that youre going to be caught up and victimized by a 
strike affecting an airline he said simply isnt fair

ever despite a spate of unusually hot dry weather early in the 
growing season

texaco usa announced tuesday it would form two 
major exploration and producing regional organizations and 
streamline its operations in an effort to boost sagging production 
profits 
james l dunlap president of houstonbased texaco usa said 
the new regions to be headquartered in denver and new orleans are 
part of a major restructuring announced by texaco inc last year and 
reflect a refocused business strategy 
texaco based in white plains ny recently completed the sale 
of more than 7 billion in assets following its emergence from 
bankruptcy protection last year the restructuring has reduced the 
size of the nations third largest oil concern and focused its 
attention on exploration and production rather than refining and 
marketing 
the two new regions and 12 divisions will replace the texaco 
subsidiarys existing 26 offices that currently employ about 7300 
people nationwide company spokesman paul weeditz said 
he said some employee relocations and reductions were expected 
but were uncertain at this point as to the ultimate impact on 
employment 
specific plans for the restructuring are expected to be completed 
by the end of the year 
the idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellhead 
as possible so that each division operates as would a successful 
independent company making its own operating decisions with minimum 
review at other management levels while being accountable for its 
own performance dunlap said 
the new orleansbased region or the east region will be 
responsible for the companys onshore and offshore exploration and 
production in the gulf coast and eastern seaboard areas 
the denverbased region or the west region will be responsible 
for those activities in the midcontinent west coast and other 
areas 
vice president william wallace will head the new orleansbased 
region while vice president l paul teague will head the western 
region both will report to gerald f rome in houston the executive 
vice president of exploration producing and gas 
the east regions five units will include two exploration and 
exploitation divisions based in new orleans and two producing 
divisions with one in harvey la and the other in morgan city 
la the fifth division also based in new orleans will be 
responsible for producing properties owned by texaco but operated by 
others 
the west regions seven units will include producing divisions in 
bakersfield calif ventura calif midland texas and denver two 
exploration and exploitation divisions in denver a division in 
denver that will be responsible for texacoowned properties operated 
by others and an exploitation unit in midland 
dunlap noted that the natural gas department texaco usas 
other major upstream or exploration and production business 
may be in for some restructuring in the future

647 million or 54 cents a share in the 1988 quarter revenue

yearearlier period 
new yorkbased gulf amp westerns three operating segments are 
publishing consumer and commercial lending and entertainment 
including paramount pictures madison square garden and theater 
circuits 
the company said firstquarter results included 51 million 
stemming from an accounting change related to the recognition of 
finance income and a onetime gain of 56 million from the sale of 
a 50 percent interest in the companys domestic theater operations 
the accounting change related to finance income should continue 
to add about 5 million a quarter to earnings over the next two to 
three years the company said without that gain and the gain on the 
sale earnings would have dropped 
gulf amp western said total receivables in its consumercommercial 
finance unit exceeded 13 billion for the first time led by healthy 
advances in consumer real estate lending 
motion picture operating income was strong but television 
operations posted the largest percentage gains due in part to the 
popularity of webster and star trek the next generation

this airport bedroom community 
founded by aviation pioneer glen curtiss was hit especially hard 
when eastern airlines idled 9500 employees in last two days 
pedro hidalgo has owned the eldorado jewelry shop for eight years 
in the corner of the central drug store in this city of 12000 on 
the edge of miami international airport now he wonders if hell be 
looking for a new job soon 
open for 2 hours tuesday hidalgo went to his desk to locate his 
only receipt for the day a 2 repair 
by this time of day i was usually crowded and people were 
waiting outside said hidalgo my survival amount to cover 
everything is 100 a day yesterday i made 62 
he feels the strike by the machinists union against moneylosing 
eastern is to blame 
shopkeepers around the downtown traffic circle estimate 40 
percent to 60 percent of their business comes from the airline 
industry and a significant segment of that from eastern whose 
headquarters is just outside the city 
betty russell a newsstand employee at the airport for 17 years 
was wondering how much longer the airport concession would keep her 
shop open in the nearly deserted eastern terminal 
i live in the springs and practically all the people that live 
in the springs work for eastern she said 
at one point she called the strike by the 8500member 
machinists union very foolish but no matter what happens she 
concluded nobodys going to win 
her employer already has closed stores on easterns shuttered 
boarding ramps and is pushing its workers to take vacations or shift 
to a fourday work week 
ive been here 17 years and i make 5 an hour i always say 
half a loaf is better than nothing she said its going to be a 
sad thing down here in miami its bad 
ticket agents and skycaps who on monday were placed on what 
eastern calls nowork status were called in tuesday morning for 
a meeting with management 
a supervisor told them they could apply for unemployment benefits 
but could be called back at any time their medical insurance 
expired at midnight monday no vacation pay would be considered and 
questions about early retirement went unanswered 
the nowork status means we hope its a shorter term in 
other words that we hope well be able to call them back to work 
said eastern spokeswoman bobbi giordano were hoping that theyll 
be coming back so thats where that stands 
iza emmett a 24year eastern veteran who had been working in 
international passenger services hugged coworkers and wiped away 
tears as she headed to pick up a paycheck 
we dont get vacation pay we dont get severance pay we dont 
get anything she said 
theyre upset very upset because they want to know whats 
happening in the future said ramp service manager joseph brazeau 
a 23year eastern veteran

the most likely cause of cases of sudden 
acceleration involving the audi 5000 and other cars is drivers 
stepping on the wrong pedal the national highway traffic safety 
administration said tuesday 
the agency however said drivers may not be to blame for 
confusion between accelerator and brake the difficulty in selecting 
the right pedal may be aggravated by vehicle design the agency 
said 
a yearlong study of sudden acceleration conducted by the 
agencys transportation systems center in cambridge mass found 
that a car can suddenly speed up to full power only if the throttle 
is opened almost completely to provide oxygen to the engine 
other proposed theories of sudden acceleration such as problems 
with the cruise control or electronic idle speed control systems 
failed to meet the test of an open throttle while the brakes are 
applied nhtsa said 
nhtsa has conducted more than 100 investigations of unwanted 
acceleration involving 20 manufacturers since the late 1970s 
the agencys investigations of the problem have resulted in 26 
recalls and manufacturers have conducted another 75 recalls 
a major sudden acceleration case involved the west germanmade 
audi in late 1986 the company recalled about 250000 of its 
5000series automobiles for installation of a shiftlock device 
which prevents the transmission from being put into forward or 
reverse without the brake pedal being depressed 
audi spokesman joseph bennett said in detroit that the report 
is a breath of fresh air as far as were concerned 
while the transportation center chose to use the term pedal 
misapplication we feel that it is fundamentally what weve been 
saying bennett said 
he was skeptical that design factors in the audi could have 
contributed to confusion among pedals 
our pedals are optimized for braking efficiency for driver 
control bennett said these cars are designed to be driven on 
autobahns at 100 mph plus 
the center for auto safety a critic of the auto industry 
declined comment until it could see a copy of the report 
nhtsa rejected the conclusion of a canadian study and some 
automakers that sudden acceleration was due to driver error 
driver error may imply carelessness or willfulness in failing 
to operate a car properly nhtsa said pedal misapplication is 
more descriptive of what occurs it could happen to even the most 
attentive driver who inadvertently selects the wrong pedal and 
continues to do so unwittingly 
a report by transport canada issued in january concluded that 
sudden acceleration occurs as a result of driver error 
pedal placement shape and feel may be factors that lead drivers 
to press the wrong pedal nhtsa said 
however the agency said proposals for any design changes must 
await further research 
complaints of sudden acceleration are based on instances when 
cars allegedly go to full power from a standstill or slow speed 
usually after the driver has moved the automatic transmission from 
park into drive or reverse nhtsa said 
the agency excluded from its definition of sudden acceleration 
instances of high idle speed or throttle sticking

a resurgence of commercial and speculative buying pushed platinum 
futures prices to a 3month high tuesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange and boosted gold and silver futures as well 
on other markets crudeoil futures tumbled soybeans retreated 
grains were mixed cattle futures advanced and pork futures fell 
platinum settled 480 to 530 higher with the contract for 
delivery in april at 55150 a troy ounce the highest close since 
the markets middecember collapse from levels near 600 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 520 to 580 
higher with april at 39570 a troy ounce silver finished 65 cents 
to 68 cents higher with may at 5965 a troy ounce 
platinums slow climb back from less than 520 an ounce reflects 
both renewed commercial demand from the far east and the gradual 
return of bullish speculators who bailed out of the market following 
the ford motor cos dec 14 announcement that it had developed a 
catalytic converter that did not use platinum as a primary 
ingredient 
the use of platinum as a chemical catalyst in the automobile 
pollutioncontrol devices accounts for about a third of global 
platinum consumption 
with ford still testing its new converters the platinum markets 
attention has gradually returned to the existing tightsupply 
situation which is expected to persist into the 1990s 
yet platinum traders remain cautious an attitude underscored by 
tuesdays activity the april contract traded as high as 559 during 
the session then dropped back as traders lost their nerve and took 
profits 
still youve got to give the market some credit just for 
getting up there said craig sloane a metalmarket analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
in contrast the gold and silver markets closed near their highs

of those metals will continue to rise 
peter cardillo commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co 
in new york said golds performance on tuesday tells me were in 
for a shortterm pop to the 400 area a level the gold market has 
not seen since late january 
tuesdays sharp drop in energy futures prices on the new york 
mercantile exchange was attributed to technical factors rather than 
to a change in the bullish fundamentals that have recently driven 
crudeoil futures to prices approaching 19 a barrel 
those positive factors include agreements by nonopec 
oilproducing countries to reduce their crudeoil output in a 
concerted effort to boost prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 37 cents 
lower with april at 1830 a barrel heating oil was 35 cent to 57 
cent lower with april at 5108 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was

soybean futures prices fell moderately on the chicago board of 
trade reflecting concerns about the imminent arrival of new

first union corp said tuesday that it 
agreed to acquire florida national banks of florida inc in a cash 
and stock deal valued at 749 million 
meanwhile chemical banking corp said it would sell its 49 
percent stake in florida national and abandon earlier plans to 
acquire the jacksonville fla bank once interstate banking between 
new york and florida is permitted 
under the latest deal first union would pay 2712 per common 
share of florida national with one half in cash and the other in 
preferred stock first union also received a warrant under to buy up 
to 92 million shares of florida nationals unissued common stock at 
2250 a share 
florida national soared 637 a share to 2425 in national 
overthecounter trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
first union dipped 112 a share to 2150 and chemical rose 50 
cents to 3125 a share 
first union said florida national would operate as a florida 
subsidiary with 17 billion in assets making it the second largest 
bank in that state with 400 branches 
florida national with assets of 78 billion has 185 offices 
and nearly 5000 employees charlottebased first union reported 
assets of 29 billion at the end of 1988 and operates 702 banking 
offices in north carolina south carolina georgia florida and 
tennessee 
florida national chairman john d uible will join first unions 
board of directors and become chairman of the executive committee of 
the florida subsidiary billy walker will continue as chairman and 
chief executive officer of first union national bank of florida and 
byron hodnett would continue as president 
first union chairman edward e crutchfield jr said the bank 
plans to gain significant operating efficiencies from the combined 
company 
because of those anticipated efficiencies we expect this 
merger to have less than two percent impact on earnings per share in 
1989 and a slightly positive impact on our earnings per share in 
1990 he said 
chemical and florida national banks had agreed to merge in 1984 
when interstate banking between new york and florida became 
permissible but chemical chairman walter v shipley said 
reciprocal interstate banking between florida and new york seems 
unlikely in the near future 
chemical said it would sell to first union its warrants in 
florida national for 100 million in addition chemical agreed to 
sell to first union its holdings of 13 million shares of common 
stock in florida national under the terms of the first union merger 
agreement 
chemical said that if the first union merger is not consummated 
the merger agreement between chemical and first national would be 
extended by a period equal to the time during which first unions 
merger with florida national was pending 
either chemical or florida union may terminate their agreement in 
early 1991 if the merger with first union does not occur chemical 
said

the 2300 level 
dow joness average of 30 blue chips up 2053 points on monday

the markets advance monday was prompted in part by a monthly 
report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed 
to a slowing of economic growth in february 
that was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation 
outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates 
could ease 
but analysts said some traders were fearful that they might get 
some contradictory evidence later this week when the labor 
department issues its statistics on the employment situation for 
february 
those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise 
in openmarket interest rates tuesday

even with its planes idled and thousands of its 
employees on furlough because of a strike eastern airlines was 
interviewing applicants for jobs as flight attendants tuesday 
union members picketing outside the hotel where the interviews 
were held said eastern was trying to line up nonunion attendants 
to replace united transport workers members 
the company denied it and said it was simply going ahead with the 
interviews because of helpwanted ads it placed before the strike 
several of the 15 to 20 young men and women who showed up for 
interviews said they were not aware that the airline was in 
difficulty 
similar interviews were held in miami on sunday and monday and 
also were picketed by unionized attendants 
judy coughlin secretarytreasurer of local 533 of the transport 
workers union which represents the flight attendants said eastern 
was also interviewing in boston on tuesday and was planning 
interviews in new york on wednesday 
we are meeting these people at every hotel ms coughlin 
said we have had great success in convincing people to turn away 
we handed them a flier and told them about other airlines that were 
hiring flight attendants and would pay them more money and we said 
please come back some day when things are better at eastern 
flight attendants have joined easterns pilots in honoring picket 
lines thrown up saturday by the airlines 8500member machinists 
union 
eastern announced monday it was sending more than 5000 workers 
home and most planes were grounded by the crippled airline the 
nations seventh largest 
this didnt deter a young woman who would identify herself only 
as barbara as she emerged from the room where she had filled out a 
form and talked with an eastern representative about future 
employment 
i want a job she said i really didnt know about the 
controversy that was going on 
the airlines ad which appeared sunday said tired of the 
nine to five grind see more of the world in a month than most 
people see in a lifetime eastern is currently recruiting flight 
attendants and would like to consider you a candidate 
the ad said the jobs would pay 1000 to 1200 per month in base 
salary plus expenses 
jeff bowen who was conducting the interviews said they were 
basically informational 
asked in a telephone interview whether the interviewing session 
had anything to do with easterns current difficulties bowen said 
yes it does i think at present we need to make sure that we can 
get this operation back on its feet 
we are not passing out applications he said we are just 
trying to get an idea of those individuals who would be interested 
in working for eastern in the event that we had to do some 
replacement of flight attendants 
when a reporter arrived at the hotel however bowen said what 
we are doing is trying to fill the commitment we made in the 
newspaper ads rather than lock the door we had no idea we would be 
faced with this situation 
bowen said he believed the ads were placed last wednesday 
outside the hotel teal carter a stewardess with eastern for 
five years and a member of the union said theyre hiring scab 
flight attendants to replace us 
ron richardson an official of a union that represents workers at 
the washington hilton where the interviews took place said he 
telephoned william h edwards jr general manager of the hotel 
monday night and asked him to throw eastern out of there 
his response was that they had already rented the place and 
they couldnt legally get out of it said richardson who is 
executive secretarytreasurer of local 25 of the hotel and 
restaurant employees union 
edwards said of the company it was a situation that they could 
have avoided i dont foresee it happening again 
the airline has 7000 flight attendants 
david ashelford a picket who said he had been with eastern for 
23 years suggested new attendants would be hired at much lower pay 
he said an experienced flight attendant makes about 1800 a month 
plus 25 an hour for flying time in excess of 75 hours a month 
bowen told that the pickets did not believe his account of the 
purpose of the interviews said they probably wouldnt as a 
result of the climate that we have now at eastern airlines but i 
can assure you there has been no plan made as a result of what has 
happened 
the woman named barbara said company interviewers did not talk to 
her about the union or tell her that people were being laid off she 
also said she was not given encouragement that she would get a job 
francis folefac of baltimore said he was aware of the strike but 
that eastern representatives told him they were just trying to 
honor the ad in the paper he too said they did not give him any 
encouragement

a divided house panel approved a unionsought 
bill tuesday that would compel president bush to intervene in the 
eastern airlines strike despite administration insistence that such 
involvement would not settle the bitter dispute 
the legislation passed 2112 by the house public works aviation 
subcommittee would require bush to appoint an emergency board to 
study the impasse that has grounded most of the carriers flights 
and to recommend a solution during this process there would be a 
coolingoff period of up to 60 days in which the striking employees 
would return to work 
the bill is not expected to reach the house floor until sometime 
next week although many lawmakers concede that there are not enough 
votes in congress to override an expected presidential veto 
democrats say the exercise is worthwhile because of the pressure it 
places on bush to find a solution to the work stoppage 
when we send the bill to president bushs desk were passing a 
hot potato back to him rep peter defazio dore said after the 
panels vote whats his solution 
the legislation would require the emergency board to study the 
dispute between not only eastern and its striking machinists but 
between the airline and two other unions whose contracts have 
expired the air line pilots association and the transport workers 
union of america which represents flight attendants 
we want to stick it all into the same bag settle it all at 
once said the subcommittee chairman rep james oberstar dminn 
but bsh in a session with white house reporters repeated his 
belief that the free collective bargaining process should 
resolve the standoff he said it would be inappropriate for the 
government to impose a solution 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner told the panel that he 
would recommend that bush veto the legislation arguing that the 
frustrations and animosity between easterns management and its 
striking workers was building and would fester despite a boards 
appointment 
you cant run an airline where you have the kind of animosity 
over a period of time building up skinner said 
democrats however argued that a board could produce a solution 
to the dispute which began saturday and has pitted eastern against 
its 8500 machinists and ramp workers represented by the 
international association of machinists most of the carriers 
pilots and flight attendants have also walked off their jobs in 
support of the machinists in a dispute focusing on wages and 
benefits 
the emergency board gives cover to both parties to reach 
agreement said subcommittee chairman james l oberstar dminn 
elsewhere house speaker jim wright also sought to pressure bush 
to appoint a board telling reporters that presidential leadership 
was needed 
he can do as previous presidents have done as president 
kennedy did in the steel crisis wright said thats 
leadership 
aflcio president lane kirkland sounded a similar theme to the 
house subcommittee blaming bushs failure to appoint a board for 
the strike 
it is time for congress to fill the leadership void the 
president has created kirkland told the lawmakers 
skinner told the subcommittee that administration remains poised 
to introduce legislation that would prohibit secondary boycotts of 
railroads and other airlines that labor has threatened to support 
the eastern strikers 
a strike at eastern alone does not substantially disrupt this 
nations transportation system skinner said it is only the 
specter of secondary activity that threatens to hold hostage this 
nations economy and our global competitive position 
in his session with reporters bush reiterated that secondary 
boycotts are not in the public interest and i will send 
legislation to congress to forbid them if that is necessary 
skinner drew occasionally testy questions from the panels 
democrats who kept demanding to know why the administration has so 
far adopted a passive role in the dispute 
there hasnt been any rolling up of sleeves and getting in 
there said rep douglas bosco dcalif 
im not afraid to go anywhere anyplace and put anybody in a 
room to find a settlement to the strike skinner responded 
even some republicans were critical of easterns owner frank 
lorenzo and said they had not decided whether they would support 
the democrats call for an emergency board 
but other gop lawmakers supported bushs stance rep john paul 
hammerschmidt of arkansas ranking republican on the house public 
works committee said to convene an emergency board and return to 
the wages and working conditions of last week will only further 
bleed eastern and endanger its survival 
democrats said they expected the administration to have little 
chance of getting its bill through the democraticcontrolled 
congress 
all 19 democrats on the subcommittee who voted supported the 
legislation all but two of the panels republicans opposed the 
measure reps sherwood boehlert and guy molinari both from new 
york 
on a related issue boehlert introduced a bill tuesday that would 
require air carriers to submit plans to protect their ticketholders 
in case of bankruptcy 
boehlert said tens of thousands of travelers have already 
purchased tickets for eastern flights some of which might not be 
redeemed if the airline reorganizes under the bankruptcy laws

east texas steel facilities a subsidiary of lone 
star technologies is negotiating with lenders to stretch out 
payments on 135 million in bank debt the parent company said 
the steel unit formerly known as lone star steel co faces a 
44 million payment on the debt march 31 the holding company is not 
responsible for east texas debt 
east texas steel facilities met friday with a group of its bank 
lenders led by ncnb texas national bank to discuss restructuring 
the debt officials said monday 
in addition lone star said auditor arthur andersen amp co may 
include an explanatory paragraph in its report on the companys 
financial results for the year the paragraph described as slightly 
less severe than a qualified report would reflect uncertainties 
about lone stars ability to complete the proposed debt 
restructuring the company told the dallas times herald 
buoyed by overly optimistic projections of demand for its 
oilfield products east texas steel borrowed heavily last year to 
purchase highquality slab steel used to manufacture pipe bank debt 
in the year soared to 1441 million from 1083 million 
but the steep downturn in world oil prices dried up the market

a federal judge tuesday refused to order eastern 
airlines pilots back to work even though eastern warned it couldnt 
otherwise survive the 4dayold machinists strike a spinoff job 
action by pilots nationwide failed to clog airports as feared 
eastern earlier sent 2500 more nonunion workers home blaming 
pilots for leaving it with no business on the books 
if the pilots do not come back to work eastern airlines is 
gone company attorney david ross said he warned during a court 
hearing that eastern was faced with bankruptcy without its 3600 
pilots who have firmly refused to cross picket lines the machinists 
union set up saturday 
us district judge edward b davis denied easterns request for 
a temporary restraining order less than a half hour after the 
threehour hearing 
pilots union spokesman jb stokes called the ruling a victory 
of principle a victory of ethics 
later the pilots union reported that eastern management called 
its negotiators to try to set up new talks no details were 
immediately available 
basically were extremely cautious stokes said adding that 
no talks had yet been scheduled 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the company would appeal 
davis ruling immediately to the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
in atlanta 
ross said the company couldnt operate more than 48 to 72 hours 
more without the pilots and could have to file for federal 
bankruptcy protection 
matell said bankruptcy would be a course of last resort he 
declined to speculate on how long it would be before eastern would 
make such a move 
eastern the nations seventhlargest airline already has nearly 
shut down saying it was forced to lay off a total of 9500 workers 
this week because of the pilots adherence to the strike in a 
17monthold contract dispute 
the airline wants 150 million in concessions the machinists 
want 50 million in raises eastern has said it lost more than 1 
billion this decade and 1 million a day before the strike 
the national pilots union had asked its 40000 members at all 
airlines to follow rule books stringently starting tuesday and 
there were fears of havoc as delays piggybacked around the country 
but while the union said 60 percent of its members followed the 
directive delays were few 
the reports we have are that there has been no effect on 
operations said capt roger hall spokesman for the air line 
pilots association he said the job action would continue but he 
did not know for how long 
the union contended its action was not a slowdown but an effort 
to ensure safety during the strike transportation secretary samuel 
k skinner at a news conference in new york called the effects 
sporadic 
the federal aviation administration said in washington that the 
system so far has operated in a close to normal manner spokesman 
bob buckhorn said there had been sporadic requests for 
morethanusual handling by air traffic controllers but the system 
has been able to accommodate those requests 
president bush in washington said pilots should not make the 
innocent traveling public a pawn and stood by his opposition to 
government intervention to stop the walkout by the 8500member 
machinists union which represents mechanics and ramp service 
workers 
skinner appealed to congress not to force the administration to 
impose a 60day coolingoff period but a house subcommittee 
approved a unionsought bill tuesday that would compel bush to 
intervene by appointing an emergency board to study the impasse 
between the airline and union and recommend a solution it would 
include a coolingoff period of up to 60 days in which the striking 
employees would return to work 
the bill is not expected to reach the house floor until sometime 
next week and many lawmakers concede there are not enough votes in 
congress to override an expected presidential veto 
bush said if the machinists try to shut down rail service later 
this week he will ask congress to ban such secondary boycotts he 
said the strike should be settled through bargaining but no talks 
are scheduled 
secondary boycotts particularly in the new york metropolitan 
area could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people 
unions representing workers at three suburban new york rail lines 
tuesday appealed a judges order issued over the weekend barring 
them from honoring any machinists picket lines set up at railways 
an appeals court hearing was set wednesday but the lowercourt 
judge extended his order originally set to expire wednesday 
afternoon through friday 
meanwhile eastern has just 1500 employees still working down 
from 31200 before the strike according to joe leonard eastern 
executive vice president and chief operating officer who announced 
another 2500 layoffs tuesday 
we simply dont have any business on the books today leonard 
said our competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic our 
traffic since march 4 
some union members have speculated that easterns owner texas 
air corp and its chairman frank lorenzo are trying to tear the 
carrier apart lorenzos antiunion reputation has galvanized 
easterns unionized employees 
one of the problems in this situation and the reason its gone 
on for 17 months is mr lorenzos credibility with his unions is 
about as low as you can get skinner said he thought the pilots 
would cross its pretty clear to me the pilots had no intention of 
crossing the picket lines 
nearly 3000 eastern employees jammed miamis knight center 
downtown tuesday night for a teleconference being carried by 
satellite television to 11 other groups across the country 
lorenzo makes machiavelli look like gomer pyle henry duffy 
president of the air line pilots association told the cheering 
union members 
eastern has contended the pilots who along with its 5900 flight 
attendants have honored the picket lines are conducting an illegal 
strike but pilots attorney james linsey said the pilots can honor 
the strike under the railway labor act 
flights were slightly delayed at some airports tuesday by alpas 
action which was to take advantage of the discretion pilots have in 
deciding preflight and prelanding checks such as reading flight 
plans to controllers 
everythings quiet said mildred schneider spokeswoman for 
the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates the 
three major new yorkarea airports 
if there a slowdown here we cant see it said john braden 
spokesman at hartsfield atlanta international airport where eastern 
had accounted for 26 percent of the traffic before the strike 
airports in philadelphia indianapolis los angeles kansas city 
mo phoenix and portland ore reported few or no delays san 
francisco officials said fog delayed some flights 
in denver officials at stapleton international airport said the 
pilots action delayed some united flights while continental 
airlines flights by nonunion pilots flew on schedule 
it certainly isnt by accident commented richard boulware a 
spokesman for the airport 
eastern has said it would continue only its most profitable 
routes the shuttle between washington new york and boston and 
three round trips weekly between miami buenos aires argentina and 
santiago chile 
before the strike eastern carried 100000 passengers on 1040 
flights daily on tuesday the shuttle was running at full 
throttle with all 62 flights but not with full loads

strikecrippled eastern airlines shut down nearly all operations 
and idled at least 5000 workers monday saying it could not afford 
to maintain the 60yearold business while pilots honored a 
3dayold machinists walkout 
we can cannot run an airline with unpredictability eastern 
spokesman robin matell said in miami we cannot continue to 
inconvenience passengers we cannot afford the steady financial 
drain 
matell said eastern would continue to run only its most 
profitable routes its northeast shuttle service between 
washington new york and boston and three round trips weekly between 
miami buenos aires argentina and santiago chile 
the dramatic action in the 17month labor dispute came after 
eastern asked a federal judge in miami to order the financially 
ailing carriers 3600 pilots to stop honoring the machinists 
walkout and return to work 
the pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the 
company matell said we believe that it is an illegal weapon to 
gain the air line pilots associations economic objectives 
he said 5000 to 6000 idled nonunion employees were notified 
immediately of their nowork status and would receive lumpsum 
payments ranging from 270 to 640 depending upon their normal 
wages 
with more than 17000 workers on strike honoring picket lines or 
laid off eastern has about 7000 active employees matell said 
i just cant believe that they got away with this said a 
weeping diana goss 24 a ticket agent at miami international 
airport 
she was one of a group of nonunion employees going into a 
hastily called evening meeting with eastern managers at the 
terminal the laidoff employees were told to report back at 9 am 
tuesday to turn in their identification badges 
matell said eastern would file for bankruptcy only as a last 
resort but indicated the pilots walkout may force the airline to 
consider the option 
were not the ones who sought the strike said eastern pilots 
union head john j bavis this is a strike that mr lorenzo 
called he said referring to parent texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo whose antiunion reputation has galvanized easterns 
union employees 
the injunction request filed in miami before us district judge 
edward b davis came as pilots nationwide planned a sympathy 
jobaction starting tuesday morning that threatened to delay every 
flight on every airline 
eastern canceled almost all flights monday but had supervisors 
haul baggage and deice planes to keep its toppriority northeast 
shuttle flying some scheduled trips between new york boston and 
washington despite a snowstorm 
as of 8 pm est monday 69 flights had taken off 25 of them on 
the northeast shuttle the airline said four or five more shuttle 
flights were expected by the end of the day before the strike 
eastern averaged 1040 flights carrying 100000 people daily 
eastern pilots are honoring a strike by 8500 mechanics and ramp 
service workers that began saturday the strike has grounded most 
flights stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nations 
seventhlargest airline to the brink of collapse 
you cant fly without pilots matell said adding that 
easterns future was under hourtohour evaluation 
before the strike eastern claimed losses of more than 1 billion 
in the last decade 1 million a day and said it had 25 billion in 
debts stemming from its acquisition by texas air in february 1986 
a top creditrating agency said easterns roughly 400 million in 
cash will drain fast because the airline must pay competitors to fly 
waylaid passengers and is facing a 70 million debt repayment within 
weeks 
the strike poses a serious threat to easterns survival and 
management may choose to cease operations or seek bankruptcy 
protection if more pilots dont return to work soon standard amp 
poors corp said 
matell said about 200 pilots out of 3600 were flying but the 
pilots union put the number at 88 eastern had 85 flights saturday 
and 93 sunday the company said including three shuttle flights 
with 14 or fewer passengers eastern averaged 1040 flights daily 
before the strike 
the pilots union advised members monday to ignore an order and 
personal plea from eastern president phil bakes to return to work 
alleging threats and intimidation by management 
the company said the pilots would be classified as strikers if 
they did not return to work by noon tuesday eastern implied they 
could risk their seniority pensions and jobs 
eastern asked the federal judge for a preliminary injunction 
against the pilots union ordering them back to work and requesting 
damages a tuesday afternoon hearing was scheduled 
i think its time to face this for what it is a pilots 
strike eastern spokesman james ashlock said we waited to see 
whether this was an initial demonstration and whether they would 
come on back but now its time 
eastern said under the 1926 railway labor act the pilots must 
continue negotiating a new contract and may not strike the law says 
unions may strike only after federal mediation which the machinists 
underwent before striking 
we knew that was coming said alpa secretarytreasurer rick 
chapman adding that association attorneys would study the motion 
easterns 5900 flight attendants also have honored the strike by 
mechanics baggage handlers and ground crew eastern is seeking 150 
million in concessions while the machinists are demanding 50 
million in pay raises 
aflcio president lane kirkland urged easterns flight attendants 
and pilots to continue honoring machinist picket lines 
those three unions have stood shoulder to shoulder in an 
admirable display of solidarity kirkland said at a news 
conference in washington all of us stand ready to give you the 
support you need to see this mission completed 
federal aviation administration associate director anthony 
broderick said inspectors are monitoring eastern closely and there 
had been no safety lapses 
he said the faa is prepared to respond to the planned pilots 
action but didnt elaborate 
the national pilots union planned a teleconference for all 
members to explain the action set to begin at 6 am tuesday pilots 
would strictly follow aviation safety rules which could 
dramatically slow air traffic 
its an individual thing obviously said jim gray a delta 
airlines pilots union spokesman the captain of the plane decides 
what he wants to do but we are encouraging our pilots to observe 
the flysafe 
the international machinists union planned to appeal a federal 
judges order barring sympathy strikes on three new yorkarea 
railroads that threatened to disrupt the morning commute for more 
than 300000 people no strikerelated transit problems were 
reported in any cities 
us district judge robert patterson on monday also temporarily 
barred unionized amtrak workers from honoring any picket lines by 
eastern machinists 
in washington a white house spokesman said president bush wont 
push for a bill banning secondary picketing unless the strike 
against eastern spreads 
the chairman of a house subcommittee scheduled a hearing for 
tuesday and said he hoped for quick action on legislation to force 
bush to appoint an emergency board and halt the strike for 60 days 
bush had refused to intervene 
the sharp cuts in operations have affected thousands of easterns 
100000 daily passengers eastern said many stranded caribbean 
vacationers were back on the us mainland monday 
a morning snowfall in new york and other problems forced 
cancellation of 10 of the first 16 eastern flights on the northeast 
shuttle pan american world airways was doubling service on the same 
routes 
eastern officials in new york said employees were asked to wear 
warm clothing and boots and supervisors handled baggage deiced 
planes on the runway and worked as flight attendants to keep the 
shuttle flying 
in atlanta the rev jesse jackson donned an eastern pilots cap 
and led chanting strikers in a prayer session at continental 
airlines ticket counter lorenzo broke a 1983 strike at continental 
by filing for bankruptcy 
if lorenzo cant fly it let the workers buy it jackson said
