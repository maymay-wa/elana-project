iraqi troops rounded up 28 americans in kuwait 
on monday and some of them later were reported in baghdad the 
state department said monday night 
the americans were among more than 300 british citizens and 
other foreigners picked up by the iraqis at three hotels in kuwait 
we have reports that a dozen or so americans have arrived in 
baghdad said a state department official who spoke on condition 
that his name not be used 
the embassy is taking steps to verify these reports and get in 
contact with them 
the official said he had no immediate word on the citizens of 
other countries picked up in kuwaiti hotels or on the rest of the 
americans but this does not mean anything is wrong in view of 
the time needed to locate and identify people in the iraqi capital 
it appeared that the new arrivals were being housed in the same 
hotel where 11 american oilfield workers picked up by invading 
iraqi troops were taken this official said 
in london a british spokesman said that government believed 366 
people had been assembled mostly passengers from a british airways 
flight stranded in kuwait since the invasion by iraqi troops began 
thursday 
before reports of the location of the us citizens in baghdad 
were received in washington us officials said they did not rule 
out that the foreigners would show up in baghdad unharmed 
nonetheless they issued a warning 
we hold iraq responsible for their safety said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
its premature to call them hostages she said we dont 
know their destination 
assistant secretary of state john kelly summoned iraqi 
ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat to the state department to 
demand information about the whereabouts of the 28 
the meeting with kelly lasted less than 15 minutes after which 
the iraqi ambassador tried to evade reporters by leaving through a 
side entrance when reporters caught up with him he said i have 
no statement to make 
the safety of americans was also brought up at a meeting in 
baghdad earlier in the day when president saddam hussein summoned 
the senior us diplomat there joseph wilson 
during the twohour meeting wilson demanded that iraq respect a 
commitment given last week to protect americans said tutwiler the 
meeting apparently occurred before us officials learned of the 28 
missing americans 
tutwiler described the meeting as serious but declined to 
divulge details another official said the session was not 
terribly pleasant 
secretary of state james baker discussed the safety of us 
citizens in kuwait and iraq with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze in a 30minute telephone conversation monday 
shevardnadze whose government has announced an arms boycott of 
iraq said he was worried about soviet citizens in kuwait and iraq 
said another official 
it was the second time since the invasion that the state 
department has raised an alarm about missing americans reflecting 
the vulnerability of the estimated 3000 us citizens in kuwait 
and 500 others in iraq 
on thursday 11 american oil workers were picked up by iraqi 
troops at three oilfields in kuwait they turned up in baghdad on 
saturday and were free to leave the country once the airport 
reopens 
airports and ports in kuwait and baghdad remained closed monday 
but some americans managed to leave kuwait said tutwiler another 
state department official said the number of those who managed to 
get out was small but he declined to say how they left 
several americans managed to drive to saudi arabia late last 
week us consular officials were standing by on the saudi side of 
the border to assist anyone who comes out 
the us embassies in baghdad and kuwait have been in touch with 
most of the americans in those countries said tutwiler the state 
department is also in touch with the families of americans in the 
united states through a special hotline

president bush said monday the world is 
united to stop iraqs aggression while pentagon sources said 
us warships had moved close enough to launch air strikes 
throughout the persian gulf or even against iraqi targets 
a possible blockade against iraq was mentioned by both british 
prime minister margaret thatcher and canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney after they met separately with bush 
in a victory for bush the un security council voted 130 for 
sweeping trade and military sanctions including a ban on oil 
purchases as punishment for iraqs invasion of kuwait 
these sanctions will be enforced whatever it takes bush 
vowed 
mrs thatcher said the west would have to consider a naval 
blockade of the persian gulf if united nations sanctions against 
iraq proved ineffective 
mulroney agreed that a blockade might be necessary to make the 
sanctions stick if you look at the geography it certainly 
wouldnt hurt at all he said 
the white house said it was discussing military 
possibilities with persian gulf states to prevent iraqs saddam 
hussein from taking his conquering army into oilrich saudi arabia 
mrs thatcher said britain had ordered two additional frigates 
to join its single warship in the gulf making britain the second 
nato ally to send extra forces france earlier dispatched a frigate 
to join two french warships 
the united states also pressed a campaign to choke off iraqs 
oil exports by closing pipelines in turkey and saudi arabia 
bush refused to say what turkey and saudi arabia would do but 
said i think youll see a lot of countries now coming together 
to deny this man saddam any market at all 
defense secretary dick cheney went to the saudi city of jiddah 
to discuss security arrangements and secretary of state james a 
baker iii was ordered to go to turkey at midweek 
there was rising concern for the safety of americans 
twentyeight us citizens were among foreigners rounded up by 
iraqi troops from three hotels in kuwait and taken away by bus the 
state department said about a dozen were reported to be in 
baghdad the department said 
we hold iraq responsible for their safety state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
with anger growing about gasoline price increases at home 
members of congress set hearings for tuesday on possible 
pricegouging in reaction to the mideast situation the justice 
department said it would be looking for antitrust violations and 
would vigorously prosecute any it found 
the administration was heartened by the un vote the world 
is united against the kind of aggression that weve witnessed 
the president said 
he said the un measure gives an awful lot of muscle to 
countries and we want to see them use it against iraq 
he noted that oil is a commodity that could be cut off under the 
un measure 
mrs thatcher standing alongside bush said i cannot 
remember a time when we had the world so strongly together against 
an action as now 
nato secretary general manfred woerner also at the white house 
said this is the moment for the west to show cohesion 
determination to make it clear what cannot be accepted in this 
world and to safeguard its own security interests 
warning of dire consequences to americas economy from curtailed 
oil supplies presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was 
clearly in the national interest to stop saddam hussein 
with saddams troops massed on the border of saudi arabia 
fitzwater said the defense of saudi arabia is paramount 
bush asked if saddam had pledged not to invade saudi arabia 
said i have had no such assurances directly to me iraqi 
officials have said they will not invade saudi arabia 
bush consulted over lunch with house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash he also conferred with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney over dinner posing for pictures with mulroney bush said 
we have a lot to consult about given the naked aggression of 
iraq 
afterward mulroney told reporters if those pipelines were 
shut down and if there was a degree of appropriate interdiction 
they would have a great deal of difficulty in selling their 
product 
and if the resolution of the united nations security council 
bit the way it must bite then theyre going to have a great deal 
of difficulty in buying products that they need for their 
citizenry he said turkey deserved nato protection if necessary 
if it cut iraqs pipeline 
the nato treaty requires members to treat an attack against one 
as an attack against all and turkey is a member of nato 
defense secretary cheney after an overnight flight arrived in 
the saudi city of jidda for talks on security arrangements we 
have discussed military possibilities and our abilities with all 
the countries in the gulf fitzwater said 
from the moment the first iraqi soldier entered kuwait it has 
been clearly in the national interest to stop saddam hussein he 
said this is an overt situation his tanks are real and moving 
our response is real and moving on all the fronts diplomatic 
economic political and military 
bush also ordered baker to turkey which controls a vital 
pipeline for iraqs oil another pipeline for iraqi oil crosses 
saudi arabia 
in a display of superpower cooperation baker talked by 
telephone for 30 minutes with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze about moving quickly at the united nations for 
sanctions against iraq tutwiler said 
the state department urged all americans in kuwait and iraq to 
leave as soon as possible and said it was withdrawing all 
nonessential embassy personnel and their families from those 
countrie 
assistant secretary of state john kelly summoned iraqi 
ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat to demand information about the 
whereabouts of the missing 28 americans 
its premature to call them hostages tutwiler said we 
dont know their destination 
meanwhile iraqs saddam summoned the senior us diplomat in 
baghdad joseph wilson for a meeting that lasted several hours 
tutwiler said she said wilson raised the question of safety of the 
3000 americans in kuwait and the 500 in iraq 
the administration said there was no sign that iraqi military 
units were pulling out of kuwait 
to the contrary the iraqi military presence throughout 
kuwait including along the saudi border remains extremely large 
and threatening fitzwater said 
pentagon sources said two us aircraft carriers the uss 
independence near the persian gulf and the uss eisenhower in the 
mediterranean sea had moved within range to launch warplanes down 
the persian gulf and as far as iraqi targets 
jawboning suppliers fitzwater said it is not clear that all 
of the increases that have been reported at the consumer level are 
necessary 
nevertheless fitzwater said iraqs invasion of kuwait 
threatens regional and world stability threatens opec and could 
force severe economic consequences in the united states 
bush talked by telephone sunday night with jordans king 
hussein who has stood out in defending saddam against world 
condemnation

tarzan on television stirred a public outcry johnny carson 
led a letterwriting campaign in support of parks and 20000 
people took part 
parks went on to play host at other pageants some serious 
others silly 
former pageant director albert marks jr who died last year 
said in 1980 that he fired parks because he wanted to appeal to a 
younger generation unfamiliar with parks or little enamored of his 
rendition of the theme song

career 
he has since been host of the mrs america pageant the us man 
of the year a smalldog contest and a prettiest tugboat contest

welsh director of the miss oklahoma pageant im sure he is 
capable of doing a great job 
he and the miss america pageant were kind of synonymous 
said nate zauber director of the miss new jersey pageant this 
would be the return of a legend it would be a return to tradition 
and very welcome 
the source on the miss america board said the pageant would be 
redressing a wrong 
a lot of people were very unhappy the way he was fired said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity he said parks 
learned of his firing from the news media 
horn said parks possible return is part of an effort to do 
something special for the pageants 70th anniversary for which at 
least 26 former miss americas are returning 
he was a major contributor to the popularity of the program

yvette hernandez never votes not for mayor of 
new york not for congress not even for president but if puerto 
ricos future comes to a vote shes ready to head for the nearest 
polling place 
why shouldnt i vote im puerto rican she declares 
that this furniture saleswoman has lived in new york for 17 
years matters little she was born in puerto rico and if the 
island is to decide its future independence statehood or no 
change she wants a say 
she is not alone even as congress debates when and if to hold a 
plebiscite a parallel debate is going on in and out of the 
mainland puerto rican community should puerto ricans who left the 
island and even the descendants of those emigrants have a vote 
in its destiny 
we think of ourselves as one nation and puerto rico is never 
out of mind for us and thats a fact explains us rep jose 
serrano dbronx 
serrano himself puerto rican born has proposed an amendment to 
the plebiscite legislation that would extend the vote to anyone 
born in puerto rico or with at least one parent born on the island 
the proposal is unprecedented according to columbia university 
law professor henry p monaghan 
there is no case in which there have been people who are not 
living in a territory who are enfranchised he said 
the idea of 25 million people on the mainland taking part in 
the plebiscite doesnt sit well with everyone especially sergio 
pena clos a member of the islands senate 
theyve left the island theyve abandoned the island and now 
they want to vote said pena clos theyll be affecting my 
destiny the islands destiny and the destiny of my descendants 
serranos reply this is not an election for public office 
this is an election on status political status and that 
decision belongs to all the puerto rican people 
serranos words echo on the streets of east harlem home to many 
of new yorks 1 million puerto ricans 
this is something that is a big decision this is not like an 
election that takes place every four years said carlos de jesus 
the new yorkborn son of a woman from puerto rico because 
depending on the outcome of that vote many people here might just 
want to go back to puerto rico 
his wife carmen also born in new york wants to vote 
no matter where in the world they are now they should be 
allowed to vote its our right and no one has the right to take 
that away she said 
puerto rico in fact has not been independent since it was 
conquered by ponce de leon for spain in 1509 the island remained a 
spanish colony until the spanishamerican war of 1898 when became 
a us territory 
puerto rico became a us commonwealth in 1952 exposing its 
people to a dizzying array of contradictory rights and 
proscriptions 
puerto ricans are us citizens and are eligible for military 
service but cannot vote for president they elect their own 
governor and legislature but their representative to congress has 
no vote there federal law applies to the island but puerto ricans 
pay no federal taxes 
in a 1967 nonbinding referendum 60 percent of puerto ricans 
said they wanted to retain commonwealth status while 39 percent 
wanted statehood but recent polls indicate that a slim majority 
favors statehood 
it is not clear that they will have an opportunity to vote in 
the near future president bush who strongly backs statehood for 
puerto rico has urged congress to pass plebiscite legislation 
mandating that whatever is decided by the voters be implemented by 
1993 
in a letter to the house subcommittee considering the bill bush 
wrote how can we applaud the exciting and momentous movements 
toward freedom in eastern europe latin america and elsewhere while 
refusing to grant to our own citizens the right to 
selfdetermination 
but the chances of passing such a bill in 1990 appear slim 
action on the house version has been delayed by the illness of del 
ron de lugo dvi chairman of the interior subcommittee on 
insular and international affairs 
the bills senate counterpart which has been approved by the 
energy and commerce committee still must be considered by the 
finance agriculture and judiciary committees before it can go to 
the full body and because its an election year congress is 
hoping to adjourn earlier than usual 
still the debate about who would vote continues off the island 
and on 
rafael hernandez colon puerto ricos governor and leader of the 
procommonwealth popular democratic party has said he favors 
allowing firstgeneration puerto ricans living in the united states 
to vote in the plebiscite but believes most island residents oppose 
the idea 
and former gov carlos romero barcelo of the prostatehood new 
progressive party said any effort to determine who would be 
eligible to vote would be a logistical nightmare 
pena clos noted that puerto rico has about 35 million people 
about 21 million of whom eligible to vote 
how can 25 million people living in the united states be 
allowed to affect the future of those on the island he asked 
miguel colom who moved to new york 12 years ago agrees that he 
and others living here have no business voting on the islands 
future 
im an american thats it he said 
why should they vote if they live here theyre not affected 
by what happens there i know a lot of people who say im puerto 
rican but if they sit down and think about it theyll realize 
they were born here live here and work here why should they vote 
there 
gilberto seda was born in new york its not that i dont care 
about puerto rico i do he said and its not that i deny im 
puerto rican but my homeland is new york 
but serrano said such thinking is too narrow if this were the 
united nations this would be easy to understand that there is a 
nation of puerto ricans just as there is a nation of jews around 
the world and a nation of palestinians he insisted 
which is the same reasoning that puertorican born yvette 
hernandez the nonvoter uses in asserting her right to vote in 
a plebiscite 
i live here but im puerto rican so i should vote she 
said

the american bar association is demonstrating how 
deeply divided it is over taking a public stand on abortion and 
the future of its prochoice policy remains in doubt 
by a vote of 885836 monday members at the abas assembly 
meeting adopted a resolution that supporters say is designed to 
restore the nations largest lawyers group to a position of 
neutrality on abortion 
questions presented by a decision to terminate pregnancy are 
extremely divisive the resolution said the aba for the good 
of the association will not adopt a policy supportive of a 
particular viewpoint 
the resolution urged repeal of a proabortionrights stand 
adopted by the abas policymaking body its house of delegates 
that body will meet wednesday to decide whether it should adopt 
the recommendation and rescind its prochoice stand approved in 
february by a margin of better than 21 
aba secretaryelect anthony palermo of rochester ny sponsor 
of the repeal resolution said the narrow victory monday is a good 
sign that the aba may be ready to abandon its position 
this vote demonstrates how divisive this issue is but its 
not over yet he said palermo denied that rescinding the 
prochoice position would be a slap in the face to women in the 
organization 
sally determan of washington dc a leader of the drive to 
retain the policy favoring abortion rights said she is not 
disheartened by mondays developments 
im pleased the vote was this close she said 
if the house of delegates reaffirms its previous policy the 
assembly could reconvene and by a twothirds vote force a 
referendum by the abas 360000 members 
mondays vote was preceded by nearly two hours of debate those 
urging repeal of the prochoice stand said adoption of the 
resolution would not be interpreted as a vote against privacy 
rights for women 
but opponents of the resolution said backing away now from 
support of abortion rights would damage the groups credibility 
aba members want the right to decide and speak for themselves 
individually on abortion matters and they do not want the aba to 
adopt a policy of organization abortion advocacy palermo said 
but ms determan said a great organization should never 
recede from principle because of threats of resignations and 
financial pressure 
she said the organization has a duty to speak out on the leading 
issues of the day no matter how controversial the abas darkest 
hour was in the 1950s when it remained silent over civil rights and 
discrimination she said 
the abortion controversy has cost the aba 1500 members and 
300000 in annual fees 
the assembly vote was open to any of the 12000 association 
members attending this weeks annual convention who paid a 250 
registration fee 
the resolution adopted by the house of delegates in february 
said government should not interfere with the confidential 
relationship between a pregnant woman and her physician in 
deciding on abortions 
aba members noted that being on record on the abortion issue put 
the organization in position to express itself formally when state 
legislatures and courts consider abortion laws 
the repeal fight took on new significance with president bushs 
nomination of david h souter to the supreme court 
the aba plays a key role in evaluating the qualifications of 
high court nominees and some opponents of the abas stand have 
said the organizations role in judicial selection is now suspect 
they say the aba could appear to be biased against a nominee who 
opposes abortion 
souters views on abortion are largely unknown 
attorney general dick thornburgh who addressed the aba on 
monday told a news conference the organization would be wise to 
restore its neutrality on abortion 
its credibility will suffer if the aba takes a position on 
every hot button issue of the day he said

bf skinner the psychologist who 
popularized behavior modification is facing his approaching death 
by leukemia with no regrets a fitting end to a life he claimed was 
governed by rational rules 
skinner 86 is preparing what may be his final work a defense 
of controversial research that explored the uses of positive and 
negative reinforcement to improve human behavior 
i will be dead in a few months skinner said with a laugh 
but it hasnt given me the slightest anxiety or worry or 
anything i always knew i was going to die 
for years skinner has endured a battering by many american 
psychologists who scorned his belief that behavior could be 
engineered to make society better not everyone will accept his 
final work he said in a recent interview 
im writing a paper which is my summing up of what psychology 
is all about and attacking cognitive psychologists skinner said 
the cognitive psychologists wont like it but that doesnt 
bother me at all 
cognitive psychology emphasizes the unconscious structures of 
the human mind rules for the brains operation that cant be 
explained by conditioning 
skinners principle of operant behavior holds that even 
seemingly spontaneous action is a response to rewards and 
punishment people dont shape the world he has said the world 
shapes them 
on friday skinner is to be honored by the american 
psychological association in boston 
the appearance will be tricky the cancer has decimated 
skinners immune system and visitors to his cambridge home must 
wash their hands before meeting him 
theyre going to smuggle me up on the stage and then take me 
right back out skinner said i wont go to a reception and 
shake anyones hands 
i suppose he added with a chuckle i could show up with 
rubber gloves on 
burrhus frederic skinner bf to the world fred to his 
friends grew up in susquehanna pa and spent most of his career 
at harvard university where he applied his observations of animals 
to the motives and manipulation of human conduct he retired from 
the faculty in 1974 
skinner argued that behavioral technology could be put to 
work to create a world free of overpopulation war and pollution 
in walden two published in 1948 he described a tightly 
controlled utopia in which people are motivated by positive and 
negative reinforcements the novel was required reading for many 
college students in the 1960s and 1970s 
in walden two everyone is happy people dont know the meaning 
of envy and jealousy buildings are communally owned and everyone 
helps out with chores 
many psychologists found skinners walden to be a tyrannical 
place others said it was bland but his application of the ideas 
of the russian physiologist ivan pavlov have left an indelible 
stamp on american society 
we now know that many principles govern human behavior not 
just operant behavior but that doesnt diminish his 
importance said jerome kagan chairman of the harvard psychology 
department 
operant conditioning is used every day by parents kagan said 
every time they praise a behavior they want and punish one they 
dont want 
to his regret skinner may be best remembered for teaching 
pigeons to play pingpong using the skinner box the pigeons 
pressed buttons or levers to receive food in return for doing what 
the experimenter wanted them to do 
a life magazine photograph of the pigeons hangs in skinners 
woodpaneled study in his home nearby is a signed portrait of 
pavlov whose experiment showed dogs could be conditioned to 
salivate at the ring of a bell 
skinners frame is lean but otherwise he shows little sign of 
illness his snowwhite hair is combed back from an expansive 
forehead and his bluegray eyes sparkle when he discusses his work 
he laments the search among cognitive psychologists for an 
inner creator responsible for human behavior likening them to 
creationists who scorn darwins theory of evolution 
skinner compares the search for an inner self to the search for 
god skinner doesnt believe in god either 
and how does skinner want to be remembered 
somebody asked my daughter recently what she remembered most 
about me he says it was very strange she said i used to come 
and put her to bed and talk with her and id take her hand and 
thered be tears in my eyes 
id hate to have people say hes the man who taught pigeons to 
play pingpong

the electrical worker from czechoslovakia says 
he must have met a hundred americans in his 2 months in america 
but everyone was too busy to become real friends 
whenever he talked to the owner of the virginia publishing 
company where he interned i was seeing that the time was running 
in his head 
the young lawyer from poland bemoaned americans lack of 
knowledge about europe or even about america 
in an afterhours competition with his fellow summer clerks at a 
prestigious washington law firm he was able to name 45 states of 
the union the best any of his new harvardeducated friends could 
do was 36 or 37 
these young east europeans a translator a civil engineer a 
law professor a legal advisor to the hungarian parliament a 
polish radio and television worker and others many of them with a 
history of dissidence had been in america since midmay learning 
the ropes of capitalism and democracy 
they worked in banks in bookstores in congressional offices 
and state government chiefly in washington and north carolina 
sidebyside with american counterparts in a program run by the 
nonprofit national forum foundation recently they spent the 
morning discussing what they liked what they disliked and what 
surprised them 
piotr kochanski 28 a lawyer was the pole who outshined the 
other summer clerks at hogan amp hartson by listing 45 states and 
all the presidents of the us in the 20th century he played 
softball with the firms young lawyers but found it a boring 
game 
what dismayed him was how little americans in turn knew about 
europe they know nothing about our country our history our 
culture he said 
i was asked very funny questions many times agreed mirek 
kleber a novice polish businessman who speaks russian french and 
german and interned with a bank in lumberton nc do we have 
television in poland do we have cars 
on the other hand kochanski marveled americans can organize 
something in an hour everybody has confidence in the others 
everybody can trust one another i love it this ability for 
working together 
and he was struck by how americans can tear down a perfectly 
fine building and in two months a new beautiful building can go 
up 
we have all this history in poland he said i love this 
history but i think we can learn from your creativity your 
pragmatism this modern mentality 
i am from a city one thousand years old said beata 
kalczynskagasic a civil engineer from krakow in raleigh nc 
where she worked with the state department of transportation she 
was shown a picture of the city what struck her was that no 
building was more than 40 years old 
americans seem to be running toward the future and dont look 
back she said but she asked where is the soul in your 
cities 
kalliope bakirdzi 31 press secretary for a new political party 
in hungary the alliance of free democrats worked in the office of 
the lieutenant governor of north carolina and observed the 
democratic senate primary campaign 
she liked the civility of american politics the acceptance of 
compromise 
whatever you are republican or democrat you know there 
will always be republicans and democrats and you have to get along 
with the other side she said 
in hungary she said we hate each other much more than is 
needed for normal political life 
she was impressed too that american politicians can spend 80 
percent of their time talking to meeting dealing with the voters 
our politicians never cared about the people she said 
but she was puzzled by the fuss over flagburning in this 
country 
recalling a television news report she said she was a little 
shocked how they allowed the ku klux klan to march but they try to 
ban burning the flag if you burn a flag you dont hurt anybody 
but the ku klux klan can hurt people 
daria golebiowska 22 advertising director for a warsaw fashion 
house interned at roll call a capitol hill newspaper she liked 
the way people assumed responsibility without direction 
everybodys working away she said describing a newsrooms 
chaos everything seems to be so loose people are coming in and 
out and talking on the telephone and suddenly a newspaper comes

this land of immigrants opened its 
doors wide after world war ii but now the welcome on the mat 
has begun to fade 
most australians seem to feel they should continue showing 
compassion for refugees but resentment is increasing particularly 
toward asians 
demonstrators protest large japanese purchases of prime real 
estate arriving boatloads of vietnamese and cambodian refugees 
raise fears of an uncontrollable flood from southeast asia 
several whitesupremacist groups have sprung up six members of 
the australian nationalists movement are to face trial this year 
for allegedly trying to drive asians out with a terror campaign 
advocates of immigration say it generally has been positive for 
australia they say most immigrants are young with needed skills 
and initiative and provide new perspectives 
critics contend immigrants exacerbate pollution unemployment 
housing and other problems 
they also claim there is a trend away from assimilation some 
city neighborhoods like cabramatta a vietnamese district of 
sydney have become virtual ethnic enclaves 
a government decision allowing chinese students afraid to go 
home after the prodemocracy movement was crushed to stay in 
australia at least four years added to the immigration debate 
no one was happy the students wanted permanentresident status 
and other ethnic groups complained about an accompanying reduction 
in their quotas 
the australian a national daily newspaper said the decision 
demonstrated the lack of a coherent immigration policy and 
described the government rules as a camel of a policy a camel 
being a horse designed by committee 
australias combination of large size and relatively small 
population makes it appear ideal for growth the land area of 
3073000 square miles is roughly equal to the contiguous united 
states but australia has only 17 million people about 
onefifteenth the us total 
environmentalists say that unless the desert can be made to 
bloom it is more appropriate to compare australia to canada with 
its vast areas of nearly unusable tundra 
much of australias population is in the coastal cities and 
immigrants tend to settle there nearly half the people live in the 
sydney and melbourne areas and projections indicate rapid growth 
will continue 
sydneys state new south wales received 65000 immigrants last 
year nearly triple the number in 1984 
nearly 40 percent of the immigrants live in sydney at least 
initially that has led to housing shortages and suburban expansion 
that puts a greater burden on public transportation 
supporters of high immigration levels say foreigners are being 
used as scapegoats by politicians unwilling to to make unpopular 
expensive decisions about housing and public services 
australians have been spoiled by a relative abundance of raw 
materials they say and now are starting to pay the price 
since the end of world war ii the population has increased by 
150 percent as part of a growth policy designed in part to make 
australia less susceptible to attack 
about 500000 of the new residents were refugees and australia 
gained a reputation as a haven for the homeless it still takes 
more refugees per capita than any other main resettlement country 
but the strains have begun to show 
we are the last country to regard ourselves as the first 
asylum country for refugees and its about time we changed our 
view of ourselves luke hardy executive director of the refugee 
council of australia said recently 
australia has tried to bathe in the luxury of going abroad to 
select refugees from camps and then bringing them here under fixed 
quotas every year hardy said 
we cant just pretend we can go and find our own refugees we 
have to deal maturely and compassionately and methodically with 
refugees claiming asylum on our shores and in our cities 
the refugee issue has led to friction with neighboring 
countries particularly indonesia many boat people stop there en 
route to australia often because their boats are unsafe and end 
up in refugee camps 
nearly 15000 vietnamese are housed in one camp on galang an 
indonesian island south of singapore and the number of cambodian 
refugees also is increasing

as a peace broker who had put his countrys 
weight and his personal standing on the line president hosni 
mubarak was deeply embarrassed by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
after iraqi president saddam hussein aired his grievances 
against kuwait last month mubarak traveled to the capitals of 
iraq kuwait and saudi arabia on a single day in peacemaking 
efforts 
he returned home apparently heartened by what he called iraqi 
assurances of peaceful intentions he proudly told reporters july 
25 that iraq and kuwait would stop their war of words and hold 
direct talks to settle their differences over oil and land 
the talks collapsed after the first round of talks in jiddah 
saudi arabia on aug 1 the iraqis invaded kuwait the next day 
the invasion undoubtedly was a letdown for mubarak who said he 
had personal assurances from saddam that he would not resort to 
arms diplomats in cairo said they had no doubt mubarak was telling 
the truth and that saddam lied 
ibrahim nafei editor of the leading newspaper alahram and 
known to be close to mubarak wrote with the first shot fired at 
kuwait mubarak could have come out and laid bare before the arab 
people many shameful positions by iraq but he preferred caution 
and wanted the fire put out before it got out of hand 
he described mubaraks feeling upon hearing of the invasion as 
very painful grief 
mubarak himself a courteous man who shuns scathing words 
rejected a reporters suggestion saturday that the invasion was a 
stab in the back to him 
he indicated he may have been deceived by iraqi leaders but 
with his military background he said he understood why iraqi 
leaders hid their invasion plans 
really i was very upset mubarak said but i cant say it 
is a stab in the back if anybody is planning to make an invasion 
he will never say so exactly otherwise he is going to spoil 
everything 
but he was adamant on three things iraq must withdraw from 
kuwait the kuwaiti ruler sheik jaber alahmed alsabah must be 
reinstated and the two countries must agree on ways to settle the 
conflict peacefully 
he spoke the day after his foreign ministry issued a statement 
censuring the invasion and making the same demands 
the statement came 24 hours after the invasion and the interim 
silence from cairo caused surprise mubarak rejected a reporters 
suggestion this was because egypt was afraid of saddams wrath 
we could easily have given a very nervous statement right away 
after the invasion but we had to understand all the reasons and 
make some effort he said still the efforts are going on 
underlying cairos caution was a sense of being torn between two 
close friends 
egypts predicament was summed up by columnist anis mansour in 
the newspaper alahram 
president saddam took an entire nation hostage he wrote 
the arab countries stood confused and at a loss torn between the 
murderer brother iraq and the murdered brother kuwait what is 
our right hand going to do with our left hand which has slapped us 
on both cheeks and on the back of the neck too 
the invasion has not deflected mubarak from pursuing his drive 
to settle the iraqkuwait conflict peacefully he wants this done 
strictly within the arab family 
arab leaders are capable of finding a solution to this problem 
without any foreign intervention at all he told reporters on 
saturday we are doing our maximum and arab efforts must 
succeed

a gang of thieves preying on foreign 
tourists at the central train station engaged police in a running 
battle and succeeded in freeing a colleague already under arrest a 
newspaper reported 
the same gang is suspected of beating and slashing the husband 
of an american peace corps worker july 30 as his family looked on 
the incidents reflect the skyrocketing crime rate in poland in 
the year since the communists lost power partly because of the 
hard economic times connected with the new solidarityled 
governments economic reform program 
the police force is being restructured and crimefighting units 
in general are understaffed underfunded and demoralized 
gazeta wyborcza polands largest daily reported monday that 
thieves rescued their handcuffed compatriot at about 6 am sunday 
as he was being led away by two police officers 
later that morning about 50 officers were confronted on an 
empty platform by 20 gang members who challenged them to fight 
they charged the police and escaped 
the days final confrontation took place in the afternoon in a 
nearby underground passage gazeta wyborcza said fifteen officers 
closed in on the thieves who responded by shooting tear gas 
pistols throwing stones and swinging boards broken off from 
benches 
only one of the suspected gang members was apprehended police 
maj wojciech kinowski told the associated press on monday 
police were armed with guns clubs and spray cans of a macelike 
irritant but could not fire their pistols in the crowded station 
he said 
on july 30 john zukowskifaust was attacked at the station 
before boarding a train with his wife jean zukowskafaust 
associate director for education of the us peace corps in poland 
and their two teenage children 
zukowskifaust was sprayed with tear gas cut in the face with a 
knife and had his leg broken in two places he is hospitalized in 
london said peace corps spokeswoman hanna grzedzicka on monday 
the gang working the train station watches for foreign tourists 
and either assaults and robs them or uses other ruses such as 
creating a distraction while a colleague picks their pockets 
kinowski said police were not giving up but will strengthen 
our efforts to catch the gang

us officials are concerned about the safety 
of 14 to 15 foreigners including one american who were kidnapped 
from a monrovia hotel by liberian rebel troops and taken to an 
insurgent headquarters 
the action appeared to be part of a campaign by prince johnson 
the leader of one liberian rebel faction to provoke international 
intervention in liberias civil war by seizing foreigners 
he believes that such intervention will help topple the 10year 
rule of president samuel k doe 
the kidnapping occurred at the hotel africa on monday two days 
after johnson issued his warning the captives were taken to 
johnsons headquarters in the town of caldwell 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the us 
embassy reported to the state department late monday liberia time 
that johnsons forces have seized hostages 
she said there was no indication that any of the captives had 
been harmed no information on the identity of the american was 
available except that he was in monrovia as a private citizen 
despite johnsons appeals for foreign intervention the bush 
administration has adopted a handsoff policy and has called 
repeatedly for a diplomatic solution 
the insurgency against doe is now in its eighth month and has 
left the capital without public water electricity or telephone 
service food shortages have intensified 
us officials said they were worried that johnson may resort to 
even more extreme measures if the kidnappings do not provoke 
foreign intervention one concern is that his forces may launch 
attacks on foreign embassies 
the administration has been increasingly troubled by events in 
liberia since last week when government forces murdered hundreds of 
civilians who had sought sanctuary at a monrovia church 
after johnson issued his warning about kidnapping foreigners 
president bush ordered the partial evacuation of foreigners among 
the first group to be evacuated were 62 americans and 12 other 
foreigners 
us marines operating from a flotilla of vessels offshore 
evacuated an additional 20 people from liberia on monday including 
six americans and 14 other foreigners ms tutwiler said 
the maneuver codenamed sharp edge was launched from four 
warships stationed in international waters off liberia since early 
june 
the united states has made a standing offer to help doe leave 
the country but he has shown no interest in accepting it 
us officials said they also understood that nigeria and 
perhaps other countries in west africa were planning to evacuate 
citizens stranded in liberia 
they said between 1200 and 1600 nigerians have been camped out 
at the nigerian embassy compound and some are in dire 
circumstances 
there also have been reports that nigeria may attempt to send 
troops to liberia in an effort to stop the fighting and set up an 
interim government nigeria has been working closely on the 
liberian issue with other countries from the economic community of 
west african states 
community members include nigeria ghana guinea sierra leone 
togo and liberia

a naval blockade of iraq would succeed in 
choking off most of saddam husseins oil exports and food imports 
experts say but it carries the danger of drawing hostile fire from 
the trapped iraqis 
a blockade is on the bush administrations list of options to 
punish iraq for its invasion last week of neighboring kuwait to be 
fully successful the allies would need help from turkey and 
possibly jordan to close off all trade to iraq 
but a naval blockade a tactic last used by the united states 
during the 1962 cuban missile crisis would not be without risk of 
bloodshed iraq has frenchmade exocet missiles which proved 
deadly in iraqs attack against the uss stark in 1987 and when used 
by argentina against british ships in the falklands war 
any lengthy blockade likely would have the undesired effect of 
driving up world oil prices hurting the united states and other 
western economies that could give saddam a small victory even if 
he was ultimate missiles instead of one 
they would have a significant aerial capability to counter the 
blockade but their successes would be limited if we have three 
carriers in the vicinity blackwell said well dominate the 
air over the seas and limit what the iraqis could do 
but blackwell and others including a state department analyst 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity said a successful economic 
blockade would hinge on preventing iraq from exporting oil through 
landbased pipelines and from importing food through its neighbors 
iraq pipes oil across turkey and turkish president turgut ozal 
promised monday to go along with a united nations trade embargo 
against iraq 
according to cia data iraq imports about 13 billion in goods a 
year with turkey its no 1 trading partner other iraqi trading 
partners include the united states britain france west germany 
japan the soviet union and italy 
it was a fourday blockade of cuba in october 1962 that brought 
the missile crisis to an end president kennedy warned the soviet 
union that its ships would be boarded and inspected and none 
carrying weapons tried to cross through the us ships moscow 
ultimately agreed to withdraw its missiles from cuba in exchange 
for a us promise not to invade 
the us navy has not attempted a blockade since then although 
such actions were considered against north vietnam against cuba 
again during president reagans first term because of arms 
shipments in central america and as recently as last january to 
block cocaine shipments from colombia 
six british ships were lost and 10 others damaged during the 
blockade of the falklands in 1982 but the blockade prevented food 
fuel and other supplies from reaching argentine troops

the concert was called blowin in from 
chicago and it starred two tenor saxophonists born in the windy 
city johnny griffin 62 and von freeman 67 
monday evenings classical jazz at lincoln center concert 
was rooted in bebop once considered too intellectual for mass 
listeners now become mainstream jazz 
it proved that tunes composed by griffin and freeman not often 
heard are as enjoyable as standards more enjoyable than some 
overtired standards when played as well as their quartets played 
them 
both men spoke entertainingly while staying relaxed both sets 
had variety of mood including excitement never pushed to hysteria 
alice tully hall held strong fans of the two musicians who 
arent often heard here freeman and his pianist john young usually 
play in chicago on monday ron carter played bass and billy 
higgins played drums with them 
griffins tight quartet included michael weiss piano dennis 
irwin bass and kenny washington drums 
griffin who lives in europe played first he began with 
thelonious monks evidence played his own chicago calling 
which swings lightly he told a tale of a woman leaving him and 
taking all his money making it funny said he heard three sad 
notes in my minds ear and wrote woe is me 
the tune was a sweet remote memory of melancholy rather than 
anger or pain the quartet cooked on hot sake and did an encore 
which griffin called a cross between honky tonk and blues with 
strange changes 
freemans rhythm section played with inventive interaction they 
played after dark he said although we about wore that one 
out for his son tenor saxophonist chico freeman whom he later 
introduced 
then saying i usually heat things up before i get into this 
but i feel like playing it the quartet played the melodic lost 
in the fog griffin joined them for the final two numbers in 
which the two saxophonists played in unison and traded solos 
building and driving but staying loose they also traded 
compliments and the audience gave them a standing ovation

spurred by a series of violent crimes mayor 
david dinkins announced plans to take back our streets by 
hiring 1058 more police officers most of them to walk the beat 
dinkins on monday said he scraped scratched and squeezed 
24 million out of the citys 278 billion budget to pay for the 
additions to the 26000member force 
the mayor said he wants to change the image people have that 
they are not safe in our town 
among recent events that have put dinkins under pressure have 
been the slayings of four children by stray bullets and the 
killings of an advertising executive making a call from a pay phone 
and a 14yearold shot over a moped 
in addition 19 cab drivers have been killed this year 
on monday a sleeping baby was wounded by a bullet that went 
through the wall of his apartment the bullet cracked his skull but 
didnt penetrate his brain said judy murphy spokeswoman for st 
lukes hospital police had no suspects 
we will take back our streets by night as well as by day 
because a safe new york at peace and free of fear is the legacy 
we intend to leave our children dinkins said 
the mayors proposal will be presented to the city council on 
wednesday for approval 
we think that this is not only the right direction to go but 
what the people of the city expect said city council speaker 
peter f vallone 
most of the new officers would walk beats dinkins said the 
police force now includes 10 community patrol officers in each of 
the 75 precincts 
last month more than 1100 officers were shifted from 
specialized units into seven highcrime precincts an additional 
200 senior officers were assigned to overtime duty in operation

the african national congress 
29year guerrilla campaign intended to force the white minority 
government to negotiate with the black majority and end apartheid 
it was never designed to topple the vast power of the white 
state and it never came close 
the anc military wing never engaged in a battle with the south 
african army and seldom attacked any fortified or military 
installation 
the anc camps in neighboring countries could not fight off south 
african defense force raids which were mounted with helicopters 
and bombers 
but hundreds of civilians policemen guerrillas and soldiers 
were killed and injured in bombings grenade attacks police raids 
and in township shootouts during an anc urban bombing campaign 
from 1984 to 1989 37 people were killed and 680 injured 
early today anc deputy president nelson mandela announced the 
cessation of all armed action by the guerrilla organization he 
helped found in 1961 
during his 1964 trial on charges of sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the government mandela said that ancs armed wing spear 
of the nation was to perform sabotage and strict instructions 
were given to its members right from the start that on no account 
were they to injure or kill people 
when he was released from prison in february and asked about 
the civilian casualties from the urban bombs mandela replied that 
the country was at war and civilians sometimes were killed in the 
crossfire 
mandelas changed attitude reflected the different goals the 
military wing commanders had been given by the anc leadership 
during mandelas 27 years in prison the first fatal bombing for 
which the anc claimed responsibility occurred a few months after 
mandela was sentenced to life in prison 
mandela had said in 1964 that planned destruction of power 
plants and interference with rail and telephone communications 
would scare away foreign capital and make it more difficult for 
goods from the industrial areas to reach the seaports on schedule 
mandela and the other early guerrilla commanders hoped economic 
disruption would cause whites to reconsider their support of 
apartheid 
in 1988 after a series of bombs in shopping malls and 
restaurants anc commander chris hani explained the new spear of 
the nation reasoning we want to make apartheid costly and very 
painful and bitter for whites 
anc leaders suggested that frightened whites would turn against 
their leaders and force them to negotiate with the anc 
but even such as helen suzman a member of parliament for the 
antiapartheid progressive federal party noted no sign of any 
fear or trepidation as a result she said the anc had 
underestimated the determination of the white minority to stay in 
power and the ferocity of the reprisals the government would 
take 
security police bragged that they had informers at the highest 
levels of the anc and the government arrested scores of 
guerrillas many of whom were hanged there were several cases of 
guerrillas blowing themselves up 
many also died in police custody 
each new bomb brought a vow from former president pw botha 
that he would never negotiate with terrorists the last major 
bombing attributable to the anc occurred in august 1989 after 
president f w de klerk had come to power 
he reversed bothas policy by legalizing the anc and freeing 
mandela before they met the longstanding government demand to 
renounce violence 
anc leaders other than spear of the nation commanders were often 
ambivalent about their support of and reasons for bombings and 
grenade attacks 
the exiled leadership in lusaka zambia rarely acknowledged 
that any bombing had been committed by umkhonto we sizwe 
they often said the guerrillas were operating across the border 
and underground and couldnt be kept track of 
they said some bombs such as one that exploded in a bar 
frequented only by blacks may have been left by untrained 
activists they also said the police caused some explosions

rising consumer food prices are set to make 
news again with or without the mideast war jitters and threats of 
inflation agriculture department analysts say 
the freezing weather that ripped into texas and florida last 
christmas boosted fruit and vegetable prices more than anyone in 
usda had anticipated says denis dunham of the departments 
economic research service 
by itself the freeze damage was enough to drive up overall food 
prices sharply in the first three months of 1990 
vegetable prices came down later as more production came into 
line but fruit prices are still high and will continue that way 
until the new crop is ready 
last fall usda forecast 1990 food prices on the average would 
rise 3 percent to 5 percent during the year but that was before 
the december freeze 
further dunham said monday in a telephone interview livestock 
and dairy prices are up particularly hogs and milk that has put 
more upward pressure on retail prices this year 
we started off thinking commodity prices would be pretty flat 
this year dunham said but hogs and milk are higher than we 
thought and cattle gained a bit more too 
retail food prices gained 58 percent in 1989 on the average 
the most since 1981 this years increase is expected to be even 
sharper although usda wont announce the new forecast until aug 
17 
some analysts have said however that a revised forecast of 6 
percent to 8 percent is in the works while other have speculated 
that an increase of 8 percent to 10 percent may be more like it 
while dunham and other agency economists attribute the sharper 
increase on higher prices at the farm gate they also concede 
quickly that the farm price of most raw commodities is a fraction 
of what consumers pay at retail 
farm prices are very volatile and can swing widely in a 
short time dunham said but the marketing spread of prices 
between farmers and consumers creeps higher each year 
the spread includes the costs of transportation processing 
packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm 
while the farm price is going up and down that spread is just 
persistently going up and contributing all the time to that 
increase in retail prices dunham said 
farmers and their advocates frequently quote usda market 
basket figures showing how little producers realize from consumer 
food dollars 
in 1989 dunham said the farm value of a marketbasket of foods 
sold at grocery stores represented 30 cents of each 1 spent by 
consumers for food unchanged from 1987 and 1988 
the 30cent farm share of the food dollar also was the lowest 
since 1950 according to usda and dunham said it probably will be 
about the same in 1990

prospects of large soybean crops in brazil and 
other southern hemisphere countries probably made us farmers 
leery about expanding bean acreages this year says a agriculture 
department report 
in march a planting survey showed farmers would cut the us 
soybean acreage by 2 percent from last year the departments 
economic research service said in the august issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine but the most recent estimate puts the 1990 
acreage down 4 percent 
the weather also was a big factor the report said over the 
entire united states may was the sixth wettest since 1895 
rainfall was especially heavy during the second quarter in 
arkansas idaho iowa massachusetts missouri and oklahoma 
in sharp contrast some durum wheat growers and north dakota 
and montana are experiencing their third consecutive year of 
abnormally dry weather the report said 
many thought the heavy rainfall would cause farmers to switch 
from corn to sorghum or soybeans which are less vulnerable to 
midsummer heat also soybeans mature faster than corn 
but the weather improved in the first two weeks of june and 
many farmers got their corn into the ground quickly the report 
said farmers decisions to proceed with late corn were 
apparently based on expectations of strengthening corn prices and 
weakening soybean prices relative to benefits from the corn 
program 
ironically the report added decisions to hold back on soybean 
plantings have now pushed up soybean futures prices

agriculture department scientists say lowfat 
hamburgers can be made tender and juicy by adding potato starch 
potato starch gel is now used as a thickener in salad dressings 
when mixed with the meat the gel helps bind the water to the meat 
burgers containing the additive actually cook faster than pure 
beef said the departments agricultural research service the 
faster cooking and increased moisture retention created cooked 
patties with 45 percent less fat than cooked allbeef burgers

sales of existing homes slipped 05 percent in 
the second quarter from a year ago as psychological paralysis 
gripped homebuyers a real estate trade group reported today 
the national association of realtors said resales of 
singlefamily homes town houses apartment condominiums and 
cooperatives totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 368 
million compared with 370 million units during the same period in 
1989 
the secondquarter resale statistics reflect a slightly 
stalled housing market caused in small part by regional economic 
downturns and in large part by a psychological paralysis that has 
gripped consumers said realtors president norman d flynn 
the credit crunch which primarily has affected builders has 
stirred fear on the part of homebuyers he added also there 
has been a perception this year which is totally unfounded that 
we are on the brink of a national housing recession 
but flynn said when mortgage interest rates began falling in 
may buyers resumed house hunting particularly in areas with 
relatively affordable prices 
people have started jumping in where the waters not too 
deep he said 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp the average 
cost of a fixedrate 30year mortgage was 1067 percent during the 
first week in may and dropped to 1015 percent by the end of june 
the realtors survey also found the median price of an existing 
home ranging from 345000 in honolulu to 45100 in youngstown 
ohio the median price means half of the homes cost more and half 
less 
californias highcost markets remained among the most 
expensive however san francisco with a 263600 price 
anaheimsanta ana 248900 and los angeles 216900 ranked 
second third and fourth respectively 
but overall prices in the west declined 08 percent to 
138300 while they rose 58 percent in the midwest to 75000 
the median price rose 15 percent to 86200 in the south but fell 
16 percent to 143500 in the northeast 
the us median price was 96200 a 34 percent increase 
by region sales fell by 145 percent to 650000 units at an 
annual rate in the northeast and 31 percent to 620000 units in 
the west sales gained 44 percent to 141 million units in the 
south and 42 percent to 990000 units in the midwest

saddam husseins vow to defeat any challenge 
of his stranglehold on kuwait carries an implied threat to use 
chemical weapons american experts say after all hes used them 
before even on his own countrymen 
the experts interviewed monday said they saw little reason for 
the iraqi president to resort to using mustard gas and other 
elements of his chemical arsenal but they said president bush in 
contemplating military action to force iraq out of kuwait would 
have to consider the possibility of a chemical response 
the iraqis have used chemical weapons before and have 
threatened to use them again therefore it would be perilous in any 
military plan not to consider the possibility again said brian 
jenkins a terrorism expert at kroll associates a consulting firm 
in los angeles 
elisa harris a chemical weapons specialist at the brookings 
institution a washingtonbased think tank said there are no 
reliable estimates of the size of iraqs chemical arsenal but 
theres no doubt that it is substantial she said 
iraq is probably the most powerful chemical country in the 
region she said 
frank gaffney a former pentagon official and now director of 
the center for security policy a private research firm said he 
believed it likely that saddam would use chemical weapons if he 
attacked saudi arabia and met stiff resistance 
they have about as good an understanding of the military use 
of chemicals as anyone in the world gaffney said 
israeli media reported sunday that the israeli army was stepping 
up its distribution of gas masks to civilians in response to the 
invasion of kuwait israel is not directly involved in the 
conflict but last spring saddam threatened to scorch half of 
israel with poison gas if israel attacked iraq with nuclear arms 
the use of chemical weapons is outlawed by the 1925 geneva 
protocol but iraq repeatedly demonstrated during its eightyear 
war against iran that it is willing to use its arsenal which is 
believed to include mustard gas and other nerve agents 
in march 1988 the iraqi military used poison gas in attacking 
halabja an iraqi village in the kurdish section of the country 
after the town was captured by iranian forces doctors who treated 
survivors said mustard gas cyanide gas and other nerve agents were 
used causing burns to skin eyes and lungs 
in response to a worldwide condemnation of its invasion iraq 
warned other countries not to come to kuwaits aid baghdad radio 
said iraqi armed forces would make kuwait a graveyard for those 
who launch any aggression 
on saturday in washington the iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq 
mashat said without mentioning the united states by name that any 
attempt by outside nations to try to restore the kuwaiti royal 
family to power will be thoroughly dealt with 
bush has not ruled out using military force against iraq the 
president has all but committed himself to deploying us troops to 
the arabian peninsula in the event of an iraqi attack on saudi 
arabia the most important american ally in the region and supplier 
of 15 percent of us oil imports 
bush said at a joint press conference with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher last thursday that he agreed with mrs 
thatchers statement that iraqs chemical capability does not limit 
western military options against iraq 
you cannot have a situation where one country marches in and 
takes over another country which is a member of the united 
nations mrs thatcher said i dont think the particular 
weapons they have affects that fundamental position

sen howard m metzenbaum dohio says he 
thinks a subcommittee he chairs has established the legal basis to 
overturn a 1988 savings and loan bailout he describes as very 
sweet 
arizona insurance executive james m fail acknowledged on monday 
there were inaccuracies and omissions in disclosure statements he 
signed before acquiring 15 failed thrifts now operating under the 
name bluebonnet savings bank dallas 
one of the penalties for improper disclosure is removal as sampl 
owner 
i believe there is enough to reopen and renegotiate the 
contract the real issue is can we save the taxpayers millions and 
possibly billions of dollars i believe the answer is yes 
metzenbaum told reporters after an allday session of his judiciary 
subcommittee on antitrust 
fail acknowledged omissions in documents filed initially with 
the federal home loan bank board concerning fraud allegations 
leveled against him in 1976 in alabama however he said that 
before the bailout deal was signed on dec 22 1988 he fully 
disclosed the relevant details 
former senior regulators who testified to the subcommittee 
previously said they did not know all of the details of the fraud 
allegations and that if they had fail would have been disqualified 
metzenbaum said the bluebonnet deal and other bailouts completed 
in a headlong rush at the end of 1988 were very sweet 
virtually assuring sampl acquirers a profit from generous government 
subsidies 
the regulators couldnt possibly have known what they were 
doing in the hustle and bustle he said 
in the bluebonnet transaction metzenbaum is scrutinizing the 
role of gop lobbyist robert thompson who represented fail in 
negotiations with regulators thompson was an aide to president 
bush when he served as vice president 
thompson who had been fighting the panels subpoena appeared 
briefly at the hearing delivered documents and read a prepared 
statement he is scheduled to be questioned by the panel sept 11 
the lobbyist continues to dispute the subcommittees 
jurisdiction but said i do not want to give any one any excuse 
to say that my absence from these proceedings indicates i have 
something to hide 
thompson said his representation of fail followed all rules of 
propriety and not one word has been uttered not one fact has 
been disclosed that suggests i did anything improper 
he said he was promised 2 percent of fails profits in the deal 
but has received nothing because bluebonnet has yet to pay a stock 
dividend fail disputes him saying he knew that would be an 
improper arrangement under federal regulations 
in the alabama case fail was indicted on fraud charges which 
were subsequently dismissed and a company he controlled united 
security holding co pleaded guilty to fraud and paid a 5000 
fine as part of the settlement fail agreed not to conduct 
insurance business in alabama 
fail said he reported the details in a dec 18 letter to thomas 
lykos then in charge of the bank boards bailout program in the 
southwest fail said that on dec 19 he sent an attorney to new 
york to further discuss the case with regulators 
we went out of our way to see that it was disclosed he 
said adding that hiding the incident would be like trying to 
slip an elephant into a girls dormitory 
however sens arlen specter rpa and orrin hatch rutah 
complained that the disclosures were confusing made at the last 
minute and buried in fine print 
you didnt put in the part that made you look bad specter 
added 
fail acknowledged that he had signed the original incomplete 
disclosure documents but said they had been prepared by his staff 
and he did not read them closely he also admitted he did not 
disclose civil suits that were connected to the alabama criminal 
indictment 
i had a very bad habit in the past which i can assure you i 
will not have in the future of signing a great many things which 
are placed before me fail said 
mondays session was the third held by the metzenbaum panel 
just before fail took his place at the witness table thomas k 
pennington former president of an insurance company controlled by 
fail said fail and a top aide harry carneal believed they 
couldnt lose in the bluebonnet bailout 
they felt it was a nobrainer that theyd have to be awful 
stupid not to make money pennington said

iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat said 
recently his priority was reversing a tide of unflattering press 
reports about his country iraqs invasion of kuwait is 
definitely setting things back 
everything has to be suspended put on hold until the place 
settles down said ron cathell executive director of the 
national council on usarab relations his group sponsors 
frequents visits to iraq for educators members of congress and 
other policymakers 
such efforts at usiraq business government and cultural ties 
were cut off by iraq president saddam husseins overthrow of 
kuwait and a spokesman for one usiraq group says the small 
iraqi community in the united states is on the defensive 
iraq had tried to polish its image in this country since 
diplomatic ties resumed five years ago but even before the 
invasion the state department had been weighing whether to place 
iraq on the list of countries that support terrorism 
despite almashats earlier comments to dossier magazine about 
building better iraqus ties he has declined repeated requests 
for interviews since last thursdays invasion 
he invited reporters to the iraq embassy twice since thursday 
but has declined to answer extensive questions on monday he tried 
to evade reporters at the state department after assistant 
secretary of state john kelly summoned him to ask about the fate of 
americans in kuwait 
faisal arabo head of the iraqiamerican foundation a 
detroitbased group that tries to promote understanding and good 
will between americans and iraqis conceded were doing a lousy 
job 
arabo who produces a television program titled arab voice 
said there are about 200000 iraqiamericans in the united states 
including about 70000 in the detroit area many of them are upset 
by world developments he said 
the iraqis are somehow starting to think they cant speak 
their mind he said we hate to see this relationship with 
strife 
personal relations between iraqis and americans generally have 
been friendly and cordial despite the diplomatic strains he said 
iraqis have never harbored strong antiamerican sentiments of the 
kind that developed among shiite moslem religious fanatics in 
neighboring iran 
arabo estimated there are several hundred iraqi students 
studying in the united states 
duke austin a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service said the agency was working to develop an official head 
count although no official action has been taken against the 
students 
more serious to some was president bushs cutoff of commercial 
relations between the two countries following the invasion 
the executive order has stopped all business said marshall 
wiley head of the usiraq business forum a group that 
represents american companies seeking to do business in the 
oilrich country 
wiley said the forum supported by about 70 duespaying american 
companies is trying to help them avoid serious financial losses as 
a result of the order 
for instance the forum wants to find out what happens to iraqi 
oil that has been purchased by americans but remains on the high 
seas in tankers wiley said he cant predict whether his group will 
disband after some of those problems are resolved 
the commerce department estimated that in 1989 iraq bought 
goods worth 11 billion from the united states mostly food by 
comparison the united states purchased about 24 billion from 
iraq mostly oil 
few iraqi businessmen are based in the united states because 
most trade is through iraqs government he said 
wiley said his biggest concern was that the bush 
administrations steps to punish saddam might backfire making him 
a hero in the eyes of other arab states and spawning deepseated 
bad feelings towards the united states 
if that is the case american businesses could find themselves 
shut out of expanding opportunities in iraq and other arab 
countries he said 
in addition wiley said he doubted that a broad sanctions 
program orchestrated by the united states would work other 
countries will start cheating but we wont he said

benazir bhutto rose to power with the 
blessings of pakistans powerful army generals some say she fell 
that way too 
after 20 months in office president ghulam ishaq khan abruptly 
dismissed ms bhuttos government on monday citing corruption and 
failure to control ethnic violence in the prime ministers home 
province of sindh 
although 11 years of military rule ended on aug 17 1988 the 
army still casts a long shadow on pakistans infant democracy and 
most politicians diplomats and political analysts say ishaq khan 
would not have dismissed ms bhuttos government without the 
militarys consent 
most who attended the swearingin ceremony of mustafa jatoi as 
head of the caretaker government were pakistans most powerful 
military men the army chief of staff the joint chief of staff 
the air force and naval chiefs of staff and the corps commanders 
immediately after the presidents announcement soldiers were 
deployed throughout the federal capital and took control of the 
state television network and the telephone and telex exchanges 
cutting off foreign circuits 
the army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg insisted the 
military was only trying to maintain peace not take power 
we are not involved in politics we have never been involved 
in politics we are not going to get involved in politics beg 
said before the swearingin ceremony 
the relationship between ms bhutto and the army which has 
ruled pakistan for 25 of its 43year history has never been 
smooth but it went into a nosedive in late may 
from prison and then from exile in england ms bhutto spent a 
decade fighting gen mohammad zia ulhaq who overthrew her father 
in a 1977 coup and ordered him hanged two years later but she was 
forced to call out the army when ethnic violence flared anew in 
sindh and claimed more than 400 lives 
the army blamed members of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party 
for the violence and demanded sweeping powers to maintain order and 
to arrest try and convict troublemakers 
ms bhutto refused setting an army that never became accustomed 
to being out of power on an apparent collision course with a 
government that never seemed to get used to having it 
the 37yearold ms bhutto educated at harvard and oxford was 
one of the best political stories of the 1980s 
when zia died in a mysterious plane crash on aug 17 1988 
clearing the way for the first democratic elections in a decade 
ms bhutto led her party to victory she became the first woman to 
lead a modern moslem nation 
but in order to gain the job she wanted ms bhutto had to make 
certain concessions to the military including handsoff on foreign 
policy particularly in afghanistan and defense spending she 
agreed 
benazir bhutto was created from the rib of aslam beg and she 
fell from the rib of aslam beg one diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity 
senior cabinet members had repeatedly accused the army of trying 
to destablize her democratically elected government 
army officers on the other hand did not hide their contempt 
for ms bhuttos party accusing members of blatant corruption and 
involvement in criminal activity 
a meeting last month between ms bhutto and beg failed to 
resolve their differences 
against begs advice ms bhutto extended the tenure of a 
lieutenant general the military high command saw it as a blatant 
attempt to divide the army and win the political support of some 
officers by patronizing them 
ms bhutto suffered a serious setback when beg forced the 
officer to retire 
although ms bhuttos government was caught off guard on monday 
political opponents had said privately for weeks that ishaq khan 
planned to dissolve the national assembly and call new elections 
possibly as early as october 
ishaq khan set an election for oct 24 and declared a state of 
emergency for up to four months that allows the president and the 
caretaker government to make laws and to suspend individual rights 
and civilian courts 
ms bhutto got few favorable marks from pakistanis her 
government passed no legislation except for a federal budget and 
spent most of its energy fending off a hostile opposition and 
corruption charges 
her popular support rated at 54 percent when she took office 
had steadily been eroded by the mounting accusations of corruption 
which were never proved but a poll released last month showed her 
popularity had tumbled to 34 percent 
late monday ms bhutto told a news conference she didnt blame 
the president for bringing down her government saying there were 
other elements who wanted me out 
she urged party members to accept the decision and refrain from 
doing anything that would prompt another phase of martial law

existing medical skills could save the lives 
of 10000 babies each year and protect an additional 100000 from 
disabilities if the united states can find way to assure proper 
care is delivered according to an administration report 
the draft reports conclusions are similar to those reached over 
the past few years by other groups including a congressionally 
chartered commission headed by former democratic sen lawton chiles 
of florida and by the institute of medicine 
it found that some pregnant women dont get needed medical care 
for themselves and their unborn children because they cant afford 
it and that for a variety of reasons others do not obtain the 
care for which their eligible 
for some women who need assistance and qualify for it the 
complexity of the medicaid qualifying process itself 
constitutes a barrier to care the report says applications 
can be lengthy they average 14 pages and require more 
verification that a tax return 
copies of the draft report by the white house task on infant 
mortality have been leaked by those who complain that the bush 
administration has shelved the study the new york times carried an 
account in its monday editions 
another copy was obtained monday by the associated press 
we are anxious to see a final report out of the president 
followed by leadership chiles chairman of the national 
commission to prevent infant mortality said tuesday in a statement 
chiles said an additional annual expenditure of 500 million or 
only onetenth of 1 percent of the total spending annually on 
personal health care in the us could put recommendations of 
the report into effect 
sixty percent of the babies who die before their first birthdays 
weighed less than 55 pounds at birth the report said 
another common characteristic is they come from poor families 
other contributing reasons include maternal alcohol and drug abuse 
poor diet and smoking 
by applying the knowledge it already has this country can 
prevent an additional 10000 infant deaths and an estimated 100000 
disabling conditions in the newborn the report said 
some 40000 infants die each year in the united states before 
reaching the first birthday and an additional 400000 are 
handicapped by mental retardation or physical problems the report 
said 
slightly fewer than 4 million babies are born in the united 
states every year 
in 1987 the us infant mortality rate was 101 deaths per 1000 
live births a rate bettered by 21 other industrial countries and 
twice the rate in japan and scandinavia for blacks the rate was 
179 deaths and for whites it was 86 deaths 
those rates have been declining but the report noted that the 
rate of decline for blacks has slowed and the fetal death rate for 
blacks went up 27 percent in 1987 the first increase since the 
1960s 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the study began in july 
1989 and there is no due date for its completion

carving out an exception to the 
therapistclient privilege a judge ruled conversations between a 
psychologist and two brothers charged with murdering their parents 
can be used at trial 
the ruling monday covers tapes of psychotherapy sessions held 
between erik and lyle menendez and their psychologist l jerome 
oziel after the slayings 
the sessions concern the brothers emotional and psychological 
state after the murder of their parents superior court judge 
james albracht said 
albracht said oziel had believed the brothers made threats 
during the sessions and it was necessary to disclose the 
conversations to prevent danger the judge said that such a threat 
constitutes an exception to the psychologistpatient privilege 
the ruling provoked a gasp in the courtroom from the menendez 
family 
the defense said it would appeal to the california supreme court 
if necessary to prevent the tapes from being used in the brothers 
prosecution 
normally conversations between a patient and therapist or 
between a priest and penitent are not admissible 
if the judges ruling is upheld it brings a virtual end to the 
psychotherapistpatient privilege said defense attorney leslie 
abramson 
deputy district attorney elliott alhadeff expressed confidence 
the ruling would be upheld 
he added however we consider it to be very important 
evidence but it is not crucial to the case 
erik menendez 19 and lyle menendez 22 are charged with the 
shotgun slayings of their parents jose and kitty menendez at the 
familys beverly hills mansion last august in a scheme to collect 
the couples 14 million fortune jose menendez was president of a 
video production company 
the brothers remain in jail without bail they could face the 
death penalty if convicted 
ms abramson said albracht based his ruling on a recent court 
decision that held that if a psychotherapist discusses a patients 
statements with someone else the privilege disappears

iranian editorial writers are rejoicing 
now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated 
bogeymen iraqi president saddam hussein 
a monday headline we warned you frankenstein would torment 
his own creators 
saddam attacked iran in september 1980 after a series of border 
skirmishes spawning a war that dragged until an august 1988 
ceasefire the conflict has still not formally ended 
irans late fundamentalist patriarch the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini vowed for years to unseat saddam never at a loss for a 
vivid phrase he compared accepting the ceasefire with saddam to 
drinking poison 
the status of great satan was reserved for the united states 
the allencompassing public enemy no 1 for the islamic republic 
iran frequently accuses both the us and saddam of trying to 
undermine the islamic revolution 
saddam conveniently boasts of having alone staunched the tide of 
radical islam in fact one of his reasons for invading kuwait on 
thursday the iraqi press noted was its gall in demanding back 
tens of billions of dollars loaned to iraq during the war saddam 
says he fought for all arabs 
over the past six months successful unsponsored efforts 
toward facetoface negotiations between iraq and iran robbed 
iranian newspapers and television commentators of a favorite target 
saddams overthrow of the emir of kuwait changed all that 
old scores came brimming to the surface kuwait after all 
reflagged tankers in the united states during the iraniraq war 
ushering in the reason for the arrival of the us navy in the 
persian gulf in force 
irans official islamic republic news agency printed excerpts 
mondya of an editorial from the ettelaat newspaper that was 
headlined foster child turns rapaciously on nourisher kuwait 
it noted that kuwait had blindly supported iraq little 
knowing that it was feeding a wild beast in her own neighborhood 
saddam has also been called generalissimo and the invader 
under the frankenstein headline irna said in its own commentary 
for the time being tiny kuwait breathes no more with its 
sheikh a stateless person and its powerful dinar which bankrolled 
the iraqi military mere garbage kuwait is a nonentity swallowed 
up by the dangerous pet it reared 
despite all the attention to the dangerous pet the great satan 
has not been forgotton according to irans pundits the great 
satan planned it all it wanted to get the navy back in the persian 
gulf

a bodyguard has been convicted in the 
slayings of two american tourists he mistook for us agents after 
they wandered into a restaurant celebration by mexican drug 
traffickers 
mondays verdict against javier vasquez velasco was the last in 
the latest trial over the slaying of us drug agent enrique 
camarena the case has strained us relations with mexico and 
entangled more than 40 people in the two countries 
vasquez 38 portrayed by federal prosecutors as a drug lords 
bodyguard was convicted of two counts of violent crimes in aid of 
racketeering in the 1985 slayings of john walker and alberto 
radelat in a guadalajara restaurant 
prosecutors said walker and radelat were mistaken for drug 
agents after they wandered into a party for drug kingpins 
vasquez was not charged in the camarena case but was tried with 
three other men who were those three were convicted earlier 
we can take no pleasure in the final outcome of this trial 
due to the grisly events outlined by the evidence presented 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
however there is justice in the fact that many of those 
responsible for the brutal kidnapping torture and murder of dea 
special agent enrique kiki camarena have now been held 
accountable for their dreadful acts 
vasquez could get life in prison at sentencing oct 29 
his lawyer fought to have his trial separated from that of the 
other defendants but us district judge edward rafeedie ruled the 
two cases were sufficiently related to try them together 
camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were abducted 
tortured and killed in 1985 at a ranch outside guadalajara 
prosecutors said the slayings were revenge for drug enforcement 
administration raids on marijuana and cocaine operations that cost 
the drug barons 5 billion in profits 
earlier in the trial ruben zuno arce brotherinlaw of former 
mexican president luis echeverria was found guilty of 
racketeering kidnapping and conspiracy in camarenas death he was 
not charged with the actual murder 
juan jose bernabe ramirez a former mexican policeman was found 
guilty of kidnapping but innocent of murder drug baron juan ramon 
matta ballesteros was convicted of kidnapping but the jury also 
refused to convict him of murder 
in the first us trial stemming from the camarena slaying two 
defendants were convicted in 1988 of murder and a third was found 
guilty of aiding the escape of a mexican drug lord after the 
slayings 
the dea has vowed to capture every person involved in the 
slaying so far 22 people have been charged in this country more 
than 20 have been imprisoned in mexico fourteen others are at 
large in mexico including the former head of mexicos interpol 
still pending is the case of dr humberto alvarez machain who 
was spirited out of mexico at the behest of the dea and brought to 
los angeles to face charges in the camarena case

after 10 years of fastforward growth video 
retailers facing industrywide slomo are adding pizzazz and in at 
least one case pizzas to get movie rentals back on track 
filmsavvy clerks easiertofind titles candy counters video 
reference databases and free telephones for renters who need to 
consult with those at home regarding second choices are among the 
perks being offered to keep the customer satisfied participants at 
an industry convention say 
going to the video store is no longer fun said robert 
klingensmith president of paramount pictures video division 
in a glum keynote address at the ninth annual video software 
dealers association convention klingensmith told retailers what 
they already knew that sales growth has leveled off after a boom 
decade 
we have new customers who are hard to reach and old customers 
whose interests may be waning or need to be reinforced he said 
to counter the trend renting videos must become less of an 
ordeal klingensmith said 
thats the goal at the video station in alameda calif where 
video shoppers can take home fresh readytobake pizzas customers 
unable to decide on a second choice after failing to find what 
theyre after at new hampshires empire video can call home for 
free 
simple improvements like better shelf organization can help 
said mitch lowe chairman of the convention 
the thing that i hate the most is where films are just thrown 
anywhere lowe said you cant just expect people to find the 
title they want by putting it on the wall 
other simple measures are hiring more knowledgeable clerks 
stocking a wider variety of candy and installing afterhours drop 
slots and rental machines 
about 15000 delegates are attending the convention in its 
third day today 
ken dorrance who owns video station with his wife said his 
pizzas are part of a larger plan to give consumers the attention 
video chains often cannot 
he lets patrons reserve movies by phone sells movierelated 
toys and hires clerks with some movie knowledge 
what else can you excel at besides customer service everybody 
else has the same titles dorrance said 
lowe said it may cost 2 more per hour to employ clerks who know 
steel magnolias isnt a howto tape on gardening but if you 
pay someone 2 more per hour they can tell people about films and 
rent two or three more movies an hour he said 
according to the trade publication video flash 41 billion 
tapes were rented last year and 196 million were sold although up 
from the previous year the growth does not parallel the rise in 
the number of us households with video cassette recorders now an 
estimated 70 percent 
many customers complain they cannot always find what they are 
looking for more than 75 percent of all renters did not find what 
they wanted on at least one occasion and 6 percent left the store 
with no tape at all video flash said 
video munch a supplier of snacks for video stores is showing 
off a new ninja turtle gummy candy at its convention booth to 
complement a gourmet line that includes spice drops jelly rings 
and natural pistachios 
what we want to do is get a mini candy store in every

or 331 percent ending the day at 2765307 
the index has lost 318492 points since thursday when iraq 
invaded kuwait 
the dollar closed at 15060 yen it had opened 125 yen from 
mondays close of 14950 yen the currency moved between 15048 yen 
and 15110 yen during the afternoon session 
traders said the nikkei recovered late afternoon as investors 
finally started picking up underpriced issues that have declined in 
the last few days 
until midmorning almost half of the 225 issues on the first 
section of the tokyo stock exchange were left without prices 
because no one was interested in buying them traders said they 
said the index could fall further in the afternoon when 
participants gradually filed sell orders 
investors are panicking because their fears are growing as 
they now realize how serious the situation could be said a 
trader with nomura securities co who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the 225issue nikkei stock average had lost 1327 points or 
464 percent to end the morning session at 2727186 the index

to rise in early asian trading as october brent sold at 2705 per 
barrel tuesday morning 
there were almost no buyers for 40000 issues offered for sale 
in initial trading said yoshihide koyama an analyst with nikko 
securities

uncertainty over the middle east rising oil prices and mondays 
9331point drop in the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
on the new york stock exchange 
in currency markets dealers said the yen was recovering its 
stability following dollar sales as investors took profits despite 
the dollars strong overnight increase in new york 
uncertainty about the middle east is a factor that encourages 
dollarbuying but on the other hand pessimistic prospects over 
the us economy which is a dollarselling factor is equally 
strong said takashi fujii a trader with the bank of tokyo 
right now investors are watching both factors the middle 
east situation and the us economy and the currency could move in 
either direction he said 
as part of an international effort to isolate iraq japan is 
freezing both iraqi and kuwaiti assets in japan and suspending 
credit in cooperation with international sanctions voted by the 
un security council said japanese finance minister ryutaro 
hashimoto

iraqi media attacks on the ousted royal 
family of kuwait indicate concern in baghdad that the family is 
still recognized at home and abroad as tahe legitimate rulers of 
kuwait 
the corrupt alsabah family are not arabs iraqs ruling 
baath party newspaper althawra declared on monday 
another iraqi newspaper said the kuwaiti royal family was 
descended from christian crusaders who were defeated by arabs in 
the 11th century 
after their defeat they wandered in the desert where they 
practiced primitive medicine among the arab tribes alqadissiya 
newspaper said 
iraqs statecontrolled newspapers said the alsabah family had 
been removed from kuwait forever 
after its invasion of kuwait on thursday iraq replaced the 
royal family with the provisional government of free kuwait a 
leadership of nine previously unknown officers 
however arab nations and the rest of the world still recognize 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah in exile in saudi arabia as 
kuwaits legitimate ruler 
the alsabah family began its rule in 1756 after arriving in the 
persian gulf region from central arabia the familys rule had been 
uninterrupted until iraqs invasion although kuwait was a british 
protectorate from 1899 to 1961 
after its attack iraq was unable to find any prominent kuwaiti 
to serve in the revolutionary government it installed most experts 
believe the family is admired for its shrewd investment of kuwaits 
huge oil income 
investment funds set up to provide income for the state after 
the countrys oil runs out are estimated at more than 100 billion 
last year the funds earned kuwait more income than it received 
from oil exports 
kuwaits per capita income is 20000 a year 
the number of alsabah princes has grown to more than 1000 but 
the rulership is given to members of two branches descended from 
the emir mubarak the great who ruled at the turn of the century 
princes serve as head of state prime minister fill key 
ministries and other critical jobs such as head of kuwaits office 
in london which oversees the massive foeign investments 
power of attorney over kuwaits public wealth is held by the 
ruler making the emirate virtually a family business like saudi 
arabia but the kuwaiti princes have generally led more austere 
lives than their saudi counterparts 
they take a share but they dont rub it in said a kuwaiti 
newspaper editor before the invasion 
there have been pressures for more democracy in the emirate 
with calls for a westernstyle parliament kuwait experimented with 
a parliament twice in the 1970s and 1980s with a fullyelected 
50seat body 
both times the parliament was closed by the emir after members 
engaged in harsh criticism of government ministers performance 
elections were held in june for a third try at a parliament 
with onethird of the members appointed by the ruler 
only male kuwaiti citizens over 21 were eligible to vote 
turnout was 63 percent and most governmentsponsored candidates won 
handily 
a group of 30 former liberal parliamentarians organized a 
boycott of the elections saying the parliament should be fully 
elected 
with the exception of a handful of radicals however most 
opposition members were thought to favor more powersharing by the 
alsabah family but not its overthrow 
some in the arab world welcomed the iraqi invasion some 
palestinians for example believed kuwait had not done enough to 
support their cause against israel 
in jordan where more than 50 percent of the population is of 
palestinian origin the media said the iraqi invasion was justified 
a jordanian journalist said resentment was based on three 
factors kuwaits failure to give enough support to jordan as a 
frontline state facing israel not investing in jordan to boost 
its economy and treatment of the large palestinian minority in 
kuwait as secondclass citizens 
more than 300000 palestinians are among the 12 million 
expatriates in kuwait there are only 600000 kuwaiti citizens 
few expatriates had dared speak out against the kuwaiti monarchy 
for fear of deportation they faced losing much higher income and 
better living conditions in kuwait than they would find at home in 
india pakistan iran or egypt 
the al ahrar newspaper of cairo expressing the opinion of 
poorer arabs referred to the invasion as a problem of rich and 
poor while some countries like somalia and sudan starve other 
have billions 
the palestine liberation organization was among seven members of 
the arab league that refused to condemn iraq for the invasion plo 
leader yasser arafat was believed unwilling to offend iraq a more 
likely hero for the palestinians in their battle to gain a homeland 
from israel

china plans to open up 14 panda reserves more 
than doubling the number of protected zones for the endangered 
animal and forcing some people to relocate an official newspaper 
said today 
foreigners who have visited some of the 13 existing panda 
reserves in china have found the areas heavily inhabited by people 
pushing the pandas to small mountaintop areas and preventing them 
from mingling during mating season 
more than 4000 peasants live in chinas showcase panda research 
and breeding center in wolong in southwest chinas sichuan 
province 
the china daily report today said residents now living in the 
proposed conservation areas would be persuaded to move and 
extensive publicity and education would be used to arouse the 
publics consciousness on protection of pandas 
the world wildlife fund which uses the panda on its logo is to 
provide money equipment and facilities the paper said without 
providing a figure the organization will send experts to train 
chinese staff and carry out laboratory work the report said 
in britain last week senior world wildlife fund officials said 
pandas do not have much chance of survival if the chinese 
government does not provide funds for the panda management plan 
the organization helped the chinese formulate 
the china daily report did not say whether the new reserves were 
part of the plan it did say that the world wildlife fund 
participated in studies on the proposed reserves and that final 
approval was needed from both the wildlife fund and the state 
council chinas cabinet 
western experts estimate that china has 11001500 pandas 
living in the wild poaching is the main cause of chinas dwindling 
panda population though the government has instituted harsh 
penalties for panda killing including the death penalty panda 
skins can fetch tens of thousands of dollars 
the paper said the chinese government each year allocates 
850000 to rescue and protect the species 
todays report said the new reserves would be set up in the 
provinces of sichuan gansu and shaanxi in southwest and central 
china and would take 10 years to establish 
the report did not say how much area the reserves would cover or 
how many pandas are in the areas to be protected

as nations look to saudi arabia and elsewhere to 
make up loss of oil from kuwait and iraq predictions from experts 
on world supplies range from no immediate danger of shortages to 
severe restrictions soon 
uncertainty has sent prices surging in new york west texas 
intermediate crude was 2805 a barrel at mondays close a 
fiveyear high and 365 up on fridays close in tokyo today 
north sea brent blend was trading at 2775 up 140 from its 
close monday 
the united nations security council voted 130 on monday to 
impose broad sanctions against iraq punishment for its invasion of 
kuwait the penalties include a ban on imports and exports aimed at 
blocking baghdads oil trade 
there will be a potential restriction of oil supply in the 
near future that could range in intensity from significant to 
highly severe the middle east economic survey a weekly 
newsletter published in cyprus said monday 
but in london experts said disruption of oil supplies from iraq 
and kuwait posed no immediate danger of shortages they said 
however that extra world capacity could be called upon quickly 
pushing prices higher 
iraq produced 31 million barrels of oil daily in july and 
kuwait 16 million together that accounted for 9 percent of world 
output the international energy agency reported excluding iraq 
and kuwait the persian gulf has unused capacity of 32 million 
barrels a day the agency said 
the extra capability is concentrated in saudi arabia but 
analysts say there are doubts the saudis would be willing to 
antagonize iraq by stepping up output 
the key obviously lies with saudi arabia and there must be 
considerable doubt as to how far the kingdom would be prepared to 
go in antagonizing iraq the newsletter said 
but lucy mullins an oil analyst at the london investment 
company barclays de zoete wedd ltd said in the short term i 
dont think people are panicking too much the world could last six 
months or so almost quite happily 
she said norway which doesnt belong to opec might be able to 
kick in an extra 200000 barrels a day 
britains north sea supplies amounting to 36 million barrels a 
day in july have been constrained by summer maintenance and 
industrial action by workers 
and oil producer venezuela said monday it would not immediately 
increase its oil prices or production 
the reaction in mexico the worlds fifthbiggest exporter of 
crude oil was the same 
were watching prices very closely but we have not changed 
our policy said a source at the state petroleum monopoly pemex 
mexico has been exporting an average of 12 million barrels of 
oil a day and experts said the oil wells are pumping at full 
capacity 
worldwide the oil market has had an excess of supply and oil 
importers stocks are high experts say the oil shocks of the 
1970s also have made industrial nations accomplished in cutting 
demand 
before the un vote the united states the 12nation european 
economic community japan and other countries had announced plans 
to impose an embargo on iraqi oil purchases 
iraq which pipes most of its oil through saudi arabia to the 
red sea and turkey to the mediterranean on monday cut back the oil 
flow through its turkish pipeline following reports the united 
states had asked turkey to block the lines president turgut ozal 
of turkey said before the un security council imposed its embargo 
that he would abide by it 
kuwaiti production was halted after iraqs invasion 
the dutch government said monday it was stopping iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil shipments to rotterdam one of the worlds largest oil 
harbors 
france said monday ships carrying iraqi oil or under iraqi 
control would be refused permission to dock at french ports 
and australia brazil and switzerland on monday all announced 
embargoes on iraqi oil imports 
brazil buys about 30 percent 160000 barrels a day of its 
oil from iraq 
we are in a comfortable position because we produce over half 
the oil we use and already have 70 days worth of stocks said 
lanning elwis a spokesman for brazils state oil monopoly

us sen bob graham says he never tried to delay 
the government seizure of centrust bank whose failure led to a 
record 17 billion bailout 
nbc reported monday that graham special counsel steve josias 
arranged a 1987 meeting between banking regulators and centrust 
lawyers and used his position at the senators office to bring 
pressure on regulators looking into the thrift 
graham a democrat and member of the senates powerful banking 
committee said he first learned in march about the meeting the 
senator said it was bad judgment for his aide who had done 
legal work for the thrift to attend 
but he said i would say categorically my office did not 
have any effect on any action by federal regulators that would have 
affected their decisions 
josias who served as special counsel to graham for six months 
and whose law firm had handled some real estate matters for 
centrust called the nbc allegations ludicrous 
he said he merely convened the meeting with regulators from the 
federal home loan bank board at the request of centrust officials 
who felt government officials were failing to respond to questions 
on regulatory procedures 
but josias admitted he should have told all concerned about his 
firms work for centrust 
when regulators seized centrust in february they blamed its 
failure on speculative investing including the purchase of more 
than 1 billion in junk bonds 
they also cited the lavish spending of the institutions 
chairman david l paul who allegedly spent millions of thrift 
dollars on a museumquality art collection for his home a company 
yacht limousines and a corporate jet 
paul has declined comment about centrust and its seizure which 
has led to the biggest bailout to date of the savings and loan 
crisis 
investigators are examining the legality of 328000 in 
political contributions by paul graham said he never received 
money from paul or any centrust political action committees 
previously five other senators have come under scrutiny by the 
senate ethics committee for meeting with regulators about lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif after accepting a 
combined 13 million in political contributions from the failed 
thrifts owner charles keating jr 
the senators are alan cranston dcalif john glenn dohio 
dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz and donald riegle

block parties a candlelight march and a 
uscanadian motorcade top the plans for tonights seventh annual 
national night out in which citizens step outside to reclaim the 
streets from criminals 
organizers are hoping that millions of ordinary people across 
the country will turn on porch lights and emerge from behind locked 
doors to meet local police and let street predators know theyre 
watching 
the neighborhood activism began in 1984 with an idea advanced by 
matt peskin and the national association of town watch 
its a july 4 atmosphere but theres seriousness peskin 
said we call it a party with a purpose 
this year its going international with a noontime hands 
across the border ceremony scheduled at mather arch in fort erie 
ontario slated to take part were 300 members of police agencies 
and neighborhood groups from western new york and southern ontario 
the ceremonies in canada were to be followed by a motorcade 
across the peace bridge to the new york state armory in buffalo 
led by canadian pipes and drums and royal mounted police 
this will demonstrate that crime doesnt stop at the 
international boundary and policing is a universal job said 
peskin 
cities around the country are sponsoring block parties 
milwaukee planned 1000 parties and demonstrations to show people 
how to illuminate their homes police in plainsboro nj will 
give away two cases of floodlights 
syracuse ny planned a citycounty candlelight march in 
louisville ky sirens and church bells will sound at 8 pm a 
signal for people to turn on their outside lights and check the 
batteries in their home smoke detectors 
its a rare chance especially for the kids the event seems 
to draw out neighborhoods that have usually been tough to involve 
in anything peskin said 
generally most people are lawabiding and they want to be 
neighborly but nowadays if you try to be neighborly many people 
are likely to be suspicious

the tokyo stock exchange fell sharply today to its 
lowest level in nearly 22 months as uncertainties over the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait grew the dollar strengthened against the 
japanese yen 
the dollar closed at 15060 yen up 110 yen from mondays 
14950 finish the currency opened at 15075 yen and ranged between 
15048 and 15110 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 94646 points or 331 
percent ending the day at 2765307 the lowest level since oct 
26 1988 when the index fell to 2762060 
since iraq invaded kuwait on thursday the index has lost 
318492 points or 115 percent first section volume today was 
thin estimated at 500 million shares up from mondays 330 million 
on an active day more than 1 billion shares are traded 
the index ended the morning session with a 1327point decline 
before bargainhunting helped regain some of the loss in the 
afternoon according to traders who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said the nikkeis decline was caused by growing fears among 
investors of middle east developments surging oil prices plunging 
government bond prices and the weakening yen 
oil prices continued moving up in asia with october brent 
valued at 2780 to 2800 a barrel at around 3 pm 
it sold at 2705 at the beginning of the day 
meanwhile the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese 
government bonds closed at 8298 points down from mondays 
8371point finish the yield finished at 8105 percent up from 
7935 percent 
market players were increasingly getting pessimistic and they 
were almost panicking said kazuhiro nomura a trader with new 
japan securities co 
there were plenty of sellers today but buyers stayed out of the 
market analysts said 
unless they figure out the extent of its effect investors are 
inclined to stay away from the stock market nomura said 
the japanese government has imposed a set of sanctions against 
iraq for invading kuwait including a ban on oil imports from iraq 
and kuwait and on all japanese exports to the two nations 
japan relies on imports for 99 percent of its oil needs and has 
never previously banned the import of petroleum 
while top officials acknowledge the sanctions will affect daily 
life they point out that the nations petroleum reserves which 
are estimated to last for 142 days should cushion the impact 
prime minister toshiki kaifu will ask other oilproducing arab 
countries later this month to expand their crude oil production if 
the embargo is prolonged 
in currency dealings soaring oil prices and further declines in 
stock and bond markets added to the currency markets bearish 
sentiment toward the yen although there was a slight recovery of 
stability dealers said 
they said some market players sold the us currency to take 
profits from its strong overnight increase in new york 
uncertainty about the middle east is a factor that encourages 
dollar buying but on the other hand pessimistic prospects over 
the us economy which is a dollarselling factor is equally 
strong said takashi fujii a trader with the bank of tokyo 
right now investors are watching both factors the middle 
east situation and the us economy and the currency could move 
in either direction he said 
finance minister hashimoto said earlier today that the yen will 
strengthen in the aftermath of the middle east crisis

world leaders in colombia for todays 
inauguration of presidentelect cesar gaviria have pledged to aid 
the violenceweary country in its fight against drug trafficking 
and terrorism 
security in the capital was heavy with some 5000 soldiers and 
policemen guarding against possible attacks by drugbankrolled 
terrorists army officials declared a maximum security alert in the 
hours leading up to the inauguration 
military helicopters circled bogota and the army set up 40mm 
antiaircraft guns on a hill half a mile from the presidential 
palace where gaviria was to take the oath of office for a 
fouryear term 
roadblocks and army checkpoints lined major roads and highways 
gaviria 43 has promised to hold to the current tough line 
against cocaine barons who have waged a nearly yearold war 
against the government in an attempt to force and end to the 
extradition of drug traffickers 
about 500 people have died in a wave of bombings and 
assassinations 
on monday the presidents of venezuela argentina ecuador and 
haiti along with highlevel delegations from scores of other 
countries arrived in bogota for the inaugural ceremonies vice 
president dan quayle was expected today 
drug trafficking is a blow to the international community and 
it must be fought through international cooperation said 
ecuadors president rodrigo borja 
giovanni spadolini president of italys senate echoed borjas 
sentiments we are particularly sensitive to this fight against 
the drug scourge and we offer our solidarity 
but in his inaugural speech gaviria was expected to ask foreign 
nations to provide economic aid and special trade status rather 
than military assistance said the rcn radio network 
colombian drug cartels supply about 80 percent of cocaine 
purchased in the united states cocaine is a multibillion dollar 
business in colombia and the revenues and jobs it provides have 
helped prop up the economy 
a year ago the united states sent colombia 65 million in 
military aid including helicopters and bulletproof vests but the 
economic aid colombia had hoped for such as preferential treatment 
for its exports never materialized 
rcn said gaviria would also ask industrialized countries to 
control money laundering by drug traffickers

a palestinian woman was shot to death as she 
drove past a jewish west bank settlement early today and officials 
suspected she was killed by settlers in revenge for the slayings of 
two israeli teenagers 
in jerusalem police poured hundreds of additional forces into 
the city following mass antiarab riots that were sparked by the 
discovery of the youths bodies on monday 
thousands took to the streets in at least seven neighborhoods 
and officials said the extent of the rioting was unprecedented in 
this mixed jewisharab city the violence persisted this morning as 
arabs heading to work in jerusalem came under attack on the highway 
linking the city to the occupied west bank town of bethlehem 
an angry israeli mob forced a palestinianowned car to stop on 
that road and then smashed its windshield with iron bars injuring 
seven passengers arab reports said 
soldiers at nearby roadblocks later urged palestinians not to 
enter jerusalem warning they could get stoned and most returned 
home 
thousands of israelis were expected to attend the funeral of the 
two youths later today and police feared trouble 
the slain palestinian woman was identified by arab reports as 
aziza salem jaber 27 from the west bank town of hebron 
mrs jaber was shot twice in the head as the station wagon she 
rode past the jewish settlement of kiryat arba at about 2 am 
police officials said refusing to elaborate 
an official source confirmed police suspected the shooting was 
by a settler in revenge for the brutal slayings of the two jewish 
teenagers 18yearold ronen karamani and 17yearold lior tubul 
arab witnesses said a group of settlers were standing near the 
kiryat arba entrance when the shots were fired the reports said 
mrs jabers cousin najeh was wounded in the shoulder 
mrs jaber and other relatives were reportedly accompanying a 
pregnant cousin to a hospital at the time of the shooting 
her death would bring to 726 the number of palestinians slain by 
israelis since the december 1987 start of the palestinian uprising 
another 245 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on 
suspicion of collaborating with israel 
the slayings of tubul and karamni brought the israeli death toll 
in the uprising to 47 
teenage volunteers found their bodies monday with multiple stab 
wounds in a dry river bed near the jewish neighborhood of ramot in 
arab east jerusalem just inside the city limits 
the army swiftly clamped a curfew on a nearby village and 
conducted wide searches but no arrests were made 
news of the slayings sparked the worst antiarab riots in 
jerusalem the scope was unprecedented amir heshin advisor to 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek on arab affairs said on army radio 
several thousand angry israelis blocked main highways throughout 
the city showering arabowned cars with rocks and cinderblocks 
some 20 to 30 arabs were injured by police estimate 
the depth of antiarab feelings stirred by the stabbings was 
also reflected in israels masscirculation news dailies tuesday 
the three most widely read newspapers splashed across their 
front pages a picture of karamanis corpse the photo showed the 
youth lying face down in a rocky field a towel tied around his 
mouth and his blue tshirt ripped by stab wounds 
the yediot ahronot daily linked the slayings to the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait the war of arabs against arabs just like the 
war of arabs against us are a different face to a process of 
reducing the limits of human morality yediot editorialized 
the conservative maariv daily called on security officials to 
restrict the free movement of palestinians in israelicontrolled 
territories 
perhaps it would harm our liberalism to a certain extent but 
the harm done by the murderers is much more serious and in order to 
thwart them it is permissible to compromise on the open gates

doctors have a new drug effective against a lung 
disease that kills about 3000 premature infants a year 
the food and drug administration said monday it approved 
exosurf which cuts the death rate in half in premature infants 
suffering from respiratory distress syndrome the most common cause 
of death in babies under 30 days old 
the drug is a mixture of synthetic chemicals that mimics the 
action of lung surfactant a liquid in the lungs that helps keep 
them inflated premature infants cannot make surfactant and their 
lungs can collapse if not treated 
the drug was invented by dr john clements of the university of 
california at san francisco and is made by burroughs wellcome co 
of research triangle park nc 
approval of the drug is a very important development said 
dr mary ellen avery professor of pediatrics at harvard medical 
school in boston there has been a significant reduction in 
deaths among those who were treated 
respiratory distress syndrome afflicts 50000 infants each year 
and kills about 3000 of them the american lung association said 
exosurf and another experimental surfactant made from cows 
lungs survanta have been available since last year when the fda 
allowed distribution under a policy to make lifesaving drugs 
available before approval 
survanta is made by abbott laboratories in abbott park illan 
abbott spokesman said approval of survanta was expected soon 
both drugs have been widely used and although they have not 
been directly compared both work pretty well avery said 
dr anthony corbet a neonatologist at the baylor college of 
medicine in houston who has participated in studies of exosurf 
said the drug could significantly lower the us infant mortality 
rate 
the us rate is 10 deaths per 1000 live births and about 
three infant deaths per 1000 are due to respiratory distress 
syndrome he said 
in studies with 1600 infants with respiratory distress 
syndrome exosurf cut the death rate 66 percent the company said 
when given to 1800 infants who were at risk of developing the 
disease but had not yet contracted it the drug reduced the death 
rate 50 percent company officials said 
the company said side effects include a slight increase in 
bleeding in the lungs and apnea a treatable disorder in which 
infants intermittently stop breathing 
dr richard kent of burroughs wellcome explained that without 
surfactant the little air sacs in the lung called alveoli collapse 
like balloons if air pressure is not maintained when surfactant is 
added the alveoli become more like bubblegum bubbles and maintain 
their shape when air pressure falls he said

a set of doonesbury comics 
containing suggestive language and showing a woman wearing nothing 
but rope and a bucket is in poor taste say two newspaper editors 
who pulled the strips 
if we had been running it on the oped page we probably would 
have thought differently about it said phil record associate 
executive editor of the fort worth texas startelegram but we 
just did not think this was suitable on a page we try to draw kids 
to 
the newspaper said monday it will not publish this weeks strips 
but has notified readers they can pick up copies at newspaper 
offices 
the republic in columbus ind also decided to drop the strips 
the newspaper will run old doonesbury comics instead editor 
john harmon said 
it just didnt meet our guidelines for taste he said if 
our photographers came back with something like that we wouldnt 
run it 
the baton rouge la statetimes and morning advocate decided 
to run the strip opposite the editorial page rather than on the 
comics page 
it contains language and art that i would be very reluctant to 
invite children to look at said jim hughes executive editor 
and children read the comics page 
the strip by garry trudeau apparently refers to controversy over 
national endowment of the arts funding some politicians have tried 
to block government money going to art they consider obscene and 
some artists have lost grants 
in mondays strip the character jj tells her husband she has 
a new concept for performance art so innovative that the nea will 
have to reconsider her grant application 
she is covered only by a strategically placed rope and her hand 
and she has a bucket over her head 
in strips for later in the week jj utters words such as 
ooze lubricate and hot juices although she makes no 
direct reference to sex acts 
lee salem editorial director at the strips distributor 
universal press syndicate said only about eight to 10 newspapers 
called with concerns the kansas city company distributes the strip 
to about 1000 newspapers

the system for cleaning up oil spills has 
deteriorated over the last decade a coast guard panel said in 
winding up an investigation of 12 spills in the new york area this 
year 
the ninemember board led by rear adm william g henn said 
monday the system worsened as public and government concern waned 
until recently 
we would not have been talking about this 10 years ago and we 
had pretty much the same number of spills henn said what we 
thought was good in 1980 is not good enough today 
there were 12 oil spills in the area around the port of new york 
and new jersey during the first seven months of 1990 including a 
570000gallon spill from an exxon refinery in linden nj into 
the arthur kill on jan 2 
the coast guard panel recommended a 10 percent increase in the 
number of inspectors in the area about 75 inspectors monitor ship 
and shore facilities 
the report also recommended a system of radar screens for 
monitoring ships in the harbor such a tracking system was shut 
down in 1988 because of budget constraints it would cost about 10 
million to get it fully operational again

western europe has acted almost in unison in 
opposing iraqs invasion of kuwait to the extent that even neutral 
switzerland announced today it will join in imposing sanctions 
however the french government is encountering harsh criticism 
at home from some political figures who say it bears partial 
responsibility for the attack by encouraging massive arms sales to 
iraq over the past decade 
a former national intelligence director pierre marion said in 
an interview published monday that france provided iraq with 
onefourth of its military arsenal while pursuing a shortsighted 
incoherent middle east policy the sales earned an estimated 5 
billion for france which trailed only the soviet union as iraqs 
biggest arms supplier 
frances neighbors havent echoed such criticisms and the 
french delegation played a leading role at the weekend meeting in 
rome of the european community which voted for an embargo on 
imports of iraqi oil 
the communitys 12 member countries also voted to freeze iraqi 
and kuwaiti assets 
switzerland not a member of the european community nato or any 
other political alliance demonstrated the broad consensus on the 
iraqkuwait conflict today announcing it would break from its 
traditional policy of not taking part in international embargoes 
switzerland said it would follow the lead of the un security 
council and ban all trade with iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait it 
also prohibited all payments and other financial transfers to iraq 
and kuwait 
switzerland had refused to join the unendorsed sanctions 
campaigns against rhodesia and south africa 
sweden norway and denmark also announced today they were 
imposing a complete trade embargo against iraq and kuwait 
in britain foreign secretary douglas hurd said monday the 
crisis in the persian gulf had produced a rare degree of unity 
transcending customary alliances in contrast to some recent 
foreign policy issues his government has not found itself at odds 
with any major allies 
the iraqis have got themselves into a corner hurd told 
bbctv they did not expect the international community the 
russians japanese europe at our instance the americans to 
come together so clearly and so soon against this act of 
aggression 
britains relations with iraq had been strained severely since 
the march 15 execution by that country of farzad bazoft an iranian 
journalist with the british newspaper the observer 
on march 28 british authorities announced the seizure of parts 
that could be used in nuclear bomb triggers just before they were 
put aboard an iraqbound airliner in april large pipes were 
seized that britain alleged were parts for an iraqi super gun 
project 
in france the government responded quickly to the iraqi 
invasion by announcing a halt to all arms sales to baghdad and an 
end to training of iraqi fighter pilots officials said arms sales 
in fact had stopped in may because of problems arising from iraqs 
debt to france of more than 4 billion but the actions failed to 
ward off criticism 
on sunday the head of frances greens party antoine waechter 
said the government practiced blind diplomacy during the years 
of arms sales to iraq 
france is partly responsible for what is happening today 
waechter said france sold arms even when it was obvious that 
iraq had this type of dominating expansionist behavior 
marion who in 198182 headed frances external intelligence 
agency told the paris newspaper le figaro that france had sold 
iraq 210 mirage warplanes and stateofthe art missiles 
sales continued even after the iraniraq war ended in 1988 he 
said 
since early this year marion said the french military 
contractor thomson csf has sold 160 million worth of electronics 
equipment to iraq that could be used to develop sophisticated 
military radar systems 
four french companies have sold equipment that could be used to 
increase the range and accuracy of sovietmade scud missiles 
possessed by iraq marion was quoted as saying 
because of the complaisant attitude which it had in the past 
toward saddam hussein france today must have a bad conscience 
and some regrets said an editorial monday in the courrier de 
louest a newspaper in angers 
in west germany there also has been extensive media criticism 
of allegedly illegal shipments by west german companies to iraq 
over the past several years 
the news magazine der spiegel reported saturday that german 
companies have played central roles in helping iraq with its 
military buildup

look up when you pass the davenports place 
and you just might see ed and sandie up a tree sipping soda pop in 
their gazebo tree house 
davenport a 46yearold farmer hopes combining his childhood 
longing for a hideaway in the tree tops with an adult penchant for 
the peace and quiet of a gazebo will lead to some offseason work 
its free advertisement atop a giant cottonwood 18 feet in 
circumference thats middle limbs were torn off in a wind storm 
i couldnt have found a more perfect tree because it is big 
enough and it did look strange without those middle limbs 
davenport said recently of course some people think it looks 
strange now 
davenport started his project about a month ago with a stairway 
more than 20 feet into the tree 
two weeks after he hammered in the first nail davenport 
completed the yellow white and gray latticework structure which 
reaches 30 feet high and seats eight people 
davenport hopes the project will attract people interested in 
contracting with him to build gazebos in the winter when work on 
the farm is slow 
he says he expects most people would want groundlevel 
structures but if any of them want to go out on a limb hes 
willing

the dollar was steady in thin uncertain trading 
in europe late this morning 
gold prices were up but off their early highs as an asian rally 
turned to profittaking dealers said 
traders said they expected the dollar to recover slightly after 
having hit bottom on monday 
dealers said however that market conditions remained nervous 
because of the tense situation in the middle east 
its fairly quiet this morning but quite tense said one 
trader at deutsche genossenschaftsbank in frankfurt if saudi 
arabia cuts off iraqs oil pipeline and iraq then invades saudi 
arabia then i could imagine people would turn to the dollar as a 
safe haven 
some traders said they were optimistic about the middle east 
dispute being settled by diplomatic means 
but iraqs blunt warning to the united states to stay out of the 
persian gulf crisis on monday and other signs of heightened tension 
are prompting traders to try to find safe middle ground the

raw tomatoes may be the common link in 
a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 100 people in 
four midwest states since july health officials say 
in illinois 51 salmonella cases have been reported since july 
1 mostly in the chicago area said dr bernard turnock the 
states public health director 
minnesota has reported 38 cases michigan 10 and wisconsin three 
minnesota officials said monday the outbreak of salmonella 
javiana was definitely linked to tomatoes turnock said test 
results from illinois cases show an association with tomatoes as 
the common source 
investigators believe tomatoes from a single farm or distributor 
may have been contaminated with manure used as fertilizer but the 
source hasnt been pinpointed said tom schafer a spokesman for 
the illinois department of public health 
fecal matter is a common source of salmonella bacteria 
tomatoes associated with the outbreak came from grocery stores 
and were eaten at restaurants 
most likely in the fields these tomatoes were fertilized with 
manure that got on the tomatoes plants and such schafer said 
if not properly washed they could carry salmonella 
consumers and foodservice workers should wash tomatoes 
thoroughly and remove the area where the stem is attached as well 
as any bruised or damaged areas sliced or cut tomatoes should be 
refrigerated until serving 
cooked tomatoes and tomato products arent considered a 
potential problem because cooking destroys the salmonella bacteria 
turnock said 
salmonella symptoms include vomiting diarrhea and stomach 
cramps 
in 1985 illinois was the center of a massive midwest salmonella 
outbreak in which more than 16000 cases were confirmed the 
disease was traced to contaminated lowfat milk processed by a 
chicagoarea dairy 
schafer said the reported cases in the current outbreak may 
represent only a fraction of people stricken typically in 
salmonella outbreaks only a relatively small portion of those 
afflicted are treated and diagnosed by a physician 
a lot of people could have it and think it was stomach 
cramps schafer said

the african national congress 
announced today that it is ending its 29year guerrilla campaign 
and suspending all military action clearing the way for fullscale 
talks on ending white minority rule 
anc leader nelson mandela said his organization was making every 
effort to notify supporters to immediately end all armed action 
against the government 
the two sides pledged after 16 hours of talks to work together 
to counter growing political violence that has claimed hundreds of 
lives in recent months 
the way is now open to proceed towards negotiations on a new 
constitution a joint statement by the two sides declared 
police said today at least 15 blacks had been killed in 
scattered faction fights around the country since sunday the dead 
included 11 killed in kagiso outside johannesburg in a power 
struggle between anc supporters and inkatha the conservative zulu 
political movement police said 
the independent south african press association said kagiso was 
tense but quiet today with police patrols deployed in force in the 
area 
president fw de klerk who announced the ceasefire with 
mandela after the talks hailed the breakthrough saying we 
think what has happened today forms an important turning point 
the two leaders looked tired but pleased as they announced the 
agreement in the early morning hours 
in the interest of moving as speedily as possible towards a 
negotiated peaceful political settlement and in the context of the 
agreement reached the anc announced it was now suspending all 
armed actions with immediate effect said a joint statement 
released by the anc and the government 
mandela said the anc would halt the infiltration of guerrillas 
and arms from neighboring countries we hope that we will be able 
to communicate with our people and inform them of what we have 
decided he said 
mandela and the anc now face a major test of their leadership to 
see if blacks especially militant youths in black townships 
observe the call for a ceasefire some critics fear the anc has 
little actual control at the grass roots level and violence will 
continue since many young blacks oppose a peaceful settlement 
immediate reaction to the anc announcement was glowing anglican 
archbiship desmond tutu a leading antiapartheid activist said 
its tremendous news we want to commend the anc very warmly 
for its actions 
but tutu echoed warnings from anc leaders that the government 
must act to curb the police and ensure the law was administered 
fairly anc leaders contend the police oppose reform and continue 
to persecute opposition groups 
tutu said we must warn the south african government very 
sharply that if it does not act very firmly indeed to bring the 
police under control then it will wreck the prospects of a 
negotiated settlement 
mandela said the decision to end the ancs guerrilla campaign 
was made even before his fiveman delegation arrived for the talks 
with de klerk and cabinet members the two sides have been trying 
since may to remove obstacles to fullscale talks on ending white 
rule 
although the ancs guerrilla wing spear of the nation has made 
no major attacks in the past year anc officials have acknowledged 
that guerrillas continued to infiltrate the country stockpile 
weapons and plan attacks 
mandela had resisted declaring a ceasefire saying the 
government had to make concessions the anc demanded the government 
release hundreds of political prisoners grant amnesty to about 
20000 exiles remove laws restricting political activity and end 
the state of emergency in natal province 
todays statement indicated the government has gone some 
distance toward meeting anc demands though stopping short of 
outright acceptance further discussion of the issues will now take 
place 
the joint statement said the government would consider repealing 
some security laws and lifting the state of emergency in natal the 
emergency gives police wide powers to detain people and restrict 
political activity 
both sides also agreed to draw up plans for the release of 
ancconnected prisoners and for granting amnesty to many of the 
exiles who want to return home 
asked what the government had conceded de klerk said his 
administration would try to ensure that the police deal with all 
problems in what he called an evenhanded manner 
in a bit of friction at the news conference mandela interjected 
that the government had so far failed to bring the police under 
control 
its a totally unsatisfactory situation and until the 
government tames the police we will be dissatisfied mandela 
said 
the joint statement also said the government would continue to 
review security legislation under which scores of anc activists 
including a member of the national executive committee have been 
detained by police during the past few weeks 
de klerk had been under pressure to secure major concessions 
from the anc after he legalized black opposition groups and in 
february freed mandela after 27 years in jail white critics of de 
klerk charged the government failed to gain anything by its 
concessions 
the united states and other western nations had been urging the 
anc to renounce its armed struggle and seek a peaceful settlement 
during mandelas last years in prison the anc guerrilla wing 
waged an urban bombing campaign from july 1986 through august 
1989 the campaign killed 37 people and injured 680

an armybacked caretaker government 
with sweeping emergency powers consolidated control today after 
benezir bhuttos administration was dismissed in what one diplomat 
called a constitutional coup 
exercising his constitutional power president ghulam ishaq khan 
abruptly dismissed prime minister bhuttos government monday and 
dissolved the national assembly the lawmaking lower house of 
parliament 
corruption and nepotism in the federal government has reached 
such proportions that the people have lost faith in the 
government the president said in a statement 
ishaq khan set new elections for oct 24 and declared a state of 
emergency saying national security was threatened by external 
aggression and by internal disturbances 
the president did not elaborate but his statement likely 
referred to border tensions with neighboring india and ethnic 
violence in ms bhuttos home province of sindh that has left 
hundreds dead 
opposition leader mustafa jatoi was sworn in as acting prime 
minister monday most of those attending the ceremony were members 
of the military high command 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the pakistani 
army strongly supported ishaq khans move they said the army has 
become increasingly impatient with ms bhuttos unwillingness to 
find a political solution to the ethnic violence and her perceived 
meddling in military affairs 
army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg said the military 
which has ruled the country for 25 years of its 43year history 
had no intention of seizing power 
we are not going to get involved in politics beg said 
ms bhutto 37 said in a statement before leaving for her home 
in the southern port city of karachi that the presidents action 
was arbitrary illegal and unconstitional 
but she said she did not believe the president had betrayed her 
other forces wanted me out a subdued ms bhutto told a news 
conference 
the presidents decision caught members of ms bhuttos 
government by surprise but opponents said the president starting 
drafting the order two months ago 
she has nobody to blamed but herself she had plenty of 
warnings said abida hussein a former lawmaker and one of ms 
bhuttos most outspoken critics 
this was a kind of constitutional coup staged while world 
attention was focused on the events of kuwait and iraq said one 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity but something had 
to be done if things had continued the only ultimate solution 
would have been martial law 
shortly after ishaq khan dissolved the government the army took 
control of the staterun television network and the telephone and 
telegraph exchange soldiers were deployed throughout the capital 
emergency rule valid for up to four months allows the 
president and the caretaker government to suspend individual rights 
and civilian courts and to make laws 
educated at harvard and oxford ms bhutto inherited the 
political mantle of her father the late prime minister zulfikar 
ali bhutto he was ousted by gen mohammad zia ulhaq in a 1977 
coup and hanged two years later 
zia himself was killed in a mysterious plane crash on aug 17 
1988 his death led to the first democratic elections after more 
than a decade of military rule 
when ms bhutto who led her party to victory took office in 
december 1988 she pledged to restore democracy and her family name 
but many diplomats and political analysts say ms bhutto never 
made the transition from a fighter of political oppression to prime 
minister 
her popular support rated at 54 percent when she took office 
was steadily eroded by mounting accusations of corruption against 
senior cabinet ministers and members of her family including her 
husband asif zardari none of the allegations was proved but a 
poll released last month showed ms bhuttos popularity had tumbled 
to 34 percent

cleanup crews hoped to scrape up the last pockets 
of oil today along a sevenmile stretch of shoreline stained by a 
massive spill in galveston bay 
about 700000 gallons of oil spilled into the busy bay july 28 
after a tanker collided with two barges in the houston ship channel 
one barge remained crippled in the channel today blocking 
traffic crews were scouring its emptied tanks so the vessel could 
be cut up and moved out of the way 
we dont want to cut it open and have a minioil spill added 
to what weve already got said coast guard chief warrant officer 
rick meidt also a cutting torch could ignite a fire if the tanks 
are oily he said 
a few heavy patches of oil remained along the shoreline today 
and a light sheen floated about two miles into the bay 
theyre going to try and get the very last of it said coast 
guard petty officer scott campbell theyve already released some 
cleanup crews theyre just isnt that much to do 
campbell said cleanup crews might be finished by the end of the 
day however other officials said it probably would take the rest 
of the week to finish the cleanup estimated to cost 5 million 
the channel was open monday to twoway barge traffic but 
deepdraft ships were allowed only one way at a time because their 
wakes could disrupt the salvage operations 
the heavy black oil stained several beaches seeped into some 
marshes and collected around several residential docks however 
officials said it spared other marshes that are breeding grounds 
for much marine life 
crews used vacuum trucks again monday to clean up oil on shore 
more than 300000 gallons of an oilandwater mixture has been 
picked up so far said meidt 
crews also sprayed oilgobbling microbes on a marsh south of 
cedar bayou said campbell the microbes were sprayed on another 
marsh sunday and a beach last week 
the microbes used in a process call bioremediation reduce the 
oil to a fatty emulsion that is eaten by marine animals 
coast guard officials said they received no reports of injured 
birds or wildlife 
however larry mckinney director of the resource protection 
division of the texas parks and wildlife department said his crews 
found some dead crabs mussels small fish and other small marine 
animals along the shores around houston point

the cia and fbi dismissed as ludicrous and 
not credible renewed claims that the cia had a hand in the 
assassination of president kennedy and allegations one gunman is 
living in secrecy in texas 
ricky don white an unemployed oilfield worker claimed on 
monday that his father a dallas police department employee acting 
on orders from the cia fired the shots that killed kennedy 
whites father roscoe white died in 1971 
the cia broke a longstanding policy against commenting on 
alleged covert operations to deny the story 
these allegations that this was done on cia orders that 
this guy worked for us and that cia had any role in the 
assassination of president kennedy are ludicrous cia spokesman 
mark mansfield said in washington 
the fbi said in a statement that it had received the same 
information in 1988 but determined that this information is not 
credible 
the story adds another conspiracy theory to the bulging file on 
the assassination even though the warren commission concluded that 
lee harvey oswald acting alone shot the president from the sixth 
floor of the texas school book depository in 1978 a divided house 
committee concluded that oswald shot the president but that a 
second gunman also fired a shot that day that missed 
theories have circulated for years that the cia had a part in 
the assassination 
white gave his account at a news conference monday although he 
had been shopping his story to reporters for some time 
his claim was backed by his mother geneva white galle who told 
the odessa american there is no doubt in my mind that my husband 
did shoot kennedy she was married to roscoe white for 15 years 
and remarried after white died 
mrs galle who has terminal cancer said she wished the 
information had been revealed sooner and added i lost my health 
because of it 
in his news conference ricky white did not repeat an earlier 
contention that one of the three purported coconspirators lives a 
reclusive fearful existence near dallas 
however gary shaw who helped organize mondays event said the 
coconspirator was not mentioned because we want to approach this 
in a way not to make them run 
at the news conference white said he hoped his story would 
result in a book and movie contract 
white said much of his theory is based on information he said 
was in a diary kept by his father who served in the marines with 
oswald white said the diary which he showed to no one is 
missing and suggested it was taken by the fbi 
white who lives in midland said his father joined the police 
department three months before the assassination in 1963 to carry 
out the plot 
white claimed the diary shows his father was on a grassy knoll 
in front of the presidential motorcade and fired two shots that 
struck kennedy oswald was part of the conspiracy but fired no 
shots white said 
white said his father also killed police officer jd tippit 
about an hour after the assassination tippits slaying has been 
blamed on oswald 
white died at age 35 in what his son called a suspicious fire 
and explosion at an equipment company in suburban garland where he 
was shop foreman white said he believes a cia witness 
elimination squad killed his father 
ricky white made his claims at the jfk assassination information 
center a private group that researches assassination theories

the woman whose relationships with archbishop 
eugene marino and a priest led to their resignations was seduced by 
the bishop but never had sex with the priest her attorney said 
the woman vicki r long 27 of riverdale has accused a third 
priest of fathering her child 
louisiana attorney anthony fontana said monday that some people 
might consider ms long a seductress but once the facts come 
out the public will know grown women can suffer sexual abuse 
even in a relationship not termed to be perverse one person can 
make demands and manipulate the other to satisfy those demands 
fontana known for arguing sexual abuse cases against the roman 
catholic church said marino manipulated his client into a sexual 
relationship to which she did not consent 
she went to see archbishop marino for counseling and pastoral 
help in dealing with sexual abuse fontana said he took 
advantage of that situation manipulating that situation 
archdiocese spokesman peter dora said he does not believe marino 
would take advantage of anyone but declined to comment further 
fontana said ms long categorically denies she had a sexual 
relationship with the rev michael woods a sandy springs priest 
who resigned saturday after admitting he had an intimate 
relationship with her 
woods who said he was the godfather of ms longs 4yearold 
daughter previously was ms longs pastor at a hapeville church 
she doesnt deny the relationship was intimate but she 
categorically denies it was sexual said fontana 
ms long may file a lawsuit against the church he said 
archdiocese officials confirmed last week that marino 56 
formerly the nations highestranking black catholic resigned 
earlier this year because of an intimate relationship with ms 
long that involved paying her 1500 a month 
the archdiocese said it would investigate whether church funds 
were paid improperly to ms long fontana said monday that his 
client was certain church funds were used 
marino has not commented publicly on his relationship with ms 
long 
ms long also has refused to comment 
several years ago she filed a paternity suit claiming that 
another priest rev donal keohane of columbus ga fathered her 
daughter he denied paternity and blood tests supported him but 
the archdiocese is paying her child support church officials 
decline to explain why 
in december 1987 fontana represented an altar boy who sued the 
church claiming the rev gilbert gauthe of lafayette la molested 
him a jury awarded the boy 155 million and his parents 250000 
gauthe is serving a 20year sentence on the molestation charges

the economic pressure increased on an increasingly isolated 
saddam hussein today as turkey agreed to comply with un sanctions 
against iraq which likely would involve closing a pipeline 
carrying iraqi oil through its territory 
a worldwide trade embargo already forced iraq to stop the flow 
through one of its two turkish pipelines and sharply reduce it in 
the other oil executives said today iraqs use of a saudi arabian 
pipeline also had been drastically cut because there was no one to 
buy the oil once it reached the other end 
if successful the unordered embargo could cripple iraqs 
oildependent economy 
in other developments today 
jordan appeared ready to provide an overland escape route for 
foreigners caught in kuwait which iraqi troops have occupied since 
thursday 
travelers said saudi arabia deployed missiles along its border 
with kuwait facing the iraqi military buildup 
defense secretary dick cheney arrived in egypt for talks with 
president hosni mubarak on the crisis mubarak has been trying to 
mediate the dispute 
the tokyo stock exchange followed its new york counterpart 
today plunging 332 percent on fears of economic fallout from the 
persian gulf crisis oil prices rose with brent north sea crude 
oil trading at 2775 per barrel up 140 from its close monday in 
new york 
the turkish government announced today it would comply with a 
un security council vote monday ordering broad economic sanctions 
against iraq to pressure it to withdraw from kuwait 
when asked if turkey would close a pipeline pumping hundreds of 
thousands of barrels of iraqi crude oil through his country state 
minister mehmet yazar said these details of implementing the 
un decision are being worked out 
but a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
turkey intended to shut down the pipeline which carries iraqi oil 
to a terminal on the mediterranean for export 
on monday turkish officials said iraq informed them it had 
slashed the pipelines capacity to 70 percent and closed its second 
turkish pipeline because of the reduced market for iraqi oil 
oil executives in saudi arabia said today iraq also 
significantly reduced the flow of petroleum through a pipeline 
across saudi arabia to the red sea one executive speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the flow through the saudi pipeline 
which had been about 800000 barrels a day was down to 200000 
barrels others said they thought the flow was somewhat higher 
the saudi and turkish pipelines carry more than twothirds of 
iraqs daily oil output of about 3 million barrels iraq also pumps 
oil through the persian gulf 
the washington post reported today that saddam summoned us 
charge daffaires joseph wilson in baghdad on monday and threatened 
to attack saudi arabia if iraqi pipelines through that country were 
closed 
oil is at the root of the crisis iraq invaded kuwait after 
accusing it of cheating on opec production quotas and driving down 
the price of oil it also alleged that kuwait stole 24 billion 
worth of oil from a field that includes land both sides claim 
kuwait and iraqi officials met aug 1 in an attempt to resolve 
their differences but the talks broke down iraq invaded kuwait

historical objects housed at jasna gora which was founded in 1382 
by the hermetic paulite order from hungary 
however firefighters had to break through the copper roof of 
the building where the fire broke out in addition to the library

the black madonna was brought to the monastery in 1384 by duke 
ladislaus of opole adviser to louis of anjou king of poland and

swedish army and inspired the country to rise up and throw out the

andrew young took his underdog bid to become georgias first 
black governor to the voters today in a runoff for the democratic 
nomination against lt gov zell miller kansas and michigan also 
were holding primaries for governor 
max cleland georgias secretary of state predicted just 38 
percent of the states 27 million registered voters would cast 
ballots and early turnout was slow in some areas 
we had a flowing river three weeks ago and today we had a 
trickle said liz thompson poll manager at the jewish community 
center in atlanta 
fortyfour percent of eligible voters turned out for the july 17 
primary in which miller got 41 percent of the vote and young 
received 29 percent

a scared rabbit and were going to catch him young said after 
arriving in augusta and savannah as miller left young trailed by 
about 20 points in two polls last week 
miller said he was optimistic repeating a favorite campaign 
phrase he quoted an inscription on a mountain tombstone i done 
my durndest 
race had rarely been mentioned during their threeweek campaign 
after the two survived a fiveman contest in the primary 
georgia requires a runoff if no candidate receives more than 
half the vote but the requirement was under challenge as 
discriminatory against blacks who make up about 28 percent of 
georgias voters 
on monday young referred to his days in the civil rights 
movement and spoke of his accomplishments on behalf of blacks he 
took a jab at millers pet issue establishment of a state lottery 
i dont believe anybody marched i dont believe anybody went 
to jail or died for certain for a lottery young said 
miller appeared before about 50 members of the political 
advisory council of chatham county a black group that endorsed him 
over young miller said the group helped him when he won his first 
race for lieutenant governor 
now 16 years later when its so difficult to do what youre 
doing youre reaching out to me again miller said 
the winner of the primary will meet republican state rep johnny 
isakson in the november election twoterm gov joe frank harris a 
democrat is not eligible to seek reelection

a program that would let poor milwaukee 
children attend private schools at state expense has been declared 
constitutional by a state judge apparently clearing the way for it 
to begin this fall 
dane county circuit court judge susan steingass ruled monday 
that the states school choice program was legal because it served 
to improve education quality and thus met the public purpose 
requirement of the wisconsin constitution 
i conclude that education is a public purpose and that the 
program is the legislatures reasonable assessment of how to 
improve the quality of education to the benefit of the entire 
state ms steingass wrote 
in addition the judge ruled that state school superintendent 
herbert grover who must administer the program but has publicly 
opposed it exceeded his authority in demanding certain 
requirements of participating private schools including complex 
forms that are difficult to fill out 
she ordered grover to redraft his the forms or face further 
court action 
grover did not immediately return a telephone message left at 
his home monday night seeking comment on the decision 
the school choice program approved by the legislature and 
signed by gov tommy thompson last spring provides up to 2500 in 
state funds per pupil to let poor innercity milwaukee 
schoolchildren attend private schools 
the state budget includes 25 million for the program this 
year meaning that the program could accommodate 1000 students 
it is believed to be the first of its kind in the country and 
has drawn praise from the bush administration 
judge susan steingass made the right decision one in favor 
of our children thompson said monday 
critics of the program including grover and two teachers 
unions claim the plan undermines public education and places 
pupils in private schools that are not fully accountable to the 
state 
supporters of the program said it provides poor parents with 
another choice to improve their childrens education and does not 
force participation 
clint bolick an attorney for the washingtonbased landmark 
legal center foundation for civil rights said the judges decision 
was a slamdunk for parental choice in education 
it will stand up very well under any appeal bolick said 
adding that he doubted whether opponents would have enough time to 
attempt to legally block the program before it begins in the next 
few weeks

unemployment in east germany almost doubled 
between june and july official figures released today said the 
west german official overseeing east germanys businesses said the 
economy is in chaos 
reiner gohlkes remarks published today in an east german 
newspaper are some of the most ominous to date concerning the 
countrys rapidly deteriorating economic situation 
they coincided with the release of the latest official 
unemployment figures showing the number of east german jobless 
jumped to 272017 last month up from 142096 in june 
more than 656000 of the nations 88 million workers are 
working short shifts because of the lack of demand for east german 
products 
also today toplevel meetings got under way in both germanys to 
try to work out the precise date of german unity and the best means 
of stemming east germanys escalating economic and social problems 
the social democrats secondlargest party in both germanys 
have demanded unity by sept 15 
but the christian democrats of west german chancellor helmut 
kohl and east german prime minister lothar de maiziere insist unity 
must wait for allgerman elections that should be held oct 14 
since the west german mark became the east german currency on 
july 1 the countrys 8000 major businesses have faced increasing 
difficulties staying afloat 
the next six months will be the hardest the newspaper neue 
zeit quoted gohlke as saying 
gohlke is president of the trust institute of the german 
democratic republic the institute was established to oversee the 
east german economys change from a staterun economy to a 
capitalist system 
there have been predictions that up to 4 million east germans 
could be out of work by early next year as businesses close 
that in turn has led to predictions of a hot autumn of 
worker unrest in the former communist nation 
the situation is worse than i had thought neue zeit quoted 
gohlke as saying we have chaos nothing is running normally 
the neue zeit newspaper is closely linked to east germanys 
christian democrats 
economists expect an economy recovery in east germany late in 
1991 after unproductive staterun businesses either reform or 
close 
in addition west german companies are rushing into east germany 
to set up production and will be drawing east german workers

the aircraft carrier saratoga and four escort ships steamed out 
of their home port en route for the mediterranean and possible 
mideast duty today and 2500 marines boarded ships bound for the 
coast of wartorn liberia 
the mood aboard the saratoga was professional and 
workoriented but concerned said chief petty officer charles 
underwood a spokesman for the mayport naval station at 
jacksonville fla 
i think this force is probably going over toward that area and 
if something happens these boys can handle it said wade andrews 
of sebring fla whose son randell was aboard the saratoga 
there was an air of subdued concern as parents friends and 
wives carrying babies wept blew kisses and waved and yelled 
goodbyes at dockside as the saratoga pulled away it was preceded 
by the destroyers spruance and sampson the frigate elmer 
montgomery and the guided missile cruiser philippine sea 
both deployments had been scheduled before iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and the marine mission to rescue americans from liberia the 
departing marines in fact were scheduled to relieve the marine 
unit involved in the liberian rescue 
marine col wc fite iii commander of the 26th marine 
expeditionary unit leaving camp lejeune at morehead city nc 
said he hadnt gotten orders yet 
we havent been told about our future plans fite said at a 
brief news conference as troops boarded ships as far as we know 
this is a routine deployment we have plans to go to spain which 
is routine and also plans if needed to go to the coast of 
monrovia liberia 
the saratoga could be sent to the eastern mediterranean and be 
within striking distance of iraq but the use of carrierbased 
planes from there would be complicated by having to fly through the 
air space of one or more other countries and probably inflight 
refueling 
the saratoga is no stranger to crises in the middle east during 
an eightmonth deployment that ended in april 1986 the carrier 
participated in the capture of terrorists who hijacked the liner 
achille lauro and retaliatory air strikes against libyan 
surfacetoair missile sites and armed libyan patrol boats in the 
gulf of sidra 
the ship also patroled the eastern mediterranean during the 
sixday war between israel and egypt in june 1967 
at morehead city groups of marines sat on the dock waiting to 
board ships if we have to do something were prepared to do 
it said cpl david ellis 22 of chicago theres no sense 
worrying about something you dont have any control over 
in events like these that are taking place in iraq and libya 
were obviously the nations force of choice when it comes to 
initial response capt scott campbell said earlier 
everyone has an idea where were going said 1st lt chris 
maxmin everyone is apprehensive and excited at the same time i

a handful of protesters took umberage 
but its out with the old and in with the new inside 64color boxes 
of crayola crayons the fliptop package that was the first status 
symbol for baby boomers 
crayola maker binney amp smith created eight brighter colors and 
given them names like jungle green wild strawberry and vivid 
tangerine 
to make room the company decided to ax eight classic but hohum 
colors so that the traditional sharpenerequipped boxes could be 
preserved said spokesman brad drexler 
a ceremony this morning inducting the retired colors into 
the newly established crayola hall of fame was picketed by 
about a dozen people who said they would miss maize raw umber 
lemon yellow blue gray violet blue green blue orange red and 
orange yellow 
binney amp smith america takes umberage said one sign 
indians call it maize we call it gone said another 
the 5foot10 models of the retired colors stand in plastic 
tubes in front of crayolas production center each has a plaque 
extolling the colors virtues 
well all miss these retired colors thats why we started the 
hall of fame so people can come by and see them whenever they want 
to said tom muller general manager of binney amp smiths crayola 
division 
joining the list of new colors aimed at a fresh generation of 
children are dandelion fuchsia teal blue royal purple and 
cerulean a darker version of crayolas sky blue 
thousands who grew up with the old colors and some youngsters 
using them now called or wrote binney amp smith to complain but the 
change was prompted by child surveys in the first place so the 
company went forward with the plan 
for members of the baby boom generation the fliptop crayon box 
with all the colors and the builtin sharpener was a childhood 
status symbol akin to todays designer sneakers and nintendo video 
game sets 
it was always the haves versus the havenots drexler said 
i never had a 64 until i worked here now i have two 
he said the 64color box was nearly eliminated but binney amp 
smith feared a backlash 
the first idea was to make the 64box a 72box but then we 
thought of the coke scenario and believed wed be messing with a 
classic drexler said 
complaints came anyway especially regarding a wellknown color

sluggish home sales that had picked up lately 
as mortgage rates fell are under a new threat from rising interest 
rates resulting from the iraqi invasion of kuwait analysts said 
tuesday 
the single factor that affects housing nationally is mortgage 
financing said john a tuccillo chief economist with the 
national association of realtors 
tuccillo and other economists said tuesday that a worldwide 
embargo on oil from iraq and occupied kuwait will result in price 
increases for most goods including a likely rise in mortgage rates 
of 25 to 50 percentage points in the near term 
if they go up 50 now and the thing is resolved in a few 
weeks they will go down 50 and will continue going down 
tuccillo contended if the crisis lingers on mortgage rates 
are going to go up and theyll stay up and housings going to be in 
pretty bad shape 
robert van order chief economist with the federal home loan 
mortgage corp or freddie mac said a 25 percentage point 
increase in rates would result in an additional mortgage payment of 
25 a month on a 100000 house 
according to weekly surveys by freddie mac the average cost 
fixedrate 30year mortgage fell from its 1990 peak of 1067 
percent in may to 984 percent last friday the rates do not 
include addon fees known as oints 
realtors president norman d flynn said that when mortgage rates 
began falling in may buyers resumed house hunting particularly in 
areas with relatively affordable prices 
as a result the commerce department reported gains in new home 
sales during may and june after five consecutive monthly declines 
and the realtors said sales of existing homes which represent 
about 80 percent of the housing market posted a 12 percent 
increase in june it was their first advance in seven months 
but the decline in existing home sales in april and may resulted 
in a 05 percent drop in overall resales during the second quarter 
compared to the same period of 1989 the realtors said tuesday 
according to their most recent survey secondquarter resales 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 368 million units 
compared to 370 million units during the apriljune period of last 
year sales dropped 27 percent from the first quarter to the 
second 
by region sales were off 145 percent to 650000 units at an 
annual rate in the northeast and 31 percent to 620000 units in 
the west sales gained 44 percent to 141 million units in the 
south and 42 percent to 990000 units in the midwest 
the realtors said that in addition to rising mortgage rates 
they were concerned over the effect of the governments sale of a 
large volume of properties in the southwest that had been acquired 
from failed savings and loans 
in their survey the realtors found the us median price was 
96200 a 34 percent increase over the second quarter of 1990 
the median price means half of the homes cost more half less 
the median price in the west declined 08 percent to 138300 
while it rose 58 percent in the midwest to 75000 it rose 15 
percent to 86200 in the south but fell 16 percent to 143500 in 
the northeast 
by city the median price of an existing home ranged from 
345000 in honolulu to 45100 in youngstown ohio

turkey announced today it has stopped 
tankers from loading iraqi oil from the last operating pipeline 
through the country blocking the route for half of iraqs oil 
exports 
turkey also announced it was stopping all exports to iraq with 
the exception of medicine and food imports were also being halted 
mehmet kececiler turkish minister in charge of oil affairs 
said iraq could continue to pump crude through the pipeline until 
the storage tanks at the terminal were full but then must stop 
pumping he said it would take about six days to reach capacity in 
the tanks 
iraq on monday shut down one pipeline in turkey and reduced the 
flow to 70 percent in the other because the international embargo 
against iraq had shrunk the market the embargo protests iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on thursday 
the turkish pipelines carry more than half of iraqs daily oil 
output to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the mediterranean 
kececiler told reporters that turkey notified iraqs state oil 
marketing organization of its decision to halt loading from the 
second pipeline this afternoon 
he said the un security council vote monday imposing broad 
economic sanctions against iraq was binding for all member states 
that is why we took this decision we were not pressured by 
anyone kececiler said 
only one tanker from morocco came to the terminal today but 
was turned back he said 
earlier in the day president turgut ozal said that there 
should be no more loading by tankers of iraqi oil at the terminal 
the un measure bans all imports from iraq and kuwait it also 
prohibits any activities including the transfer of funds that 
would help iraq and kuwait export their goods and forbids loans to 
the two countries 
turkeys border post with iraq at habur remained opened today 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reported but the dispatch 
said iraq was not allowing travelers other than its own citizens to 
enter the country 
the washington post reported today that iraq has threatened to 
invade saudi arabia if its leaders shut down the iraqi pipeline 
running through their country 
in another sign that the embargo on iraqi oil was having an 
effect oil executives reported today that iraq had significantly 
reduced the flow of its oil through a pipeline across saudi arabia 
to the red sea 
they said no tankers were loading oil at the red sea terminals 
iraqs daily output is about 3 million barrels about half of 
which has been flowing through turkey and smaller amount through 
saudi arabia a very small amount goes through the persian gulf 
the white house announced monday that secretary of state james 
a baker iii would travel to turkey this week for consultations on 
the crisis set off by the iraqi invasion 
turkish newspapers reported today that a number of us f111 
bombers were dispatched to turkey to the incirlik us base near 
the mediterranean 
a us embassy official said 14 f111s from a us base in 
england were flown to incirlik in what he called a routine 
regularly scheduled transfer the official speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the first group of f111s arrived on june 20

government troops tracked down and 
killed 42 tamil rebels held responsible for massacring moslem 
villagers officials said today 
we will show no mercy to these tamil terrorists criminals who 
do not deserve to live deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne 
said of rebels blamed for killing at least 193 moslems since 
friday most of the villagers were slain while worshiping in 
mosques 
wijeratnes statement in parliament replied to opposition 
criticism that government forces had not give moslem civilians 
protection against rebel attacks 
in a separate incident a moslem mob avenging the massacres 
raided a tamil village and killed 40 people a tamil politician 
said today 
kandiah premachandran a member of parliament quoted survivors 
as saying the moslems attacked thirraikerni village in ampara 
district and shot and stabbed residents leaving 40 dead the 
village is 130 miles east of colombo 
there was no independent or police confirmation of 
premachandrans allegation 
premachandran is general secretary of the eelam peoples 
revolutionary liberation front a former guerrilla group which gave 
up arms to join mainstream politics 
the front is a bitter rival of the separatist liberation tigers 
of tamil eelam which has been accused of carrying out the 
massacres 
saturday and sunday at least 50 moslems were shot or hacked to 
death in ampara district according to officials who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules they blamed the tamil tigers for 
the incident the tigers have been involved in an intensive war 
with government forces since june 11 
the government launched search operations in the district for 
the assailants and killed 42 rebels the officials said most of 
the clashes occurred monday they said 
the government clamped an indefinite curfew in the eastern port 
city of trincomalee after reports of tension between moslems and 
tamils who are mainly hindu in colombo armed police guarded 
hindu temples to prevent outbreaks of sectarian violence 
the weekend attacks on the moslems follow a raid on two mosques 
in the batticaloa district friday at least 143 moslem worshippers 
died in machinegun fire and grenade explosions according to army 
and witness accounts 
the military and moslem politicians blamed the tigers but a 
rebel spokesman claimed the attacks were carried out by a rival 
tamil group to discredit the tigers 
moslems who make up 7 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim neutrality in the war between tamil separatists and the 
government but the rebels accuse moslems of siding with the 
government 
the eastern districts of ampara batticaloa and trincomalee have 
roughly equal populations of tamils moslems and the mainly 
buddhist sinhalese who control the island nations army and the 
government 
the tamil war has been mainly directed against the sinhalese 
whom they accuse of discrimination 
since june 11 at least 3150 combatants have been killed in 
fighting between tamil rebels and the military hundreds of 
civlians also have died but there is no precise estimate 
tamil militants began fighting for an independent homeland in 
1983 but agreed to a ceasefire in may 1989 that agreement was 
broken after 13 months when the tigers overran police stations 
along the east coast 
at least 14000 people have been killed in the 7yearold 
insurrection

a defense lawyer in the central park jogger 
trial asked the jury today to acquit his client charging that 
detectives coerced an incriminating statement from the teenager 
and lied about it on the witness stand 
they came in here and they lied to you and they intended to 
lie to you said defense attorney michael joseph in an 80minute 
summation in state supreme court in manhattan 
the detectives persuaded 16yearold antron mccray to implicate 
himself in written and videotaped statements by threatening the 
teen with jail if he didnt cooperate joseph charged 
its the hope of getting out of trouble that caused the 
statement to be made said joseph the first of three defense 
attorneys addressing the jury today the prosecutor was to deliver 
her summation when the defense finishes 
the defense attorney pointed out the lack of physical evidence 
linking mccray to the attack no blood on his clothes none of his 
semen recovered from the jogger 
he also pointed out close to a dozen discrepancies in the 
testimony of police detectives in the case charging they had lied 
to the jury in an effort to get a conviction 
yusef salaam 16 raymond santana 15 and mccray are charged 
with raping and beating a woman jogger in central park and leaving 
her near death the night of april 19 1989 
the jogger now 30 is back at work at an investment bank but 
testified she suffers from impaired sight balance and smell she 
does not remember the attack 
summations were delivered one day after salaams mother was 
ejected from the courtroom after she leapt up and screamed at the 
final witness a prosecutor 
shes lying shes lying sharonne salaam shouted monday as 
assistant district attorney linda fairstein told of meeting mrs 
salaam at the 20th precinct police station the night yusef was 
arrested 
why are you telling all these lies my son is innocent you 
dont have to lie like that he passed a lie detector test and hes 
innocent mrs salaam shouted at fairstein 
two court officers escorted mrs salaam from the courtroom 
the results of lie detector tests are inadmissible justice 
thomas galligan instructed the jury to totally disregard any 
outbursts like that it is totally inappropriate 
mrs salaam testified that she told fairstein right away that 
her son was 15 but that the prosecutor stalled for at least an hour 
while detectives continued to question the boy it is illegal for 
police to question anyone under 16 without a parent or guardian 
present 
fairstein however testified that no more than 10 minutes 
elapsed between the time mrs salaam told her the boy was 15 and 
the time the woman was allowed to see her son

a congressman asked the navy to investigate 
possible safety hazards aboard the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier 
uss nimitz after a television station broadcast allegations of 
violations an aide said today 
us rep norm dicks dwash was assured by adm bruce demars 
navy director of nuclear propulsion that his office would join the 
investigation currently under way aboard the nimitz dicks 
spokesman george behan said 
the violations were alleged by four men identified as nimitz 
sailors who appeared on seattle television station kiro last week 
with their faces and voices masked 
they alleged that crew members had cheated on reactor 
inspections that some nuclear operators had to work up to 100 
hours a week during a monthlong maintenance run at the puget sound 
naval shipyard in bremerton and that crew members did not have 
sufficient knowledge to control a nuclear accident 
they also said some had discussed sabotaging the reactor to ease 
their heavy work schedule however one later said the comments 
were not meant as a direct threat by the four 
four sailors believed by the navy to be the source of the 
allegations were kept aboard as the aircraft carrier left port 
monday despite objections from their lawyers who wanted them kept 
ashore pending an independent investigation 
the nimitz set sail monday night from bremerton on a 30day 
mission 
a navy spokesman said the sailors rights had not been violated 
and they would continue to be part of the investigation until the 
navy gets to the bottom of the allegations 
attorneys for the petty officers said the navy had a 
vendetta against the four the lawyers want independent 
investigators not the navy to look into the claims 
were concerned about our clients if anything happens to 
these people while theyre out to sea for the next 30 days the navy 
is going to be held responsible attorney michael withey said 
monday 
a navy spokesman lt comdr bob pritchard said in the nimitzs 
home port of san diego that the sailors were taken off restrictive 
status monday afternoon after the naval investigative service found 
the threat of possible nuclear sabotage by them groundless 
withey would not confirm whether his clients were the ones who 
appeared on kiro last week but did say they had been interrogated 
and fingerprinted 
in a letter to the ships captain robert williamson withey 
demanded that the navy stop questioning the four sailors make 
arrangements for them to stay in bremerton while the carrier sails 
and end the intimidating atmosphere aboard the nimitz 
pritchard said the navy would not rule out action against the 
four for possibly releasing classified information on tv but he 
denied they had been intimidated during questioning

training courses for about 10 iraqi air force 
pilots in france have been abruptly canceled and the aviators await 
the reopening of air routes before they can go home 
the pilots scattered around several french air force bases for 
flight training or to familiarize themselves with french equipment 
purchased by iraq were grounded as of saturday two days after 
iraq invaded kuwait 
they are at the end of their stay a foreign ministry 
spokesman said tuesday the pilots will return to iraq when the 
air frontiers open again unless they dont want to 
training came to a formal end for the pilots no matter what the 
stage of their individual courses after the 12nation european 
community adopted an oil and arms embargo against iraq on saturday 
the conservative daily newspaper le figaro reported tuesday that 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement ordered the pilots placed 
on standby friday a day before the sanctions were adopted 
france has trained iraqi pilots since the 1970s to fly the 
modern warplanes it sells to baghdad including mirage fighters 
the ministry refuses to reveal how many iraqi pilots it has 
trained but le figaro said the number has dropped as iraq becomes 
able to instruct its own pilots 
a former national intelligence director pierre marion said in 
an interview monday that france has sold iraq about 5 billion 
worth of arms about onequarter of baghdads arsenal 
the arms include about 210 mirages as well as exocet antiship 
missiles that iraq used against oil tankers in its eightyear war 
with iran marion said

the soviet unions strategic position will be more 
difficult following german unification the chief of the soviet 
armed forces general staff said tuesday 
the soviet people are interested in what policy a united 
germany will pursue in future mikhail moiseyev told the tass 
news agency regrettably nato doctrines and concepts based on 
the use of nuclear weapons first have not changed 
president mikhail s gorbachev agreed last month that a unified 
germany could belong to the north atlantic treaty organization his 
changeofmind came after west german chancellor helmut kohl 
promised that a united germany would cut its armed forces it also 
followed a nato agreement to shift from a military to a political 
alliance 
we should display realism and restraint in all appraisals 
moiseyev said 
noting that the new border between nato and the warsaw pact 
countries will run along the oder river dividing poland from what 
is now east germany moiseyev said 
it would be premature to say today that the military danger 
for the ussr has disappeared 
tass quoted him as saying his countrys strategic position would 
then be more difficult 
gorbachev said last month he would withdraw the remaining 
380000 soviet troops from east germany within two or three years 
some western experts predict they will leave even sooner 
kohl promised that a united germany would reduce its combined 
armed forces to 370000 the two germanys now have 600000 enlisted 
men 480000 of them in the west

the new president of soviet armenia appealed 
tuesday for its restive and armed citizens to act with cool heads 
as its parliament began debating a declaration of independence 
in the baltic republics of estonia and lithuania where 
independence drives began earlier the parliaments approved 
platforms for negotiations with the soviet union on breaking from 
moscow 
the soviet interior ministry reported that extremists in 
armenia continue to seize arms in defiance of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs decree demanding that militants disarm and disband by 
thursday 
underscoring the danger from the illegal weapons the tass news 
agency reported that a man shot and killed a military cadet on 
sunday in armenia while seizing a submachine gun 
levon terpetrosyan a nationalist leader whom the parliament 
elected president on saturday said in his address that armenia 
could handle its own problems a rejoinder to kremlin threats to 
send in troops to enforce order if gorbachevs decree is ignored 
we are capable in a short period of time and with our own 
means of solving the complex problems relating to the republics 
domestic life and of stabilizing the existing explosive situation 
provided that external interference is excluded he told 
armenias parliament 
i have grounds also to anticipate that the union soviet 
authorities will receive our position with understanding he said 
he urged the population to evaluate coolheadedly the current 
state of crisis in the republic the only way out of which is the 
consolidation of the people around the idea of statehood and its 
embodiment in the national parliament 
about 40000 members of armenian paramilitary units must under 
gorbachevs decree surrender their weapons or face forcible 
confiscation by the red army the armenian parliament already has 
rejected the decree as interference in the republics internal 
affairs saying it can police itself 
i call upon all the volunteers to give a pledge of allegiance 
to the republics seat of supreme authority and forgetting 
internal contradictions to abstain from any unconsidered 
operation he said 
i am obliged to remind you also that the people will not 
forgive any adventure that endangers the fulfillment of our 
statehood he added in the speech a copy of which was provided 
to the associated press by the armenian national movement tass 
also carried a report on the speech 
terpetrosyan a leader of the armenian national movement spent 
six months in jail last year for organizing mass demonstrations 
against azerbaijani control of the disputed territory of 
nagornokarabakh more than 200 people have died in ethnic clashes 
between armenians and azerbaijanis over control of the territory 
which azerbaijan has held since 1923 
tass reported that the lawmakers on tuesday began discussing a 
declaration of independence from the soviet union 
if armenia adopts the resolution on independence it would 
become the fifth of the 15 soviet republics to move toward complete 
separation from the soviet union lithuania latvia estonia and 
georgia have already taken steps 
the estonian parliament on tuesday declared that it will 
negotiate with the soviet union with the following understandings 
that the soviet constitution ceased to regulate state and social 
relations in estonia that it will refuse to help draft a treaty 
of union among the soviet republics and that it will consider the 
soviet armys presence illegal unless estonia and soviet 
authorities draft a treaty on the issue a report on the 
parliaments actions came from the estonian news agency 
the interfax news agency meanwhile reported that lithuanias 
parliament approved the basic points and goals of negotiations with 
the soviet union on independence the action was taken at a closed 
session of parliament and no further details were released 
armenias independence proposal calls for specific steps toward 
achieving separation from the soviet union according to legislator 
raphael popoyan it does not follow the example of lithuania which 
on march 11 declared overnight independence with the details to be 
worked out later 
popoyan said the victory of terpetrosyan a supporter of the 
independence proposal indicated the parliament probably will 
support complete separation from the soviet union rather than a 
lessradical declaration of sovereignty

an armysupported caretaker 
government assumed power tuesday and ordered former prime minister 
benazir bhutto and other top officials not to leave the country 
one diplomat called it a constitutional coup 
ms bhutto dismissed by the president on monday spent her 
first day out of office meeting with former cabinet ministers to 
chart a strategy for their party which is now deeply divided and 
demoralized 
ms bhutto members of her government and members of the 
disbanded federal legislature were ordered to remain in pakistan 
spokesmen for the new and former governments said 
pakistan appeared calm after the action and troops deployed to 
maintain order began returning to their barracks monday night 
president ghulam ishaq khan invoked his constitutional authority 
and dismissed ms bhuttos government alleging widespread 
corruption misuse of power judicial intimidation and failure to 
curb ethnic violence that has claimed more than 400 lives since may 
in her home province of sindh 
ms bhutto called the charges baseless and said she had only one 
demand hold fair and free elections on schedule and let the 
people decide 
the president appointed opposition leader mustafa jatoi as 
acting prime minister set new elections for oct 24 and declared a 
state of emergency that gave the new government sweeping powers to 
suspend all laws and individual rights 
but many members of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party said 
privately that the link between ms bhutto and grass roots members 
has been almost severed largely because of her unwillingness to 
compromise and allegations that senior government officials used 
their positions to make huge fortunes 
we simply blew it one former minister said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the presidents decision took ms bhutto and senior officials by 
surprise 
but some opposition officials said the president starting 
drafting the order two months ago after telling ms bhutto to 
reform her government 
she has nobody to blame but herself she had plenty of 
warnings said abida hussein a former lawmaker and one of ms 
bhuttos most outspoken critics 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
pakistani army also had become increasingly impatient with ms 
bhuttos inability to find a political solution to the ethnic 
violence in sindh and her perceived meddling in military affairs 
the sources said the army gave ishaq khan the green light to 
dismiss the government after a meeting between army chief of staff 
gen mirza aslam beg and ms bhutto failed to resolve the dispute 
this was a kind of constitutional coup staged while world 
attention was focused on the events of kuwait and iraq one 
diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity but something 
had to be done if things had continued to deteriorate the only 
ultimate solution would have been martial law 
the military has ruled pakistan for 25 years of its 43year 
history 
members of ms bhuttos former government alleged the interim 
administration appointed by ishaq khan was considering 
investigating and punishing ms bhutto 
they may be planning to have tribunals of accountability and 
not let her stand in the next election said her former minister 
of information ahmed saeed awan 
the tribunals under consideration would reportedly have the 
authority to suspend participation in elections for five to seven 
years 
critics dismissed the notion saying the former prime minister 
and her party members would be allowed to participate in an 
election 
jatoi said the new government would initiate a process of 
accountability but added justice will be provided without 
victimizing anyone 
some in ms bhuttos administration have compared ishaq khans 
move to the events of 1977 when ms bhuttos father the late 
prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown in a coup led by 
gen mohammad zia ulhaq he was hanged two years later for alleged 
complicity in a murder plot 
zia ruled pakistan until his death in a mysterious plane crash 
on aug 17 1988 his death cleared the way for democratic 
elections that installed ms bhutto as prime minister the first 
woman leader of a modern moslem nation

invasion troops turned up at a baghdad hotel today but they are 
not allowed to leave the building the state department said 
us officials have met with some of the americans who were 
among a group of more than 300 foreigners picked up by the iraqis 
on monday and taken by bus to baghdad 
the americans were placed in the rashid hotel where 11 american 
oil workers rounded up by the iraqis in kuwait last thursday are 
also staying said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
the americans in the hotel in baghdad with whom we have met 
appear to be in good shape she said our understanding is that 
foreigners in hotels in baghdad who have been brought from kuwait 
are not being allowed to leave the hotels at this point 
the top us diplomat in iraq joseph wilson is discussing with 
iraqi authorities a plan that would allow all 500 americans and the 
50 official us employees in the country to leave she said 
he made clear that we expect once the situation is safe and 
the borders are open private americans should be able to leave 
along with any officials and their dependents ms tutwiler said 
the first commercial flight to leave iraq since the invasion 
arrived today 
in amman jordan with 78 foreigners most of them japanese 
tourists and a number of iraqi citizens arrived today 
it was not immediately known if there were americans on board 
the iraqi airways jet 
the efforts to arrange the departure of americans from baghdad 
seemed designed to preclude any possibility that they might be 
taken hostage by iraqi president saddam hussein 
if americans can get out by cars or buses they will be able to 
drive to neighboring jordan or turkey ms tutwiler said adding 
that both countries have promised the united states they would help 
americans on their way 
a senior iraqi official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said today iraq is considering allowing foreigners including us 
embassy staff and dependents to leave by land through jordan 
ms tutwiler said the estimated 3000 americans in kuwait are 
mostly unable to leave the occupied country although some have 
managed to get out the us embassy has reported that all 
americans in the country are safe she said 
the state department said the group of foreigners taken monday 
included passengers from a british airways flight stranded in 
kuwait since the iraqi invasion began 
the iraqi official said today that his country might be 
loosening travel restrictions on foreigners and the government is 
considering facilitating the departure of the foreign community for 
those who wish to leave iraq or kuwait 
there are an estimated 3000 us citizens in kuwait and 500 
others in iraq 
we hold iraq responsible for their safety ms tutwiler said 
earlier however she also said its premature to call them 
hostages 
assistant secretary of state john kelly summoned iraqi 
ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat on monday to demand information 
about the 28 americans taken from kuwait and to deliver a stern 
warning about their safety 
it was a short and tense meeting said an official afterward 
almashat refused to talk with reporters 
another warning against harming americans was delivered in 
baghdad by wilson the charge daffaires in iraq to saddam 
saddam summoned wilson to his office the first contact the 
united states has had with saddam since the invasion and the 
meeting lasted two hours said ms tutwiler 
we viewed it as a very serious meeting she said indicating 
the session was confrontational the meeting took place before us 
officials learned of the 28 missing americans 
secretary of state james a baker iii discussed the safety of 
us citizens in kuwait and iraq with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in a 30minute telephone conversation 
monday shevardnadze whose government has announced an arms

a fire has damaged polands holiest roman 
catholic shrine and injured four monks who tried to save 
centuriesold volumes from the blaze media and officials said 
tuesday 
the fire at the jasna gora monastery in czestochowa did not 
endanger the jewelrobed black madonna the burnished icon to which 
millions of pilgrims pay homage every year said sister daria at 
the roman catholic curia in czestochowa 
four monks suffered smoke inhalation while rushing through the 
burning building to save books including some illuminated 
manuscripts dating to the 15th century from the twostory library 
built in 1739 
the monks were hospitalized in stable condition polish 
television reported 
the fire appeared to have started in the attic and been caused 
by a short circuit in the electrical system polish radio reported 
a commission of warsaw specialists was established to investigate 
the fire started late monday and was extinguished at 830 am 
tuesday said the rev simon stefanowicz at the monastery 
he said there was no significant damage to the many historical 
objects housed at jasna gora founded in 1382 by the hermetic 
paulite order from hungary 
however firefighters had to break through the copper roof of 
the building where the fire broke out in addition to the library 
and archives the building houses a small hotel for visiting 
priests and the editorial offices of a monthly monastery bulletin 
officials said 
the building is adjacent to the chapel where the icon is housed 
but the curia said the chapel and the rest of the monastery were 
sealed off and not jeopardized 
more than 15000 pilgrims left warsaw on monday on the nineday 
174mile walk to czestochowa for assumption day on aug 15 a 
tradition that has been maintained every year since 1711 
up to 170000 pilgrims make the trip on foot many covering the 
last distance on their knees in all a halfmillion worshipers are 
expected to fill the field at the monastery aug 15 
jasna gora or bright mountain rests on a brick fortification 
and houses an extensive collection of polish historical objects 
from the weapons of kings to teargas grenades lobbed at solidarity 
protesters 
the monastery provided sanctuary for the solidarity movement 
through its decadelong fight against polands communist government 
and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki visited czestochowa two days 
after becoming the first noncommunist government leader in the 
east bloc in august 1989 
the black madonna painted according to legend by st luke 
was brought to the monastery in 1384 many miracles have been 
attributed to the doleful painting including a 1655 siege during 
which 70 monks and 180 supporters held off nearly 4000 soldiers 
from the protestant swedish army and inspired the country to rise 
up and throw out the invaders

the soviet union said tuesday it prefers political 
pressure to an international military buildup to force iraqi troops 
out of kuwait but it took no chances dispatching two warships to 
protect soviet commercial vessels in the persian gulf 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said an 
antisubmarine ship and a destroyer patrolling the indian ocean 
were sailing toward the strait of hormuz the entrance to the gulf 
journalists in helicopters on tuesday reported seeing a soviet 
destroyer nearing the strait 
gremitskikh said the ships were dispatched to ensure safety of 
navigation of soviet civilian vessels 
he urged caution in the naval buildup but was careful to avoid 
direct criticism of the united states which has sent even more 
warships to the gulf 
a buildup in the military presence and naval muscleflexing in 
such a very tense and very complex situation is not the best line 
of action gremitskikh told a regular news briefing 
the united states moved aircraft carriers into position near the 
gulf one is at the mouth of the gulf and the other is in the 
mediterranean within striking distance of iraq 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
told cbs on tuesday an international naval blockade against iraq 
was very likely 
the washington post said the pentagon proposed an international 
blockade that would include forces from the soviet union 
gremitskikh told reporters moscow had not discussed joining such a 
blockade 
the soviet union prefers political means for resolving the 
crisis such as the worldwide trade embargo ordered by the un 
security council on monday and diplomatic intervention by other 
arab states gremitskikh said 
a senior soviet military official doubted the superpowers would 
resort to force against iraq 
i think the soviet union and the united states will solve 
this but not by war they will use public pressure lt gen 
vladislav lisovsky deputy commander of the leningrad military 
district told reporters watching military exercises near 
leningrad its apparent that the soviet union and the united 
states have taken the humanitarian side he added 
us ambassador jack matlock met tuesday in moscow with soviet 
deputy foreign ministry alexander belonogov who has been holding 
regular talks with iraqs ambassador tass reported 
the official news agency did not disclose details of the meeting 
except to say it was at the americans request the us embassy 
confirmed the report but refused to elaborate 
the soviet union joined the united states in condemning iraqs 
invasion of kuwait and urging a speedy withdrawal of iraqi troops 
it also halted arms sales to baghdad a longtime ally 
the soviet union has not said what other measures it will take 
to implement the un security council resolution ordering 
worldwide sanctions against iraq belonogov told the government 
newspaper izvestia that whatever action is taken the soviet 
economy will be hurt he did not elaborate but the 
shortageplagued soviet union imports 16 billion worth of goods 
from iraq it exports 428 million worth of goods to the middle 
eastern country 
by taking these measures we cut the cooperation which we have 
accumulated with baghdad for decades belonogov said but all 
the same the ussr will unswervingly observe the resolution of 
the security council 
the communist party newspaper pravda said in a commentary that 
the soviet unions decision to suspend arms supplies to its old 
friend iraq was not taken lightly 
the soviet union sided with iraq at its most trying times but 
it is one matter to participate in defense and other to be 
involved in piracy the newspaper said 
belonogov said the foreign ministry was working on plans to 
evacuate soviets from kuwait by air or sea 
lisovsky said soviet military officers in iraq had already left 
almost 900 soviets live in kuwait and 8000 in iraq including 
diplomats businessmen military advisers and oil workers 
bulgaria and czechoslovakia have asked for soviet help in 
evacuating their nationals belonogov said

president hosni mubarak met tuesday 
with defense secretary dick cheney who was said to be seeking 
support for a multinational ground force to deter iraq from 
invading saudi arabia 
cheney met for an hour with mubarak who earlier held separate 
meetings with iraqi and kuwaiti leaders 
mubarak who has been trying to mediate the iraqkuwait crisis 
received a message from iraqi president saddam hussein explaining 
why his troops took over kuwait on thursday 
presidential sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the message explains the iraqi viewpoint on the present crisis 
it was relayed by izzat ibrahim vice president and deputy chairman 
of iraqs ruling revolutionary command council 
ibrahim and mubarak met for two hours after ibrahim left 
cheney and mubarak had their meeting cheney refused to talks to 
reporters afterward 
pentagon sources in washington said cheney was seeking approval 
from mubarak to move the aircraft carrier uss eisenhower with its 
complement of sophisticated aircraft through the suez canal from 
there it could head toward the persian gulf 
cheney also was seeking the cooperation of middle east nations 
to station a multinational ground force in saudi arabia to contain 
further iraqi aggression said the sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
earlier in the day the middle east news agency said mubarak had 
spoken on the phone with president bush to discuss the situation in 
kuwait 
cheney stopped over on his way home from saudi arabia where he 
conferred monday with saudi officials about bolstering the us 
presence there in the event of an iraqi attack on the oilrich 
kingdom 
penatagon sources said that although two us aircraft carriers 
were within range to carry out air strikes in the persian gulf or 
against iraqi sites a major air strike would require flying over 
or landing rights from friendly nations in the region 
although iraqi officials repeatedly have said they would not 
attack saudi arabia residents have reported increased military 
activity in the kingdom especially near the kuwaiti border where 
iraqi troops have been sighted strenthening their positions 
cheney was accompanied by norman schwarzkopf head of the us 
middle east force known as the central command richard gates 
deputy national security adviser and paul wolowitz deputy defense 
secretary 
ibrahim was the first iraqi official to meet with mubarak since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
he was also the head of the delegation that held talks with 
kuwaiti officials aug 1 in jiddah saudi arabia to resolve their 
differences over oil and land 
the talks failed and less than 24 hours later iraq invaded 
kuwait

federal scientists didnt really lose a 
quartermilliondollar underwater camera used to map the ocean 
floor 
they know exactly where it is 200 miles off the oregon coast 
and more than a mile straight down 
the crew of a submersible will try to find and hook a cable to 
the oneton camera system a task sort of like standing atop a 
skyscraper and trying to drop a rope into an open manhole said 
steve hammond of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the 250000 package was suspended from the 303foot noaa ship 
discoverer last week when its threequarterinch cable snapped the 
camera system includes a lowlight video camera a 35mm still 
camera and various temperature conductivity and depth sensors 
all in sealed containers 
the alvin will try to retrieve the camera later this month 
hammond said from his office at the hatfield marine science center 
the alvins crew of three will attempt to approach the camera 
with a hook and cable so a surface ship can reel it in however if 
the camera is snarled in its broken cable they may not able to get 
close enough to attach the hook hammond said 
the alvin is too small to raise the camera

andrew young struggling to keep alive his hopes of being 
georgias first black governor needed an upset tuesday in his 
democratic runoff against lt gov zell miller 
in kansas firstterm gov mike hayden fought for survival in a 
republican primary as his chief opponent real estate executive 
nestor weigand jr tried to capitalize on voter anger over higher 
property taxes on the democratic side former gov john carlin was 
favored to win the first round of a comeback bid 
two other states also held primaries michigan republicans 
picked opponents for two democratic incumbents seeking third terms 
gov james blanchard and sen carl levin polls showed rep bill 
schuette a heavy favorite over lawyer clark durant for the right to 
challenge levin state sen john engler was expected to trounce 
general motors engineer john lauve and earn a shot at blanchard 
and in missouri rep richard gephardt the house majority 
leader sought the democratic nomination for an eighth term against 
nicholas f clement a newspaper carrier who is a follower of 
extremist lyndon larouche 
young a former atlanta mayor congressman and us ambassador 
to the united nations finished 12 percentage points behind miller 
in the primary july 17 two polls released last week showed him 
trailing by as much as 20 points heading into the runoff 
that showing came in spite of an aggressive runoff strategy in 
which young suggested that miller a white moderate who has been 
lieutenant governor for 16 years pushed banking legislation that 
helped his friends 
miller 58 denied the charge and kept plugging away at the 
major themes of his campaign including support for a state lottery 
young also 58 conceded that the polls showed he would need a 
miracle to win but added pollsters have never known what 
theyre talking about 
the winner of the runoff faces republican johnny isakson in 
november democratic gov joe frank harris was barred by law from 
seeking a third consecutive term 
in kansas hayden 46 had five opponents for the gop 
nomination but polls indicated the one with the best shot at 
ousting him was weigand a wichita businessman with no political 
experience 
weigand 51 hit hard at haydens role in property reappraisal 
and implementing a new classification system that many blamed for 
big property tax increases in 1989 the changes were felt most by 
medium and small businesses 
carlin who served two terms in 197987 was challenged on the 
democratic side by longtime state treasurer joan finney and 
minister fred phelps 
sen nancy kassebaum had token opposition from political unknown 
gregory walstrom in her bid for the gop nomination to a third term 
the democratic senate ballot listed political newcomer dick 
williams of wichita and former rep bill roy who tried too late to 
remove his name

georgias runoff campaign took a negative turn when young 
shocked by a weakerthanexpected showing among black voters in the 
primary adopted a more aggressive strategy for the rematch 
he unleashed a series of attacks questioning millers ties to 
the banking industry and broadcast the first negative ad of the 
campaign season in georgia a spot accusing miller of changing 
positions on issues for political expediency the ad resurrected 
the appellation hung on miller in a campaign 10 years ago 
zigzag zell 
critics said youngs effort to woo white voters during the 
primary election and his failure to include more black elected 
officials in his campaign left some black voters feeling ignored 
the runoff required because no candidate won a majority in the 
primary has been challenged in court as discriminatory against 
blacks who make up about 28 percent of georgias voters 
in kansas weigand gained quick exposure by spending his own 
money lavishly in a 10week television blitz 
what nestor brought to this campaign is a million dollars and 
a million yard signs hayden said monday he has shown that 
hes weak on the issues and he really doesnt know much about 
government 
weigand said voters were tired of professional politicians who 
have created problems such as our property tax mess they want 
control of their government back and they dont want politicians 
telling them one thing and doing another 
the last kansas governor to be denied renomination was fred 
hall who lost the republican primary in 1956 
in michigan schuette virtually ignored durant attacking levin 
as too liberal on such issues as opposition to the death penalty 
republicans have not won a us senate election in michigan since 
1972 
similarly engler concentrated his fire on blanchard accusing 
him of using public relations gimmicks to put a shiny veneer over 
deep problems in michigans economy and state budget 
blanchard responded that he wiped out the 17 billion budget 
deficit he inherited after he was elected in 1982 and had moved to 
diversify the states economy improve education and fight crime 
with new prison construction

complying with unordered sanctions 
turkey on tuesday halted tankers from loading iraqi oil from iraqs 
last operating pipeline through the country 
the move effectively cut off the outlet for more than half of 
iraqis crude exports 
the government also announced it was freezing all iraqi and 
kuwaiti assets stopping all imports from those countries and 
limiting exports to food and medicine 
kuwaiti assets in turkey total about 25 million the foreign 
ministry said no figure was available for iraqi assets 
in imposing the measures turkey joined an international 
campaign intended to pressure iraq to withdraw its occupying forces 
from kuwait 
embargoes of iraqi products including oil had already forced 
iraq on monday to close one of its two pipelines that traverse 
turkey and carry oil to a terminal on the mediterranean it reduced 
the capacity of the second pipeline by 30 percent 
the twin pipelines had been carrying about 16 million barrels a 
day more than half iraqs total oil exports of 3 million barrels 
daily 
mehmet kececiler turkish minister in charge of oil affairs 
said iraq could continue to pump crude oil through the second 
pipeline until the storage tanks at the end terminal were filled 
the iraqis will be forced to stop pumping once the tanks are 
filled a process expected to take about six days he said 
otherwise this expensive stuff would just float around the 
minister said a tanker from morocco arrived at the terminal 
tuesday but was turned back kececiler said 
the united states japan and economic community imposed 
embargoes on iraqi oil in the past week turkey refused to do so 
until the un security council passed a resolution monday 
supporting global sanctions against iraq 
the minister said the security council vote was binding on all 
member states this is why we took this decision we were not 
pressured by anyone he said 
turkey stands to suffer substantial economic losses by complying 
with the sanctions iraq owes turkey 741 million and pays off part 
of its debt with oil 
foreign ministry officials said turkish contractors have 
construction equipment worth 40 million in iraq and that total 
contracts which are likely to be halted amount to 750 million

the pentagon sources said cheney also intended to sound out 
mubarak on the possibility of egyptian and other arab participation 
in a multinational ground force to be stationed in saudi arabia as 
a trip wire guarding against any aggression by the iraqi war 
machine against that oil kingdom

living conditions were growing more difficult said a kuwaiti 
businessman who fled his homeland through the desert backcountry to 
saudi arabia some iraqi troops are looting private houses and 
shops he said 
the proxy government installed by iraq in kuwait declared

the corrupt satellite regime installed by colonialism and

the riskladen iraq standoff is giving 
president bush a respite from partisan attacks on domestic issues 
and the potential for a major foreign policy trophy republican 
strategists say 
but democrats who have silenced their attacks to support bush 
for now contend the latest middle east crisis and its economic 
repercussions will eventually hurt the president at home 
analysts agree that bush is at a crucial defining point of his 
presidency facing a number of major challenges with the potential 
for dramatic and possibly devastating effects on an economy already 
teetering on recession and now the first significant postcold 
war military crisis 
no doubt hes got his hands full more than he has at any 
other time in his presidency said gop consultant charles black 
who is helping direct the republican party in the absence of ailing 
chairman lee atwater 
this is the type of foreign crisis that is very quickly 
domesticated in terms of us politics said stephen hess of the 
brookings institution bush is the one who has said watch how i 
handle my first real crisis and now hes got one 
the iraqi crisis presents daunting risks to the us economy and 
the stability of the middle east hess said but he said iraqs 
saddam hussein is a villain we love to hate which works in 
bushs favor 
key gop strategists acknowledged that the iraqi crisis is 
unusual because of its direct impact on oil prices and therefore on 
the us economy the primary factor in a presidents peacetime 
political fortunes 
because of that linkage and the likelihood of higher oil prices 
at least in the short term regardless of whether iraq withdraws 
from kuwait democratic strategists believe the economy and bush 
will suffer 
if he walks away he isnt showing any backbone and if he 
takes on iraq by definition he impacts on the price of energy 
badly which means a burden on the economy that almost surely will 
bring recession said democratic consultant bob beckel a 
presidents standing with the people depends on their pocketbooks 
and how they feel about the economy 
even before the iraqi invasion last thursday which immediately 
produced higher gas prices and talk of lines at the pumps there 
were growing signs of consumer unease with the economy 
that unease has been mirrored in financial markets wary because 
mounting data show a virtually idle economy and volatile because of 
bushs tax reversal stalled deficitreduction negotiations 
uncertainty over inflation and the rising cost of the savings and 
loan bailout 
add the iraqi crisis to that mix of domestic challenges 
confronting bush and democrats see the irony of ironies a 
republican president facing economic problems resembling those of 
jimmy carter the same problems that bush and ronald reagan often 
lumped together as symptoms of dreaded carterera malaise 
there are a lot of ducks to shoot out there and for a change 
theyre republican ducks said beckel 
black and bush pollster bob teeter argued that americans will 
not blame bush for economic hardships resulting from his hard line 
against iraq but will credit him for bold leadership if iraq backs 
down 
the public will understand that higher oil prices are not 
george bushs fault said teeter theres as much opportunity 
here as there is risk 
said black the end result of this will be a reinforcing of 
the view that george bush is the most qualified president we have 
had on foreign policy in modern times he also predicted bush 
will land on his feet in handling the related budgetary issues 
without any lasting economic harm 
democratic hopes for partisan gain seem pinned on a recession 
and the belief that bushs foreign policy credentials wont matter 
much to voters if the economy takes a dive 
for now democrats and for that matter i think everyone will 
be supportive of the president said democratic pollster harrison 
hickman 
but hickman said polls show people preoccupied with domestic 
problems and starting to stick some of the blame on bush the 
iraqi crisis said hickman wont negate that but it buys him 
some time because it diverts attention

mourners sporadically broke out of the funeral convoy of cars 
and pedestrians to attack arabs the citys entrance was briefly 
blocked near the cemetery a group of about 100 ultraorthodox 
jews stopped cars demanding the drivers show their identity cards 
many arabs stayed off their jobs in jerusalem after riots monday 
in which some 20 to 30 palestinians were reported injured 
one riot tuesday broke out after the funeral near karamanis 
home which is close to the arab village of beit tsafafa near 
jerusalem

allahu akbar or god is great and hurling stones at jewish

israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
dozens of other attacks were reported in jerusalem intensifying 
after dark when the funeral was over 
in an unsigned leaflet tuesday palestinian leaders condemned 
the killing of innocents on both sides but blamed the violence 
on the israeli occupation and the lack of progress in peace efforts 
the two slain youths who apparently were seized by palestinian 
militants while hitchhiking to a west bank settlement saturday 
were found monday after a twoday search 
in an apparently related development a palestinian woman was 
fatally shot tuesday morning as she rode in a car past kiryat arba 
a jewish west bank settlement 
police spokesman danny brinker said that officials suspect the 
woman 27yearold aziza salem jaber was slain by settlers in 
revenge for the killing of the two youths 
mrs jabers death would bring to 726 the number of palestinians 
slain by israelis in the uprising another 246 palestinians have 
been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating 
with israel fortyseven israelis have died

genial host of televisons fantasy island sued columbia 
pictures on tuesday for 10 millionplus claiming the studio 
didnt pay a promised 5 percent in profits 
the superior court lawsuit which seeks 10 million in punitive 
damages in addition to the profits claims the 19771983 series on 
abc earned more than 100 million and was one of the most 
successful in tv history 
the lawsuit charges that columbia pictures television and 
columbia pictures industries inc manipulated accounting practices 
to avoid paying montalban a portion of the profits 
the lawsuit said montalban was unaware of the alleged accounting 
practices until he got a distribution statement from the studio in 
1987 showing large and unwarranted interest charges on the cost 
of production and other items 
the lawsuit said the studio denies the show ever turned a profit 
the studio declined to comment on the lawsuit 
we are not aware of any suit but in any event it is not our

a business group asked the postal service 
tuesday to investigate whether postmasters violated lobbying rules 
by sending hundreds of letters defending the agencys performance 
and proposed postage rate hike 
about onethird of the letters were on postal service stationery 
and were mailed in envelopes marked official business 
according to the us chamber of commerce 
the chamber which was the recipient of the letters requested 
an investigation by the postal inspection service which protects 
postal funds and property and conducts audits 
we believe this matter must be investigated for two reasons 
chamber president richard l lesher said in a letter released 
tuesday to postal inspector mark grey of the agencys central 
division 
first postmasters may be violating lobbying restrictions 
contained in federal law second we believe this is an improper 
use of the postal services time money and resources lesher 
said 
the postal service says the letters were needed to refute a 
chamberpublished brochure against the proposed new 30cent stamp 
titled cancel this stamp the brochure invited the chambers 
member businesses to battle the rate increase and join the fight 
against waste in the postal service 
the brochure contained misinformation jim stordahl 
regional postal service spokesman said tuesday 
postmasters are not lobbying postmasters are setting the 
record straight with the facts stordahl said 
postal employees are no less entitled to seek accurate 
treatment of information than is the chamber to protest he said 
using official mail for this purpose is legitimate

economist cesar gaviria was sworn in 
tuesday as president of colombia and vowed to wage an unrelenting 
war without concessions against his countrys drug traffickers 
in remarks prepared for delivery the new president proposed 
setting up an international criminal court to try drug traffickers 
who he said were guilty of crimes against humanity 
gaviria was sworn in at 422 pm edt 
despite a ceasefire purportedly declared by drug traffickers 
last month security was tight for the inauguration ceremonies 
which were attended by 88 foreign delegations the united states 
was represented by vice president dan quayle who arrived tuesday 
morning 
four armored us blackhawk helicopters equipped with missiles 
accompanied quayles helicopter from the airport to an army base 
gaviria 43 who was elected in may to a fouryear term to 
replace president virgilio barco inherits a nation weary of its 
fight with terrorists and drug traffickers and looking for an end 
to the violence 
barco who was prohibitied by the constitution from running 
again received international praise for launching the governments 
war against drug traffickers one year ago barco will reportedly 
become colombias next ambassador to britain 
gaviria vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels 
drug trafficking is the main threat against our democracy we 
will fight it without concessions he said according to a text 
of his inauguration speech made available to reporters 
but he said colombia cannot win the fight alone and must 
receive help from the united states and western europe 
he said colombia is not a wealthy country and called on the 
major industrialized to lower their trade barriers to help colombia 
finance the drug war 
its not direct economic aid or military assistance we need 
most its fair treatment its free trade gaviria said 
he also said the united states and other countries must do more 
to cut consumption of cocaine 
no success is possible if the consuming countries do not 
achieve a substantial reduction in demand he said 
of the major candidates gaviria took the strongest stand in 
support of a continued hard line against the medellin and cali 
cocaine cartels which are believed to supply 80 percent of the 
cocaine reaching the united states he supports continued 
extradition of drug suspects to the united states 
gaviria became the candidate of the governing liberal party 
after the first candidate sen luis carlos galan was shot to 
death by drug lords in august 1989 sparking the government 
crackdown 
since then police have blamed drug traffickers for exploding 
about 300 bombs throughout colombia and killing about 500 people 
at 43 the demure gaviria is colombias youngest president a 
former finance minister from the liberal party he said repeatedly 
that achieving peace and fighting drug terrorism would be 
priorities 
gaviria also supports economic not military strength to fight 
the drug scourge observers expect him to ask for increased 
monetary aid from developed countries particularly the united 
states 
gaviria has said another way to solve colombias problems is to 
increase political participation of the left and other minority 
parties 
in naming his cabinet on monday he appeared to be doing just 
that 
the new ministers include five members of opposition parties 
including the m19 a former leftist guerrilla group that signed a 
peace treaty with the government in march 
the m19s antonio navarro became the first former guerrilla to 
occupy a cabinet post in colombia he is the minister of health 
about 20000 soldiers presidential guards and police officers 
patrolled the streets of bogota while army and police helicopter 
gunships circled above the city to provide protection during the 
inauguration 
antiaircraft guns were on hills overlooking the presidential 
palace army snipers stood on buildings throughout the downtown 
area and especially around the palace site of the inauguration 
troops at army roadblocks stopped and searched vehicles some 
major thoroughfares were closed 
the bogota daily newspaper el espectador said the blood types of 
visiting dignitaries and heads of state had been noted to ensure 
ample blood supplies if needed

minnesota and utah tied as the healthiest 
states in the nation while alaska was rated the least healthy in a 
study by northwestern national life health insurance co 
utah which had the no 1 ranking to itself in last years 
northwestern national study benefits from strong lifestyle 
activities according to a report issued tuesday mormon 
traditions that dominate utah life discourage smoking and other 
unhealthy habits 
the study which uses data from government agencies and health 
organizations was based on 17 statistical measures of health such 
as smoking traffic death rates and mortality indexes 
utah was no 1 for low prevalence of smoking and cancer rates 
it also ranked in the 10 best for violent crime rate which was 
five times less than the lowestranked florida favorable access to 
health care and aboveaverage mortality figures also strengthened 
its standing 
minnesota had the nations lowest motor vehicle death rate per 
100000 miles driven the 16th lowest violent crime rate and the 
19th lowest smoking rate 
the state was deemed sixth best in providing good access to 
medical care and it tied with utah for the third lowest overall 
mortality rate minnesotas infant mortality rate was the 10th 
lowest 
minnesota ranked third best for having relatively low disease 
rates that index included cancer heart disease and major 
infectious diseases such as aids 
contributing factors to alaskas 50th overall ranking were a 
high incidence of major infectious diseases and poor access to 
health care particularly primary care the study said but with 
the exception of high levels of smoking alaskans seem to have 
relatively health lifestyles 
overall scores ranked new hampshire third and hawaii fourth 
hawaiians had the longest life expectancy at birth with minnesotans 
the second longest based on federal studies using 1980 data 
fredric sattler vice president at the minneapolisbased 
northwestern national acknowledged that some people might be 
suspicious that minnesota came out on top in a study conducted by a 
minnesota company but he defended the findings 
we didnt know what wed find until we ran the numbers he 
said 
the top 11 states were very close sattler added 
im a bit surprised minnesota tied for no 1 but not 
shocked said paul gunderson chief of health statistics at the 
minnesota department of health i would have expected us to be in 
the top six minnesotans can feel very good about this but there 
certainly is space for improvements 
minnesotans scored in the bottom half of the national ranking in 
only one of the 17 categories acuteillness visits to the doctor 
while minnesota had the 41st highest rate of such visits the 
report noted that the difference between the highestranked and 
lowestranked states was small 
sattler said a key aim of the study is to show where 
improvements can be made

marlon brandos son pleaded innocent 
tuesday to murdering his sisters lover and his lawyer asked to 
lower christian brandos 10 million bail 
we are going to ask that christian not be singled out and 
treated differently than anyone else would be in a similar 
situation said attorney robert l shapiro 
an average prisoner in such a case would post between 50000 
and 100000 he said 
superior court judge david perez said he would consider the bail 
proposal at a hearing thursday 
shapiro made the move to win freedom for his client after the 
32yearold brando answered yes to a number of questions 
concerning his innocent plea to charges of first degree murder and 
possession of a machine gun 
his case was moved to superior court after a municipal court 
judge found there was sufficient evidence to hold him for trial 
the courtroom was jammed with spectators friends of brando 
reporters and even tourists who wandered in from the beach hoping 
to get a glimpse of the defendants famous father but marlon 
brando who has attended several previous hearings didnt show 
prosecutors argued previously for no bail saying if brando is 
freed he may attempt to flee the country two weeks ago another 
judge set the 10 million bail taking into consideration his 
fathers vast wealth 
as a condition of the bail the judge required that brando 
surrender his passport but brando maintains it was lost during a 
move from an apartment into his fathers house 
deputy district attorney steven barshop noted then that brandos 
20yearold halfsister cheyenne brando recently went to tahiti 
officials say she is unwilling to return to testify at her 
brothers trial 
brando is accused of killing miss brandos 26yearold tahitian 
lover dag drollet during an argument may 16 at the brando estate 
miss brando gave birth june 30 in tahiti to drollets son 
shapiro maintains that christian brando was drunk and the 
shooting was an accident that occurred when he and drollet fought 
over a gun he indicated tuesday that would continue to be the 
defense

president bush today ordered the deployment of 
us troops to saudi arabia to help protect the oilrich kingdom 
from iraq a pentagon source said 
a separate source said the deployment would be part of a 
multinational force 
the disclosure came as the white house said there was an 
imminent threat to saudi arabia but would not confirm any 
military maneuvers the us government is prepared for 
eventualities and doing planning as appropriate said spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
one report said some us troops had been on the ground in saudi 
arabia for several hours the united states was counting on 
egyptian troops to join the international group aiding saudi 
defense 
pentagon sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
expected army troops from several points to be readied for movement 
to the middle east including airborne units from ft bragg nc 
as well as troops from fort stewart ga and fort campbell ky 
there was no immediate word on the size of the deployment 
the airborne divisions will be used to secure air bases so that 
other troops aircraft and equipment can be sent in later sources 
said 
aside from possible deployment of troops the administration was 
exploring the possibility of an international blockade to choke off 
trade in and out of iraq in an effort to reverse its invasion of 
kuwait 
one key source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
saudis had responded positively to defense secretary richard 
cheneys request that a multinational military force including

defense secretary dick cheney was wrapping up talks in egypt 
that sources said focused on a coordinated military response to the 
persian gulf crisis including the possibility of a multinational 
ground force in saudi arabia as a trip wire against further 
iraqi military moves 
pentagon sources speaking on condition of anonymity also said 
cheney was seeking approval to move the aircraft carrier uss 
eisenhower with its complement of sophisticated aircraft 
through the suez canal cheney who stopped earlier in saudi 
arabia was expected back in washington on wednesday 
at the white house fitzwater said bush had told his cabinet 
earlier in the day that he views the iraqi troops lined up in 
kuwait facing saudi arabia as a threat to the united states 
security interests 
that has been our message to saudi arabia and we believe that 
they understand that 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
said an international naval blockade is very likely unless the 
iraqis back off 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said secretary of 
state james a baker iii already planning a trip to turkey on 
wednesday would go to nato headquarters in brussels on friday to 
meet with allied foreign ministers 
what is going on there affects the entire free world and it is 
appropriate nato meet to discuss the overall implications she 
said 
the international campaign to implement a united nationsbacked 
trade embargo against saddam gained ground when turkey announced it 
had stopped tankers from loading iraqi oil from the last operating 
pipeline through its country 
but the soviets urged caution a buildup in the military 
presence and naval muscleflexing in such a very tense and very 
complex situation is not the best line of action a foreign 
ministry spokesman said in moscow 
the bush administration said it would scrutinize the increase in 
gasoline prices at home since the iraqi invasion and three 
congressional committees conducted hearings on the topic 
saddam hussein might not be the only greedy person in this 
picture said rep phil sharp dind 
bush who called monday for full and total implementation of 
the united nationsbacked trade embargo went to cia headquarters 
later in the day for briefings on the middle east and other 
matters he again refused to respond to questions from reporters 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had said this 
blockade talk is premature and that the administration was 
committed to carrying out the trade embargo approved monday 
we expect them to work fitzwater said about the un 
sanctions 
the competing congressional hearings seemed designed to gain 
media attention as well as explore the increase in gasoline prices 
energy department official john easton told one session that oil 
supplies are at the highest level in nine years and rebuffed 
suggestions that the administration tap the strategic petroleum 
reserve in an attempt to bring down prices 
as iraq announced a 100000troop increase in its 
1millionmember armed forces the us military moved aircraft 
carriers into position outside the persian gulf 
carriers are outfitted with a range of fa18 hornet jet 
fighters f14 tomcat attack aircraft and a6e intruder bombers 
including specially outfitted ka6d jets to handle aerial refueling 
missions 
diplomatic contacts continued between washington and baghdad 
us officials were discussing with iraq a plan to allow the 
departure of some of the estimated 500 americans stranded in 
baghdad including some of the 50 americans at the us embassy 
the washington post quoted an unidentified administration 
official as saying saddam warned the us charge daffaires joseph 
wilson that he wouldattack saudi arabia if his pipelines through 
that country are closed 
but state department sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity denied the published report 
fitzwater would not give details of wilsons talks with saddam 
or confirm that the iraqi ruler had delivered such a warning 
nunn a georgia democrat said today that a naval blockade of 
iraq is very likely unless the iraqis back off and start moving 
out of kuwait 
we need to get to get their military forces out of kuwait i 
think that is the most important thing now because they threaten 
saudi arabia in doing that though we have to have the 
cooperation of the saudis in terms of helping with the blockade or 
embargo and that cooperation itself makes it more likely the 
iraqis will take some action the georgia democrat told cbs news 
the aircraft carrier saratoga was leaving mayport fla on a 
weeklong voyage to the gulf region the battleship wisconsin was 
to leave norfolk va for the same area 
they would join the carriers independence and eisenhower which 
pentagon sources said had moved within range to launch warplanes 
down the persian gulf to reach iraqi targets

the justice department suffering heartburn 
over a plan by the maker of peptobismol to acquire the exclusive 
sales rights for maalox filed suit tuesday to stop the 
stomachremedy alliance 
the justice department sought a court injunction under the 
clayton antitrust act to prevent procter amp gamble co which makes 
peptobismol from acquiring the exclusive rights to market and 
distribute maalox

of peptobismol last year or 14 percent of the domestic retail 
market domestic sales of maalox totalled 111 million last year or 
12 percent of the market 
under the proposal procter amp gamble would acquire the exclusive 
rights to market and sell maalox and an option to purchase the 
manufacturing assets from rhonepulenc rorer which is based in ft 
washington pa the deal would make procter amp gamble the largest 
seller of stomach remedies in the us market according to the

the united states could get enough energy from 
the wind sun trees and rivers to eliminate dependence on oil 
imported from countries like iraq proponents of renewable energy 
said tuesday 
we should really have learned a lesson 17 years ago when the 
first arab oil embargo struck the united states in october 1973 
ken bossong of the public interest group public citizen told a news 
conference it is strategically dangerous and economically costly 
to rely on imported oil 
bossong urged state and federal government action to encourage 
increased use of wind power solar energy and biomass to reduce oil 
consumption thus diminishing reliance on imports 
the cheapest safest cleanest option overall is simply 
improving energy efficiency he said 
already renewable sources account for about 10 percent of the 
energy produced in the united states according to a public citizen 
study published in june nearly half comes from hydroelectric 
projects but oncemarginal projects like windmills woodfired 
generators and solar heaters are growing fast it found 
i think we could wean ourselves off fossil fuels if we had a 
commitment on the federal level said scott sklar director of 
the solar energy industries association who also spoke at the news 
conference 
sklar said tougher environmental laws a tax on carbondioxide 
producing fuels and other government initiatives could give 
renewable energy sources the boost they need to displace imported 
oil

venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
promised tuesday to do everything he could to make up crude oil 
supplies lost by iraqs invasion of kuwait a us official said 
the venezuelan president also said other opec nations will try 
to add to supplies and push down prices the official reported 
this official is traveling with vice president dan quayle who 
conferred with perez while both were in bogota for the inauguration 
of cesar gaviria as president of colombia 
the official reported afterward on condition of anonymity that 
perez had said there will be no problem in making up for about 
45 million barrels of oil a day that had been flowing from iraq 
and kuwait roughly 10 percent of world supply now under an 
international embargo 
perez was quoted as telling quayle that venezuela would deliver 
an additional 500000 barrels a day he said that venezuela and 
other opec states were working to stabilize oil prices at or near 
the cartels reference price of 21 a barrel 
the price has soared to 28 dollars a barrel and more since the 
invasion 
venezuela is a major oil producer averaging 188 million 
barrels a day last year or about what kuwait supplied fortysix 
percent of venezuelas output was sent to the united states 
its not good for anyone if there are rapid fluctuations 
perez was said to have told quayle 
the official said that perez told quayle he had been in constant 
communication with other opec nations since saddam husseins thrust 
into kuwait and that they agreed to make up shortages no other 
nations were specified 
this is welcome news quayle was quoted as telling perez 
after a meeting and lunch at the venezuelan embassy 
quayle also conferred with carlos menem of argentina with 
gaviria and with brazilian officials attending the inauguration 
urging that they join in withholding weapons and technology from 
iraq 
after a 5hour flight from washington to a heavily guarded 
airfield outside the city quayle went by helicopter into bogota to 
meet gaviria at the bogota bank building that houses his transition 
office 
security was tight at every step in the capital of a country 
that has been ravaged by drugrelated violence gaviria entered the 
presidential race after a leading candidate was assassinated 
i thank you for the gesture of coming gaviria told quayle 
we have the will always to have good relations with the united 
states 
quayle praised both gaviria and outgoing president virgilio 
barco for the colombian stand against drug trafficking he also 
lauded the colombians for sponsoring a united nations resolution to 
punish the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
saddam husseins invasion of kuwait cannot stand will not 
stand quayle told a news conference he said gaviria agreed with 
that 
the inaugural ceremony was the first stop on quayles threeday 
trip to the andean cocaineproducing nations a followup to 
president bushs february drug summit with the presidents of 
colombia peru and bolivia

the united states places on our continuing partnership with 
colombia quayle said

administration will continue the fight begun by barco 
the vice president said he agreed with gaviria that extradition 
of colombian cocaine traffickers to face trial in the united states 
isnt the only answer to the cocaine problem

the government announced a plan tuesday to let 
some businesses and organizations trade rubles for foreign currency 
at market rates in a step toward making the ruble convertible 
the ruble is not traded on world foreign currency exchanges and 
its convertibility is seen as essential to real economic reform in 
the soviet union 
the action announced tuesday would establish currency markets in 
the soviet union beginning jan 1 the official tass news agency 
said it said the soviet council of ministers or cabinet took the 
decision on saturday 
legal enterprises and organizations but apparently not 
individuals would be permitted to buy and sell foreign currency 
in exchange for rubles at rates established by banks currency 
auctions and other operations tass said 
it did not say what the other operations would be or what other 
limits and controls would be placed on such markets 
currency auctions have been held in the soviet union in the past 
among some soviet enterprises 
tass said the decision to set up a currency market was prompted 
by preparations for the soviet unions transition to a regulated 
market economy the governments plan for such a transition is to 
go before the soviet legislature next month 
tass did not say whether the government planned further 
devaluations of the ruble 
the government last devalued the ruble on nov 1 1989 it was 
devalued from 159 to 16 cents for travelers cash exchanges the 
higher rate remains on commercial transactions 
officials said then that the official rate of 159 was not 
realistic on the black market tourists can receive up to 20 times 
as many rubles for their convertible currency as in state bank 
outlets 
western economists say the ruble cannot become truly convertible 
until the soviet union establishes a market pricing system for all 
its goods and allows free crossborder trade they also say it is 
not possible to have a convertible currency in a controlled market 
development of the market relations in the currency sphere 
will help to overcome tight limits of the principle of hard 
currency selfrepayment to make currency resources more easily 
available for all enterprises and organizations and in advancing 
toward convertibility of the ruble tass said 
tass said the currency exchanges will be set up in moscow as 
well as in other soviet republics with the soviet state bank 
controlling operations 
on aug 1 soviet citizens were given permission to spend 
foreign currency at special shops without telling the government 
where they got the money 
in addition a special network of stores is to be set up where 
soviet enterprises as well as citizens will be able to buy 
imported and domestic goods for hard currency

the un security council began work on 
tuesday to enforce the worldwide economic boycott it ordered 
against iraq but so far the only weapon in the un arsenal is 
moral persuasion 
the 15member council began informal consultations on forming a 
committee to monitor compliance by the member states with the 
sanctions resolution adopted monday 
we already are in an enforcement mode said a un official 
if the security council decides on military steps it could call 
for an international blockade of iraq to force iraqi invaders to 
withdraw from kuwait but diplomats said tuesday they hoped iraq 
would heed international will and force would not be necessary 
like many of the sources the diplomats and un official spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
publication of a members failure to comply with the sanctions 
is one of the strongest moves the united nations can make unless 
it votes to take military action 
president bush on tuesday ordered deployment of us troops to 
saudi arabia to help protect the oilrich kingdom from iraq a 
pentagon source said iraqs increasingly isolated president saddam 
hussein has rejected foreign pressure to withdraw his forces from 
kuwait 
a separate source in washington said the us deployment would 
be part of a multinational force 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar cabled copies of the 
councils resolution to all 159 un members monday and informed 
them the sanctions were legally binding 
he was expected to request soon that all members inform him in 
detail of steps they have taken to enforce the sanctions he is to 
report to the council in 30 days 
the united nations has no means of enforcing the resolution and 
must rely on the good will of member states and international 
pressure 
the resolution one of the strongest ever adopted by the 
council calls for a worldwide ban on oil purchases from iraq a 
general trade embargo freezing of iraqi and kuwaiti assets and a 
halt to all military arms sales and aid to iraq 
it asks member states to supply information requested about 
their trade financial and military relations with iraq 
canadian ambassador l yves fortier told the council monday 
the sanctions resolution would impose hardships on many 
countries public and private organizations and individuals 
throughout the world but sacrifices are necessary to maintain the 
peace and security of states and the integrity of the international 
system 
the un boycott of iraq was only the third time since the world 
body was founded 45 years ago that the security council imposed 
sanctions on a member state in 1977 an arms embargo was imposed 
on south africa in an effort to force the government to dismantle 
apartheid in 1967 the council imposed a comprehensive embargo 
against the white minority government of rhodesia which later 
became zimbabwe 
if sanctions dont work the security council could meet again 
and call for international military action against iraq

the rating controversy that hit the film 
industry two months ago is invading home video bringing both worry 
and new opportunities to the videocassette business 
blockbuster video the nations leading chain with 12 percent of 
video rentals refuses to carry xrated titles and wont take an 
rrated version of the cook the thief his wife amp her lover 
a number of independent stores facing labeling legislation are 
concerned about the proliferation of unrated films 
it will be impossible to distribute frankenhooker in video 
stores if we cant get an r rating james glickenhaus chairman 
of shapiro glickenhaus entertainment said tuesday during the video 
software dealers association convention here 
the film which he called a horror comedy not an adult 
film was rated x by the motion picture association of america 
the rating is being appealed 
rhino home video which will distribute the videocassette the 
best of comic relief 90 fears some of the comedians rough 
language in the video will yield rough sales 
i think there are people who will get uptight about it said 
rhino vice president arny schorr because comic relief was first 
shown on cables home box office it was not submitted to the mpaa 
and therefore bears no rating 
the rating system works only for theatrical releases schorr 
said 
many small companies do not submit directtovideo movies to the 
mpaa ratings board which charges about 1000 to rate films 
according to the mpaa 25 states are considering legislation 
aimed at making stores display cassette ratings titles with no 
ratings everything from jane fonda exercise tapes to lowbudget 
slasher films like three on a meathook would have to carry 
norating stickers in most of those states 
vidmark entertainment will release its controversial the cook 
the thief in two versions unrated and rrated company 
representatives say that blockbuster video wont take the rrated 
version and has yet to decide on the unrated edition 
for many filmmakers the home video market gives them a chance 
to release their movies the way they intended without making cuts 
needed for an r rating in theaters 
according to steven apple executive editor of the trade 
publication video insider renters are likely to prefer the unrated 
versions of angel heart and wild orchid to the rrated cuts 
of the same films 
one company 10th avenue video is producing softcore movies it 
hopes will satisfy customers in markets where adult films are 
either banned or hidden in a back corner the companys new 
release intimate lessons is actually a more modest version of 
the hardcore film veil 
we want to ride the line on this said 10th avenues bill 
nash we want a husband and wife to watch this and not have the 
wife say why did you bring this piece of trash home the film 
about strippers he said can also be sold in massmarket stores 
that do not stock adult films 
turner home video seeking to cut the cost of ratings and find 
more descriptive classifications submits its video releases to the 
film advisory board 
in may spanish filmmaker pedro almodovars film tie me up 
tie me down attracted a storm of controversy before its release 
in this country the mpaa ratings board recoiled at a graphic sex 
scene and dealt the film an x rating an appeal failed to reverse 
the decision 
fab ratings include m for mature and ao for adults only the fab 
rating system unlike the mpaa describes content too listing 
degrees of nudity violence and substance abuse treasure 
island earned an f for family as opposed to a c for children

a defiant saddam hussein vowed tuesday 
that he will never back down despite growing international pressure 
to withdraw his forces from kuwait 
the iraqi president said last weeks invasion was meant to 
correct flawed borders drawn up by the colonial powers that left a 
corrupt minority in control of the arabian peninsulas rich oil 
reserves while the arab masses suffered 
he said he would reject any foreign pressure for him to pull his 
forces out of kuwait 
we would rather die than be humiliated and we will pluck out 
the eyes of those who attack the arab nation saddam said in a 
speech read by an annnouncer for baghdad radio monitored in 
nicosia 
the speech reiterated much of the rhetoric saddam has been using 
since first launching a blistering verbal attack against the 
kuwaiti royal family july 17 two weeks before thursdays invasion 
the kuwait invasion has ushered in a new period in which the 
sun will shine on us in the coming days saddam said 
in his speech saddam apparently tried to play on the resentment 
felt by many poorer arabs toward the oilrich sheiks 
saddam said the colonial powers drew up the borders of middle 
east nations to keep the population centers away from the regions 
wealth of natural resources 
britain and france were the main colonial powers who helped 
reshape the map of the middle east after world war i eliminated 
turkish dominance over the region 
saddam said the colonial powers left the minority with a vast 
amount of rich reserves of the area it did not own while the 
majority fell in need due to their wealth the minority made 
corrupt decisions in alliance with the west which saddam said 
was worse than falling under foreign occupation 
saddam said the kuwaiti invasion carried on the tradition of 
iraqi victories that started with the gulf war with iran in 198088 
that war ended in a ceasefire in august 1988 and no peace 
treaty has been signed more than 100000 prisoners of war remain 
to be exchanged and the disputed shatt alarab iraqs main outlet 
to the gulf remains blocked 
saddam has claimed the war as a major victory even though he did 
not gain control over the shatt alarab his initial objective in 
starting the war or gain much territory from iran

iraq has been jamming the arabiclanguage 
broadcasts of the voice of america for the past three days the 
station announced tuesday 
the governmentfunded radio station said it will try to bypass 
the interruption by beaming its programs to iraq through satellite 
television broadcasts starting tuesday night 
iraqis can tune in to these radio broadcasts on their television 
sets if they have a satellite dish or access to one through a local 
tv station voas deputy director robert coonrod said many iraqis 
have such access 
iraq is also jamming the bbcs arabiclanguage radio programs 
from england coonrod said the englishlanguage programs of the 
voa and bbc have not been blocked he said 
the jamming affects all voas broadcasts to the middle east 
including the persian gulf and jordan he said egypt is partly 
affected too 
voa is increasing the number of hours it broadcasts in arabic to 
the middle east from seven and ahalf daily to nearly 10 and 
replacing the music programs with more news coonrod said the 
broadcasts have been heavy on news about the iraqi invasion of 
kuwaiti and international efforts to punish president saddam 
hussein 
we want iraqis to have accurate uncensored information 
coonrod said 
iraq is a police state and the media is governmentcontrolled 
and severely restricted 
satellite transmissions too can be jammed but experts say 
iraq would need to jam the entire indian ocean satellite in order 
to block voa 
voa officials hope the experiment with iraq succeeds as it did 
in china last summer after chinese authorities jammed the voas 
short and mediumwave broadcasts during beijings crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement 
coonrod said iraq is using a type of sophisticated technique 
called bubble jamming which was used to block radio programs 
from iran during the eightyear war between the two countries

leaders of the two germanys and their 
political rivals opted for a parliamentary showdown rather than a 
compromise tuesday to determine the exact date of german unity 
as politicians feuded over whether unity in september or october 
would best help the beleaguered east germans a senior official 
warned that east german economy is falling into chaos and 
conditions will only get worse 
reiner gohlke who is overseeing east germanys economic reform 
attempts was quoted by the east german newspaper neue zeit as 
saying the situation is worse than i had thought we have chaos 
nothing is running normally 
a major lobbying group the west german association of industry 
and trade demanded that unity come as soon as possible before 
east germanys economy collapses every day of divided political 
responsibility in both parts of germany prolongs troubles in east 
germany it said in a statement 
east germany meanwhile announced that joblessness nearly 
doubled within a month spiraling to 272017 
deteriorating economic and social conditions in east germany are 
central to the political dispute in both german states over when 
unity and allgerman elections should occur 
west german chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday rejected demands 
by the opposition social democrats that the two countries merge by 
sept 15 and elections for an allgerman parliament be held on dec 
2 
kohl told reporters after meeting social democratic leaders he 
will not budge from his plan for allgerman elections and 
simultaneous unity on oct 14 
he said his east german christian democratic allies led by 
prime minister lothar de maiziere will propose a parliamentary 
resolution on wednesday supporting unity and elections on oct 14 
on thursday his own coalition will make a similar proposal in the 
bundestag west germanys parliament he added 
east germanys social democrats who are in de maizieres 
coalition plan to offer their own measure on wednesday calling for 
german unity by sept 15 and elections later 
richard schroeder parliamentary chief of the east german social 
democrats told reporters in east berlin his party and de maiziere 
were in insurmountable disagreement 
in bonn kohl said he still plans to seek a change in west 
germanys constitution to allow elections on oct 14 under 
constitutional constraints dec 2 would be the earliest for new 
elections 
but kohl needs social democratic support for the twothirds 
parliamentary majority he needs for a constitutional change and 
that opposition party swears he will not get his twothirds 
both sides claim their respective unity and elections time 
proposals are best for helping out troubled east germany 
the social democrats claim kohl wants the earlier election date 
because he fears voters will turn against him as east germanys 
economy erodes 
kohl says separating unity from elections could have bad 
psychological effects on east germans who want the two to occur 
simultaneously

as many as 1000 poor city students could be 
enrolled in private schools with state money this fall say 
supporters who won a court challenge of the nations first school 
voucher plan 
however opponents including wisconsins top education offical 
said theyd appeal the ruling before the program takes effect this 
fall 
dane county circuit judge susan steingass on monday ruled the 
program was legal because it aims to improve education to the 
benefit of the entire state thereby filling the public 
purpose requirement of wisconsins constitution 
the program approved by the legislature and signed by gov 
tommy thompson last spring provides up to 2500 in state money 
per pupil to let poor milwaukee schoolchildren attend nonsectarian 
private schools 
this years budget includes funding to be deducted from the 
citys school budget for 1000 students who would receive 
vouchers from the state milwaukee has about 97000 students 
the average yearly tuition to a milwaukee private school is 
about 3200 
state school superintendent herbert grover and the wisconsin 
education association council the states largest teachers union 
said the program undermines public education and that private 
schools are not fully accountable to the state 
grover the union and the national association for the 
advancement of colored people filed a lawsuit seeking to block the 
subsidies 
steingass said grover exceeded his authority in devising 
requirements for participating private schools and ordered him to 
carry out the legislatures intent 
grover said tuesday he was disappointed with the ruling but 
anticipated it would be appealed the unions president also said 
an appeal was likely 
were going to have two school systems in this state and both 
paid for by public money he said one will have accountability 
and one wont 
however the programs sponsor called the ruling a victory for 
parents and students 
this is the right thing to do we are trying to save our 
children that our dying right now because the milwaukee public 
schools are not doing their job said rep polly williams 
the children are going to be in these schools this year she 
said 
about 10 private schools in milwaukee with students in 
kindergarten through eighth grade would participate in the 
program they were deluged with student applicants she said 
one of the participants urban day school accepted about 100 
student transfers but had to reject another 200 because of a lack 
of room executive director zakiya courtney said tuesday 
theres some disappointment for parents whose children could 
not get in the school ms courtney said but those parents who 
did get are elated because now their children have the same 
opportunity that others have had but they could not afford in the 
past

an iraqi airways jet carrying 78 foreigners 
and some iraqis arrived here tuesday the first commercial flight 
allowed out of iraq since it invaded kuwait a japanese embassy 
spokesman said 
no americans were on the flight 
thousands of westerners remain stranded in kuwait and iraq since 
iraq invaded kuwait on thursday 
in london a foreign office spokesman said iraq has offered to 
allow britons in baghdad on shortterm visas to leave it was not 
clear if the offer included several hundred foreigners rounded up 
in kuwait and taken to iraq including americans britons west 
germans and a spaniard 
those rounded up included 350 passengers on a british airways 
flight bound for malaysia that was caught in the unrest in kuwait 
a british airways spokeswoman said a substantial number of 
those passengers arrived safely in baghdad on monday among the 
passengers were 28 americans who also turned up in a baghdad hotel 
and appear to be fine a us official said in washington 
we do not know what is happening to people after they arrive 
in baghdad said the british airways spokeswoman 
thirtyfour british servicemen and an oil field worker picked up 
in kuwait over the weekend are being held in baghdad 
the iraqi offer appeared to apply only to tourists and 
businessmen but not to british residents in iraq said the foreign 
office spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman added they were trying to confirm and clarify the 
iraqi offer 
those allowed to leave would probably travel through jordan 
which has told the foreign office that it would receive people and 
grant them visas 
we are making preparations to receive a huge number of 
people said one jordanian official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
until tuesday there had been no indication of what plans iraqi 
president saddam hussein has for foreigners in occupied kuwait or 
iraq 
iraqs ambassador to greece abdel fatah al khereji said 
tuesday any foreigners in kuwait who wish to leave can do so 
by land from iraq through turkey or jordan 
the first large group of foreigners to arrive from baghdad were 
those on board the iraqi airways flight which arrived at queen 
alia international airport 30 miles south of amman the jordanian 
capital at 615 pm the japanese diplomat said 
most of the foreigners on the flight were japanese tourists who 
were visiting iraq the diplomat said also on board the boeing 727 
jetliner were two belgians a spaniard a dutchman an italian as 
well as 34 members of an iraqi soccer team he said 
we are very happy that we are in jordan said masyi yoshiko 
a computer clerk from tokyo it was very difficult for me to be 
in a country at war 
ms yoshiko 42 said the group did not feel threatened at all 
after iraqi forces invaded kuwait on thursday but were not allowed 
to leave their hotel for five days 
we enjoyed our stay in the hotel she said iraqi people 
were not bad the people and police were very good with us 
the embassy spokesman said the plane was supposed to fly on to 
vienna after refueling but the austrian government denied landing 
rights 
the un security council on monday voted sanctions that impose 
a ban on trade and financial contacts with iraq 
hundreds of foreigners are expected to flood into jordan in the 
next two days once iraqi authorities ease travel restrictions for 
foreigners stranded by the invasion 
iraqs borders and airports were completely closed the only 
people to escape from kuwait since saturday used obscure desert 
routes into saudi arabia 
a kuwaiti businessman said about 1000 people a day were fleeing 
kuwait through the desert to saudi arabia the businessman who 
arrived in london on a british airways flight from bahrain today 
said kuwaitis and expatriates including westerners were joining 
convoys to escape the iraqi forces 
earlier tuesday jordans information minister ibrahim 
izzedine said the us government had asked jordan to facilitate 
the entrance from iraq of american diplomats and their dependents 
us embassy officials said about 12 diplomats in addition to 
their dependents are expected to arrive in jordan from iraq on 
wednesday 
the provisional government of free kuwait set up by iraq had 
threatened sunday to hold hostage citizens of countries imposing 
sanctions on it 
kuwaits ambassador in london said that despite the iraqi 
assurances about allowing foreigners to leave iraq might choose to 
hold some westerners as a bargaining chip 
he saddam will choose some to keep said ambassador ghazi 
alrayes said he cant afford to keep 5000 or 10000 hostages 
he will keep americans europeans whatever nationalities he thinks 
are valuable 
maybe he will behave like anyone who hijacks a plane he has 
hijacked a country 
a us diplomat said washington had instructed american 
citizens living in or visiting iraq and kuwait to leave when 
circumstances permit

a naval blockade to sever iraqs oil lifeline 
may be the best hope for pushing saddam hussein out of kuwait but 
it would require hundreds of ships and perhaps months of 
enforcement military experts said tuesday 
meanwhile government sources said president bush was 
dispatching american warplanes and ground troops to saudi arabia 
where they were to be joined by forces from egypt and morocco in an 
effort to discourage iraq from pushing on into kuwaits larger 
neighbor 
while that move was being made and talk continued of a united 
nationssanctioned blockade by us european and perhaps soviet 
forces other more drastic and risky military options were 
available experts said 
among the options 
launch air strikes on iraqi oil fields iraqs economy is built 
on oil destroying the oil production facilities would be 
tantamount to destroying the economy 
bomb troop supply lines in southern iraq the purpose would be 
to isolate the 100000man iraqi occupation force in kuwait by 
preventing supplies and reinforcements from crossing the border 
engage the iraqis in a fullscale air and land battle in kuwait 
and iraq experts say this would be highly costly and would risk 
starting an arabisraeli war 
the un security council voted 130 on monday to impose a 
worldwide ban on trade with iraq bush hinted afterward that he was 
prepared to order a naval blockade to enforce that embargo if iraq 
finds a way to circumvent it 
these sanctions will be enforced no matter what it takes 
bush said monday 
vice adm henry c mustin a recently retired deputy chief of 
naval operations said in an interview that an international naval 
blockade of iraqs three main oil outlets in the mediterranean 
sea the persian gulf and the red sea would be the best military 
option so long as saddam has not invaded saudi arabia 
mustin added however that a blockade would run the risk of 
triggering actual combat 
a blockade is an act of war to effect a blockade you have to 
enforce it he said 
if the united states set a blockade on its own the operation 
would take probably most of the us navy meaning several 
hundred ships and tens of thousands of sailors mustin said 
reconnaissance aircraft would be needed to ensure that tankers 
in the gulf not carrying iraqi or kuwaiti oil actually arrived at 
their stated destinations 
a joint operation with european allies would be more effective 
mustin said the washington post reported tuesday that the pentagon 
had proposed an international blockade that would include soviet 
ships but a soviet foreign ministry spokesman said i dont 
think that we are thinking about such an idea 
the united states has two aircraft carrier groups in the gulf 
area and a third on the way it also has a group of eight naval 
ships inside the gulf britain has one ship in the gulf and two 
more due by weeks end on tuesday a french naval destroyer sailed 
into the suez canal enroute to the gulf by way of the red sea 
journalists in helicopters reported spotting a soviet destroyer 
nearing the straits of hormuz the narrow entrance to the gulf from 
the arabian sea 
gen jack merritt recently retired from the army and a former 
us representative to natos highest military council said he 
doubted that either a naval blockade or carrierbased air strikes 
against iraqi economic targets would be enough 
of the chances of dislodging the iraqi army from kuwait with air 
power alone merritt said just forget it 
merritt said that if bushs goal is to deter saddam from 
striking at saudi arabia the administration should already be 
moving ground and air forces into the gulf area from western 
europe the united states has no military bases in the area 
in the event the 1 millionstrong iraqi army moved on saudi 
arabia the united states would be compelled to engage in a ground 
war merritt said that would require perhaps 500000 us troops 
plus large numbers of attack aircraft and bombers he said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said tuesday that in addition to preparing for a 
possible naval blockage of iraq the bush administration should be 
trying to persuade egypt or other arab nations to participate in a 
multinational ground force deterrent in saudi arabia 
i think its enormously important this not simply be a 
saudius operation nunn told cbs news we need our allies 
involved but the saudis also need the indigenous arab forces that 
will come to their aid 
nunns counterpart in the house rep les aspin dwis said 
sending us troops to saudi arabia as a tripwire or deterrent 
force would a high risk option one that would mean an 
american commitment to allout war with iraq 
the message to mr hussein would be if you attack those 
american troops right along that line i mean that is war right to 
the end

richard secord who ran the illegal contra supply 
network for oliver north testified tuesday that the state 
department and the cia were briefed on the operation several times 
secord and miamibased southern air transport are being sued by 
eugene hasenfus of marinette wis the only survivor of the 
october 1986 cargo plane crash in nicaragua that helped expose the 
network supplying nicaraguan rebels 
secord who pleaded guilty to lying to congress about the 
irancontra scandal and is serving probation took the stand as a 
hostile witness for hasenfus he quickly sought to play down his 
control over the network and its finances 
secord said he ran the operation in conjunction with the white 
house and some private companies 
when congress moved toward again granting lethal aid to the 
contras in the fall of 1986 it was decided to turn the private 
supply operation over to the cia he said 
it was my understanding that there were several interagency 
meetings including the state department and the cia secord 
testified 
he sparred with hasenfus attorney brian strange over his control 
of swiss bank accounts through which money from the iran arms sale 
was funneled to the supply operation 
strange read secord his 1987 congressional testimony saying he 
had verbal control over the accounts secord eventually conceded 
that point 
but he bristled when asked if he was to keep the profits left in 
those accounts when the government took over later in 1986 
i dont think ive ever taken that position he said 
although he agreed the enterprise would keep whatever money 
remained 
after a lunch break strange asked secord if within the past 
month he had transferred 92000 from the sale of spare contra 
supply plane parts to his personal account 
after the judge overruled objections to the question secord 
responded yes 
my attorneys offered to settle secord said before senior 
us district judge c clyde atkins interrupted him secord 
apparently referred to meetings before the trial in which the two 
sides attempted to reach a settlement 
atkins has ruled that strange may refer to secords conviction 
to attack his credibility and strange did secord had pleaded 
guilty to lying to congressional investigators about money north 
received from the enterprise 
jurors who are allowed to ask questions through the judge 
wanted to know why secord did not pay death benefits to the family 
of copilot wallace sawyer jr even though he controlled the bank 
accounts 
secord said he had ordered his attorney to do so but the 
congressional investigation into the case frightened the lawyer 
who never made the payment 
hasenfus attorney zeroed in on that question noting that 
secord had ordered 250000 paid to southern air transport a year 
later yet had chosen not to pay the victims families 
youre quite wrong an angry secord responded you can put 
any kind of gloss on it you want 
secord retired as an air force general in 1983 and shortly 
afterward was recruited by north a national security council aide 
working out of the white house to run the network at a time 
congress had banned lethal aid to the contras 
hasenfus and sawyers family of magnolia ark say secord ran 
the operation and is responsible for misleading the crews and using 
shoddy equipment that led to their plane being shot down by a 
nicaraguan rocket 
hasenfus parachuted to safety and was held captive by 
nicaraguas sandinista government for three months before being 
released 
secord has said he never met hasenfus or sawyer 
southern air has denied involvement with the hasenfus flight and 
claims hasenfus and sawyer worked for corporate air services a 
separate company 
the two families have listed actual damages of just under 4 
million but that does not include distress or punitive damages

the justice department on tuesday urged the 
withdrawal of a longstanding immunity of us airlines from 
antitrust laws that allows the companies to fix fares to and from 
this country 
the departments antitrust division made the recommendation in 
comments filed with the transportation department which is 
considering whether to extend the antitrust immunity for the 
international air transport association 
iatas members who include american and foreign airlines set 
international air fares under an antitrust immunity that the 
organization has enjoyed since 1946 
the federal aviation act allows the granting of such antitrust 
exemptions to further international comity or other foreign 
policy interests 
the justice department said that when persons affected by 
price fixing are us consumers and the airlines involved are us 
carriers the us interest is clearly paramount 
it urged the transportation department to review on a 
countrybycountry basis the antitrust immunity give foreignowned 
carriers to fix fares on flights to and from the united states 
immunity for iata appears particularly unwarranted in those 
markets where the involved foreign government does not actively 
support or favor cartel pricing the justice department said 
noting that european common market nations are pushing for 
increased airline competiton 
many americans may not realize that the prices of their 
airline tickets for travel abroad are set by what is in efect a 
legalized international cartel attorney general dick thornburgh 
said in a statement 
lower fares and better service are what we seek the 
attorney general said with so many of the countries of the world 
now recognizing the benefits of competitive freemarket economies 
we should not continue to grant blanket immunity to a multilateral 
cartel but should address the needs and concerns of individual 
foreign governments on a casebycase basis thornburgh said 
now that airline deregulation has promoted competition on 
domestic flights there is a strong interest in protecting 
consumers when they travel on us carriers from the united states 
to foreign countries said james f rill assistant attorney 
general for antitrust

architecture died after a brief illness his firm said wednesday 
he was 81 
bunshaft a retired partner in skidmore owings amp merrill died 
of cardiac arrest at his home in manhattan on monday 
bunshafts first big project lever house was also his most 
famous the 24story bluegreen office building constructed in 
1952 introduced the sleek international style to manhattans park 
avenue then lined by traditional masonry buildings 
architecture critic wolf von eckardt called lever house the 
proud proclamation of a new era and it helped make skidmore one 
of the nations leading design firms lever house was designated a 
new york city landmark in 1982 the first structure of its kind to 
win that designation 
bunshaft also designed a number of other manhattan office 
towers including the manufacturers hanover trust building the 
pepsico building and the headquarters of the chase manhattan bank

johnson library in austin texas the hirshhorn museum and 
sculpture garden in washington and his last and most elaborate 
project the national commercial bank in jiddah saudi arabia 
the latter a triangularshaped building 27 stories high with no 
apparent front or back is so abstract that it is impossible to 
judge its actual size except upon close examination noted the 
new york times it barely reads as a building 
in 1988 bunshaft was awarded the pritzker prize for architecture 
in recognition of his early designs he also was a member of the 
american academy and institute of arts and letters and a fellow of 
the american institute of architects

defense minister moshe arens called tuesday for 
stronger western measures against iraq in a speech underscoring 
growing nervousness here over the invasion of kuwait by the jewish 
states most formidable arab foe 
arens speech to parliament was made before president bush 
ordered us troops and warplanes to the front line tuesday to 
guard saudi arabia against iraq 
other officials said israel would favor a usled naval 
blockade to bring an end to the gulf conflict 
in an early reaction here to the latest us move ron 
benishai political analyst and journalist for the yediot ahronot 
newspaper said on israel army radio 
this is not completely suprising it was expected that the 
us would want to land soldiers in saudi arabia but what was not 
expected was that the saudis would agree so quickly if it is 
true it is indeed a extraordinary change in saudi policy that 
needed great courage because they will have to deal with the 
results if the americans dont succeed 
other analysts said earlier that considerable concern existed in 
israel that unless saddam was reined in the unpredictable iraqi 
president could pose a direct threat to israel 
they noted saddams warnings this spring that he would torch 
half of israel with binary chemical weapons if iraq ever came under 
attack by israel saddam was accused of using chemical arms against 
kurdish rebels at home and against iranian forces during his 
eightyear war with iran 
unfortunately the international community didnt take any 
action after he used chemical weapons and threatened to attack 
israel with chemical weapons arens said 
nations of the world have a capability to influence iraq the 
nations of the world can prove that aggression doesnt pay and 
that iraq will pay the heaviest price for attacks staged by its 
leaders 
arens warned that saddam hussein is liable not to suffice with 
kuwait just as he didnt suffice with his attack on iran in 
september 1980 which led to a war that went on until 1988 
he has a big army and limitless aspirations arens said of 
saddam 
arens reiterated that iraqs invasion of kuwait last thursday 
doesnt constitute a geostrategic change for israel but the 
moment we detect such a change like the entry of iraqi forces into 
jordan we will act 
jordan has a long border with israel 
king hussein of jordan facing serious economic and political 
problems has lately forged an alliance with saddam 
in february jordan and iraq announced formation of a joint air 
force training squadron 
arens said israel was closely watching developments in kuwait 
we will know to defend our interests and security he concluded 
moshe shahal a former cabinet minister of the leftofcenter 
labor party said of saddam if he has a problem with the arabs 
thats his problem but if someone messes with us we know how to 
settle an account and you saddam hussein will bring a holocaust 
on yourself and your people because israel is not kuwait

early foreign reaction tuesday to the dispatch of 
us forces to saudi arabia described it as certain to strengthen 
the saudis but unlikely to bring a swift end to iraqs occupation 
of kuwait 
i think that this is an obvious step that has to be taken if 
iraq is to be deterred from some move forward in saudi arabia 
said sir john moberly a former british ambassador to iraq who is 
now with the royal institute of international affairs in london 
it is a protective measure he said in a television 
interview but i agree that to get saddam hussein out of kuwait 
is a very different question and its a very long haul 
in the hague a dutch government official predicted the 
deployment of us forces would bring a substantial 
deescalation of the tense situation in the persian gulf 
because of the move were pretty much drifting toward a kind 
of stalemate said the official who declined to be identified by 
name 
the world is now going to wait until shortages develop in iraq 
and then well be able to find an elegant way out for saddam 
hussein the source said 
in israel political analyst ron benishai of the newspaper 
yediot ahronot said on israel army radio 
this is not completely suprising it was expected that the 
us would want to land soldiers in saudi arabia but what was not

the army units readying for duty in saudi 
arabia are part of the nations rapid deployment force a 
contingent of air and land forces created during the carter 
administration to respond to a middle east crisis 
pentagon sources said tuesday that president bush had ordered 
elements of the 101st airborne division from fort campbell ky 
the 24th infantry division mechanized from fort stewart ga and 
the 82nd airborne division from fort bragg nc 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said elements 
of those three units would be deployed with the 18th airborne 
corps a command and control unit at fort bragg that directs 
operations of the three combat divisions 
the bush administration declined to confirm the deployment plan 
which sources said was designed as part of a multinational

bulgarian premier andrei lukanov and his 
cabinet resigned tuesday to allow the countrys new president to 
choose his own cabinet the state bta news agency reported 
the action took place a week after parliament elected zhelyu 
zhelev the first noncommunist president in more than four decades 
bta reported 
lukanov a 51yearold multilingual economist and a former 
moderate communist was elected premier in february bta said he 
was likely to continue as premier heading a new cabinet to be 
chosen at a fourday parliament session that opened tuesday 
the new government is expected to include independent experts 
and possibly members of the democratic opposition as well as of 
lukanovs socialist party formerly the communists the former 
communist party won free elections in june but has lost power 
steadily since then lukanov has repeatedly said he does not want 
to head an allsocialist cabinet 
lukanov submitted his cabinets resignation as mandated by the 
constitution to parliament president nikolai todorov bta said 
the bulgarian economy is in a general crisis the shortage 
of all basic commodities is growing bta quoted lukanov as 
telling parliament in a speech 
the internal trade imbalance has become so acute now that 
the countrys market is actually threatened by disintegration 
the former premier said 
lukanov cited a drop in industrial output by 93 percent this 
year surpassing an expected decrease of 5 percent 
the cause for the crisis is the command neostalinist 
model of development and management in the field of economy that 
was in force for four decades he said 
zhelev a 55yearold philosopher turned politician was elected 
president aug 1 
zhelev who led the opposition union of democratic forces udf 
in junes free elections was a compromise candidate for president 
backed by all parties including socialist leaders 
he has called for a strong competent government that 
presumably could include opposition members 
with the backing of the udf which has 144 parliamentary seats 
the opposition could block key constitutional reforms which need a 
twothirds majority for approval the socialists have 211 seats in 
the 400member grand national assembly 
the opposition repeatedly has rejected offers of a coalition 
from lukanov arguing that the former communist party must shoulder 
responsibility for past political crimes and the rapidly 
deteriorating economy 
in a nationwide tv address sunday zhelev called on political 
parties in parliament to form a council with him in a bid to solve 
a deepening economic crisis 
the crisis is worsening the state coffers are empty there 
are raw materials and energy shortages in industry prices are 
galloping the unemployment rate is growing zhelev said 
bulgaria has stopped paying either capital or interest on its 
foreign debt of nearly 11 billion 
the daily svoboden narod reported tuesday that bulgaria a 
country of just under 9 million people will be 1 million tons 
short of grain this year rationing already has been introduced in 
some towns for sugar detergent and soap and long lines form in 
sofia for many basic consumer items

days in the jungles of the philippines returned home tuesday to 
wyoming steak and rhubarb pie 
im glad to see you tim swanson said as he bearhugged his 
mother lynne swanson at the end of his 24hour trip from manila 
to cheyenne 
the 26yearold was freed by new peoples army insurgents last 
thursday after the philippine military agreed to a threeday truce 
released to members of the international red cross swanson was 
taken to the us embassy in manila where he was checked by doctors 
and met with peace corps officials 
swanson who admitted to feeling overwhelmed to be back in 
wyoming didnt think long when asked how he planned to celebrate 
i guess i want to eat the steak and the rhubarb pie that my 
mother told me about and get some sleep he said 
swanson considers the philippines his home now but hes not 
sure when hell return or what hell do when he gets there he 
wont go back to the peace corps and his filipino wife merle is 
on leave from her teaching job 
swanson said his brief foray into the forefront of international 
politics was not welcome 
i resented it he said i didnt like being used as a pawn 
by the npa 
he was kidnapped on june 13th when three rebels came to his 
home and insisted he come with them swanson said he had limited 
freedom in the jungle hideout near his philippine home of patag 
but for the most part had little to do but sit and wait 
the united states suspended peace corps operations in the 
philippines on june 27 and sent volunteers home because of alleged 
reports that rebels planned to target them us officials said 
they were unaware of swansons kidnapping when the order was issued

government officials say talks 
with the african national congress on ending whiteminority rule 
could begin by early next year now that the anc has suspended its 
guerrilla campaign a news report said tuesday 
the independent south african press association quoted 
unidentified government officials as saying the ancs announcement 
that it was halting its armed struggle meant formal constitutional 
negotiations could begin by early 1991 
this indicates their the ancs seriousness to take to the 
road of negotiation and their subtlety and realism one official 
was quoted as saying 
early tuesday the government and the anc released a joint 
statement in which the antiapartheid group announced it was 
suspending its guerrilla campaign the statement followed 16 hours 
of talks between delegations headed by president fw de klerk and 
anc deputy president nelson mandela 
joe slovo a senior anc official told a news conference that 
the organization agreed to end its armed struggle so the government 
could begin talks on sharing power with the black majority 
we came here to break the logjam in the peace process and i 
believe we walked away with complete success in that direction 
he said 
but slovo said the anc reserved the right to resume armed 
actions should the government fail to carry out its 
undertakings 
mandela said the anc was making every effort to notify 
supporters to end all armed action against the government 
immediately 
the joint statement by the government and the anc said both 
sides had reached a milestone on the road to true peace and 
prosperity for our country 
it said the way is now open to proceed towards negotiations 
on a new constitution 
but the agreement did not halt protests 
in worcester outside cape town police used teargas and rubber 
bullets on tuesday to break up an illegal protest march by about 
2000 residents of a mixed race suburb no serious injuries were 
reported 
police said tuesday at least 15 blacks had been killed in 
scattered factional fighting around the country since sunday the 
dead included 11 killed in kagiso outside johannesburg in a power 
struggle between anc supporters and inkatha the conservative zulu 
political movement police said 
the government and the anc have been trying since may to remove 
obstacles to fullscale constitutional talks on ending white rule 
although the ancs guerrilla wing spear of the nation has 
launched no major attacks in the past year anc officials have 
acknowledged that guerrillas were continuing to infiltrate the 
country stockpile weapons and plan attacks 
mandela had resisted declaring a ceasefire saying the 
government must make concessions the anc demanded that the 
government release hundreds of political prisoners grant amnesty 
to about 20000 exiles remove laws restricting political activity 
and end the state of emergency in natal province 
tuesdays statement indicated the government had gone some way 
towards meeting the anc demands but stopped short of outright 
acceptance further discussion of the issues will take place 
the joint statement said the government would consider repealing 
some security laws and lifting the state of emergency in natal 
which gives police wide powers to detain people and restrict 
political activity 
both sides also agreed to draw up plans for the release of 
ancconnected prisoners and for granting amnesty to many of the 
exiles who want to return home 
de klerk has been under pressure to secure major concessions 
from the anc after he legalized black opposition groups and freed 
mandela last february after 27 years in jail white critics had 
charged the government failed to gain anything by its concessions

distance the plane can fly loaded with weapons for combat and

egypt and morocco were the first nations to commit troops to the 
multinational military force led by the united states to protect 
saudi arabia from possible iraqi attack washington sources said 
tuesday 
there were no reports of any western european or other arab 
nations joining the force japan said it would not participate in 
any such action 
president bush ordered us troops and warplanes to the front 
line of the explosive standoff according to authoritative pentagon 
sources and sources on capitol hill there was no announcement of 
military moves from the white house 
a source in washington said us troops would be part of a 
multinational force a condition set by the saudis us 
congressional sources said egypt and morocco were joining the 
effort 
saudi arabia sharing arab sensitivities had never before 
agreed to stationing us military power on its soil 
egypt is the secondlargest recipient of us economic and 
military aid with current annual aid level of 23 billion and a 
large arsenal of ussupplied weapons since 1981 the united 
states has conducted joint maneuvers with egypt involving several 
thousand troops from each country every two years 
moroccos king hassan ii enjoys close relations with the united 
states and receives millions of dollars a year in us military 
aid the moderate arab country has usmade tanks 
japanese foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said that the 
countrys nowar constitution would bar it from joining any 
international military effort in the persian gulf 
the west german foreign ministry also said there were no plans 
for german troops to join a multinational force in the gulf a duty 
officer noted that the west german constitution bars the use of 
german troops outside the country 
turkey which closed iraqi oil pipelines had received no 
request to join such a force foreign ministry spokesman murat 
sungar said 
two us carrier battle groups were already on station in the 
region the uss independence and its 14 escorts in the arabian sea 
at the mouth of the persian gulf and the force led by the uss 
eisenhower in the eastern mediterranean 
us defense secretary dick cheney in egypt persuaded egyptian 
officials to allow the eisenhower to pass through the suez canal on 
tuesday night to move closer to the embattled gulf region pentagon 
sources said 
a handful of british and french navy vessels were also in the 
region a soviet foreign ministry spokesman said a soviet 
antisubmarine ship and destroyer were dispatched from the indian 
ocean toward the area but only to ensure safety of navigation of 
soviet civilian vessels 
diplomats said the un security council resolution calling for 
a worldwide boycott against iraq could be used as justification by 
the united states and other nations to act unilaterally or in 
concert apart from the united nations to enforce the boycott 
there was hope that a multinational defense of saudi arabia 
would deter saddam husseins millionman iraqi army from storming 
the saudi oil fields iraqi forces conquered kuwait last week 
saudi arabia borders kuwait and also has a common border with iraq 
secretary of state james baker made plans to meet friday in 
brussels with the foreign ministers of the 15 us allies in europe 
after a quick consultation trip to turkey the move appeared to be 
an effort to enlist western europe in the saudi defense effort

neighborhoods across the country took a 
stand against crime and celebrated safety tuesday night with block 
parties candlelight marches and flashing lights in the seventh 
annual national night out 
the block is running over with people said barbara landers 
who held a block party in the philadelphias hunting park 
neighborhood the kids are out here playing they helped decorate 
the street were all having fun here tonight the block is out 
in charleston wva at least 25 neighborhood groups held 
rallies cookouts marches and block parties among the events was 
a senior citizens march with flashlights around their highrise 
apartment complex said sgt dallas staples 
in columbus ohio police coordinated the activities of 194 
community block watches said the police departments howard wilson 
in barrow alaska police officer brent robles said timing just 
wasnt right barrow gets just a couple hours of semidarkness at 
this time of year 
were going to do it when we get a night said robles 
national night out turns the clock back about 40 years to a 
time when communities were safer because people knew their 
neighbors routinely looked out for one another and everyone knew 
the cop on the beat said organizer matt peskin 
peskin is director of the national association of town watch a 
nonprofit organization based in this philadelphia suburb it is 
dedicated to the development of lawnforcement affiliated crime and 
drug prevention activities 
about 400 communities participated in the first night out 
through their local town watch groups in 1984 peskin said this 
year he was looking for a turnout of 21 million in 8000 
communities in all 50 states and in canada and at us military 
bases around the world 
last year police in dayton ohio gave out mock citations and 
light bulbs to people who didnt have their outside lights on 
this year the night out ceremonies began at noon with a 
hands across the border trek from fort erie ont to buffalo 
ny for 300 police and members of citizens groups 
what were trying to show is crime doesnt have any 
boundaries said buffalo police lt ron christopher after more 
than 100 police officials from new york state and canada staged an 
afternoon motorcade across the international peace bridge from 
buffalo to fort erie ontario 
in new york city mayor david dinkins urged citizens to join the 
fight against crime saying public safety is my highest priority 
but i cant do it alone 
im not calling for you to become vigilantes but i am 
preaching vigilance said dinkins speaking to about 250 people 
in harlem 
night out organizers in butte mont said they would light up 
the 90foot lady of the rockies statue atop the continental 
divide milwaukee the leading city in the celebration last year 
planned 1000 block parties and security lighting demonstrations 
most important peskin said is the way the night out draws 
people together and gets them in touch with the police 
you have police in the neighborhood and nothings wrong he 
said its a rare chance especially for the kids the event 
seems to draw out neighborhoods that have usually been tough to 
involve in anything 
generally most people are lawabiding and they want to be 
neighborly peskin said but nowadays if you try to be 
neighborly many people are likely to be suspicious you can do 
that on this night

remember how much fun it was to stay up too late 
on a saturday night with popcorn and orange soda pop and wait 
expectantly for the late nite shriek theater shock horror creature 
feature 
im dangerous tonight airing tonight on cables usa 
network is just like those good old b movies it doesnt pretend 
to be great art just a nice scary movie that is suitable for 
middleschool viewers 
it means also that the movie is not quite that scary for 
grownups 
dont blame director tobe hooper poltergeist and texas 
chainsaw massacre who makes the most of the slenderest of 
premises 
a cloak used in early aztec blood sacrifices which transmits 
forbidding evil supernatural powers to unwitting victims who come 
in contact with it 
the opening credits for im dangerous tonight run while a 
big tractortrailer rig rolls into view and onto the campus of good 
old state u 
i got a delivery for dr jonas wilson the surly latin 
americanaccented driver tells the security guard and forklifts in 
a huge stone aztecsymbol inscribed whatchamacallit 
what the heck is that asks the security guard 
its an aztec sacrificial altar the driver says having 
readahead in the script during important festivals they say the 
blood ran from this altar in rivers your professor should be 
pleased with it 
enter the professor ooh hes pleased his fingertips twitch 
greedily as he moves to touch the profane altar 
hey professor some sacrificial altar eh says the 
security guard 
a line reading as stupid as that kids automatically moves the 
security guard onto the list of minor characters about to be 
scragged horribly 
the professor caresses the stone as he waxes rhapsodic about the 
ancient corn festivals where the aztec priests who sacrifice 20000 
victims a day his eyes get misty as he says their hearts 
torn from their living bodies 
then our professor friend opens the altar and inside is 
aaaaaaaaaagh 
scared ya huh 
you get the picture hooper moves the teleplay of producers 
bruce lansbury and philip john taylor as steadily as a sine wave 
pacing the thrills and the lulls as dependably as a train schedule 
all too soon the cloak comes into the possession of amy the 
oddly lovely twin peaks regular madchen amick a worthy 
cinderellatype freshman at state u who falls under the cloaks 
spell and makes an evening dress of it 
she is transformed into a sensual manhungry vamp just as 
long as shes wearing the dress this causes some understandable 
confusion for the lad who removes her from it during a friendly 
embrace at the college dance 
ah but theres still plenty of confusion mayhem and murder 
ahead kids 
r lee emery remember the tough di in full metal jacket 
turns in his usual superlative performance as a police detective 
investigating what has become a string of homicides 
he is a surprisingly competent policeman and not at all typical 
of the scary movie genre losing a relative is a tragedy he 
tells one potential victim but losing two in two days is 
downright careless 
anthony perkins whos becoming known as a great cable 
television actor phones in his role as an archaeology professor 
and dee wallacestone cujo puts in lateinnings relief as a 
cloak victimcumperpetrator 
im dangerous tonight is welldirected even it it isnt 
particlarly wellwritten director hooper creates some scary images 
and is still prodding the material for thrills even when the script 
has run out of steam

magnolias youll be disappointed 
miss ralph plays the downtoearth one and miss stickney the 
wild and impulsive one they convey warmth in their relationship 
despite the snappy patter morris day does a nice job as a 
selfabsorbed hairdresser 
sadly thats about as far as it goes the show is underwritten 
its comedic situations lack a sense of risk or danger and its 
characters are thin 
were still waiting for an comedy about black women that can 
entertain us without patronizing us and wasting the talents of 
performers like miss stickney who was in the women of brewster

some southerners look at monument avenues 
stately statues of confederate heroes and see the most beautiful 
street in america some northerners look at the same scene and 
see losers lane 
norrece t jones jr looks out on the statue of jeb stuart 
from his apartment and he sees human suffering 
when i see those monuments i think of people who enslaved 
african americans i can never look at them dispassionately or 
indifferently says jones professor of afroamerican history at 
virginia commonwealth university 
one hundred years after robert e lee became the first son of 
the south to be memorialized on monument avenue the 140footwide 
thoroughfare symbolizes both the scars of slavery and the elegance 
of a time long ago 
it is more than a confederate valhalla says edwin j slipek 
jr director of the avenues centennial celebration its a 
linear central park or town square tracking the development of an 
american city 
the 62foottall statue of lee on his horse was dedicated on 
memorial day in 1890 jeb stuart and jefferson davis followed up in 
1907 stonewall jackson in 1919 and matthew fontaine maury 
pathfinder of the sea in 1927 
by the 1920s monument avenue was richmonds most prestigious 
address douglas southall freeman the richmond historian whose 
writing about lee won the pulitzer prize doffed his hat whenever 
he passed marse lee 
they didnt start out by saying were going to dedicate a 
street to the men who lost the civil war said robert winthrop 
an architectural historian 
instead the row of statues grew piece by piece he said 
if the city government was focused on a memorial to the lost 
cause it might be different 
george callcott professor of southern history at the university 
of maryland said one of the things american historians have 
noticed is the souths preoccupation with the past monument avenue 
is an indicator of that 
john zehmer executive director of the historic richmond 
foundation is among those who suggest monument avenue is not so 
much a commemoration of confederate heroes as a display of fine art 
still when other statues were proposed through the years 
noncivil war types like thomas jefferson woodrow wilson william 
henry harrison and edgar allan poe among them none was built 
in the late 1970s when richmond first elected a city council 
with a black majority the outgoing administration feared that 
blacks would move or tear down the lee monument so the whites 
deeded robert e lee to the state 
but henry marsh the citys first black mayor laid a wreath at 
the jefferson davis monument assuring the united daughters of the 
confederacy that he was mayor of all the city 
the city had never experienced what they perceived as black 
control and didnt know what to expect marsh said the avenue 
he says today is one of the great boulevards in the world 
monument avenue is a haven to joggers and children who frolic on 
the grassy treelined median it is an avenue of mansions the 
average home is 5000 square feet with a halfdozen fireplaces 
four bathrooms maids quarters and a dozen rooms on three floors 
some of the houses have been sold to new owners who find them 
too large to handle and turn them into offices and apartments 
some have been purchased by newcomers eager to buy a mansion for 
a relatively cheap price ceci amrhein a real estate broker who is 
also cochairwoman of the centennial said a house in need of major 
renovation is on the market for 250000 while another fully 
renovated sold for 775000 
the centennial has had its goofy side including a croquet 
festival billed at the worlds largest croquet match on the 
avenues lawns 
but when as part of the celebration a jazz group was invited 
to play black youths in the band refused to perform under the 
statue of lee jones said the band moved the show a block away 
the civil war in essence was fought to preserve a certain 
culture that culture predicated on the enslavement of hundreds of 
thousands of african americans jones said 
though he can look out of his window and see the statue of 
stuart renowned as one of the best cavalry commanders of the army 
of northern virginia jones says he enjoys living there 
the building in which he lives designed by architect william 
lawrence bottomley is on the virginia historic register and the 
national register of historic places he enjoys the model of a 
claes oldenburg sculpture on a neighbors lawn the sculpture 
depicts not a war hero but a clothespin 
and there have been signs of change the virginia chapter of the 
american institute of architects held a mock competition for a new 
sculpture on monument avenue and drew responses from 250 
architecture students 
the most popular subject virginia gov l douglas wilder the 
first black elected chief executive of any state

these are times that test investors and separate 
them from traders guessers speculators and crowd and guru 
followers 
investors think longterm absorbing and measuring the daily and 
monthly events against their basic analysis of sales and earnings 
possibilities good investors maintain a distant view they tend 
not to panic 
sir john templeton expresses the philosophy this way the 
short term the next month or year depends very heavily on human 
emotions the long term however depends on values and values 
keep rising 
that is the value of wellchosen investments grow they grow 
because the economies of which they are a part grow because their 
markets are expanding because they are well managed 
templeton based in nassau bahamas is one of the most 
successful investors of all time a living legend a knight a 
founder of mutual funds in which 700000 investors own shares 
there have been seven bear markets since templeton founded the 
templeton growth fund in 1954 but in that time a 10000 
investment would have grown to well over 1 million after payment 
of all fees and expenses 
ask templeton about shortterm events and how to deal with them 
and he might say as he said to steven halpern your guess is as 
good as mine 
templeton recently told halpern editor of a stock market 
newsletter that we have been investment counselors for 58 years 
and in all that time we have never been able to tell our clients 
when a bear market will start or stop 
rather than trying to forecast templeton buys shares selling at 
a low price in relation to longterm prospects in that way he 
said he can produce better longterm results than if he had tried 
to forecast the market 
overall and in spite of bear markets and unforeseen events he 
observes stock prices have doubled about every 10 years throughout 
the history of american markets 
as a result if you invest over a period of one or two full 
stock market cycles we believe youll come out a winner he told 
halpern who produces the dick davis digest a compilation of views 
from 400 advisory services 
during those cycles he suggests you might consider bear 
markets not to be a catastrophe a reason to sell or to drop out of 
the market but as an opportunity a chance to buy at a relatively 
low price 
the significance of templetons words is obvious these days 
when nervous stockholders call their brokers every hour when gloom 
is pervasive when fears of a collapse are rampant when shortterm 
events cloud longterm perspectives 
it takes conviction to stand firm of course and not everyone 
can do it some people bend under the onslaught of negative news 
and views others are compelled to sell because they need the money 
but those who can hold out during negative times says 
templeton are likely to be as well rewarded in the future as they 
have been in the past 
maybe even more so he said

lindiwe phillip an 
antiapartheid activist fled into exile and expected to return 
triumphantly in a few months that was 14 years ago 
she came home in june when the government granted temporary 
amnesty to dozens of african national congress leaders so they 
could return and prepare for talks on ending apartheid the racial 
policy that gives 5 million whites supremacy over the nations 28 
million blacks 
ms phillip now 32 was among thousands of young blacks who 
left after the the 1976 student uprisings hundreds of people were 
killed in 1976 and the uprising helped shape a generation of 
militant activists 
i thought exile would be very temporary about three 
months she said as time went on i had to grapple with the 
fact that i am in exile and that i can no longer go home 
the anc south africas leading black opposition movement has 
an estimated 20000 members in exile the anc and the government 
agreed monday to clear the way for their return starting in 
september 
while ms phillip was in exile in zambia her parents died 
after she was in touch with her brother about the deaths he was 
killed and then her younger brother was found stabbed to death 
she still does not know who killed either of them 
i was just heartbroken she said i was almost on the 
verge of going nuts crazy 
during her exile ms phillip received military training and 
studied in cuba and tanzania she also worked in the anc womens 
section and the department of information and publicity in lusaka 
zambia the ancs exile headquarters 
her feelings were mixed when she returned in june with a group 
sent to recruit members for the anc womens league 
we had so longed to be back home but at the same time we were 
not sure it was the correct time she said 
african national congress members began trickling out of south 
africa when the organization was banned in 1960 
president fw de klerk lifted the 30year ban in february a 
law passed at that time empowers de klerk to grant immunity but so 
far he has given only temporary amnesty to a few dozen anc leaders 
and officials 
officials say that under mondays agreement the cases of all 
exiles will be reviewed and disputed cases will be handled by a 
special commission 
mathews phosa a lawyer on the anc negotiating team fled south 
africa five years ago when he was told his life was in danger but 
had to leave his wife and 3yearold daughter behind 
it is one of the most traumatic decisions one could take in 
ones life a very very painful experience shattering 
terrible he said 
what sustained exiles phosa said was unshakeable belief in the 
struggle to end apartheid 
you dont know where you are going to exactly he said 
you are being uprooted from your loved ones you know you are 
going to comrades but thats not enough you still have to make 
new friends 
after the initial shock life in exile becomes normal the 
lawyer said people get married they fall in love they work 
and home is not something that haunts you every day 
finding a place to live is a major problem for returning exiles 
there is a severe shortage of housing for blacks 
many will want to catch up on education they missed while 
fighting for spear of the nation the anc military wing but black 
schools are overcrowded qualified teachers are rare and violence 
has disrupted classes for years 
recent rightwing violence against blacks and against whites 
opposed to apartheid is a source of fear for returning exiles 
phosa said but that cant be a reason for us not to come home 
with the political space being there to organize and build our 
organization it would be irresponsible for us not to deploy our 
cadres inside the country he said 
i think i am optimistic that we will get over the stumbling 
blocks there is a willingness on the part of the government they 
are very slow hesitant but i think they are moving forward and 
they should be credited for that

movement to make the city greener in 1972 by cleaning out empty 
lots piled with trash and planting shrubs and flowers the city 
became involved in 1979 when it began operation greenthumb to help 
pay for fencing seeds and tools 
today nearly 550 community gardens can be found on lots owned 
by the city and greenthumb says the value of the fruit and 
vegetables they yield amounts to 375000 a year there also are 
many gardens on private lots 
gardens give people greater pride in their neighborhoods said 
lisa stephano a spokeswoman for the american community garden 
association based in philadelphia the national association claims 
250 community garden programs nationwide as members but estimates 
there are nearly 1000 
we find that once a garden is developed it takes over 
peoples lives said jane weissman director of operation 
greenthumb what they are really doing is throwing open their 
doors going down in their streets meeting their neighbors and 
creating an environment of safety with others 
three years ago john english was a jeweler on wall street 
today he owns a construction company he founded to stop a city 
plan to pave over what is considered the citys first community 
garden 
english 47 couldnt understand how developers plans to widen 
the sidewalk and put in shops and low and middleincome housing 
would improve the neighborhood more than the liz christy garden he 
became an expert on housing to argue his case that the garden 
should stay and that the homes should be built elsewhere 
english won and the graceful garden still gives the feel of the 
backyard of a country estate only its on houston street a main 
thoroughfare pounded day and night by trucks and cabs 
a garden is part of the soul without the cycles of life one 
loses track of reality he said so to me this is real in a 
city which is surreal 
the noise of clattering trucks fades in the tranquility of the 
garden but the syringes and other trash tossed over the fence are 
a reminder of the mean streets outside 
all of the citysponsored gardens must be opened to the public 
at least once a week and on a recent evening passersby strolled 
among the peach apricot and plum trees while some of englishs 
employees barbecued lobster and corn and drank beer 
this is my yard he said 
teresa civello a neighborhood resident calls the garden a 
piece of heaven 
i walk by every morning and here in the middle of this 
desolate miserable neighborhood there is a little bit of hope 
she said its always exciting and full of mystery 
the green guerrillas have a paid staff of four and 250 
volunteers who share their technical expertise to help start new 
gardens 
the group helped ms rainey landscape her garden in a lot that 
had been a neighborhood dumping ground full of discarded 
appliances trash and bricks from crumbled buildings now there 
are plots of greens okra string beans cabbage and tomatoes 
surounded by zinnias gladioluses and wild grass 
ms rainey 61 has lived only in miami and new york city she 
said she had to sit down in the dirt and get acquainted with it 
her friends see the garden as a neighborhood improvement 
project she said 
even the crackheads havent bothered me she said they 
come by and say gert its looking good 
they sort of protect it they wouldnt take so much as a 
tomato 
but plant rustling is on the rise in the city and many 
including greenthumbs ms weissman blame addicts who sell flowers 
and shrubs on the streets for fast cash landscapers also are 
suspected of stealing plants some gardeners have begun chaining 
bushes and anchoring trees to buried cinder blocks 
over in the bronx geneva mcfadden heard about operation 
greenthumb about four years ago and in one day rounded up eight 
neighbors she had never met and received approval for a garden from 
the community board 
they turned a lot that had been piled with burnedout cars and 
trash into an idyllic patch in a noisy neighborhood of apartment 
buildings and minimarkets 
the garden is a mix of meticulous bricklined flower beds of 
roses geraniums petunias marigolds and pink clover and 
woodframed vegetable plots thick with healthy tomato plants 
cabbage and corn 
people stop and comment white black and spanish so it 
brings the neighborhood together said mrs mcfadden 75 who 
grew up on a farm in south carolina the kids stand there 
looking a lot of them have never seen flowers grow before 
thousands of people walk by randy glasers garden in greenwich 
village each day to gaze through the chainlink fence at elegant 
rosebushes climbing trellises neat vegetable plots and beds of 
johnnyjumpups delphinium and fire lillies 
many of the admirers are drawn as they leave a supermarket just 
feet away 
people are constantly stopping asking questions saying thank 
you for the garden glaser said they almost become poets 
some call it an oasis in a cement desert some say theyve changed 
stores just to come by here 
its like ive reunited with the earth the world ms 
rainey said recently as she sat under in the shade of a tree 
smoking a cigarette 
you look out the window and see vacant buildings homeless 
people on tv our children destroyed by drugs she said its 
all like a big sore festering and the garden takes your mind off 
that

jack nicholson was philosophical as 
he looked back on his strifefilled fiveyear ordeal in making 
the two jakes the longawaited sequel to chinatown 
its like the army as soon as its over somehow it all 
reduces down to a bunch of funny camp stories he said 
a mellowedout nicholson was holed up in a beverly hills hotel 
suite for a round of interviews to call attention to the release of 
the two jakes in which he starred as well as directed he had 
just returned from new york where he showed the film to a few 
pals including directors mike nichols bernardo bertolucci and 
sidney lumet he thinks they liked it 
the only way you can gauge your friends is when the lights 
come up can they look at one another he said if they go like 
this glancing sideways you know that back in their minds theyre 
saying how do i deal with this weve all been in that 
situation 
the arrival of the two jakes climaxes a long and dramatic 
history that began nearly two decades ago nicholson and 
screenwriter robert towne once classmates in jeff coreys acting 
class conceived a plan to make three films based on power and 
corruption in earlier los angeles chinatown in 1974 was the 
first of the trilogy 
in 1985 nicholson and towne joined forces with producer robert 
evans who had been production head at paramount pictures when 
chinatown was made for the two jakes towne would direct 
and evans who hadnt acted in 25 years would play jake berman 
enemy of nicholsons detective jake gittes 
trouble in the partnership developed nicholson said because 
towne believed evans wasnt right for such an important role and 
refused to proceed unless evans was replaced harvey keitel 
eventually got the role but the impasse led to the films 
cancellation 
the triad was patched together enough to revive the two 
jakes and production began on april 18 1989 with nicholson 
directing and receiving directors guild scale 
why did he assume the double duty 
it kind of evolved that way he explained we had spent 
quite a bit of money the budget had been hammered down to minimal 
not lowbudget but good astringent moviemaking there really 
wasnt enough left to get bertolucci or nichols or roman 
polanski who directed chinatown or whoever we might have 
wanted 
doing both has got to be one of the hardest jobs you can do 
youre doing 20hour days theres no way around it you got to 
get the call get to makeup set up the shots youre done at dark 
you got to travel see the dailies go home shower eat learn the 
lines for tomorrow get the shots in your mind by then its 23 
oclock in the morning and you got to get up at 7 or 8 in order to 
be on the set 
theres no time to catch up should you lose energy being a 
hysterical person i didnt lose much energy 
nicholsons decade in the roger corman quickie factory helped 
him make the two jakes on schedule and on budget reportedly 
25 million including hefty charges for the aborted version his 
lesson from the corman days that good and cheap is more creative 
than good and expensive 
the two jakes was originally set for release last christmas 
a deadline nicholson considered unrealistic there had been rumors 
that preview audiences were confused by the complicated plot hence 
he added narration to help explain it 
the narration is very philosophical its not plot he said 
oddly just the sense of if we dont understand it hell tell 
us gave that security that im not sure i actually got in the rest 
of the movie 
at the beginning of the interview nicholson was downing a 
frothy purplish drink which he has termed the elixir of life 
it is part of the liquid diet that has helped him lose 30 excess 
pounds he carried as jake gittes he proudly displayed his new 
figure he also spoke proudly of his 4monthold daughter born to 
rebecca brousard who plays gittes secretary in the two jakes 
shes fantastic a boon from divine nature he exulted 
nothings any better in life as you know when i see those big 
cheeks i gargle and google like the next guy i feel very 
blessed 
the romance with brousard and the baby reportedly caused the 
break in nicholsons 17year alliance with anjelica huston he has 
another daughter from his first and only marriage to sandra 
knight another classmate at jeff coreys she is jennifer 26 who 
also worked on the two jakes as a design assistant 
the only situation clouding jack nicholsons life at 53 concerns 
the los angeles lakers he worries about rumored trades and lineup 
changes magic johnson is magic but he cant carry the whole 
load himself he commented otherwise michael jordan would win 
the championship 
but well have a representative team out there to watch only 
for kids do you have to win the championship every year 
one thing is certain nicholson will be occupying his usual 
courtside position when the laker season begins during his recent 
trip to new york he switched sports and attended a yankees 
baseball game he was amused by the reaction 
a bunch of people saw me and like a moron i stood up and 
waved pandemonium broke out and the fans started chanting jack 
buy the yanks 
i took 5 out of my pocket and waved it at them all the 
players were looking over and wondering what the hell was going 
on he said 
you never know whats going to happen in life

growing up todd mcfarlane was an indiscriminate 
comic book addict 
anything that came out i grabbed it he says 
today the 29yearold canadian artist the man behind the new 
improved spiderman has become the favorite of comic book 
aficionados by remembering what caught his eye years ago 
i still believe comic books are for kids he says i try 
to put onto the pages all the things that i used to like when i was 
growing up 
its not only kids though who are captivated by mcfarlanes 
extraordinarily detailed actionpacked work 
the first issue of his new marvel comics series titled simply 
spiderman quickly sold nearly 3 million copies this summer to 
become the bestselling comic book in us history 
mcfarlane who garnered a huge following during the two years he 
drew for the original title amazing spiderman is both writer 
and artist on the new series the fifth to feature the wallcrawler 
maggie thompson coeditor of the comics buyers guide a trade 
journal based in iola wis credits the new books success to 
the combination of a popular character a popular creator a no 
1 first issue title and a couple of special editions that have 
fanned the flames a little bit 
mcfarlane was named favorite cover artist and favorite penciler 
for the second year in a row in this summers comics buyers guide 
readers poll 
in a telephone interview from his home and studio on vancouver 
island mcfarlane said he went into comics after failing at his 
first love professional baseball he attended eastern washington 
university on a baseball scholarship but majored in graphic design 
after failing to make a toronto blue jays minor league team he 
started sending out samples to comics companies eventually landing 
a job at marvel working on the incredible hulk 
in 1988 he switched to amazing spiderman and began the 
webslingers makeover redesigning the costume and adding a 
creepier feel 
i wanted to emphasize the spider in the word spiderman 
he says so i made his eyes a lot bigger to make them look like 
bug eyes he has webbing on his costume i made about five times 
as much 
mcfarlane also puts as much effort into the background as he 
does the star 
his style is extremely intricate thompson says he 
doesnt leave a large area blank because hes too lazy to draw it 
mcfarlane also wants to give kids the same action and excitement 
in comics that they get from such things as computer games and 
adventure movies 
i think that maybe i put a little more energy onto the page 
he says when somebody is getting slugged theyre flying across 
the room theyre not just falling over if somebody gets hit by a 
ray gun or something the guy is blasting 
the wisecracking wallcrawler took favorite character honors 
this year in the buyers guide poll defeating batman the 
titleholder since 1985 
spiderman made his debut in 1962 as an unpopular wimpish 
teenager whose life changed forever when he was bitten by a 
radioactive spider in a high school science lab today hes a 
graduate student in biophysics who shares a soho loft with his 
glamorous actressmodel wife 
the fact that spiderman continues to draw new generations into 
his web doesnt surprise stan lee the writer who created the 
character with artist steve ditko 
they like spiderman because they can relate to him lee 
said he worries about earning a living he has domestic 
problems he has personal problems hes as apt to get an ingrown 
toenail or an allergy attack or worry about dandruff as anybody 
else 
the character was conceived as an average kid who happens to get 
super powers in sharp contrast to the more established characters 
such as superman who comes from outer space and batman whose 
alter ego bruce wayne is a multimillionaire 
the original concept of spiderman the teenager whos 
unpopular in school but has these secret powers and is someone to 
be reckoned with feeds a lot of fantasies of a lot of people 
thompson says 
lee is now publisher at marvel and at work on developing movie 
projects including a possible spiderman feature he confesses to 
a special love for his most popular creation and says mcfarlane has 
a great take on the character 
the toughest part of my job is trying to get as wide an 
audience as possible mcfarlane says 
you dont want to make it too simple then youre going to 
lose the 20yearolds but on the other hand you dont want to 
make it too funky or weird then youre going to lose the 
10yearold kids

the leader of a movement thats pushing 
record companies to ditch the cardboard packaging in which compact 
discs are sold is claiming victory for his side 
by the end of the year a system will be in place to get rid of 
the environmentally wasteful long boxes says robert simonds 
chief financial officer of rykodisc 
even the most vehement retailers would admit off the record 
that the days of the long box are numbered simonds said i 
think what theyre mostly fighting for now is to make sure theyre 
not stuck with the whole bill to pay for a new system 
his opponents dont quite share his optimism but admit theyre 
looking for alternatives 
in an industry that loves to show its public concern for the 
environment and other causes the controversy over the socalled 
long boxes is making people squirm 
compact discs are generally packed into 5 by 6inch plastic 
jewel boxes in order to curtail theft and use more 
eyecatching graphics record companies wrap these containers in 
6by 12inch cardboard boxes 
when they buy a cd most consumers simply tear the boxes apart 
and throw them away 
that doesnt make much sense to simonds who says the long boxes 
are both a waste of money and waste of paper his ban the box 
movement started with a letter published in billboard magazine and 
grew with the 20th anniversary celebration of earth day 
such musicians as rem bobby mcferrin the b52s sting 
rosanne cash olivia newtonjohn the grateful dead and crosby 
stills and nash have pledged their support 
if consumers stop and think about the package they will think 
that it is kind of a pain in the neck said simonds whose 
company is based in minneapolis then when they find out theyre 
paying up to a dollar or more per disc just for the package then 
they start getting angry its really struck a chord with 
consumers 
simonds stepped up the pressure in recent weeks by asking cd 
purchasers to tear open the cardboard package in the music store 
and dump it on the clerks counter the tower records chain one of 
the loudest opponents of ban the box have put recycling bins 
in some stores 
long boxes were created partly to enable retailers to place cds 
in bins once reserved for records eliminating the need for a 
costly change in how stores are set up as records replace cds as 
the music source of choice 
the smaller package also lessens the chance of an impulse 
buy from consumers attracted by colorful graphics said floyd 
glinert head of the entertainment packaging association a group 
of paper companies that supply the long boxes 
it has replaced the record jacket as an art form which is 
very important to conveying to the public the excitement of a 
record he said 
the united states is the only country that uses long boxes 
getting rid of the boxes retailers fear will make them more 
vulnerable to shoplifters 
despite all the talk about the environment the issue now is 
essentially economy record companies have changed their tune in 
recent weeks instead of dismissing ban the box they admit 
theyre seriously examining the criticisms 
theyre not thinking through what the alternatives are before 
screaming ban the box said paul smith president of cbs 
records distribution there has to be some way of merchandising 
the product i think every record company in the business is 
actively seeking an alternative to the 6by12 box 
henry droz the president of wea told billboard that his 
company has no specific plans to abandon the long box but i 
dont know that we have a longterm commitment to keep it 
although simonds is the leader of ban the box most of his 
companys product particularly the popular cd reissues of old 
david bowie albums are offered with long boxes thats because 
some music chains have told him they wont sell the discs any other 
way he said simonds offers a discount to retailers who buy his 
discs without the box 
despite all the environmentally conscious musicians jumping on 
simonds bandwagon it was raffi the canadian singer of songs 
written for preschool youngsters who blazed a trail he was the 
first to insist in a contract with his record company that his cds 
be marketed without long boxes 
i simply believe that the excessive packaging of cassettes and 
cds can no longer be tolerated in a global environmental crisis 
said raffi whos signed to mca if theres enough pressure from 
artists and their audience the buying public i think record 
stores will respond by eliminating the long box 
rocker joan jett has asked cbs records not to release her next 
cd with a long box or if the company cant to not release the 
album in a cd format at all smith said no decision has been made 
on the request 
a state senator from new york has proposed legislation banning 
the long box from being marketed here its the first state to make 
such a proposal according to ban the box spokesman martin 
folkman 
simonds suggested this country follow the canadian record 
industrys example when it banned the box in canada record 
companies contributed to a fund that helped retailers make their 
improvements 
ban the box has suggested various alternatives including 
new display cases built for jewel boxes and reusable plastic frames 
that can be taken apart by a clerk many paper companies are trying 
to come up with their own solutions glinert said 
i sense that the major record companies are supportive of 
getting rid of the long box but are in an awkward position of not 
wanting to take that stand against their retail customers until 
theyre forced to simonds said that would force them if just 
a few of their superstar artists throw us their support

hundreds of chinese jews live in old imperial capital 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when residents of north and south 
scripture lane see a foreigner wandering down their alley they can 
guess why 
are you looking for descendants of the jews asked an old 
man sitting beside the dirt lane in his undershirt and told the 
visitor about li who lived a few streets away 
he waved a hand toward where zhao lived but would not take the 
stranger there hes not accepting visitors anymore the old man 
said hes had too many 
zhao pingyu 68 is one of a few hundred descendants of jews 
living in this ancient center of judaism 390 miles from beijing in 
henan province 
kaifeng the imperial capital from the 10th to the 13th century 
once was home to thousands of jews but they gradually became so 
assimilated that little is left to distinguish them except their 
memories and stories 
in the 1980s as china opened to the outside world kaifeng 
officials sought to cash in on the mystique of jews in china to 
draw attract tourists their attitude appears to have changed since 
the crackdown last year on bourgeois liberalism the catch 
phrase for western ideas 
when a new york family held a bat mitzvah in kaifeng last month 
for their daughters coming of age their requests for permission 
to invite the local jewish community were ignored 
zhao said the kaifeng foreign affairs office had told him not to 
receive foreigners except at official receptions then he added 
but if people come on their own to my house how can i not invite 
them in that would be inhospitable 
although neighbors are reluctant to take people to zhao 
visitors have little trouble finding him zhao is wellknown in 
kaifeng because he is one of the few jews with knowledge of jewish 
history and culture 
he lives with his wife a nonjew in a large room at the back 
of a courtyard on south scripture lane that once was part of the 
synagogue compound 
the synagogue was built in 1163 and stood for 700 years through 
10 renovations it eventually was destroyed by flooding from the 
yellow river and the no 4 peoples hospital now stands on the 
site 
zhao has a diagram of the synagogue which his 
greatgreatgrandfather restored after retiring from an imperial 
court office 
a few years ago after his own retirement from the tax bureau 
zhao started building a model of the synagogue which included 
three elaborate worship halls and several side buildings much work 
still remains 
one of the three stone tablets displayed in kaifengs museum 
exhibit on jews in china came from zhaos family the tablets are 
the jews best historical record 
jewish merchants arrived in china in the 7th century joining 
other traders on the journey along the silk road or by sea from 
south india 
thousands settled in kaifeng eventually creating chinas 
largest jewish community and the one that lasted longest as 
recently as 200 years ago 2000 to 3000 jews worshipped weekly in 
the kaifengs synagogue 
by the mid19th century the jews had intermarried and become 
assimilated they adopted the customs of the majority han chinese 
or the moslems forgot the hebrew language and took chinese names 
a survey of kaifeng in 1980 found only 79 jewish families with 
166 members other accounts say kaifengs population of 500000 
includes up to 300 descendants of jews 
zhao and other jews in the old imperial capital do not observe 
jewish rituals or holidays but he remembers eating unleavened 
bread for the passover meal as a child many chinese jews observed 
passover during the chinese lunar new year 
even though he does not practice judaism zhao maintains his 
sense of jewish identity 
when the jews come here from foreign countries i feel theres 
some connection some relationship by blood he said theyre 
our friends and our brothers 
a menorah given him by an american jew is displayed in the 
middle of zhaos room but he never uses the ceremonial 
candleholder a blue yarmulke handmade by one of his daughters 
hangs on a wall 
i have five daughters he said thats a good thing for a 
jew because judaism is passed down through the mother 
zhaos household registration lists him as a jew but his new 
citizen identification card says says he is han chinese 
he said one daughter was so adamant about being jewish that she 
refused to get an identification card because it would identify 
her as han chinese 
china has 54 minority groups it does not recognize jews as a 
minority because they no longer have a language or customs to 
distinguish them from han chinese 
moslems who still practice their religion and have kept their 
traditions are chinas secondlargest minority they have token 
representation in government and the communist party and are 
entitled to special treatment

curanderos no longer recommend drinking 
jaguar blood for strength but the medicine men still use herbs to 
induce abortions 
the prescriptions and procedures are in the first known book of 
medicine written in north or south america the book has returned 
to mexico after more than 400 years a gift of pope john paul ii 
it is very important because it provides a series of 
prescriptions that allow us to study indigenous medicines said 
dr carlos viesca a professor of history and medicine at the 
national autonomous university of mexico 
viesca is the nations leading authority on the 140page book 
which bears the title libellus de medicinalibus indorum herbis 
but is commonly known as the badiano manuscript 
in it are lists of ailments treatments used by central mexicos 
indigenous population and illustrations of 185 plants viesca said 
modernday curanderos still use 90 percent of the plants as 
medicines 
martin de la cruz an indian doctor at the college of santa cruz 
at tlatelolco wrote the manuscript in the nahuatl language in 
1552 and juan badiano translated it into latin little else is 
known of the two men 
francisco de mendoza the son of new spains first viceroy 
commissioned the volume as a gift for king charles i of spain who 
eventually gave it to one of his librarians 
it was sold to cardinal francisco barberini of rome who kept it 
until his death in 1902 then went to the vatican library to be 
forgotten until two researchers disovered it 27 years later 
besides chronicling indigenous cures viesca said the book 
could be used as a model to study traditional medicine to see how 
much has been maintained how much has been lost and how much has 
been integrated into modern medicine 
some plants described in it have effective medicinal properties 
and about 10 percent have been studied by modern scientists he 
said 
yolloxochetl related to the magnolia functions as a heart 
stimulant much like the drug digitalis viesca said in an 
interview cihuapatli has been found to induce labor menstruation 
and abortions 
many religiousmagical aspects of the treatments have passed out 
of vogue he said 
before the spanish came curanderos called for divine 
intervention and recommended feasting on the bones bile organs 
and blood of animals viesca said jaguar blood was believed to 
bring extraordinary physical strength 
john paul returned the book after president carlos salinas de 
gortari mentioned it during the popes visit to mexico in may 
a copy is on display at the national museum of anthropology but 
the original is permanently stored to prevent further damage from 
light or temperature variations 
viesca said the museum may publish an edition for public sale

valmont orion vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
filmmakers seem to have a love affair with choderlos de laclos 
1782 epistolary novel les liaisons dangereuses and with his 
story of seduction hedonism and revenge in 18thcentury france 
its no surprise 
the work was first interpreted on film by roger vadim in 1959 
it starred gerard phillipe and jeanne moreau as two icy modernday 
opportunists with an open marriage it had a jazzy score by 
thelonius monk and jack murray 
the second movie version was 1988s dangerous liaisons an 
americanized fastpaced drama directed by stephen frears and 
starring glenn close as the scheming marquise de merteuil and john 
malkovich as the notorious rake valmont 
next comes milos formans valmont a 1989 movie now 
available on video and it is as different from the other efforts 
as the many interpretations of shakespeares hamlet it is a 
lush and elegant movie graced by the seductive camera work of 
miroslav ondricek 
with a keen eye for detail forman eases into de laclos story 
against the blind morals of prerevolutionary france his vision is 
sweeping theres no rush but still much activity forman loves 
the bustle and business of earlier times jugglers merchants 
servants always underfoot 
as madame de merteuil annette bening brings a sugary 
bitchiness she is less brittle than the glenn close interpretation 
and also less focused but her intent is clear she loves playing 
games wicked vicious games that ultimately destroy people and 
bring ruin to a way of life 
colin firths valmont is far more attractive than malkovichs 
indeed one wondered why women would ever be drawn to the malkovich 
character with his pasty visage and deepset eyes and bronx 
sounding voice 
firth is almost too cute almost too soft and the steely 
maliciousness is missing meg tilly is convincing as a vulnerable 
and pious young wife a woman valmontw orships and for whom he 
lusts 
fairuza balk return to oz portrays cecile the target of 
valmonts seduction and the innocent victim of merteuils revenge 
her mother has arranged for the convent school girl to marry 
gercourt an older man who will take only a virgin as his wife 
hes also merteuils exlover 
forman dances his characters about in a game of musical beds a 
game thats a nowin for just about all 
jeanclaude carrieres screenplay makes good use of de laclos 
focus on letter writing letters show up just about everywhere and 
even valmont gets into the spirit by dictating erotic passages to 
an unsuspecting cecile to send to the young music teacher henry 
thomas who loves her 
as a video valmont is worth renting or buying as a 
companion to other dangerous liaisons

turmoil in oil prices leaves no market 
unaffected and throws a wrench into every stock forecast and 
economic projection of gross national product inflation 
interest rates made by government or private sages 
there isnt a person who can say for sure not even the 
president or the federal reserve chairman what the immediate 
economic future holds except to say that not one american is 
immune from the effects 
there isnt a single economist who can rely on his or her own 
estimates of future activity not one stock market guru from the 
most conservative to the zaniest whose thinking hasnt been changed 
unless resolved quickly the oil crisis has the potential to cut 
half a percentage point or more from the gross national product 
this year which means it could be the difference between slow 
growth and official recession 
it forces the white house to reconsider fiscal strategies and it 
compels the federal reserve to think again before moving against 
inflation it changes the dollars trade value the corporate 
profits outlook and the outlook for budget and balanceofpayments 
deficits 
for individuals it means higher fuel oil prices higher prices 
for gasoline higher ticket prices on airlines it could mean 
higher utility bills and higher prices for almost any product you 
can name it could mean jobs 
if the word vulnerable is overused generally it is not in 
regard to the developed worlds dependency on oil japan imports 
almost all its oil the united states now imports nearly half the 
highest level ever the health of europe depends on a few pipes 
running from the mideast through turkey 
compared with 1973 when the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries created the first big oil shortage and sent the entire 
economy into a tailspin the united states is even more vulnerable 
us domestic production has fallen alaskas oil output rose 
steadily from the late 1970s through 1988 last year that states 
output dropped 7 percent and the transalaska pipeline has begun 
to show signs of corrosion 
united kingdom output in the north sea a friendly source and 
one relied upon by trading partners has also been down because of 
labor and maintenance problems it could worsen into fall 
mexican production also is off but steppedup mexican 
venezuelan and american production couldnt for long if at all 
make up the shortfall from a cessation however brief of oil 
shipments from the mideast 
incredibly evidence of western world vulnerability has been 
available measured almost to the gallon to almost everyone in a 
position to take action including the white house and congress 
every white house economic adviser knew that any official 
projections made included assumptions of a plentiful supply of oil 
at a moderate price and that if that assurance was lost then no 
forecast made any sense at all 
that also includes those who made projections of american 
industrial production of stock and bond market performance of 
inflation interest rates and recession of homebuilding 
automobile production airline travel 
americas dependency on oil especially foreign oil is rising 
in spite of at least two serious scares in the 1970s after which 
many leaders declared we could never let it happen again 
it has grown as reliance on other sources hydraulic solar and 
nuclear diminished it has grown as a result of abandonment of 
efforts at conservation which had worked so well it has grown as 
domestic production declined 
oils impact is fundamental and pervasive even bringing into 
question the political and military usage of the word powerful 
as in the most powerful nation on earth

houston real estate dealers and the soviet union 
are potential gainers but nearly everyone else stands to lose 
economically if the iraqiinvasion of kuwait leads to a spell of 
high oil prices analysts say 
the oil price increases are both recessionary and inflationary 
and there are many more losers than winners said allen sinai an 
economist with boston co and economic advisers inc in an 
interview monday 
if the price increase sticks it will lead to a major transfer 
of wealth from nonoil producing countries to oil countries he 
said 
he and other economists and industry analysts listed a long 
string of losers if the current middle east crisis leads to 
sustained oil price increases the auto industry housing nearly 
all consumerrelated industries and entertainment and travel firms 
but higher prices might benefit others analysts say investors 
in gold and other precious metals domestic oil companies and oil 
drilling companies as well as the economies of oilrich states 
like texas and louisiana 
added sinai the soviet union with its oil and gold reserves 
is a potential winner 
each stressed that any such economic impacts depended on whether 
the oil price increase proves to be a momentary blip or a longterm 
fact of life 
john chadderdon editor of offshore data services a 
houstonbased publisher of information on offshore drilling for oil 
and gas said that if oil prices rise well above 20 a barrel and 
stay there that might spur exploration in the gulf of mexico 
the price of west texas crude oil has risen to about 25 a 
barrel up about 4 in the last week chadderdon said 
if its long term thats something that should spur us 
activity a 20 per barrel price is just not enough for many 
companies to go after areas in the gulf of mexico its just too 
expensive he said 
he speculated that whats good for domestic oil companies might 
be good in the long run for local real estate in oil producing 
regions of the country 
george mccauley an oil analyst for the national utility 
service inc a private consulting firm said motorists already 
feeling the effects at the gas pump will continue to be losers 
along with air travellers 
two airlines pan american world airways and northwest have 
announced ticket price increases to offset rising jet fuel costs 
and the oil price increases may mean a long cold and expensive 
winter for homeowners he said 
if the rise in oil futures prices translates into actual 
dollar increases then come fall when utility companies draw down 
current inventories they will have to be replaced at higher cost 
which will be passed on to the consumer mccauley said 
sinai added that oil prices would be bad news for nearly all 
investors only holders of commodities and precious metals might 
stand to gain 
normally the dollar does well that is not happening this 
time sinai said

people awaiting compensation from the manville 
trust fund for asbestos victims will have to wait at least another 
month 
us district judge jack b weinstein in brooklyn on monday 
extended for 30 days a freeze on payments for asbestosrelated 
diseases to allow completion of a plan to restructure the 
financially ailing trust 
weinstein said the extension would allow completion of a 
courtappointed reorganization plan for the trust which has run 
out of money to pay new claims by thousands of workers made sick 
from inhaling asbestos fibers 
but leon silverman the bankruptcy courtappointed adviser 
supervising the reorganization said it is almost impossible to 
conclude that the more than 130000 pending claimants would 
receive the full value of their claims 
the reorganization is designed to speed payments and alter the 
compensation scheme to process claims based on victims health and 
financial need rather than when they file a claim 
weinstein last month set monday as a deadline for the overhaul 
plan and froze spending during the process to prevent a further 
cash drain 
the trust was created in 1988 as part of manville corps 
bankruptcy court reorganization a result of rising liability from 
lung cancer and other serious and fatal diseases caused by asbestos 
the trust has paid 974 million to settle more than 22000 
cases but still has 130000 claims pending a cash shortfall led 
the trust recently to say it would not be able to pay new claims 
until well into the 21st century 
us district judge thomas d lambros in cleveland on monday 
proposed consolidating pending manville trust claims with a private 
consortium that has been negotiating settlements for other 
asbestosmakers 
under the proposal the center for claims resolution in 
princeton nj would be annexed to the legal system and directed 
by a board of judges with input from plaintiffs and defense lawyers 
and other parties involved 
the center which is funded by 20 asbestos defendants and 
insurance companies has settled 36000 claims in 18 months 
lambros said a courtaffiliated center could minimize transaction 
costs and resolve pending claims until a longterm national 
settlement scheme is reached 
silverman said progress had been made toward providing 
meaningful funds in the near term to victims without sacrificing 
the longterm value of the manville stock 
the trust effectively owns 80 percent of denverbased manville 
which must make annual payments to the trust beginning next year 
and is shielded from further legal liability for asbestos claims 
weinstein and silverman supported continuing an injunction 
barring lawsuits against manville which would hurt the trust by 
depleting the value of manville assets 
but the judge criticized manville saying the company was 
unrealistic about its role in refinancing the trust weinstein in 
the past has suggested that the company should make new direct 
payments of more than 200 million to the trust 
manville has said its financial commitment ended with large 
contributions when the trust was created and its role is to 
strengthen manville to bolster the trusts value 
manville chief executive thomas stephens said he was 
disappointed with weinsteins comments he said the company had 
offered to inject 500 million last november through a stock 
repurchase plan 
in an interview stephens said the company last week recommended 
a plan to inject some cash into the trust which in return would 
sell some manville stock into the marketplace 
were fully aware and sympathetic of the needs of the 
claimants and are doing everything we can to optimize todays 
dollar and tomorrows dollar he said 
the trust based in washington is named in more than 100000 
lawsuits on the dockets of every federal district court and more 
than 500 state courts nationwide 
the cash shortage at the trust had been anticipated but made 
worse by more cases larger payouts and quicker settlements than 
expected victims had received an average of 43000 per claim 
compared with estimates of 25000 
according to court documents the trust has 932 million to pay 
1128 million in claims already settled that money is frozen by 
the judges order 
asbestos a white mineral used for heat resistance and 
insulation was widely used in shipbuilding construction and other 
industries 
six federal judges are scheduled to meet later this week in 
washington to discuss prospects for consolidating the asbestos 
litigation docket into a class action to speed resolution

prime minister toshiki kaifu will ask arab leaders 
to help offset the burden of an oil embargo against iraq by 
boosting their oil production a top government official said 
tuesday 
trade minister kabun muto told reporters kaifu had decided to 
make the request to preempt problems that could be caused if an 
international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil exports is prolonged 
kaifu plans to make the request of arab leaders during a tour of 
the middle east that is to begin aug 15 and take him to saudi 
arabia oman jordan egypt and turkey muto said kaifus journey 
had been arranged before the iraqkuwait crisis erupted 
oilpoor japan on sunday joined the united states and the 
european community in the embargo to try to force iraqi president 
saddam hussein to withdraw his forces that invaded kuwait last 
thursday 
japan also suspended trade credits to iraq and kuwait banned 
trade with both countries and instructed banks and securities 
companies to freeze assets 
in announcing the sanctions which were officially approved 
tuesday by the cabinet kaifu stressed that japan has 142 days of 
reserves and will come up with necesssary measures to cope with 
the problem 
tokyos actions are seen as especially tough since japan had 
previously taken a low profile in the middle east which supplies 
much of japans oil needs 
iraq and kuwait accounted for 112 percent of japans oil 
supply or 470000 barrels a day in the first quarter of the year 
according to the trade ministry 
kaifu and other leaders are calling on the japanese to conserve 
energy but no measures have been implemented officials are 
reportedly considering whether the use of air conditioning should 
be limited at government offices and gas stations shut down on 
weekends 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto tried to reassure traders by 
saying he does not expect stocks and bonds to suffer an extended 
weakness because of the crisis 
but share prices on tokyos rich and often volatile stock 
market began to tumble almost immediately after the sanctions were 
announced 
the markets main barometer lost 31 percent monday and tumbled 
another 33 percent tuesday bringing the nikkei stock average 
index to its lowest level in nearly two years 
market players were concerned about how much the incident may 
prompt inflation said kazuhiro nomura a trader with new japan 
securities co unless they figure out the extent of its effect 
investors are inclined to stay away from the stock market 
prices of crude are beginning to increase so that might have 
an effect on inflation conceded shousuke tanaka head of the 
economic planning agencys research bureau tanaka said that with 
each 10 percent increase in crude prices consumer prices go up 01 
percent 
tanaka however stressed that his agency does not foresee any 
major change in japans economic growth that has continued for 44 
consecutive months so what we really have to be cautious about 
at this time is inflationary psychology he said

general dynamics corp faced with sagging 
business prospects in the defense industry has announced plans to 
eliminate between 1500 and 2000 jobs in california 
the st louisbased defense contractor said monday it would 
combine its pomona and valley systems divisions into a single unit 
to be called the air defense systems division the two divisions 
located in pomona and rancho cucamonga calif produce missiles 
the consolidation effective immediately is the result of 
declining business prospects in the defense industry said ralph 
hawes executive vice president for missiles and electronics 
the announcement was another blow to the defense industry which 
last month was hit with the news that the nations largest defense 
contractor st louisbased mcdonnell douglas corp was reducing 
its workforce by up to 11 percent or 17000 jobs nationwide by 
the end of this year 
in order to remain competitive in a declining market for 
missiles and other air defense systems general dynamics must more 
efficiently use its existing resources and reduce overhead said 
michael c keel who has been named corporate vice president and 
general manager of the new division 
keel had been corporate vice president and general manager of 
the valley systems division since 1988 sterling starr who had 
been corporate vice president and general manager of the valley 
systems division will help in the initial steps of the 
consolidation before being reassigned 
while we all welcomed a diminished threat from the soviet 
union and the end of the cold war these changes have brought 
unfortunate personal economic consequences for many people in the 
us defense industry keel said 
keel added that the company would provide the laidoff employees 
with career consulting and placement assistance services more than 
600 of the layoffs will be caused by the elimination of duplicate 
jobs he said 
the pomona division produces standard and sparrow missiles and 
phalanx closein weapon systems while valley systems builds 
stinger and rolling airframe missiles for the us military and its 
allies 
the pomona division was formed in 1952 and valley systems was 
created in 1985 in response to the then expanding military market 
the company said the air defense systems division would not only 
operate facilities in pomona and rancho cucamonga but also in new 
mexico arizona arkansas and san diego county in california 
with the consolidation general dynamics the nations second 
largest defense contractor has eight divisions and six 
subsidiaries they are all involved in defense work expect cessna 
aircraft which makes general aviation aircraft

british airways plc said tuesday its firstquarter 
profit climbed 79 percent despite a much slower rise in sales and 
the adverse impact of a strong pound on its international earnings 
the results were boosted by interest income and asset disposals 
the airline said 
british airways said its profit for the three months ended june 
30 came to 111 million pounds or 194 million from 62 million 
pounds in the same period a year earlier 
pretax profit jumped 625 percent to 156 million pounds or 
273 million from 96 million pounds a year earlier 
sales rose 14 percent to 133 billion pounds or 23 billion 
from 117 billion pounds a year earlier 
earnings included 50 million pounds or 88 million from 
interest and asset disposals including airplane sales compared to 
a net loss on such items of 1 million pounds a year ago 
british airways chairman lord king said the increased value 
of sterling is putting some pressure on yields but nevertheless the 
revenue prospects remain good 
he added that the sudden rise in oil prices related to 
turbulence in the middle east is a matter of concern 
fuel costs are expected to soar in the nearterm in response to 
iraqs invasion of kuwait last week 
in the latest quarter fuel costs edged 74 percent higher to 
131 million pounds or 229 million 
the airline said its traffic remains buoyant passenger loads on 
scheduled flights increased to 722 percent from 704 percent over 
the same period british airways said 
offsetting the improved operating performance however were 
foreign exchange movements which cost the company an estimated 30 
million pounds or 53 million in the first quarter and leasing 
costs which increased 80 percent to 63 million pounds or 110 
million 
the 1990 figures were converted at a rate of 175 to the pound

grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade partly 
reflecting perceptions that tensions in the middle east are easing 
reports that iraq may allow foreign nationals to leave the 
country led to a drop in oil prices this morning which reduced 
inflation fears and prompted selling of grain and soybean futures 
the crop markets had risen sharply in recent days on 
expectations that inflationary pressures would drive food prices 
up but that seems to be abating this morning said victor 
lespinasse an assistant vice president in the grain trading 
division of dean witter reynolds inc 
he said selling pressure was offset by buying interest linked to 
mondays weekly agriculture department cropprogress report 
the report showed corn and soybean development still lagging far 
behind the normal pace 
the report also showed slight deterioration of the soybean 
crops condition 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 283 a bushel corn 
was cent lower to cent higher with september at 253 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to cent higher with september at 
117 a bushel and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with august at 595 a bushel

lawmakers today called for presidential 
jawboning and tapping of emergency oil reserves to combat rising 
gasoline prices that have followed the invasion of kuwait 
in the last week american consumers have been ripped off on a 
massive scale sen joseph lieberman dconn complained at a 
hearing before the senate commerce consumer subcommittee 
iraqi president saddam hussein whose troops took over oilrich 
kuwait on thursday may not be the only greedy person in this 
picture said rep phil sharp dind as he opened a hearing of 
the house energy subcommittee on energy and power 
the chief targets of the hearings were us oil companies which 
have raised gasoline prices by as much as 19 cents a gallon since 
the invasion the justice department served notice monday that it 
will seek out and prosecute any anticompetitive practices 
charles j dibona president of the industrys american 
petroleum institute said critics of the price increases were 
taking a naive onesided view of how markets work 
in written testimony for the senate subcommittee dibona said 
oil companies had no choice but to pass on to consumers immediately 
the higher cost of oil even though gasoline from that oil will 
not reach pumps for months 
lieberman and witnesses at his hearing said president bush 
should summon executives of the big oil companies and tell them to 
stop gouging the public lieberman cited president kennedys 
example in dealing with a steel price increase 
its called leadership said rhode island attorney general 
james e oneil he sid there is little that state and local 
officials could do to bring down gasoline prices 
sharp said the loss of oil from iraq and kuwait calls for 
dipping into the 509millionbarrel us strategic petroleum 
reserve the time to use it is now he said 
but john easton of the energy department said the law allows use 
of those reserves only to make up for supply shortages not to 
bring down prices he said us commercial supplies of 392 million 
barrels are at the highest level in nine years 
there is not a significant shortfall and there are unused 
production capacities in many countries easton said 
on monday jim connolly who heads a group of gasoline dealers 
in the northeast said statons are caught in the middle with oil 
companies following a greed is good motto 
oil companies said the increases were necessary because the 
price of crude oil already has gone up and the invasion of kuwait 
only added further justification 
as gas prices went up as much as 19 cents a gallon at service 
stations across the country the pressure for other increases began 
to spread through transportation industries 
pan american and northwest airlines announced higher ticket 
prices and the american trucking associations appealed to the 
government to let haulers respond more quickly with freight 
increases each time the price of diesel fuel goes up 
higher freight rates could lead to increased costs for virtually 
everything shipped to a retail store or americas front doors 
the oil companies are profiteering at a time of international 
tension said edwin rothschild of the consumer group citizen 
action and he called for a boycott of the highestpriced gas 
stations in each community 
state officials in massachusetts new hampshire new york north 
carolina and pennsylvania announced investigations of possible 
local pricegouging by oil companies 
the companies say their prices are the result of increases in 
crude oil costs from 16 a barrel in july to 27 after the kuwaiti 
invasion 
refiners are not yet recovering in the marketplace a 
significant portion of crude oil cost increases that theyve 
already incurred said anita larsen a texaco co spokeswoman 
the interstate commerce commission said the average price of 
diesel fuel based on a check of 16 stations nationwide rose 86 
cents to 1186 per gallon monday from july 31 
an interstate trucker in virginia reported paying 19 cents more 
per gallon this week than on july 27 
the american automobile association said the average cost of 
selfservice unleaded gasoline increased 111 cents from last 
thursday to 1186 per gallon including a 71cent jump over the 
weekend 
energy and transportation department officials issued a joint 
statement with the justice department expressing concern about the 
price increases and the hardships they may be causing 
deputy energy secretary w henson moore urged consumer 
conservation and said we believe that the oil industry should 
not be carried away by speculation about future events

a federal judge set a hearing next week 
on a lawsuit filed by the amalgamated clothing and textile workers 
union to keep healthtex from closing six plants and laying off 
workers 
the union and 12 workers filed the suit against the childrens 
wear manufacturer monday in us district court in birmingham on 
behalf of 4000 healthtex workers nationwide 
they also sought a temporary restraining order to keep the 
financially troubled company from closing six us plants and 
distribution centers laying off workers or liquidating assets 
us district judge william acker declined to issue the order but 
set a hearing for aug 13 said john w hargrove one of the 
companys birmingham lawyers 
the unions claims are without merit and were going to 
respond to that lawsuit appropriately hargrove said 
friday was the last day of work for most employees at 
healthtexs plant in gadsden ala which once employed 600 the 
suit also affects employees at manufacturing or distribution 
facilities in cumberland ri danville va lafollette tenn 
warrenton ga and centreville ala 
union general counsel ronald rosenberg said in a statement 
monday that healthtexs unilateral move to close its plants and 
liquidate its assets is clearly illegal under its collective 
barganing agreement with its employees already these 
employees and their communities have suffered tremendous losses 
he said 
rosenberg said the unions collective bargaining agreement 
requires healthtex to meet discuss and negotiate with union 
officials about plant closings the suit was filed after company 
officials did not respond to union requests for arbitration he 
said 
hargrove said rosenbergs interpretation of the collective 
bargaining agreement was inaccurate that was taken out of 
context he said

european currencies following big losses the previous day 
gold prices rose on uncertainty in the mideast although the 
advance was more subdued than in sessions immediately after the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
dealers said the dollar steadied as reports that foreigners were 
being transferred from kuwait to baghdad were taken as a sign that 
tensions in the region could be easing 
a moderate recovery in the european and us equity and bond 
markets also helped the dollar 
nonetheless traders in london said the dollar still appears 
fundamentally weak recent government reports have indicated 
weakness in the us economy which some analysts say will prompt 
the federal reserve to encourage lower interest rates falling 
rates would make the dollardenominated investments less attractive 
to foreign investors and curb demand for the currency

mexico does not plan to increase its crude 
oil exports even though oil prices have shot up since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait government officials say 
were watching prices very closely but absolutely not we 
have not changed our policy a source at the state petroleum 
monopoly pemex said in an interview monday night 
furthermore experts said mexico already is producing at full 
capacity and would be hardpressed to boost exports significantly 
even if it wanted to 
the pemex source denied rumors that mexico the worlds fifth 
biggest crude oil exporter planned to increase sales to spain to 
make up for a shortfall caused by the iraqi invasion 
officials at pemex and elsewhere in president carlos salinas de 
gortaris administration all of whom insisted on anonymity said 
mexico may gain billions of dollars in revenue from higher world 
oil prices but in the long run a sharp rise could be harmful 
what we want and its in our interest is market and price 
stability we dont like prices to shoot up all of a sudden and 
then suddenly slide sharply said another official at pemex 
officially known as petroleos mexicanos sa 
the world oil crisis in the 1970s gave mexico a roaring economy 
but had aftereffects of runaway inflation high unemployment high 
interest rates and a foreign debt now estimated at 90 billion 
a number of business leaders believe a sustained rise in global 
oil prices could lead to higher world inflation higher interest 
rates falling stock prices and in the long run a shrinking of 
foreign investment and credit on which mexico heavily depends for 
development 
west texas intermediate and north sea brent two grades pemex 
uses as guidelines for setting prices on its crude both were up 
sharply again tuesday with wti trading near fiveyear highs of 
more than 28 a barrel 
during the past five months mexico has been exporting an 
average of 1216 million barrels a day of a mixture of its 
extralight olmec sold only to the united states and its light 
isthmus and heavy maya 
of these 656000 barrels a day went to the united states 
65000 to central america and the caribbean 351000 to spain and 
144000 to japan mexico is the united states sixthbiggest 
supplier after saudi arabia venezuela nigeria canada and iraq 
mexico has produced about 261 million barrels a day during the 
past five months 
but experts say pemex cannot raise production levels 
significantly due to lack of investment and oil field development 
its oil wells are pumping at full capacity and no new fields have 
been explored or developed in recent years 
a june report by the private sector for economic studies think 
tank showed pemex cut its capital investments by more than half 
since oil prices plunged in 1982 throwing mexico into an economic 
crisis from which it is just beginning to recover 
as a result the report said mexicos proven petroleum reserves 
dropped from 725 billion barrels in 1983 to 6645 billion barrels 
in 1989 
meanwhile domestic gasoline consumption rose by 23 percent from 
1985 to 1989 and pemex has been importing the fuel in rising 
amounts according to the report it said gasoline imports rose to 
2295 million in 1989 from 189 million in 1988

quaker oats co said tuesday its earnings climbed 
173 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter but plunged 167 percent 
for the year 
quaker said a decline in demand for oat bran as well as costs 
associated with the reorganization of the companys grocery 
products business contributed to the slump for the year 
but it said a renewed focus on its food business following the 
spin off of its fisherprice toy division is helping the company 
get back on track 
for the fourth quarter which ended june 30 net income totaled 
663 million or 86 cents per share compared with 565 million 
or 71 cents per share a year earlier 
revenue for the quarter rose 37 percent to 141 billion from 
136 billion a year earlier 
net income for fiscal 1990 fell to 169 million or 215 per 
share from 203 million or 256 a share in 1989 
sales for the year rose 31 percent to 503 billion from 488 
billion 
william d smithburg quakers chairman and chief executive 
said the fiscal 1990 results were below expectations 
in our us grocery products business intense competition in 
cereals and pet foods along with unfavorably cool weather 
conditions for gatorade early in the fiscal year and the sudden 
decline in demand for oat bran products all combined to produce 
results below expectations even though operating income was up for 
the year he said 
but he said operational streamlining over the last year 
combined with our renewed focus as a pure food company will help 
us regain the earnings momentum established during the 1980s 
quaker announced in april the spin off of troubled fisherprice 
in reorganizing its us grocery products business and in an effort 
to cut costs the company said in june that up to 400 jobs would be 
cut from that unit by the end of the year

failed to follow federal regulations on manufacturing practices 
last year according to inspection reports released by the us 
food and drug administration 
no products were recalled and the indianapolisbased 
pharmaceutical company agreed in january to a schedule for making 
corrections 
we believe the steps we have taken have resolved those issues 
and we continue to work with fda inspectors to ensure our practices 
comply with all existing regulations said lilly spokesman edward 
a west 
the fda reports were obtained monday by the indianapolis star 
under the freedom of information act 
in one document edward r esparza director of the fdas 
district office in puerto rico said the company failed to maintain 
manufacturing practices required by federal regulations 
fda inspectors criticized an uncovered section of a conveyor 
line in which bottles were being filled with ilosone liquid an 
antibiotic gaps in an overhead conveyor chute permitted pieces 
of broken caps to fall onto and around the bottle conveyor the 
report said 
the document referred to inspections conducted june 1989 through 
october 1989 at three lilly plants in carolina puerto rico 
in subsequent correspondence esparza said lilly had answered 
most of the questions raised by the inspections and had produced a 
satisfactory schedule for correcting the problems 
the inspections of lillys puerto rican operations occurred 
during and after a fourmonth fda inspection of lillys 
indianapolis facilities which resulted in the recall of some

east germanys economy is in chaos and faces 
an extremely difficult six months ahead says the west german 
overseeing the nations businesses 
reiner gohlkes remarks published tuesday in an east german 
newspaper are some of the most ominous to date about the countrys 
rapidly deteriorating economic situation 
they coincided with the release of the latest official 
unemployment figures showing the number of east german jobless 
jumped to 272017 last month up from 142096 in june 
more than 656000 of the nations 88 million workers were 
working short shifts because of the lack of demand for east german 
products 
since the west german mark became the east german currency on 
july 1 the countrys 8000 major businesses have faced increasing 
difficulties staying afloat 
the next six months will be the hardest the newspaper neue 
zeit quoted gohlke as saying we will have to go through a very 
deep swamp 
there have been predictions that up to 4 million east germans 
could be out of work by early next year as businesses close 
that in turn has led to predictions of worker unrest in the 
former communist nation 
the situation is worse than i had thought gohlke said we 
have chaos nothing is running normally 
the neue zeit newspaper is closely linked to the christian 
democrats of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
gohlke former chief of west germanys huge railroad system 
recently became the chief of the board overseeing east german 
economic reform attempts 
that makes him one of the most influential people in east 
germany today the country is making a headlong rush from a

americans took out 463 million more in 
consumer credit than they paid off in june the government said 
tuesday but the borrowing pace fell well below that of may 
many analysts have been concerned recently over the caution 
displayed by consumers who have fueled an economic expansion that 
would reach its eighth anniversary in november consumers represent 
about twothirds of the nations economic activity 
the commerce department said consumer credit edged up just 08 
percent at an annual rate following a 61 percent gain or 365 
billion in may 
the slowing resulted in part from a 66 percent decline in 
automobile loans down from a level of 158 billion in may the 
may rate of growth had been unchanged after an 82 percent decline 
in the previous month the figures are adjusted for seasonal 
variations 
at the same time revolving or credit card debt gained 13 
billion a 76 percent advance at an annual rate the advance came 
on top of a 188 percent increase in april 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 827 
million a 48 percent annual rate after gains of 21 percent in 
may and 40 percent in april 
but borrowing for mobile homes fell 45 percent a 85 million 
decline nearly giving up its 60 percent advance in may mobile 
home debt had declined 03 percent in april 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of june 
at 7249 billion

conflicting rumors from the tense middle east buffeted oil 
prices today and jolted other financial markets but the panicky 
trading atmosphere caused by iraqs seizure of kuwait last week 
seemed to subside 
oil traders said speculative reports about the possibility of a 
middle east war mainly influenced the energy markets where crude 
prices seesawed this afternoon after shooting above 28 a barrel on 
monday the highest level in five years 
on the new york mercantile exchange a key barometer of energy 
prices the cost of benchmark west texas intermediate was weaker at 
midday on indications that the iraqis might be capitulating to the 
effects of a worldwide boycott but prices later jumped ahead to 
about 29 a barrel on reports that iraq had strengthened troop 
readiness along the saudi arabian frontier 
stock prices tumbled in tokyo rallied in london and seesawed in 
new york following mondays big loss by late afternoon on wall 
street the dow jones industrial average was down about 13 points 
to the 2703 level in choppy trading other market indicators also 
fluctuated 
its been bouncing up and down said robert otoole manager 
of overthecounter stock trading at shearson lehman brothers in 
new york any time people see a little strength they say let 
me out 
elsewhere us bond prices rebounded from losses monday then 
weakened again over anxiety about possible oilshock inflation the 
dollar gained ground against the japanese yen but was fairly 
steady in trading against major european currencies gold prices 
followed the behavior of oil 
still the volatility that gripped wall street and other markets 
monday and last week seemed to ease noticeably reflecting what 
traders called less emotional kneejerk reactions to events coming 
out of the middle east 
todays biggest losers appeared to be japanese stocks on the 
tokyo stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average dropped 
94646 points or 331 percent to close at 2765307 
japan is particularly vulnerable to oil shocks because it 
imports 99 percent of its oil the japanese market has dropped 
nearly 3200 points since iraq invaded kuwait on thursday 
a pessimistic view is dominating the market unless 
investors have some idea how this middle east situation would 
actually affect the japanese economy their uncertainties and fears 
will keep affecting the stock market kazuhiro nomura a trader 
with new japan securities co said referring to the tokyo exchange 
while the dollar held steady against most major currencies today 
in europe it was up against the japanese yen 
the dollar rose 110 yen to close at 15060 yen in tokyo later 
in london the dollar was quoted at a lower rate of 14973 yen but 
strengthened later in new york to about 14990 yen 
the worlds financial markets have been rocked by rising oil 
prices in recent days because of the potential impact higher fuel 
costs could have throughout the world economy 
as oil prices are actually rising investors fears of 
inflation are intensifying said kideyuki matsuda a trader with 
nippon kangyo kakumaru securities co basically there is no 
positive factor in the market now 
wholesale oil prices soared to fiveyear highs in new york on 
monday 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude jumped 356 to settle at 2805 a 42gallon barrel its 
highest price since august 1985 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange monday 
wholesale unleaded gasoline jumped 934 cents to 8152 cents a 
gallon and wholesale home heating oil was up 897 cents to 7555 
cents 
concerns about rapidly rising oil prices stemming from the 
persian gulf crisis pushed stocks bonds and the dollar sharply 
lower monday in foreign exchange the dollar closed lower against 
all major currencies except the japanese yen in new york 
us traders said the markets were jolted by continued worries 
that sharply higher oil prices stemming from iraqs invasion of 
kuwait last week could trigger higher inflation and push the 
nation into a recession 
the economy is in pretty bad shape now this could make things 
worse said edward yardeni chief economist for prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york

piece of news regarding the iraqkuwait conflict

increasing its troop readiness on the kuwaiti border with saudi 
arabia increased the edginess in financial markets a rumor later

with an expired contract 
looming representatives of western union corp and 2500 union 
workers on tuesday were expected to resume stalled negotiations 
the negotiator for the union the communications workers of 
america reported progress on a wage agreement but said the company 
had not yielded on demands that medical benefits be reduced job 
categories be consolidated and the number of parttime employees be 
increased 
a twoyear contract between employees and the giant telegram 
company expired monday but workers decided to return to the 
bargaining table rather than strike said dan j beckstead 
president of the cwaunited telegraph workers bargaining council 
in the event of a walkout the company has trained more than 
1000 temporary workers to keep operations afloat the company said 
western union spokesman warren bechtel said he thought progress 
had been made in the latenight talks that broke up at 2 am 
tuesday but he declined to discuss details 
on monday bechtel said the upper saddle riverbased company 
sought a contract that will allow it to operate profitably for the 
first time in more than seven years 
a major obstacle to a settlement was the companys demand that 
union workers pay higher medical insurance premiums bechtel said 
neither he nor beckstead would provide specific details about 
how the costs would be shared but on monday bechtel said union 
employees would pay as much as nonunion employees do under western 
unions proposal 
the union also balked at the companys proposals to combine the 
duties of operators and customer relations clerks and to increase 
the number of parttime employees not entitled to benefits under 
the union contract 
labormanagement disputes have led to three major strikes in the 
past four decades workers walked off the job for 10 days in 1985 
for 57 days in 1971 and 53 days in 1952 beckstead said 
the union has not set a settlement deadline he said 
communications workers of america represents operators customer 
relations clerks other clerical workers and field technicians who 
work for western union nationwide he said

watch on the persian gulf crisis and its effect on interest rates 
gold prices were mixed 
on the new york commodity exchange gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 38450 a troy ounce down 20 cents from 
monday later republic national bank in new york quoted a bid for 
gold at 38550 an ounce up 150 ronald h holzer chief 
currency dealer at harris trust amp co in chicago attributed the 
dollars rise largely to technical factors but he said traders 
were also buying dollars on the belief that us interest rates 
would remain stable for the short term 
shortterm rates have not moved lower holzer said 
in fact interest rates in the public bond markets have risen 
sharply in recent days on inflation fears which stemmed from the 
rapid rise in oil prices following iraqs invasion of neighboring 
kuwait last week 
when interest rates decline the value of a currency tends to 
follow suit

currencies except the japanese yen on worries that the federal

falling into a recession

congressional democrats charged tuesday that 
oil companies are engaging in pricegouging and exhorted president 
bush to stop it 
someone is making a killing sen john kerry exclaimed at 
one of three hastily arranged public hearings on sharp increases in 
american fuel prices following iraqs occupation of kuwait 
charles j di bona president of the american petroleum 
institute vehemently denied the accusation critics of the oil 
industry are taking a naive onesided view of how markets 
work he said 
us oil companies had no choice but to pass on to consumers the 
higher cost of oil on the world market di bona maintained saying 
prices would drop if world prices fall 
but angry members of congress said bush should jawbone industry 
leaders for price relief in much the same way president john f 
kennedy did with the steel industry 
bush also was urged to tap the governments crude oil reserve 
the aim would be to cushion american consumers against further 
economic repercussions from mideast hostilities 
oil companies have raised gasoline prices by as much as 25 cents 
a gallon since iraqi president saddam hussein sent his forces into 
neighboring kuwait last week company executives said their prices 
are the result of increases in crude oil costs from 16 a barrel in 
july to 27 after the invasion 
the american automobile association reported tuesday that prices 
for selfservice unleaded gas went up an average of 15 cents per 
gallon overnight and have averaged 126 cents higher than they were 
aug 1 the average is now 120 per gallon the highest since 
1985 said the aaa which checked 1400 service stations nationwide 
tuesdays spate of hearings was an unusual occurrence during a 
congressional recess but lawmakers were anxious to vent 
constituents anger over price hikes they were joined in this 
highprofile public interrogation by officials of state and local 
governments and consumer groups 
despite oil industry denials of pricegouging several witnesses 
maintained the evidence was otherwise they complained that oil 
companies are quick to pass on price increases but slow to pass 
along any savings 
the american public is angry its mad as hell they have a 
sense they are being held hostage to you the oil companies said 
sen richard bryan dnev 
the industry executives were summoned a day after the justice 
department pledged it would look into the soaring fuel prices 
anticompetitive pricing activities will be aggressively 
prosecuted it said 
but that did not satisfy angry congressmen 
in the last week american consumers have been ripped off on a 
massive scale sen joseph lieberman dconn complained to 
witnesses appearing before a senate commerce consumer subcommittee 
rep phil sharp dind said saddam may not be the only 
greedy person in this picture added sen john danforth of 
missouri there is another villain on the scene 
bryan cited a nationwide survey by the american automobile 
association showing gas prices up at least 11 cents and as high 
as 19 cents since last weeks invasion the prices have soared 
despite evidence showing supplies are still plentiful 
one is left with the inescapable conclusion that profiteering 
is occurring at the expense of the american consumer bryan said 
but glenn tilton president of texaco refining and marketing 
inc said his company was a hostage to supply and demand and 
thus had to raise its prices along with everyone else 
this one company cannot price out of step with the 
realities of the market or its supplies would be stripped he 
said 
but william mcgilacuddy president of the virginia service 
station dealers and auto repair association acknowledged there 
is no competition at the wholesale level whatsoever 
lieberman said bush should summon executives of the big oil 
companies and tell them to exercise price restraint 
when the connecticut democrats attempt to put the onus on bush 
was echoed by rhode island attorney general james e oneil 
danforth the only republican at the hearing questioned what good 
it would do after all he said the oil companies could merely 
refuse to cooperate 
its called leadership oneil shot back 
on the house side of capitol hill john easton deputy assistant 
secretary of energy for international affairs and energy 
emergencies told sharps subcommittee the administration was 
prepared to use the strategic petroleum reserve if there were a 
severe energy supply interruption 
he said american consumers may not tolerate high gas prices but 
they also will not tolerate use of us reserves to bolster world 
supplies without similar sacrifices by other countries 
easton said the law allows use of the 590 million barrel 
strategic petroleum reserve to make up for severe supply 
interruptions not to bring down prices 
but sharp said the us government should consider dipping into 
the reserves unilaterally to protect the economy and consumers 
there is a higher risk of damage in delay he said 
sharp said congress would not tolerate a legalistic 
determination about supply interruption to justify lack of action 
kerry a massachusetts democrat said at one point during the 
senate subcommittee hearing that the public didnt want to hear a 
lot of politicians yelling about it 
but they all did it anyway at the televised hearings 
im perfectly willing to pile on this one danforth admitted

harcourt brace jovanovich inc said tuesday 
it lost 23 million in the second quarter compared with a loss of 
426 million for the same period a year earlier 
the smaller loss reflected higher revenue from publishing and 
insurance operations cost reductions in publishing and lower 
interest expenses due to the paydown of debt with proceeds from 
asset sales the company said 
the company has a 16 billion debt much of it taken on when it 
thwarted a hostile takeover offer in 1987 
harcourt also said its annual meeting of shareholders which was 
scheduled for september 1990 will be rescheduled for a later date 
on a pershare basis the company said it lost 39 cents for the 
three months ended june 30 compared with a loss of 84 cents in the 
same quarter in 1989 
revenue rose 61 percent to 3485 million in the quarter from 
3286 million a year earlier 
the companys publishing operations reported income from 
operations of 347 million in the quarter up 394 percent from a 
year earlier as revenue rose 27 percent to 227 million 
income from insurance operations rose 116 percent to 106 
million in the quarter as revenue rose 13 percent to 1215 million 
interest expense fell to 66 million from 916 million a year 
earlier 
for the first half the company reported it lost 949 million 
or 147 a share compared with a loss of 1587 million or 264 
a share a year earlier 
revenue for the first half rose 97 percent to 6254 million 
from 5702 million a year earlier 
the company said its first half revenues are not indicative of 
the entire year because the publishing business is highly seasonal 
with the majority of revenues and operating profits coming in 
during the third quarter 
harcourt undertook a 3 billion recapitalization in 1987 after 
an unsolicited buyout offer from britains robert maxwell as part 
of the plan the company borrowed heavily to pay special dividends 
to shareholders 
last fall harcourt sold its sea world theme parks for 11 
billion in an effort to reduce its debt 
in june longtime harcourt chairman william i jovanovich 
resigned and was replaced by john s herrington a former secretary 
of energy during the reagan administration 
the job of running the company has fallen to jovanovichs son 
peter who has been chief executive of the company since last 
december 
many analysts say hbj generates enough cash to meet its interest 
obligations over the next 18 months to two years 
but they have warned that trouble could develop in 1992 when 
cash payments start coming due on preferred stock and bonds which 
now are issuing additional securities as dividends 
they say the company will have to either sell assets reschedule 
debt payments or get a capital infusion to meet those obligations

sony corp plans an expensive consumeroriented 
advertising campaign to support its new line of blank videotapes 
the company said tuesday sony declined to say how much it intended 
to spend on the campaign but it said it would exceed the estimated 
4 million to 5 million all the major brands combined spent on 
advertising blank tapes last year 
sony estimated us blank tape sales amount to 750 million a 
year industrywide 
the company said its consumeroriented ad approach which will 
use television and magazines such as people and tv guide breaks 
with the industrys practice of aiming advertising mainly at tape 
dealers 
video tape has been treated as a commodity item and that has 
resulted in disenchanted dealers confused consumers and sluggish 
sales said john bermingham president of domestic sales and 
marketing for sony magnetic products group of america 
he said sonys advertising for its new v tapes is designed 
to give the sony tapes a brand personality that consumers will 
recognize 
the new line of tapes provide better picture quality 
durability sound and performance the company claimed 
the tapes will be available at authorized dealers later this 
month and the ad campaign will start in september the company said

cattle futures prices surged tuesday on the chicago mercantile 
exchange reflecting an easing of economic worries linked to the 
middle east crisis strength in the cash cattle markets and 
chartinspired buying 
on other commodity markets pork futures ended mixed petroleum 
futures were mixed precious metals were mostly lower and grains 
and soybeans were mixed 
news from the middle east remained a major influence in many 
commodity markets but signs during the day that hostilities were 
cooling allowed traders to focus on other factors as well 
live cattle futures settled 28 cent to 115 cents higher in 
chicago with the contract for delivery in august at 7777 cents a 
pound feeder cattle were 55 cent to 112 cent higher with august 
at 8967 cents a pound live hogs were 95 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with august at 5807 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
40 cent lower to 52 cent higher with august at 5107 cents a 
pound 
charles levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said the inflation and recession fears caused by 
iraqs invasion of kuwait had had a depressing effect on cattle 
prices recently because consumers would tend to bypass beef in 
favor of cheaper meats if the economy took a downturn 
when you start comparing beef with chicken at the meat 
counters you know which is going to get the nod he said 
but cattle prices bounced back strongly tuesday as the stock and 
crudeoil markets steadied amid indications the iraqi government 
had assumed a less aggressive posture 
further support stemmed from stronger packer demand for live 
cattle and stonger demand for feeder cattle by feedlot operators 
paul hare livestock analyst with linnco futures inc in 
chicago said the live cattle market was oversold and due for a 
correction after falling for four straight days 
crude oil trading on the new york mercantile exchange was 
relatively calm after several days of skyrocketing prices 
in the gasoline and heating oil markets the contracts for 
deferred deliveries which are restricted in their movements by 
exchangeenforced limits rose most sharply in an attempt to catch 
up with the limitless nearmonth contracts 
after the close the american petroleum institute released 
weekly supply figures showing a steeperthanexpected decline in 
us stocks of crude oil and an unexpected increase in gasoline 
supplies 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 89 cents lower to 
150 higher with september at 2831 a barrel heating oil was 41 
cent lower to 4 cents higher with september at 7514 cents per 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 87 cent to 4 cents higher with 
september at 8239 cents per gallon 
gold and silver futures settled mostly lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange after a day of backandforth trading in 
reaction to rumors about the iraqkuwait conflict 
a report that iraq was holding 39 americans in a baghdad hotel 
and concerns about possible us retaliation contributed to 
nervousness in the gold market said bette raptopoulos senior 
metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
theyve been responding to every little rumor and every little 
story she said 
gold futures settled 10 cents higher to 70 cents lower with 
august at 38450 a troy ounce silver futures settled 32 cents to 
35 cents lower with august at 4857 an ounce 
grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade as signs of easing tensions in the middle east 
reduced inflationary pressures 
traders also began evening up their positions ahead of 
thursdays agriculture department crop report analysts said 
the report scheduled for release after thursdays close will 
contain the governments first official estimates of 1990 us corn 
and soybean production 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to cent higher with

oil prices moved higher again tuesday as 
prospects of curtailed supplies from the middle east triggered 
frantic trading amid market rumors 
on the new york mercantile exchange the september contract for 
west texas intermediate climbed 26 cents to settle at 2831 a 
42gallon barrel 
it was the highest level for the the benchmark grade of us 
crude since dec 6 1985 when the price reached 2874 per barrel 
the merc said 
among refined petroleum products wholesale unleaded gasoline 
was up 087 cent to 8239 cents a gallon later contract months 
showed sharper gains 
the september contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 
041 cent lower to 7514 cents but later contract months soared 
the 4cent daily limit 
the increases were smaller than in recent days indicating some 
selling to take profits prices fluctuated in nearrecord volume in 
trading for crude oil contracts 
its hard to envision a more bullish scenario than what we 
have now the potential that two of the largest producers in the 
persian gulf could go to war said andrew lebow an energy 
futures analyst with edf man international futures inc 
lebow said unconfirmed rumors including ones that iraq had 
invaded saudi arabia drove the market up and down fitfully 
the market opened calmer than expected on word that iraqi leader 
sadaam husein would allowe foreigners in kuwait and iraq to leave 
a statement that calmed the markets 
also bearish for the market was a report that assistant us 
energy secretary john easton told congress the government is 
prepared to use its strategic petroleum reserve in the event of a 
severe supply interruption 
after trading closed on the merc the united states said 
american troops were being sent to saudi arabia as part of a 
multinational force to defend the country 
among other products natural gas settled down 111 cents to 
1447 per million british thermal units

persian gulf war rumors raced through the financial world 
tuesday pushing oil prices toward 29 a barrel and sending more 
jolts through markets for us stocks and bonds 
increasing indications of a possible iraqus showdown in the 
vital oilproducing region transfixed professional investors and 
speculators through most of the day and made many markets seesaw 
without warning 
each suggestion of a conflict sent oil prices higher and stocks 
and bonds lower on the theory that a fresh blanket of oilshock 
inflation would wallop the already weak us economy conversely 
rumors that the situation was easing weakened oil prices and sent 
money back into the stock and bond markets 
although many traders said the panicky psychology that had 
gripped the markets since iraq seized kuwait last week seemed to 
subside others said widespread fear and anxiety persisted 
its an emotional volatile market said william veronda a 
fixedincome strategist at the denver investment firm financial 
programs inc 
the united states announced after domestic markets closed that 
it was deploying american troops as part of a multinational force 
in iraqs key neighbor saudi arabia oil brokers said that 
development escalated the prospects of fighting and likely would 
push oil prices higher when trading resumed 
the oil market again was the key influence on other markets 
worldwide affecting trillions of dollars in investments 
on the new york mercantile exchange a widely followed barometer 
of prices the cost of key west texas intermediate crude for 
september delivery gyrated throughout the day falling as much as 
155 a barrel to 2650 and jumping as high as 1 a barrel to 
2905 
the price settled at 2831 a barrel by the close of trading up 
26 cents from monday and up more than 40 percent from a week ago 
the close was the highest since 2874 on dec 6 1985 according 
to mercantile exchange records other blends of crude and refined 
products such as gasoline and heating oil also rose though not as 
sharply as in recent days 
michael broder vice president of the energy futures group at 
dean witter reynolds inc in new york said the markets behavior 
was dictated almost entirely by the uncertainty over whats 
happening in the middle east 
on wall street stocks escaped the largescale drubbing they 
took monday but brokers said buying interest was poor reflecting 
underlying fears about the consequences of higher oil prices 
the dow average ended down 570 points to 271064 its sixth 
straight loss overall the number of losing stocks slightly 
outnumbered advances in heavy trading 
prices had plunged monday and the dow jones industrial average 
fell more than 93 points its worst oneday slide since the 
minicrash of last october 
prices also fell tuesday in the bond market a barometer of 
interest rates and economic health the weakness especially 
affected longterm bonds reflecting investor fear that higher 
inflation would erode their value 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell about 6 per 1000 
face amount while its yield rose to 886 percent from 880 percent 
late monday 
in early trading in tokyo wednesday the nikkei stock average of 
225 selected issues regained some of the ground it lost tuesday 
when it dropped 94646 points to 2765307 its lowest level in 
almost 22 months 
basically whats happened over the past week or so is that 
people have become more pessimistic about inflation in the us 
economy said giulio martini an economist with the sanford c 
bernstein investment firm in new york what you conclude about 
this episode depends on where you think the price of oil will 
settle 
in foreign exchange the dollar ended higher against all major 
currencies except the german mark traders attributed the rise to a 
belief that shortterm us interest rates which directly affect 
the dollars value were likely to remain stable for the time being 
gold prices which moved sharply higher in recent days because 
of the metals historic value as a hedge against inflation ended 
the day little changed on the new york commodity exchange gold 
bullion for current delivery settled at 38450 a troy ounce down 
20 cents from monday
