franco zeffirellis productions for the 
metropolitan opera are lavish contain surprises but arent really 
avantgarde when the met audience gets used to them and the 
surprises dont surprise any more they become favorites 
zeffirellis new production of la traviata with the famed 
german conductor carlos kleiber and the czech coloratura edita 
gruberova bowed at the met on monday night 
kleiber made the orchestra sound smooth as silk in act 1 he 
varied tempi he ended the act very fast but never put the 
singers in jeopardy 
one expected miss gruberova to be best in act 1 where the 
coloratura singing is and less good later however her act 1 was 
a bit disappointing and her lyric singing in the later acts was 
effective and often pianissimo 
her top notes are effortless but her voice in coloratura 
passages has a rather hard edge one would like violetta to have a 
more womanly quality 
zeffirelli begins the opera with a prologue showing violetta on 
her deathbed then the party begins in her house in most 
productions her guests leave her to enter the dining room 
zeffirelli sends her into her bedroom to be alone achieving this 
by having the outer circle of the mets revolving stage move act 1 
alternates between her living room and bedroom since alfredo who 
just met her marches in to sing with her this production gives 
him more nerve than may be warranted 
having these two rooms move in and out ultimately seems not to 
add anything 
zeffirelli uses the same ploy in act 3 at floras party a 
sumptuous ballroom becomes a small gambling room when dark back 
walls slide in from the wings the party returns to the ballroom 
when the walls slide out there we liked the contrast and found 
the change less distracting than a revolving stage 
act 2 is in a huge garden room with one glass side beautiful 
but reminiscent of a conservatory at a botanic garden act 4 has 
violettas bedroom wall become seethrough letting revelers 
outside be seen and violetta sings standing and sitting instead of 
in bed as in most productions this violetta does a minimum of 
coughing and fainting all evening 
neil shicoff sang alfredo in act 1 he was swamped by his 
sopranos larger voice he gained vocal strength later the lovers 
duets were never a marvelous blend wolfgang brendel sang alfredos 
father with clarity and an edge which placed his character nearer 
stern than sympathetic 
fernando bujones and cynthia harvey danced splendidly in act 3 
though their choreography was unexciting wendy white a native of 
chicago who was a 1978 winner of the metropolitan opera auditions 
for young singers made her met debut as flora she managed to make 
a distinct and favorable impression in that small role

editors note julie wards charred remains were found in a 
sprawling gane reserve in september 1988 four months into her 
vacation in kenya her father is convinced she was murdered the 
government claims she was eaten by wild animals chege mbitiru and 
didrikke schanche have covered the case and this is their report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one of the few things not contested during 
the inquest into julie wards death was that the young british 
tourist was killed in one of the worlds most famous wildlife 
preserves 
just how she was killed remains a glaring question 
chief magistrate joseph mango has promised to rule oct 27 
whether enough evidence exists to open a murder investigation into 
the 28yearold womans death 
the inquest largely the result of pressure from ms wards 
father john ward has run intermittently since midaugust ward a 
successful hotelier from suffolk england has vowed to pursue the 
case whatever mango decides 
ms ward a wildlife photography enthusiast was four months 
into her second trip to kenya when she disappeared sept 6 1988 in 
the sprawling southwestern masai mara game reserve 
seven days later following an air and ground search ms wards 
suzuki bush vehicle was found mired in a creek well off her 
intended route six miles away in trackless bush searchers found 
the young womans lower jaw and charred and severed lower left leg 
near a pile of ashes and partly burned personal belongings 
kenyan police said ms ward either committed suicide or was 
eaten by one of the many carnivores that inhabit the game reserve 
home to kenyas largest lion population 
john ward insists his daughter was murdered and he has spent 
hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars trying to prove 
it 
ward and his attorney byron georgiadis dismiss the suicide and 
wild animal theories as absurd they claim park employees and 
police engaged in a massive coverup to protect either ms wards 
murderer or kenyas lucrative tourism industry 
tourism earned kenya 360 million last year and is the nations 
largest foreign exchange earner 
georgiadis has argued that ms ward was killed by someone who 
knew the masai mara well who had freedom of movement there and who 
could have ordered or inspired a coverup 
he has accused the maras senior game warden simon makallah of 
involvement in the death 
makallah found ms wards remains within hours after the suzuki 
was located and georgiadis claims he was able to do that only 
because he already knew where they were he further claims the game 
warden planted ms wards vehicle in the creek 
mr makallah knew where her remains were and was going there 
to make sure that nothing was left but he was with others so when 
he saw some still remained he had to find them georgiadis said 
in a closing argument oct 5 
to have committed suicide he said ms ward would have had to 
hack off her left leg cut off her head and douse her own remains 
with gasoline before setting them alight 
the wild animal theory was rejected after pathologist reports 
both in kenya and britain determined ms ward had been dismembered 
with a sharp instrument and her remains subsequently burned say 
ward and georgiadis both reports determined she died sept 12 
1988 
however the kenyan report prepared by state pathologist dr 
adel yousef shaker which initially said ms wards remains had 
been cleanly cut and that she suffered a sharp wound was 
subsequently changed by a superior 
the altered report said instead that her remains had been 
cracked and torn injuries more indicative of an animals 
mauling 
this report proved a key point during the inquest georgiadis 
claimed shaker was forced to accept the changes 
accepting the altered report as true said state prosecutor alex 
etyang left no other possible conclusion than that ms ward died 
by misadventure implicitly endorsing the wild animal theory 
etyang denied there had been any sort of coverup but he 
admitted police may have been inefficient and incompetent in their 
investigation 
superintendent muchiri wanjau a police investigator on the 
case admitted several blunders including the failure to take 
statements from rangers present where ms ward last was seen or 
from a swiss film crew camped several hundred yards from where her 
vehicle was found 
he also failed to record statements made by maasai tribesmen 
camped a mile from where ms wards remains were found and who 
georgiadis said told police they heard a womans screams 
in addition to the altered postmortem report and police 
failures in the case georgiadis points to the forgery committed by 
a game park gate keeper david nchoko who wrote ms wards name in 
his visitors book the day she was supposed to have left the 
preserve 
the visitors book with ms wards signature would have been the 
only material evidence the young woman left her campsite as 
intended but confronted with a handwriting experts testimony that 
her signature had been forged nchoko admitted he entered it into 
the book himself he said ms ward had forgotten to do so 
the fact that he forged and lied brings into question the 
whole edifice of the assertion that she left sand river gate on 
sept 6 said georgiadis

it only took a threeday meeting for 
the communists to scrap their party but it could take years to 
remove the influence of more than four decades of communist rule in 
hungary 
the communist party formally the hungarian socialist workers 
party was declared dead at a historic congress a week ago that 
gave birth to the hungarian socialist party 
spurred by upcoming free elections the congress heeded 
reformers calls for a party with democratic aspirations that would 
be more appealing to the electorate than a monolithic 
marxistleninist party the elections are due by june 
reform has been in the wind in hungary for the past several 
years even before mikhail s gorbachev decreed changes in the 
soviet union 
the most blatant stalinist manifestations personality cults 
workers brigades a repressive secret police were done away with 
under the late janos kadar but real reform gathered steam only 
after kadar was retired last year after 32 years at the helm 
the collective leadership succeeding kadar decided 
liberalization was the only way to counter serious economic 
problems it permitted political opposition to flourish for the 
first time since the communists consolidated power in 1948 and it 
pledged to permit the countrys first free national elections in 41 
years 
such developments have placed hungary on the vanguard of 
democratization within the soviet bloc along with poland the first 
warsaw pact country with a primarily noncommunist government 
the old party decided in september to begin dismantling its 
government chapters and the ministries of the interior finance 
and trade and commerce already have been formally depoliticized 
the party formally transferred control of its armed workers 
militia to the government in the summer 
after more than four decades of rewritten history there are 
plans to write it again this time reflecting events independent 
of marxist coloration education minister ferenc glatz has urged 
history teachers to use their own judgment in the classroom instead 
of old party dictates 
dozens of independent newspapers and periodicals have blossomed 
and are as free with criticism of the government and the party as 
any in the west private radio a britishhungarian commercial 
venture began functioning in june 
yet old habits die hard 
the premier and all but one of his ministers were ranking 
members of the old party and most remain in the top levels of the 
new one 
about 85 percent of senior officials in the interior ministry 
which controls the police were communist party members according 
to the independent weekly heti vilaggazdasag in the ministry of 
trade and commerce the rate is 80 percent and in the finance 
ministry it is 73 percent 
top management at state enterprises continues to be appointed by 
the party through the government the classic decisionmaking 
triangle of management party and trade union officials never has 
been dissolved although party spokesman emil kimmel said in an 
interview that it has died a natural death 
the congress endorsed the right of the new hungarian socialist 
party to organize politically in the workplace dismaying reformers 
who associate such a presence with traditional marxistleninist 
infiltration and indoctrination 
the overwhelming majority of workers militia members are also 
party members and its marxistleninist orientation continues 
informally 
plans to correct school text distortions could be complicated by 
reluctance in the new party to face the past squarely while 
condemning stalinist excesses the party congress rejected calls by 
reformist delegates to declare a holiday in memory of the 1956 
antistalinist revolution it expressed support instead for a 
day of reconciliation a normal working day with no direct 
mention of the soviet blocs bloodiest revolt 
the major newspapers radio stations and television remain 
under direct or indirect party control 
with the hungarian socialist party committed at least on paper 
to democracy and market forces its founders assert that its 
creation moves the country farther along the path of reform 
but membership is open to anyone who signs a declaration of 
agreement with the new partys democratic nature leading to fears 
that conservatives will join to keep jobs or privileges if enough 
do so their sheer numbers could sabotage reforms 
and even if the new party turns out to be a truly democratic 
institution that honors its pledge to give up power if defeated at 
the polls the stubborn legacy of the old party is bound to color 
society for years

association awarded czech playwright vaclav havel its annual 
peace prize but the human rights activist was not allowed to 
leave his country to claim it 
swiss actor and director maximillian schell collected the award 
at a ceremony sunday in st pauls cathedral because prague 
authorities refused to let the 53yearold havel to travel to 
frankfurt 
havel is banned from publishing in czechoslovakia and has been 
repeatedly jailed for his role in pressing for democratic reforms 
in his communist homeland he is a cofounder of the charter 77 
human rights organization 
the west german publishers association peace prize is awarded as 
part of the annual frankfurt book fair 
the publishing group says havel plans to use the 13000 prize 
money to start an independent publishing house for banned 
czechoslovak authors 
schell read a short acceptance message sent by havel who 
decried the continued repressions in czechoslovakia against writers 
who speak out for change 
havel reminded the gathering of the risks involved for him and 
other writers living in a country where one is still thrown in 
jail for his words and where socialism has become a rubber

the woman named shifa attired in a modest 
moslem headscarf and a fulllength dress says she is ready to vote 
in next months general election the first in which jordanian 
women will take part 
but who will determine her vote 
of course my husband because he is the man she told a 
reporter who chatted with her on a busy amman street festooned with 
banners for the nov 8 parliamentary election 
women like shifa she would not give her family name have 
dampened the optimism of womens rights activists facing their 
first nationwide campaign 
sixty percent of the women at least are not independent 
voters they will be influenced by their husband father or 
brother said laila sharaf one of just two female cabinet 
ministers in jordans 65year history 
jordan gave women the right to vote in 1974 but nationwide 
elections have not taken place since 1967 women have voted only in 
a few local elections to replace deputies who died or resigned 
this year several women are running for the 80 parliamentary 
seats and women comprise about half the countrys 1 million 
registered voters 
this is the first time we will have candidates discussing 
women and their rights said mrs sharaf a former minister of 
information 
some male candidates have targeted appeals to female voters 
woman is half of society she is the one who raises future 
generations announced a banner hoisted by one man 
the election follows two decades of rapid educational 
improvement 
when jordanians last voted nationwide only about a quarter of 
young women attended secondary school today the figure is about 80 
percent and many go on to universities or technical schools 
but conservative views of women mainly as homemakers remain 
deeply held some rooted in religion some in local traditions 
many women wear headscarves and long plain dresses that 
symbolize their adherence to a conservative vision of islam 
the world is the world of men and they always believe the 
woman is only for the house said haifa bashir head of the 
jordanian federation of women and a candidate for parliament 
women accounted for less than 15 percent of the work force in 
the mid1980s and activists say the number is declining because of 
economic difficulties and the tendency to drop women workers before 
men 
even now when the family cant pay for all their children to 
study they prefer to let the boy continue his studies and not the 
girl said asma khader a leading human rights lawyers 
they will not present the freedom to us she added we 
must work for it 
ms khader complained that jordans social security insurance 
and pension laws grant more benefits to men than women and that 
women cannot obtain a passport or get married without approval of 
male relatives 
women married to foreign men cannot pass along jordanian 
citizenship to their children and khader said criminal laws allow 
male relatives to kill a woman caught having sex out of wedlock 
while many of the laws are based on interpretations of islam 
jordans official religion mrs bashir argues that they are 
misinterpretations 
she said both the koran islams holy book and traditional 
islamic law gave rights to women 14 centuries ago better than 
what we are seeking now 
the debate flared into the press in september when a column 
defending womens rights in the daily newspaper al rai prompted a 
flood of complaints 
one letter writer opined that women are short of brains based 
on womens natural structure which differs from the mans as her 
emotional psychological structure prevails 
the weight of a womans brain is less than the brain of man 
argued another letter writer 
apparently to counter such sentiments king hussein used a 
recent speech to denounce religious preoccupation with womens 
clothing or attempts to limit their freedom 
islam is the religion of action and production and cannot 
accept the crippling of half the society said the king whose 
wife queen noor is a princetoneducated arabamerican 
women will have little impact on this years election said mrs 
sharaf but there will be a time they begin and they learn 
by the time the next election is held women will have increased 
their political conciousness and their role 
already politics has become a part of womens lives 
everyone everyone everyone is talking about it said 
rabiah adawiyeh who like shifa wore islamic clothing 
theres nothing on their tongues except the elections

coast sunday killing at least two people as it tossed cars and 
ripped down power lines balconies and trees in this island city 
the storm also spun off tornadoes that inflicted damage along the 
gulf coast 
jerrys fury combined with the highest tides of the year to 
flood coastal areas as thousands of people mostly in louisiana 
fled to higher ground 
the center of the hurricane moved ashore on the west end of 
galveston island about 725 pm with sustained winds of 75 mph 
and gusts up to 100 mph according to the national hurricane center

late sunday the bodies of a man and a small child were found 
floating near the citys seawall said gary stone a spokesman for 
galvestons emergency operations center he said the victims who 
could not be identified immediately were believed to either 
passengers in a car that washed over the seawall or pedestrians 
there were no other immediate reports of injuries 
glass windows in an apartment complex on the islands west end 
were blown out and several balconies were torn off 
the winds blew threw the glass of several of these apartments

brush past the southeast side of houston while steadily losing 
power over land meteorologists said rainfall totals of 3 to 5 
inches were expected along the path during the next 12 to 24 hours 
jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane the least severe 
possible hurricane hugo which devastated charleston and other 
parts of south carolina last month was a category 4 
i think that we did very well galveston mayor jan 
coggeshall said after the hurricane had passed over the island 
after a twohour mauling 
i think were going to find some damage but i dont think 
its going to be as significant as it could have been i think we 
are going to suffer a lot of erosion on the west end beaches he 
said 
city leaders said a team of officials would begin surveying 
damage to the area at 6 am monday 
as jerry struck heavy rains and rising tides moved over the 
upper texas coast and were expected to increase over the southwest

eye and 15 miles west that was about 10 times weaker than hugo 
which packed hurricane force winds extending 100 miles out from its 
center 
its a very small hurricane i would not expect much damage 
from it said bob sheets director of the national hurricane 
center 
category 4 is a major disaster and jerry is a bad day said 
jerry jarrell deputy director of the center 
jerry strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane 110

mph or 1 mph above the threshold according to the national 
hurricane center during the afternoon the storm reached 85 mph 
sustained wind and swung onto a northerly course toward galveston

whistle the way most people do but that didnt stop him from 
winning top honors at the international whistleoff for the second 
time 
the altadena calif man whistles while inhaling sucking air 
between his teeth and tongue to produce a unique hornlike sound

roberts of eugene ore who whistled several songs while standing 
on her head and conducting a puppet show with her feet

bosco matamoros once the voice of the contra 
rebels is hammering out his memoirs a work he says will unmask 
the stupidity and arrogance of the governments handling of 
central american policy in nicaragua 
i will portray the americans as we saw them matamoros said 
during an interview at his washington apartment im very 
relieved we dont have to deal with people who didnt speak a word 
of spanish who represented the ugly american 
matamoros 44 always an outspoken critic of the united states 
describes himself as deeply resentful of what he sees as the bush 
administrations dismantling of the civilian directorate and the 
way the contras were treated although he still considers himself 
the movements spokesman the united states does not 
my whole thesis of the book is the whole thing has been a 
farce he said the americans never respected us as the 
resistance they saw us as puppets their attitude is change your 
course or you are purged 
the united states backed the contra rebels since 1981 in their 
fight to oust the leftist sandinista government in nicaragua that 
support brought international condemnation as well as domestic 
problems most notably the irancontra affair in which the 
government sold arms to iran and used the funds to finance the 
antisandinista rebels 
the bush administration has sought to distance itself from the 
contras pointing to congressional will and agreements reached by 
central american leaders the administration has stopped arguing 
for military aid and agreed to provide the rebel combatants most 
of whom are in base camps in honduras with food and clothes 
several of the civilian leaders recently returned to nicaragua 
to take part in next years elections the ciafinanced contra 
office in miami and the congressionally approved radio station were 
shuttered 
our perspective has changed said one administration source 
who works closely with contra issues but declined to be further 
identified we no longer deal with the guys in suits 
the state department now works directly with the rebel 
commanders he said adding that the contra civilians at the time 
served a tactical necessity to lobby congress for funds the move 
leaves matamoros and others as unemployed exiles 
sitting by his typewriter near four cages of chirping doves 
finches and parakeets matamoros says a tamed more easily 
influenced sandinismo was preferable to continuing the fight in 
washington 
he leafs through his notes written in spanish and translated 
into english by his american wife 
they have achieved their big objective to eliminate the 
resistance politically matamoros says 
he said his book in the infant stages will talk about his 
dealings with prominent figures in the irancontra scandal 
including oliver north carl spitz channell richard r miller 
and richard secord 
north channell and miller were found guilty of charges 
surrounding the affair secord a former air force general is 
scheduled for trial next month 
matamoros mocked the key american players charged with plotting 
the contra policy saying it shows the stupidity and arrogance 
of an establishment facing a problem in a third world country 
matamoros indicated his book also will expose the schisms and 
infighting among the civilian contra leadership he portrays 
himself as sympathetic to the fighters writing on one side are 
the sandinistas on the other are the refugee camps 
but matamoros who has lived outside nicaragua since 1962 saw 
the battlefield only when accompanying journalists on forays into 
war zones he headed nicaraguas delegation to the united nations 
food and agriculture organization in rome as the representative of 
anastasio somoza the nicaraguan dictator deposed by the 
sandinistas in 1979

there was jesse helms one recent night 
rolling one of his trademark legislative hand grenades down the 
aisle of the united states senate and waiting cannily to watch his 
colleagues scatter in fear 
but instead freshman sen barbara mikulski handily defused the 
helms bombshell an amendment barring us aid to poland from 
going to communistcontrolled enterprises 
invoking her own polish heritage the maryland democrat asserted 
that poles everywhere know that the heart and soul of poland 
lie with democracy she argued helms amendment would cripple a 
fledgling economic reform movement and once again slam down the 
iron curtain the move was killed 7425 
it was one in a series of recent legislative setbacks for the 
vocally conservative helms whose maneuvers on the senate floor are 
drawing an irritated response from other senators 
we are being asked to cast a lot of votes make a lot of 
political statements not for the purpose of what the body was set 
up to do but rather for a variety of other purposes said sen 
tim wirth dcolo i for one am fed up with it 
in the past few weeks alone helms sought to bar the national 
endowment for the arts from subsidizing works deemed indecent 
to pressure the bush administration to use military force to oust 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega and to kill reparations 
payments to japaneseamericans interned during world war ii 
veteran helms observers say the flurry of activity is an 
indication that at age 68 the north carolina republican still has 
the zeal for a fourth term in washington and will go after it with 
his usual ferocity helms has made no public announcement of his 
intentions for next year when his seat comes up for reelection 
says political scientist merle black his political strength 
has always been the old confederate mentality you dont have 
to win you just have to put up a good stand 
helms acknowledged he has been active lately but called it 
coincidental and dismissed any political connection every six 
years this sort of speculation occurs he said 
and he said despite polls showing his favorable rating below 50 
percent his own instincts tell him his brand of emotional issues 
politics still plays well in north carolina joe lunchbucket out 
there in america land he goes by issues if anything there has 
been an increase in the intensity of people with respect to issues 
which they think are important to them 
the senate ultimately agreed to a watereddown version of his 
arts amendment but defeated him on the reparations issue and 
soundly knocked down the panama proposal 
the senate is refusing to be intimidated said sen bill 
bradley dnj at some point youve got to ask yourself why is 
he doing this 
one answer may be fundraising 
helms office has sent out a flurry of money appeals and the 
fight over grants supporting offensive art has been turned into 
radio commercials in north carolina that tout the senator as a 
defender of moral standards 
another may be politics 
during debate over arts funding sen patrick leahy dvt 
voiced what other senators were saying privately if you vote 
against this amendment can you not see the 30second ad senator 
soandso voted for pornography 
but some say helms tactics are losing their effectiveness and 
predict he will find himself with less and less company 
i think he is running scared said black a political 
science professor at emory university in atlanta who has closely 
studied helms career he said the senators recent high activity 
level is a signal that the reelection campaign is underway and 
that he has slipped 
and the outrage was palpable one recent night as the clock 
ticked later and senate majority leader george mitchell sought 
agreement to have the senate meet at 830 the next morning to 
resume work on helms amendment 
my 17monthold granddaughter is visiting me and i want to 
feed her breakfast helms said could we start at 9

consumer advocates and others say theyre glad 
president bush is finally filling a vacancy that will put the 
consumer product safety commission back in business but theyre 
troubled with his choice for the job 
bush last week nominated jacqueline jonessmith as the panels 
third commissioner if confirmed by the senate she would succeed 
terrence m scanlon to head the commission and would provide the 
quorum the panel needs to conduct business 
its been a long time coming said mary ellen fise product 
safetyrector at the consumer federation of america thgest consumer 
advocacy group were happy that finally the commission will be 
able to act again 
there was concern for the overall commission in the fact that 
it cant function now they cant take formal action said one 
congressional aide 
the agency has been virtually powerless without its 
congressionally mandated quorum of three since scanlons departure 
nine months ago it cannot hold meetings to proceed with rulemaking 
or many enforcement activities 
earlier consumer advocates attacked scanlons emphasis on 
voluntary ety standards and cooperation with industry theny 
criticized bush for allowing the commission to languish without its 
third member 
but now some expresss about whether jonessmith has the 
necessary bexperience in the consumer arena 
jonessmien a staff attorney in the general counsels ofl 
election commission since 1987 she also was an assistant county 
attorney in montgomery county md 
whdnt find was any evidence of experience in consumer product 
safety issues said pam gilbert consumer program director of the 
public interest research group founded by consumer advocate ralph 
nader 
thats where i would register my concern she would be the 
chairman of the consumer product safety commission with little or 
no experience in product safety issues gilbert said 
however bonnie guiton head of the white house office of 
consumer affairs said there is value to someone who hasnt been 
so locked in that they cant see things with a balanced 
perspective 
jackie is very bright very capable and her legal background 
makes her very thorough said guiton a friend of jonessmith 
there also has been concern on capitol hill about her lack of 
formal background in consumer matters according to one house 
commerce committee staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
however most in consumer interests circles say they believe 
jonessmith will be confirmed by the senate 
the commission is an independent regulatory agency established 
by congress in 1972 it is responsible for assuring the safety of 
more than 15000 types of consumer products except prescription 
and overthecounter drugs automobiles and cosmetics 
the uthorizes five commissioners appointed by the president and 
serving staggered sevenyear termsess has provided funds for only 
three commissioners in recent years 
since scanlons january departure ane graham acting 
chairwoman and carol g dawson both republicans have continued 
on the commsmith would fill a democratic spot on the panel 
jonessmith is married to republican businessman joshua i 
smith who was a bush campaign fundraiser

oil and auto company lobbyists had worked 
furiously to weaken president bushs plan to produce millions of 
cleanfuel cars and it was time for a crucial subcommittee vote 
on gutting the program 
rep norman f lent rny the bills chief sponsor told the 
packed hearing room that white house chief of staff john sununu 
told him the administration did not oppose the weakening amendment 
but rep henry a waxman dcalif piped up that he just got a 
call from environmental protection agency administrator william k 
reilly saying the administration vigorously opposed the change 
the mixup exposed a disorganized administration seemingly in 
conflict with itself over president bushs clean air bill the 
weakening amendment passed the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee on wednesday 1210 
i dont know where the administration is and it may be all 
over the lot on both sides said waxman the subcommittee 
chairman shortly before the vote it tells a lot about how 
theyre handling the bill 
actually the administration did have a workable strategy to 
oppose the industry amendment but show a willingness to negotiate 
changes to restore the thrust of bushs proposal 
but the strategy broke apart the day of last weeks vote 
the administration only had to turn one gop vote around but the 
mixed signals were the blessing from the pope that republicans 
needed to vote with the special interests according to a 
democratic staffer speaking only on condition he not be named 
the incident was just the latest example of administration 
officials sowing confusion about their position on a key issue 
when the senate was debating repeal of catastrophic health 
coverage for retirees health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan publicly endorsed an amendment that would have salvaged 
most of the program within hours white house budget director 
richard g darman said sullivan was not speaking for the 
administration which was not endorsing any particular amendment 
in the failed coup against panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio 
noriega the administrations actions reported as confused and 
cautious failed to match bushs rhetoric encouraging dissident 
officers to overthrow the strongman 
the clean air vote could have been avoided by sending a clear 
message that the administration was opposed to the weakening 
language the democratic staffer said 
at stake was a provision that the white house previously 
characterized as the most innovative and farreaching component 
of bushs proposals to clear up urban smog by the end of the 
century 
in fact according to lawmakers and administration officials 
negotiations to change the amendment were underway as the 
subcommittee convened last wednesday but instead of communicating 
that lent and waxman told of the conflicting phone calls 
amid such confusion eight republicans and four democrats backed 
the weakening changes while nine democrats and one republican 
opposed them 
the vote weakened bushs proposed performance standard for fuels 
other than pure gasoline and dropped the required production of 1 
million cleanfuel cars a year between 1997 and 2004 the change 
would allow automakers to simply certify that they could build the 
cars 
the administration is negotiating with amendment sponsors jack 
fields rtexas and ralph hall dtexas to revive the key portions 
of bushs proposal in the full energy and commerce committee 
white house press spokesman stephen hart said sununu did not 
change the administrations position that the amendment should move 
closer to the presidents language any misunderstanding rested 
with lent he added 
lent said in an interview that undoubtedly there was a 
misunderstanding about sununus position and acknowledged he 
may not have given the subcommittee the full picture by failing to 
mention the changes demanded by the administration

as unesco opens a monthlong meeting to chart its 
future course the united states is expressing doubt that the 
troubled world body will jettison enough ideology to bring about 
washingtons return as a member 
the 158nation organization will also decide whether to admit 
the plo as a full member a step the united states has said will 
rule out any possibility of it rejoining the agency 
the meeting beginning tuesday represents a crucial test for 
directorgeneral federico mayor the spanish biochemist and former 
education minister took over as head of the united nations 
educational scientific and cultural organization two years ago 
he must see that the new more pragmatic program he has proposed 
for the first half of the 1990s gets approved without any of the 
ideological overtones that led to us and british withdrawal in 
the mid1980s 
a former us senator heading an international panel examining 
unesco policies backed mayors plan 
republican robert t stafford of vermont speaking for the 
americans on the panel said thursday that if unesco adopts the 
substance of mayors plan the united states should resume its 
membership in unesco early in 1990 
but the panel in a report released today said unesco will 
remain an underperformer unless it adopts reforms and seeks 
advice from eminent scientists and experts in human rights 
communications and other fields 
the key to unescos success is professionalization in its 
programs says the report commissioned by the un association of 
the usa a private group interested in strengthening and 
improving the united nations and other international agencies 
panelists were drawn from america the soviet union and numerous 
other industrialized and developing countries and spanned the 
ideological spectrum 
the united states and britain which between them provided 30 
percent of unescos budget pulled out because they said unesco had 
become too political spent too much money and was poorly managed 
singapore also left saying it could spend its dues better 
elsewhere 
some 2000 delegates will attend the biennial meeting of the 
general conference the organizations highest decisionmaking 
body in addition to charting unescos future activities they will 
adopt a budget for 19901991 
the united states and britain have said they will review their 
positions on rejoining unesco after the general conference ends 
last month us assistant secretary of state john r bolton 
told a congressional committee that it was extremely unlikely 
the united states would rejoin the body if its current draft plan 
for 19901995 is approved 
bolton said mayor who took over in november 1987 from amadou 
mahtar mbow of senegal had promised to depoliticize the world 
body introduce budgetary restraints cut back on activities and 
neutralize a drive by third world nations to set up a new world 
information order 
bolton said mayor failed on all counts and has been hesitant 
to enunciate a clear new direction much less institute 
significant change or programmatic reforms 
mayor has said his room for maneuver was somewhat limited 
because he had inherited mbows programs he said more reform 
would come after the general conference adopted his proposals 
but he asserts that since he took over unesco has become more 
open improved its management and strengthened its ties with member 
states and other un agencies he promised to make personnel 
changes but said he would not remove senior aides appointed by 
mbow 
on the palestine liberation organizations request for 
membership he has said the un general assembly should decide 
such issues not unesco but he has promised to involve the 
palestine observer mission more closely in unesco activities 
unescos executive board recommended wednesday that the plo 
request be put off until 1991 
as at previous conferences for more than a decade one of the 
most contentious issues will be the new world information and 
communication order 
mayor presented a new reformoriented free press approach in the 
communications section of the plan for 19901995 but members of 
unescos 50nation executive board including senegals iba der 
thiam made changes steering the plan toward disputed objectives 
the delegates will have to decide whether to accept the boards 
changes or stick with the draft proposed by mayor 
to overcome what they see as western domination in the flow of 
information third world nations backed by the soviet bloc favor 
the new information order so they can regulate content of news and 
enlist media support for government objectives 
western nations and news organizations say the order could lead 
to censorship and other restrictions on journalists

hurricane hugo took a devastating human toll 
but its victims also included rare and endangered birds such as the 
red cockaded woodpecker which lost one of its few remaining 
habitats in the killer storm 
some endangered species really took a heavy hit by hugo 
said rudy rosen a biologist for the national wildlife federation 
which along with several government agencies has been trying to 
catalog the loss 
perhaps no endangered bird fared as badly as the red cockaded 
woodpecker a tiny bird that conservationists have been trying to 
save from extinction for nearly two decades in recent years its 
decline had been halted with an estimated 2000 woodpecker colonies 
found mainly in three national forests 
one sanctuary for about 500 woodpecker colonies was the 
250000acre frances marrion national forest just north of 
charleston sc where hugo roared ashore last month 
the forest was just wiped out trees on the ground twisted 
and uprooted said rosen he said anywhere from onefourth to 
perhaps as many as threefourths of the endangered woodpeckers in 
the forest may have been killed those that lived through the storm 
may not survive because most of the aging trees that were their 
habitat no longer stand he continued 
we have lost potentially forever one of the most viable 
populations of the red cockaded woodpecker at a time when the 
population is declining said rosen the only other significant 
habitats for the woodpeckers are national forests in mississippi 
and florida 
the oldgrowth pine trees at the marrion forest which the 
woodpeckers called home were especially easy targets for hugo 
because many already had been weakened by the woodpeckers boring 
of holes for nests 
the us forest service has been drilling artificial cavities 
into remaining pine trees in hopes of accommodating the surviving 
woodpeckers but rosen said its unclear whether that will work 
because the remaining trees are not ideal for woodpeckers nesting 
he said other animals and birds including squirrels and owls may 
compete for the manmade nests 
but the red cockaded woodpecker was not the only endangered bird 
caught by hugo 
even before hugo raced onto the us mainland its victims in 
the caribbean included the rare puerto rican wild parrot before 
the storm 47 of the endangered wild parrots were known to live in 
the wild on the island 
to date we have been able to locate 23 of the birds said 
rosen he said about 80 percent of the birds habitat was 
defoliated when hugo whipped across the island 
conservationists for a time thought the storm also had claimed 
five rare red wolves on bull island near charleston the wolves 
disappeared for days but later were found said rosen 
their loss would have been a major setback in efforts by the 
interior department to reintroduce red wolves into the wild until 
a few years ago the red wolf was considered extinct except for

the bush administration partly because of the 
federal housing scandal appears to be quietly moving away from the 
reaganera policy of turning more and more governmental functions 
over to private enterprise 
publicly the administration remains committed to the policy of 
privatization and the sale of some government assets remains 
an attractive means to help reduce the budget deficit but there 
are a number of signs that the bush administration does not share 
its predecessors zeal for finding ways to contract out work done 
by government employees 
after nine months in office budget director richard darman has 
not yet replaced previous officials who ran president reagans 
privatization program 
lets not ignore the proper role of government in determining 
those instances where the public benefit outweighs the costs 
darmans deputy frank hodsoll earlier this year told the 
privatization council a lobbying group formed in the reagan years 
we must draw the line between public responsibility and 
private provision of goods and services hodsoll said 
conservatives estimate that privatization could save the 
taxpayers billions of dollars but a leading congressional watchdog 
of reagans efforts sen david pryor dark said government 
accountability should come before possible savings 
contractors not government officials often have effective 
responsibility for the most basic decisionmaking pryor said 
darman recently told congress the management problems of the 
federal government are enormous that assessment was based 
largely on a governmentwide review he ordered after reports 
surfaced of widespread fraud and mismanagement at the department of 
housing and urban development expected to cost the government 6 
billion 
several officials who responded to the review questioned the 
effectiveness of contracting out certain services and said civil 
service morale needed a boost 
management and internal control oversight are inherently 
governmental functions which are adversely affected by initiatives 
like the current strong omb office of management and budget 
emphasis on contracting out nasa deputy administrator james r 
thompson jr said in his memo to darman 
nearly 90 percent of our funds pass through deliverers whose 
operations and accounting systems are not under dol operational 
control labor department deputy secretary rod dearment wrote to 
darman 
those who helped reagan push his privatization plan contend 
neither bush nor darman was committed to the idea and now can use 
the hud scl as a reason to halt the effort 
its norivatization that went wrong it was the execution 
said the ritage foundations stephen moore who was resefor 
reagans commission on privatization pri is being made a 
scapegoat here 
moores ts mirror those of hud secretary jack kemp who ushing 
ahead with some of the more controversial elements of the reagan 
privatization plan allowing tenants to public housing and 
providing rent vouchers to instead of subsidies to their landlords 
t the idea it was the implementation of the ide kemp said when 
asked if the 1 billion losses a hud coinsurance program stemmed 
from privatiin that case giving private lenders the power tove 
governmentinsured loans 
under reaganrivatization was established within the budget 
office and aidesere told to search for government assets and seo be 
turned over to the private sector as a rember of government 
agencies now contract out secial and food service work computer 
processing and repairs and other work 
hud allows private lenders to process and approve government 
loans the environmental protection agency hires consultants to 
interpret regulations and the energy department contracts out 
management of its nuclear facilities 
reagans omb in late 1987 estimated the government had saved 
more than 2 billion through privatization and that several billion 
more could be saved annually if more government work was contracted 
out 
heritage a conservative think tank estimated 3 billion a year 
could be saved by expanded privatization and a commission reagan 
appointed put the annual savings at 46 billion if work now 
performed by 400000 federal workers was contracted out

it looks like another record season for 
christmas tree farmers despite the preference of many americans 
for artificial trees that can be boxed and stored until next year 
a record 343 million christmas trees were sold in 1988 and an 
agriculture department report says the market is expected to exceed 
35 million this year 
economist doyle johnson said there are about 15000 commercial 
christmas tree growers in the united states these producers have 
more than 87 million trees of all ages planted on about 1 million 
acres 
last year he said christmas trees had a wholesale value of 
about 680 million putting the tree business ahead of a number of 
traditional agricultural commodities in terms of total cash 
receipts 
in 1987 for example oat production was worth about 200 
million rice 500 million sheep and lambs 600 million barley 
800 million sugar cane 800 million grain sorghum 1 billion 
and peanuts 1 billion 
the report which is scheduled for the november issue of 
farmline magazine said that 90 percent of the christmas trees sold 
each year are usgrown with the rest coming from canada 
top producing states are oregon michigan wisconsin 
california north carolina washington and pennsylvania 
a few larger growers in the west and the northeast harvest 
over 1 million trees each but most operations are much smaller 
the report said many producers grow christmas trees on a 
parttime basis or to supplement other farmrelated activities 
according to usda and industry analysts the supply of natural 
christmas trees may grow over the next five to seven years because 
of overplanting following 1988 drought losses and the entry of new 
growers 
johnson said growers averaged about 12 per tree last year 
while wholesale prices averaged about 20 most trees douglas fir 
and scotch pine retailed for 3 to 350 per foot 
consumers generally buy trees that are 6 to 7 feet tall the 
report said spruce trees the most expensive type retail for 
40 to 50 pines are typically lower in price especially in the 
south naturally a premium tree commands a premium price but 
usually requires longer to mature and more labor 
two other agency economists glenn zepp and boyd buxton said in 
telephone interviews that they didnt know of any overriding factor 
that would boost christmas tree prices significantly this season 
from 1988 levels 
fred strathmeyer of dover pa president of the national 
christmas tree association said christmas tree farming demands 
someone willing to work yearround on a crop that might not be 
marketable for a good six years 
depending on the species it can take up to 15 years to grow a 
tree to a height of six feet the average retail height the 
average growth time is seven years the shortest is four years in 
the deep south 
according to the association there is a growing tendency for 
farmers to open their land to people who want to choose and cut 
their own trees currently there are an estimated 5000 of these 
chooseandcut farms 
the trade association which has been promoting christmas trees 
for more than 30 years says the industry has grown 2 percent to 
25 percent annually for the last 15 years at least twice the 
growth rate of the us population 
but the industry had its greatest blow in the 1950s when the 
artificial tree was introduced the report said made primarily in 
south korea taiwan and hong kong the artificial tree continues 
biting at the us market 
the industry countered in 1988 with its first national 
advertising campaign realtree featuring television personality 
willard scott 
following a 1 million advertising assault on fake christmas 
trees preliminary retail reports were encouraging the report 
said retailers sales were up 6 percent over 1987 
the chooseandcut farms showed the biggest gains with an 
average increase in sales of between 12 percent and 15 percent the 
report said 
but the future is unclear an increase in the number of family 
households of 16 million between 1970 and 1980 would indicate a 
growth market for real trees however a slow population growth of 
1 percent a year coupled with an aging america could mean more 
demand for artificial trees 
the older generation middleaged america tends to buy 
artificial trees or forego a tree altogether the report said 
the family unit consisting of mom dad and about two kids is the 
backbone of the real christmas tree market 
strathmeyer said that in 1965 artificial trees held 20 percent 
of the available market for christmas trees by 1985 artificials 
held 47 percent and could add another 10 percent to 12 percent by 
the mid1990s

the solar maximum satellite 
repaired in a daring space shuttle mission five years ago is 
expected to come crashing back to earth next month possibly in 
three big chunks 
the satellites imminent demise comes as the national 
aeronautics and space administration is trying to reassure the 
public about the safety of a nuclearpowered probe to be launched 
tuesday from the space shuttle atlantis 
charles redmond spokesman for nasas science office said the 
chances of satellite debris hurting anyone are remote because solar 
maxs track takes it over large expanses of ocean and sparsely 
settled land areas 
this is a routine satellite reentry redmond said sunday 
only the largest parts of the satellite are expected to survive the 
heat created by crashing through the atmosphere a gyroscope 
package that orients the satellite a frame for a sun sensor and a 
device that holds parts in place 
redmond said the satellite will hit the earth sometime in 
midnovember producing up to three 120pound pieces 
environmental activists oppose tuesdays shuttle launch saying 
an accident might release radioactive fuel over parts of florida 
the galileo probe carrying 494 pounds of plutonium238 is to 
be released by the five astronauts six hours after launch and sent 
on its sixyear journey to jupiter 
the only portions of the united states under the solar max 
ground track are south florida the extreme southern part of texas 
and hawaii the track also covers much of south america africa 
india australia and the southernmost tip of china 
solar max cost 77 million to build and launch in february 1980 
at a time of maximum activity in the suns 11year sunspot cycle 
its mission was to study solar flares 
but after 10 months of service three fuses blew in a control 
box and it was unable to point itself accurately that in turn 
caused four of its seven onboard instruments to fail 
in 1984 the shuttle challenger pulled alongside the satellite 
and astronaut terry hart grabbed it with the ships 50foot robot 
arm at the time it was called the historic first capture of a 
satellite in orbit for inflight repair and thenpresident reagan 
congratulated the astronauts in an oval officetochallenger call 
the following day two astronauts working in the open cargo 
bay replaced the satellites control system module and an 
electronics box 
solar max has been working well since then plans were made for 
a time to boost it to a higher orbit again but that would have set 
back other scheduled missions and the idea was abandoned redmond 
said 
its seen a complete solar cycle he said of the satellite 
essentially its completed its mission

the historic battery has been spruced 
up the tourists have been invited back and all but one of the 
emergency shelters for victims of hurricane hugo have been closed 
but the recovery of this 319yearold city has largely bypassed 
the poor and many families left homeless by the storm 3 weeks ago 
wonder where they will get their next meal and how long they can 
depend on charity for a place to sleep 
weve been going from place to place this is the fourth place 
weve stayed said ethel williams 77 bedridden with a cold last 
week at the ebenezer african methodist episcopal church shelter 
mrs williams hasnt been able to return to ansonborough homes 
a lowincome housing project since it was flooded with 4 feet of 
water by the 18foot tidal surge that came ashore with hugo on 
sept 21 
joining mrs williams in her worries was her 78yearold 
neighbor rosa ferguson who retired on a small pension 
i dont know where im going to live mrs ferguson said 
the only thing i wish for is they could turn me out to a shelter 
of my own that i could find my own shack 
the two women are far from alone 
the church is feeding about 150 people a day and housing 16 
with more expected said the rev charles mclamore 
were talking about the people whove got no family to go to 
got no insurance to repair their home he said those kind of 
people that lost everything they had and a paycheck wont cover 
it 
hugo killed 33 people in the caribbean and 29 on the us 
mainland 
in south carolina 18 were killed 270000 left jobless and 
50000 to 65000 lost homes damage to homes businesses and the 
farming fishing timber and tourism industries has been estimated 
at 4 billion or more 
federal emergency management agency provides individuals and 
families with up to 10000 for housing and smaller amounts for 
repairs and rent so far the agency has distributed about 44 
million to 2300 people 
but mclamore says many of the poor will never see the federal 
aid because theyre unable or unwilling to deal with the paperwork 
most of these people who need it most dont want to go 
through all of them applications and stuff he said a lot of 
these people cant write cant read just cant find a decent job 
they are just left out 
the american red cross has helped thousands by providing 
vouchers for food clothing and furniture and one months rent for 
temporary housing said liz leopard a spokeswoman for the carolina 
lowcountry red cross but she said the poor may be unable to bounce 
back as quickly as middle and upperclass victims 
its the people who are barely getting by in the first place 
that really get hit by this she said 
the red cross which housed 90000 people in 67 shelters in five 
states at one point had just one shelter open in south carolina 
during the weekend housing 40 people 
in the battery section overlooking fort sumter roofs of stately 
homes have been patched and debris has been cleared and stacked for 
removal mayor joseph riley has invited the tourists to return 
relief workers say there are many like leroy clifford who lost 
everything in the storm and is living at the church shelter with 
his blind father housing prospects are bleak 
really i dont know clifford said when asked where he and 
his father will live 
roxy hyatt lost her job just before the hurricane then hugo 
tossed a tree onto her trailer in north charleston 
weve had to hit the free food lines said ms hyatt who 
has two children shawna 10 and corey 6 shes looking for a job 
but having a hard time for lack of money for gas and the handouts 
go only so far enough to survive but its barely enough 
she and her children got sick from trudging to relief centers in 
the unseasonably cold and heavy rains that followed the storm 
shawna and corey both have strep throat and corey has a rash 
that doctors say is from the stress of the storm she said 
ive been begging and borrowing to get the money for the medicine 
but it still wasnt enough

south african blacks view nelson 
mandela and walter sisulu as virtual equals and the sisulu clan is 
widely considered the first family of the antiapartheid movement 
but during their long imprisonment mandela a collegeeducated 
lawyer and charismatic speaker captured the international 
spotlight rather than sisulu a former laborer and high school 
dropout 
i am happy to be with the people and to receive a civilized 
welcome sisulu told hundreds of supporters and journalists 
gathered outside his small stucco house in soweto after his release 
from 26 years in prison sunday 
despite his unpromising origins sisulu has become one of the 
most respected thinkers and strategists of the outlawed african 
national congress his wife and six children are committed and 
respected activists in the antiapartheid movement 
wearing glasses and a gray suit the whitehaired 77yearold 
sisulu looked more like a church elder than leader of an outlawed 
guerrilla group 
but he remains completely dedicated to his organization which 
was formed in 1912 the year he was born in the xhosa homeland of 
transkei also mandelas birthplace 
unlike mandela who is related to a tribal chief and was trained 
for leadership sisulu was born into rural poverty and quit school 
at 15 to help support his family 
he held jobs as a bakers assistant domestic servant dairy 
worker factory laborer and gold miner after quarreling with 
employers over wages and work conditions he set up his own real 
estate business which lasted only a few years 
sisulu joined the thenlegal anc in johannesburg in 1940 and 
became known as the person young men from the rural areas should 
see to get a start in the big city he advised and helped mandela 
and current anc president oliver tambo who are both six years 
younger 
sisulu was secretarygeneral of the anc and ran its daytoday 
operations from 1949 to 1954 when the government ordered him to 
resign after that he continued to participate behind the scenes 
he was imprisoned eight times from 1953 to 1964 and was one of 
156 defendants in the 1956 to 1961 treason trial of government 
opponents which ended with acquittals for all 
in 1962 sisulu was arrested six times but charged only once 
he was convicted in march 1963 of furthering the aims of the anc 
which had been banned in 1960 
released on appeal sisulu went underground and joined the ancs 
armed wing in july 1963 he was arrested with others at the ancs 
secret headquarters in rivonia outside johannesburg and charged 
with sabotage 
during the trial sisulu acknowledged the anc had used sabotage 
but denied the states charge that a guerrilla war had been 
launched because he said there was still hope 
leading afrikaner intellectuals began to meet leaders of the 
african people he said it was my view that wellconducted 
political action could bring about a changed situation 
sisulus wife albertina is a prominent activist in her own 
right she was banned from 1964 until 1981 and was served with new 
restrictions in 1988 because of her role as copresident of the 
banned united democratic front an antiapartheid coalition her 
restrictions were lifted on friday 
the government granted her a limited passport in june allowing 
her to leave the country for the first time she met president bush 
and british prime minister margaret thatcher among other world 
leaders

ten governors in an unusual 
friendofthecourt brief filed with the supreme court are urging 
the justices to reject efforts to restrict abortion 
the governors asked the high court to strike down an illinois 
statute they said would impose extremely burdensome 
requirements on abortion clinics 
they added that while it is their job to enforce constitutional 
rights it is up to the courts to define those rights 
they urged the high court not to scale back the principle laid 
down in the landmark 1973 case roe v wade holding that women 
have a constitutional right to abortions during the first three 
months of pregnancy 
the amicus curiae brief in the illinois case turnock v 
ragsdale was signed by govs madeline kunin of vermont james 
blanchard of michigan richard celeste of ohio steve cowper of 
alaska mario cuomo of new york michael dukakis of massachusetts 
booth gardner of washington neil goldschmidt of oregon john 
mckernan of maine and roy romer of colorado 
mckernan is a republican the other nine are democrats 
kunin told reporters after addressing the closing session of the 
20th annual conference of the national abortion rights action 
league on sunday the climate has dramatically changed in the 
past two weeks 
she cited the failure of abortion restrictions during a special 
session of the florida legislature last week and the house vote to 
expand medicaid eligibility for abortions to victims of rape and 
incest 
president bush said friday he is looking to see if there is 
room for flexibility to avoid a veto on the medicaid abortion 
funding 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine speaking sunday 
on cbs face the nation said a veto would be a tragic 
mistake on his part were talking here about the poorest most 
vulnerable american women those who have become pregnant after 
being victims of rape or incest and cant afford to pay for an 
abortion 
the governors brief dropped off at court offices saturday 
said 
it would be unprecedented for this court having recognized a 
fundamental constitutional right to withdraw that right and throw 
the abortion issue back into the political arena 
the governors expressed concern that the workable and 
restraining constitutional guidelines that have developed since roe 
v wade may yield to laws that discriminate unfairly against large 
segments of our population are easily evaded by persons with 
money or are so widely ignored that evenhanded enforcement becomes 
impossible 
they said they are also worried that respect for law is eroded 
by statutes such as the illinois one that purport to regulate 
health when their true purpose restricting abortions is 
apparent 
if the right to a first trimester abortion is abandoned they 
said womens ability to choose would be determined primarily by 
whether she fortuitously resides in or has the ability to travel 
to a state where abortions remain legal 
the supreme court has scheduled arguments dec 5 on the illinois 
statute which a federal judge and the 7th circuit court of appeals 
already have struck down 
however a new bid is being made in illinois to settle the case 
before it goes any further

the unconditional release of 
seven african national congress leaders is a resounding political 
victory for the guerrilla movement at a time its armed wing is 
relatively dormant 
the heros welcome given to the political prisoners six jailed 
for at least 25 years reflects the depth of support for the anc 
despite government repression throughout the movements 77yearold 
history 
the government outlawed the anc in 1960 and president fw de 
klerk remains adamant that the organization must renounce violence 
before it may participate in negotiations on a new constitution 
however the release of anc leaders and de klerks recent 
decision to allow peaceful mass protests virtually amounts to de 
facto validation of the banned anc said the sunday times the 
countrys largestcirculation newspaper 
at the very least the dedemonization of the anc has began 
the newspaper said in an editorial 
after their release the seven spoke to hundreds of supporters 
and journalists at a news conference it was the first time ranking 
anc leaders were permitted to engage in political activity in south 
africa since the organization was banned 
government officials have conferred with the ancs most 
prominent jailed leader nelson mandela whose release is widely 
expected in coming months there is speculation mandela wants the 
anc legalized as a political force before he leaves prison 
anc supporters long denied the chance to express their 
political sympathies now wave the green gold and black anc flag 
at marches an action that previously brought swift police action 
at a rally in durban last month the anc banner was raised at 
city hall and police allowed it to remain on the flagpole until the 
demonstration ended 
blackoriented newspapers now print articles favorable to the 
anc and run pictures of its imprisoned and exiled leaders in 
outright defiance of government censorship laws 
new nation one of the countrys most militant opposition 
newspapers on friday printed its entire front page in green gold 
and black and ran pictures of the seven former prisoners under the 
headline anc lives 
such developments seemed unthinkable as recently as a year ago 
de klerks predecessor as president pw botha and his 
security officials denounced the anc as a communistled terrorist 
group botha said the guerrilla movement would be barred from any 
negotiations on apartheid 
in recent months the anc appeared to be regrouping if not 
retreating 
anc president oliver tambo 71 suffered a stroke in august and 
remains hospitalized in london he has no clear successor and 
there has been speculation of a rift between anc hardliners who 
want more military action and political leaders who believe 
negotiations are on the horizon 
while the anc publicly calls for an escalation of its armed 
struggle there have been fewer attacks this year than any time 
since nationwide black unrest broke out in 1984 
since a stateofemergency was declared in june 1986 more than 
210 bombings have killed 37 people but this year about 40 have 
killed three 
this year the anc based in lusaka zambia had to close its 
military bases in angola under a regional peace treaty signed by 
south africa angola and cuba 
the organization wont say where its thousands of guerrillas 
were sent reportedly the fighters were moved to uganda and 
tanzania two countries with little daytoday contact with 
southern africa 
the south african government also has successfully eased its 
diplomatic isolation on the continent botha and de klerk met 
several black african leaders in the past year 
the ancs bid to increase economic sanctions on south africa has 
waned and few new punitive measures were imposed in the past two 
years 
the government can claim small victories but the ancs support 
particularly among the young is stronger than ever 
thousands of black youths fled south africa in 1976 amid 
nationwide black violence to join the anc and the organization says 
that since 1984 it has received about 100 new recruits monthly 
the organization has an estimated 15000 members in exile and 
millions of supporters inside south africa where blacks comprise 
28 million of the 37 million population 
most political analysts believe the anc would receive the most 
votes if free elections were held 
even relatively conservative black leaders say the anc must be 
legalized before serious negotiations on political change can take 
place

leftist guerrilla leaders and 
officials of president alfredo cristianis rightist government open 
negotiations today for a temporary ceasefire in el salvadors 
decadeold civil war 
spokesmen for the wo sides said the gulf between them was wide 
and they expect no early agreement but roman catholic church 
officials who had acted as mediators in earlier meetings said the 
of twoday round of talks are the most substantial so far and they 
are hopeful 
we consider this meeting very important it could be a 
significant step toward peaceand that is why we are helping the 
participants with our prayers archbishop arturo rivera damas 
the head of el salvadors catholic church told reporters sunday 
but costa rican foreign minister rodrigo madrigal who is 
playing host to the talks had a different opinion it would be a 
miracle if an agreement is reached in these negotiations 
at a preliminary meeting in mexico city last month both sides 
agreed to this weeks talks and to subsequently meet at 30day 
intervals until a peace accord is reached 
three meetings by the preceding administration of president jose 
napoleon duartes administration with guerrilla leaders from 1984 
to 1987 all ended in deadlock with the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front demanding to share power in a new 
government before laying down its weapons 
cristiani succeeded durate on june 1 for a fiveyear term his 
ultraconservative republican nationalist alliance had defeated 
duartes centrist christian democrats in national elections in 
which leftist groups refused to participate 
since then the rebels have softened their demands 
at the mexico meeting they offered for the first time to call a 
temporary ceasefire by nov 15 form a political party and run 
candidates in future elections if cristiani agrees to undertake 
wideranging social political and constitutional reforms and 
reduce military ranks 
cristiani who is demanding an immediate ceasefire while talks 
of reform continue said saturday that the rebels are expected to 
step up attacks in coming days in an effort to bolster their 
positions at the talks 
rebel spokesman cesar marti said sunday that the front will not 
agree to stop fighting unless terms including reforms are 
agreed upon first adding that the negotiations will be 
difficult 
the government wants us to lay down our weapons and negotiate 
afterwards but we want a temporary truce and progressively work 
towards a definite ceasefire with absolute guarantees there will 
be true democracy in our country he said 
according to human rights groups more than 70000 people have 
been killed in the civil war and the united states has been 
providing 1 million daily in military and economic aid to prop up 
a succession of salvadoran governments 
the talks were to be held at a church retreat in moravia a 
small town six miles northeast of san jose and monitored by church 
leaders and observers from the united nations and the organization 
of american states 
the talks are being held within the framework of peace accords 
cristiani and four other central american presidents signed in 
honduras in august to end the salvadoran war a ussupported 
contral rebel war in nicaragua and a longsimmering leftist 
insurgency in guatemala 
before the talks open marti said the ninemember rebel 
leadership would meet with president oscar arias of costa rica who 
won the 1987 nobel peace prize for authoring a regional peace plan

it underlined the tightrope pope john paul ii walked as he 
toured indonesia the worlds most populous moslem country for 
five days before reaching this indian ocean island 
the pope treaded softly when he touched on such controversial 
issues as human rights the roman catholic churchs position 
against contraception or pressures on catholics from moslem 
extremists 
but nothing provoked more debate than whether john paul kissed 
the ground of east timor the former portuguese colony invaded and 
annexed by indonesia in 1976 
john paul has kissed the ground each time he arrived in a new 
country on his 44 foreign tours 
indonesian authorities were relieved when he made no such move 
upon arriving in east timor they had posted billboards beside the 
airport tarmac welcoming him to indonesias 27th province 
although the vatican like the united nations doesnt 
officially recognize the indonesian claim on east timor john 
pauls hosts viewed his stop as bolstering their position 
but 90 minutes later when the pope arrived at a dusty seaside 
field to celebrate mass he knelt beneath the altar and kissed a 
crucifix resting on a pillow on the ground 
applause rang out from the crowd of 100000 people indicating 
people believed he had done the deed or had he 
a vatican official rushed to tell reporters that kissing the 
crucifix was merely a pastoral gesture done by every bishop 
when he enters a new diocese 
for kikus corner a frontpage column in the englishlangauge 
indonesia times the pope kissed the soil only once upon arriving 
in the indonesian capital of jakarta 
its thus a recognition of east timor as part of the 
indonesian country no doubt about it kiku told his readers 
the vatican insists that no obstacles were placed in the popes 
way during the trip and that he spoke with absolute freedom 
but he clearly made choices as he has on past trips when for 
example the price of visiting paraguay was a meeting with the 
former authoritarian ruler gen alfredo stroessner 
one such choice according to a vatican official was not to 
upset the delicate balance in indonesia which unites some 200 
ethnic and language groups 
for this reason the explanation goes john paul did not visit 
ancient buddhist and hindu temples in java near where he 
celebrated mass he also didnt step inside a model mosque when 
visiting a miniature reconstruction of indonesia in jakarta 
expert knowledge was required to decipher the codewords in his 
speeches the pope spoke of traditional practices and other 
contemporary social influences contrasting with church teaching 
on the family an apparent reference to polygamy and the 
governments active familyplanning program 
one thing john paul could not escape was the heat on his 10day 
pilgrimmage that took him from indian summer in seoul south korea 
to sweltering indonesia and mauritius 
the fairskinned pope born 69 years ago in the cool of poland 
reddened from standing hatless in open cars waving to the crowds 
temperatures were in the 90s 
the pope returned to rome today the eleventh anniversary of his 
election as pontiff

antinuclear activists say weekend protests 
that resulted in about 475 arrests show that their 13yearold 
fight against the stalled seabrook nuclear power plant remains 
spirited 
im thrilled with the way things have gone dianne dunfey of 
the antinuclear clamshell alliance said sunday as about 200 
protesters rallied at the statehouse they seabrook proponents 
thought wed go away a long time ago 
on saturday dunfey and the others scaled fences surrounding the 
seacoast plant and were arrested for trespassing 
today a small group of activists planned a sitin at gov judd 
greggs outer office until he meets with them to discuss seabrook 
the protests were part of a week of antiseabrook events 
scheduled to culminate with a rally near president bushs vacation 
home in kennebunkport maine 
seabrook was finished in 1986 and conducted lowpower atomic 
tests this summer but the 62 billion reactor still lacks a 
commercial license because of challenges to evacuation plans for 
nearby beaches and communities in new hampshire and massachusetts 
antiseabrook demonstrations since 1976 have resulted in more 
than 3600 arrests and made the plant a symbol of the nations 
antinuclear movement 
the fight is far from over and in many ways the fight has 
just started said massachusetts state sen nicholas costello 
one of sundays speakers 
but the police chief in the town of seabrook paul cronin said 
he is considering a new weapon against clamshell organizers the 
federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
last week the us supreme court upheld a decision in which an 
abortion clinic used rico to win damages from an antiabortion 
group in philadelphia cronin said he wants to determine whether he 
can use the law against clamshell leaders 
the chief said seabrook opponents have a right to climb over the 
plants fences to be arrested but not to incite others to follow 
them 
they rouse up those people and brought them to the town with 
the express idea of breaking the law cronin said 
roy morrison one of four clamshell leaders identified as 
targets for possible harsher treatment countered the 
authorities are willing to destroy the basic fabric that protects 
freedom in this country freedom of citizens to speak associate 
and take action

with a boost from president bush 
republican tom anderson is racing to make up ground in tuesdays 
special election that could cost the gop its last us house seat 
in mississippi 
based on returns in the primary election and recent polls 
democratic state sen gene taylor is the frontrunner to take the 
5th district seat republicans have held 16 years 
anderson 43 is an aide to sen trent lott rmiss a national 
spokesman on conservative issues who formerly held the south 
mississippi house seat now being contested 
anderson acknowledges hes chasing taylor 
it has been a long campaign in a very short period of time 
weve got a long way to go and i am the underdog but we can do 
it anderson said at a rally last week 
taylor 36 who represents bay st louis in the legislature 
captured 42 percent in oct 3s open primary while anderson 
finished second with 37 percent 
the seat become vacant when freshman republican rep larkin 
smith a popular former sheriff died in an aug 13 plane crash 
smith won the office in 1988 beating taylor 
the national parties view the campaign as a key battleground 
less than a year before the 1990 congressional elections 
bush visited last week at lotts urging and appeared at a rally 
for anderson 
part of the legacy of larkin smith is making sure that his 
successor carries on the work you sent him to do in washington i 
know tom anderson is the right man bush said 
tommy took on two democrats who ganged up on him at every 
turn and tried to smear his good name said rep guy vander 
jagt rmich chairman of the national republican congressional 
committee but tom remained on the high road and continued to run 
on the issues and he was rewarded for that by the intelligent 
voters of mississippis 5th district 
the candidates differ little on issues 
anderson has tried to pin the liberal label on taylor who 
contends his voting record in the mississippi senate is 
conservative 
im a conservative southern democrat taylor has said 
the district which includes gulfport and biloxi on the thriving 
coast has a history of voting republican it twice rejected 
southerner jimmy carter and went 87 percent for richard nixon in 
1972 the highest percentage he won in any congressional district 
in 1972 lott then a top aide to us rep bill colmer was 
elected to congress from the district lott who was minority whip 
gave up the seat to win the senate post of the retiring democrat 
john c stennis in 1988 
anderson has been lotts chief of staff since 1972 except for 
two years as he spent as ambassador to barbados during the reagan 
administration 
anderson has spent more than 500000 bolstering his name 
recognition after living in washington for 17 years taylor has 
spent more than 100000 
anderson also has had to deal with the appearance of being 
lotts handpicked candidate 
lott rallied republicans around anderson after clearing the 
field of other republicans including sheila smith wife of the 
late congressman 
the democratic congressional campaign committee has filed two 
ethics complaints against anderson for allegedly failing to list 
all flights he took while a lott aide on the jet of a mississippi 
corporation and for alleged discrepancies between financial 
disclosure statements filed with the senate and house 
anderson and the republicans have labeled the complaints as 
smear tactics but democrats contend the issues are real 
mississippi has a long history of sending members to congress 
who are beyond reproach when it comes to integrity and honesty 
said rep beryl anthony dark chairman of his partys 
congressional campaign committee tom anderson is a walking 
ethics scandal the voters of the 5th district cant possibly 
approve of these actions by mr anderson 
if taylor wins the election the democrats would have all five 
mississippi seats in the us house for the first time since 1972

investigators seeking the cause of a flash 
fire that gutted a parked delta air lines jetliner said they are 
focusing on an area in the belly of the boeing 727 that houses 
computer gear 
a team of federal inspectors arrived sunday to join the 
investigation of the blaze which burned a 4by15foot hole in the 
side of the plane as it sat at a salt lake international airport 
boarding gate 
saturdays fire forced the nine passengers and six crew members 
aboard to evacuate five crew members and one passenger were 
treated for smoke inhalation 
the investigation assisted by representatives of delta and 
boeing co should take three or four days said bob johnson 
regional director for the national transportation safety board in 
denver 
the fire broke out 20 minutes before flight 1558 was to leave 
for edmonton alberta the flight which began in los angles had a 
onehour layover in salt lake city and most passengers were in the 
terminal 
those aboard reported hearing a loud pop before smoke began 
billowing from a vent in the firstclass section 
early indications are the fire broke out in a spot below and 
behind the cockpit where the planes computer and avionics nerve 
center are housed said johnson and delta spokesman fred rollins 
we are focusing on that area rollins said but its 
really too early to speculate on the cause 
investigators have determined that the fire didnt begin in the 
baggage area faa officials initially sealed the plane and kept the 
baggage from being returned to the passengers but rollins said the 
luggage was released later 
firefighters extinguished the flames within 15 minutes 
authorities said 
delta has yet to determine if the 30 million airliner can be 
flown again said rollins who was unable to provide a damage 
estimate 
the fire heavily damaged the aircrafts interior and melted 
portions of the metal skin

panamanian soldiers tried to overthrow gen manuel 
antonio noriega because of his constant drinking and corruption 
which left troops so poor they had to mend their own boots the 
wife of the slain coup leader says 
adela bonilla de giroldi who was the first person to make 
contact between the conspirators and us officials described the 
mood among the rebels before the oct 3 revolt led by her husband 
maj moises giroldi 
my husband was once stationed in nicaragua and he always said 
to me it cant continue this way we are on the same road as 
nicaragua under somoza the officers are corrupt and we will end up 
the same as somoza the 36yearold mrs giroldi said of the 
late anastasio somoza 
she fled to miami with her three children her brother and her 
parents after the failed coup 
giroldi was named to the top security post at noriegas central 
headquarters after he helped put down a coup in march 1988 but 
while noriega grew wealthy giroldi and other loyal military 
officers saw their countrymen and their troops situation 
deteriorate his wife said in an interview last week 
the people were hungry the soldiers were hungry she said 
there were units where they dont even have enough money to take 
a bus home if their boots have holes they must repair them 
themselves 
in addition she said noriega drank to excess and behaved 
erratically 
general noriega spends all day drinking 24 hours a day 
drinking so he can make decisions she said 
she said he fires ministers and banishes officers based on what 
his inner circle tells him while he is drunk 
on sept 29 giroldi told his wife he planned to lead fellow 
officers in a coup arrest noriega and turn him over to the us 
military they never planned to kill him she said 
then on oct 1 she said he asked her to get in touch with us 
officials because it was too risky for him and the other officers 
a friend who worked with the us military arranged a meeting 
between mrs giroldi and a us colonel 
she told the colonel the rebels needed the united states to send 
flights over panamanian air bases to keep noriega loyalists on the 
ground they also wanted us roadblocks around noriegas downtown 
headquarters 
the colonel called in two americans in street clothes who later 
met with her husband giroldi said he was elated with the us 
response 
on oct 2 her husband reported to headquarters she visited him 
in the barracks that night she would never see him again 
the next morning she took her family to fort clayton a us 
base outside panama city but because the coup plans were secret 
the officer on duty wouldnt let her in at first she said 
i didnt know whether to trust him or not it was a very 
difficult situation mrs giroldi said she was quite literally 
saved by the bell 
the alarm went off and they were yelling alert to everyone 
in fort clayton she recalled he asked why i was there and i 
answered for the alert 
later soldiers who survived the coup including capt javier 
licona the highestranking plotter to escape helped her piece 
together what happened 
at first it went according to plan she said noriega was 
captured and tried to negotiate with giroldi but her husband 
refused she said 
then she said they realized a fellow conspirator maj 
federico oleochea head of the strongest local unit battalion 
2000 had betrayed them and was surrounding the barracks 
if major oleochea had not turned on us all would have been 
well all would have been as planned she said but he is the 
type who always bets on the winner 
licona tried to call in american help using an emergency number 
given giroldi at the meeting but the officials doubted liconas 
identity she said licona had to leave the headquarters and go to 
fort clayton to convince them 
there was a lot of trouble trying to identify him she said 
confirming this confirming that when they finally said they 
were going to act it was very late that was the failure 
giroldi and his fellow conspirators apparently surrendered some 
panamanians said giroldi was shot personally by noriega but a 
soldier who survived told her all of the prisoners including her 
husband were lined up and mowed down with a machine gun

antiapartheid leader walter sisulu 
resuming the struggle on his first day of freedom in 26 years told 
an emotional crowd hes confident hell see the day a black man can 
become president 
the government freed sisulu and seven other aging antiapartheid 
leaders at dawn sunday and the seven who belong to the african 
national congress held the guerrilla movements first news 
conference in south africa since it was banned in 1960 
our determination has never been weakened by our long years of 
imprisonment said sisulu a former anc secretary general and the 
countrys bestknown black leader after the stillimprisoned nelson 
mandela 
some among the hundreds of anc supporters packing the church 
hall where the news conference was held wept as the freed 
prisoners raising clenched fists led them in singing god bless 
africa the anthem of the antiapartheid movement 
sisulu said the seven aged 60 to 80 were confident they would 
live to see a government that includes blacks a democratic 
method where a black man can become president or a white man can 
become president 
today newspapers across the political spectrum said the release 
had ushered in a new era that will be full of dramatic change and 
uncertainty 
the country enters a new phase in its history the 
progovernment citizen said in an editorial but it is not going 
to be an easy transition and nobody knows what kind of new 
country will emerge 
the sowetan the countrys largest blackoriented daily 
cautioned that the freed black leaders face a daunting task that 
of uniting the democratic forces in this country and transforming 
it into a nonracial democracy 
business day the countrys leading financial daily concurred 
this is only the start of a long and complex process wrote 
editor ken owen what is said by sisulu and his colleagues this 
week will be as important for creating a negotiating climate as 
president fw de klerks bold move in ordering their freedom 
de klerk announced the unconditional release of the eight 
tuesday as part of his attempt to improve conditions for 
negotiating a new constitution that will extend political rights to 
blacks 
but he envisions some arrangement under which whites would 
retain veto power over major decisions under apartheid the black 
majority has no voice in national affairs 
the releases are viewed as tacit acknowledgement by the 
government of the ancs influence and popularity 
sisulu 77 told the news conference that he had felt pressure 
building for his release and that sooner or later they would have 
to give in it was not possible to despair because the spirit of 
the people outside was too great 
even relatively conservative black leaders have said they will 
reject any negotiations with the government unless the anc is 
legalized and its jailed leaders freed 
sisulu and his colleagues said the anc the largest group 
fighting the whiteled government will continue its military 
campaign and reject negotiations until the government legalizes it 
lifts the 3yearold state of emergency and releases all political 
prisoners 
if the government doesnt meet our demands we have no 
alternative but to continue to fight for our freedom said andrew 
mlangeni 63 
the exprisoners seated in front of a large green gold and 
black anc flag at the news conference also said they would press 
for mandelas release 
there can be no real joy about our release when we think of 
the comrades we left behind sisulu said 
mandela 71 is widely expected to be released in the next few 
months but there is speculation he does not want to go free until 
the government takes further steps to legalize anc political 
activity 
five of the anc men including sisulu and mlangeni were 
arrested in 1963 and sentenced to life prison terms in 1964 along 
with mandela for plotting antigovernment sabotage 
the others freed sunday were elias mostsoaledi 65 ahmed 
kathrada 60 raymond mhlaba 68 wilton mkwayi 67 and oscar 
mpetha 80 who had been hospitalized in cape town and was the 
nations oldest political prisoner 
the eighth man is 58yearold jafta masemola of the outlawed pan 
africanist congress a smaller guerrilla group he was convicted of 
sabotage in 1963 
all except mpetha had served at least 25 years 
the anc seven spoke directly to their supporters after the news 
conference we are not the heroes you are the heroes said 
kathrada 
at least 10000 greeted kathrada an indian later sunday night 
when he arrived in the lenasia the main indian township outside 
johannesburg 
the anc leaders said they would seek passports to travel to the 
ancs exile headquarters in lusaka zambia to consult with their 
colleagues

japanese investors message to wall street today 
was its up to you now we held on 
instead of unloading their shares in panic as they did two years 
ago after wall street crashed most japanese market players were in 
a holding pattern 
they watched anxiously today as the tokyo stock exchange posted 
a sharp but not disastrous loss in thin trading 
i did not sell much but its tough to buy shares on a day 
like today said hiroshi yamamoto a private investor watching 
price displays before the ginza branch of nikko securities co in 
central tokyo 
depending on how new york will do todays drop may turn out 
to be just timely relief for the tokyo market or an omen of 
another crash he said 
dealers and traders tried to build confidence and show they 
learned from the 1987 crash while investors remained calm compared 
with two years ago 
i dont think there were many investors who sold their 
holdings in panic said keiichi nishida a dealer with kidder 
peabody securities in tokyo it was nothing like two years ago 
when investors rushed to the brokerages to unload their holdings 
so many investors only lost money two years ago when they sold 
their shares quickly after black monday in new york and these 
shares quickly won back their loses nishida said they have 
learned lessons from that experience 
a day after black monday when the dow jones industrial average 
plunged 23 percent the nikkei average lost about 15 percent but 
the barometer gained back most losses in the next two days 
the nikko securities retail brokerage office was somewhat busier 
than usual today scores of phone calls poured in from investors 
anxious to find out where their holdings stood 
i am telling you that its not time to sell yet its not too 
late if we wait until tomorrow and see how new york will do a 
broker was overheard saying on the phone 
some investors said they were waiting for bargains rather than 
to unload their shares 
i expect the nikkei index to remain bearish all day but i am 
not so worried because we all know it is due to external factors 
said an investor watching the key index at nomura securities 
shortly after the market opened 
i am going to sit and wait for a while and start buying shares 
later on as they start hitting the bottom he said 
a dealer at nikko securities said japanese private investors 
seemed to have learned the lesson that fluctuation of the wall 
street index is only one of many aspects of the tokyo market it is 
undoubtedly an important element but not necessarily as dominant 
as it was thought to be 
nishida said many investors remained hesitant to place purchase 
orders today because they want to make sure that the new york 
plunge was only a onetime thing and the dow jones will not go 
down further there 
some investors said there was no reason why the tokyo market 
should suffer because of new york 
if tokyo plunges after new york the whole world is in 
trouble said motoko goto a veteran private investor 
i think the dow jones average fell in new york because it was 
friday the 13th she said it may have a negative implication 
in the christian world but there is no reason it should depress 
the stock market in japan

us officials today lodged a formal protest with 
soviet authorities after two soviet officers were allegedly caught 
trying to obtain classified military documents from a us air 
force airman in west berlin 
anthony sariti a spokesman for the us diplomatic mission in 
west berlin said the protest was filed after two soviet majors 
were apprehended while engaging in espionage activities 
sariti said sunday night that the us air force airman whose 
name was not released was caught in the act of passing classified 
information to the soviets 
but he said today that he had been mistaken that the airman had 
not been caught in the act sariti said he had erred sunday night 
because he did not at that time have with him the official news 
release prepared in the case 
sariti said today that the soviets were detained after asking 
the airman to hand over documents on saturday night he said the 
airman was cooperating with authorities 
sariti would not say how serious the case was 
both soviet officers were questioned and then returned to the 
soviet sector sariti said in reference to east berlin 
he refused to say where the meeting had taken place and declined 
to provide further details 
he said returning the soviets to east berlin after questioning 
was normal procedure 
sariti said agreements with the soviets regarding the divided 
city provide that military forces from one side cannot be 
arrested by the forces on the other side 
he said us officials lodged a verbal protest with the soviets 
on saturday night sariti said the soviets had not responded to the 
protests as of late this morning

if it was my daughter she wouldnt be going city 
councilwoman virginia paulson said after 11yearold sarah york 
left last week for her second trip to panama 
on wednesday sarah and her father turned up beside noriega as 
panamas military leader lauded her as a meritorious daughter 
of panama city and an example of the truth of the united states 
purity not hatred 
after her meeting with noriega she repeated her support for the 
general she said hes very nice and she doesnt believe the 
bad things newspapers in the united states say about him 
in the united states that day us leaders were talking about 
ways to oust noriega 
rep bob davis rmich said sarahs visits to noriega put the 
united states in an awkward position 
to have one of our little citizens go down there and be 
treated well is kind of an embarrassment for our government 
davis said it sends the wrong message that we or some people in 
this country say noriega is an allright guy 
the schoolgirl and her father mitchell a prison guard left 
for panama on oct 8 and planned to return tuesday to this northern 
mining town of about 5000 people the trip which the yorks say is 
safe despite a state department travel warning was delayed by the 
oct 3 coup attempt 
the girl visited noriega last october 
she sent her first letter to noriega following his us 
indictment on drug trafficking charges 
her mother pauline who accompanied her on the first visit but 
stayed behind this time refuses to discuss the second trip 
mayor jack morris said residents never had given much thought to 
panama 
it was nice to have somebody go to another country he said 
but he rejected mrs yorks request that negaunee find a sister 
city in panama 
it just wouldnt be proper morris said 
after her first trip sarah set up school exhibits and helped 
classmates become pen pals with children in panama negaunee 
schools superintendent don mourand said very few parents complained 
i believe parental choice is certainly come to force here 
mourand said the parents of sarah have decided to allow her to 
be exposed to many things the average child is not exposed to 
unfortunately shes being characterized by many people as being 
naive as being nonamerican 
she just has a natural curiosity about other people mourand 
said

libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
arrived in this seaside resort today for talks with president hosni 
mubarak a milestone in ending one of the arab worlds bitterest 
feuds 
the leaders were to discuss regional affairs and resuming 
diplomatic relations egyptian sources said on condition of 
anonymity 
talks will concentrate on bilateral relations and how to 
develop them one source said 
gadhafi traveled the 150 miles from the frontier between the 
north african neighbors to this historic town in a motorcade 
mubarak flew from cairo to mersa matruh welcoming ceremonies with 
an honor guard and presentation of flowers were performed at the 
airport 
mubarak and gadhafi were to spend the night in mersa matrouh a 
popular mediterranean resort 300 miles northwest of cairo then 
travel to the libyan border town of tobruk for more talks on 
tuesday sources in cairo said 
the visit is gadhafis first to egypt in 16 years but his 
second meeting with mubarak this year 
gadhafi led arab opposition to egypts 1979 peace treaty with 
israel and was considered an archenemy until may when he and 
mubarak met at an arab summit in morocco 
after the reconciliation the two countries opened their 
borders closed for 12 years and land and air travel between the 
nations resumed 
each countrys media toned down persistent carping about the 
other the official libyan agency stopped using the phrase 
oppressed egyptian capital for cairo 
unlike most visits to egypt by arab leaders when host cities 
are decked with banners and posters no such signs of welcome were 
in evidence in mersa matruh there was however a notable increase 
in security on city streets 
of the 17 arab countries that broke relations with egypt after 
mubaraks predecessor anwar sadat made peace with israel only 
libya and syria have not resumed diplomatic ties 
gadhafi last visited egypt in november 1973 when he joined sadat 
in a special parliament session honoring top egyptian military 
officers for their performance in the 1973 arabisraeli war 
but relations had already begun to sour a year earlier when 
sadat refused overtures by gadhafi to merge the two countries 
gadhafi threatened to lead libyan civilians on a march across the 
border to enforce the merger 
relations further deteriorated in 1974 after sadats 
rapprochement with the united states and his preliminary steps 
toward peace with israel a move in which egypt still stands alone 
among the arabs 
egypt blamed libya for several bombings in cairo and other 
cities in 1975 to 1976 and the two fought a fiveday border war in 
july 1977 the border was sealed after that and remained closed 
until after the may summit in casablanca

share prices plummeted in heavy but orderly 
trading on londons stock market today in response to wall streets 
plunge on friday then recovered slightly as bargain hunters 
stepped in 
shares fell sharply on other european exchanges then 
stabilized in amsterdam a limit was imposed on price declines 
and in milan and paris trading in some shares was suspended 
because of insufficient buying orders 
in brussels an unusually heavy volume and order imbalance 
delayed the start of computerassisted trading by an hour 
the london market europes largest was less panicky than 
during the october 1987 crash and the stock exchange said the 
trading system was holding up well 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was down 
1424 points or 64 percent at 20915 two hours after it opened 
and volume was a heavy 3874 million shares 
the index had opened 1571 points down 68 percent in trading 
before londons exchange officially opened the index was estimated 
down 200 points or 9 percent 
dealers are allowed to trade stocks outside exchange hours and 
it was during the preopening trading that bargain hunters entered 
the market and triggered the partial recovery 
there isnt the same panic as there was during the 1987 
crash said bob wade joint head of market making at robert 
fleming and co so the pressure on the dealing machinery hasnt 
been so intense 
charles larkum an equity analyst at the london investment firm 
james capel and co said the market is looking for a level 
which it is comfortable holding 
the dollar also sank and then partially recovered in european 
trading it was quoted at 15785 to the pound at midmorning 
compared with 15625 late friday the dollar cost 18561 west 
german marks and 14099 japanese yen down from 19025 marks and 
144 yen late friday 
market makers who are required to make continuous prices 
available in certain stocks were quoting prices on the exchanges 
screenbased trading system normally the exchange said 
on friday wall street slumped after the london market closed 
for the weekend and initially london investors were not reassured 
by a relatively calm response in tokyo earlier today 
in tokyo where trading ends before london dealings begin the 
nikkei stock average fell 64733 points or 18 percent to close 
at 3446869 today 
the securities association which governs the london stock 
exchange met early today to assess asias response some 
stockbrokers stayed in central london hotels overnight to get an 
early start in trading 
stock exchange chairman andrew hugh smith said before trading 
began i certainly do not think there is any reason to panic 
london market makers moved prices sharply lower in an effort to 
protect themselves from any flood of sell orders dealers said 
its havoc at the moment but we expect the market to stabilize 
at lower levels ahead of the new york opening later monday said 
richard dingwallsmith an economist at the london investment firm 
county natwest woodmac securities 
analysts said the london market was concerned that a fresh burst 
of computerdriven selling on new york later today could drag the 
market sharply lower 
the plunge of 190 points in wall streets dow jones industrial 
average friday occurred two years after a 108point dow drop 
presaged the oct 19 1987 black monday crash of a record 508 
points 
the bank of england said saturday it saw no reason for such an 
exaggerated fall in london share values 
it said it regarded the new york price fall as a special case 
sparked off by the collapse of the highrisk junk bond market 
which does not exist on anything like the same scale in london 
michael hughes an economist with barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
said on bbctv that the apparent determination of governments to 
prevent a 1987style crash gives underlying support for the 
market so i wouldnt get overexcited about the danger of a full 
crash 
the us federal reserve was reported ready to move large 
amounts of cash into the american banking system if money was 
needed to prevent a financial crisis an option would be to lower 
interest rates 
but that was not seen as a choice for britain because of its 
76 percent inflation rate chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson last week raised base lending rates to an eightyear high of 
15 percent to control inflation

thousands demonstrated their support of abortion rights in new 
jersey and in california where the state attorney general 
announced he would sponsor a ballot initiative to protect a womans 
right to have an abortion 
in trenton nj several thousand prochoice demonstrators 
chanted waved banners and marched on the statehouse on sunday to 
urge lawmakers not to change laws that allow abortion 
the battle over abortion has heated up nationwide since the us 
supreme court issued a ruling in july broadening states rights to 
restrict abortion and the issue figures in the new jersey 
governors race 
eleanor smeal former president of the national organization for 
women urged the demonstrators in trenton to use the election to 
send a message to the rest of the country 
its a political fight its a medical fight and its a public 
health fight ms smeal said 
democratic gubernatorial candidate james florio opposes any new 
restrictions on abortion james courter the gop candidate has a 
long antiabortion voting record but in recent weeks has said he 
wouldnt impose his personal views on new jersey women 
state police estimated the crowd at 6500 organizers claimed 
10000 
in san francisco a crowd estimated by police at 30000 marched 
down market street on sunday carrying signs and chanting their 
support for abortion rights 
california attorney general john van de kamp sporting a 
choice button told the crowd he would sponsor a ballot 
initiative to protect abortion rights 
as in new jersey the issue is becoming a matter of 
gubernatorial politics 
the ballot measure proposed by van de kamp one of three 
democratic hopefuls in the 1990 governors race if the measure 
attracts enough signatures it will appear on the ballot in november 
1990 
the measure is designed to negate a provision of a crime 
initiative that will appear on the ballot in june that is sponsored 
by sen pete wilson the expected republican candidate for 
governor and local prosecutors 
the wilsonbacked measure would repeal a wide range of state 
constitutional rights in criminal cases including the right to 
privacy 
van de kamp backed by several constitutional scholars and major 
abortionrights groups contends the initiative could lead to 
criminal prosecution for some abortions that is because abortion 
rights in california are based on the state constitutional right of 
privacy

rescue divers watched helplessly from the 
oceans surface as a 12foot shark fed on the body of a scuba diver 
who had failed to return from an outing the night before 
acting fire department capt aaron young said he ordered his men 
out of the water sunday when he determined there was no safe way to 
reach the body while the shark continued feeding 
i decided it was not worth the risk to put fire personnel into 
the water in a situation that involved a recovery and not a 
rescue young said 
there is no way we could find out if he got into trouble and 
he died or if he initially was attacked by sharks he said 
young said the divers later recovered a small part of the mans 
body and his dive equipment the 33yearold mans name was not 
immediately disclosed pending notification of his family 
he had gone diving with three companions saturday evening but 
failed to return to shore officials said a search saturday night 
was suspended and resumed about 9 am sunday young said 
about an hour after the body was located lifeguards on shore 
spotted a large school of tiger sharks some as big as 15 feet in 
the area and warned people to stay out of the water said capt 
joseph mills of the citys water safety office 
the body was located in 15 feet of water about 400 yards 
offshore of kahe point about 30 miles from honolulu the area is 
known for shark sightings young said

air force investigators studied the 
wreckage of an f16 fighter jet today to determine what caused it 
to turn upside down and slam into the ground killing the two men 
aboard 
the jet which had been on a training mission went down sunday 
morning at carswell air force base said a base spokesman 
the fighter crashed just 200 feet from bomber row a section 
of the airfields taxiway where about 10 b52s were parked three 
of them were slightly damaged 
the victims were identified as the pilot reserve maj robert m 
tucker 37 of roanoke texas and marine corps capt james t 
bourne 33 of dallas officials said 
the crash site was restricted because of fuel that had spilled 
and because of unspent ammunition that was aboard the aircraft 
said 1st lt stephen norton a base spokesman 
officials said the jet was making a simulated attack run on the 
base when the crash occurred witnesses said the fighter was 200 to 
300 feet high when it listed to its right turned upside down and 
slammed into the ground 
the jet was assigned to the 944th tactical fighter group air 
force reserve stationed at luke air force base near phoenix said 
luke afb spokesman capt joe davis 
the 20 million aircraft was en route from dallas naval air 
station to carswell on a training mission when it crashed norton 
said 
col john sams jr the base commander said it could take eight 
to 12 months to determine the cause of the crash 
sundays fatal crash followed by two days the crash of an air 
force rf4c jet that went down in a pasture near bangs texas 
killing one of its two crewman the rf4c was stationed at 
bergstrom air force base in austin about 150 miles from bangs in

fan blade fragments probably severed the 
hydraulic controls of a dc10 this summer crippling the aircraft 
and causing it to plunge to the ground in a fiery crash officials 
said 
general electric co flight saftey investigator jerry clark 
speculated about the cause of the crash sunday night after more 
than 100 volunteers swept farm fields in northwestern iowa looking 
for the missing parts from the no 2 engine of united flight 232 
the july 19 crash at the sioux gateway airport 60 miles from 
here killed 112 of the 296 people aboard 
it is much more likely that the hydraulic lines were hit by 
fan belt blade fragments than fan disc fragments clark said in a 
telephone interview 
federal investigators are not sure whether the fan disk that has 
already been recovered will solve the mystery 
we wont know that until we analyze it but we want to recover 
everything that is out there said ted lopatkiewicz a spokesman 
for the national transportation safety board 
searchers on sunday found a sheared off bolt buried 3 inches in 
the ground of a field near alta on saturday searchers found a 
part of a fan blade sticking out of the ground in a nearby field 
the search was financed by ge which made the planes engine in 
1972 
altaarea farmer janice sorenson earned a 119000 reward for 
finding about twothirds of the rear engine fan disc while 
harvesting corn on her farm last tuesday the remainder of the disk 
was found thursday on the nearby farm of harold halverson who will 
collect about 40000 
ge paid 1000 each for the bolt and fan blade fragment 
discovered this weekend an equal payment of 1000 was made to the 
metal detector clubs that found the parts and the owners of the 
land nick droegmiller and dale sorenson 
the important thing is to try to get as much of the rotating 
parts of the engine back to cincinnati where ge makes engines so 
we can understand the complete failure sequence said clark 
the engine broke apart north of alta cutting parts of hydraulic 
lines that controlled the flight of the jumbo jet pilots were able 
to guide the craft erratically to sioux city but the plane crashed 
in flames on landing

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the drunkendriving conviction of a pennsylvania man 
who was videotaped answering police questions about his height 
weight and color of his eyes 
the court said it will decide whether police violated the 
motorists rights when they videotaped his responses before warning 
him of his right to remain silent or have a lawyer present 
inocencio muniz first was questioned by upper allen township 
patrolman david spotts who noticed munizs car stopped by the side 
of the road nov 30 1986 with the engine running 
the patrolman said he smelled alcohol on munizs breath and 
noticed that his eyes were glazed and bloodshot spotts said he 
told muniz not to drive until he was in a condition to operate the 
car safely but muniz drove off as the officer returned to his 
patrol car 
spotts pursued muniz ordered him to stop and told him to 
perform some sobriety tests which he failed the officer said he 
then took muniz to a police station where the motorist was 
videotaped answering questions about his height weight eye color 
and other personal characteristics 
only after those responses was muniz given socalled miranda 
warnings about his rights 
muniz convicted previously of drunken driving was convicted 
again and sentenced to a prison term of 45 days to 23 months 
a pennsylvania appeals court threw out the conviction last year 
it said any testimonial or communicative statements elicited 
from muniz following his arrest and before he received his miranda 
warnings should have been suppressed for trial purposes unless he 
effectuated a voluntary knowing and intelligent waiver of his 
rights 
the statistical questions muniz was asked were designed to 
reveal his thought processes and munizs confusion and failure 
to speak clearly indicated a state of drunkenness the state 
court said 
the case is pennsylvania vs muniz 89213

regional communist party chiefs are demanding dramatic changes in 
leadership as well as an easing of the nations hardline policies 
bild said the demand for honeckers ouster and the reshuffling 
of the polituro comes because they the regional communist

candidates

tense said harry tisch a member of the ruling politburo who 
oversees the nations nearly 86 million workers

business inventories rose 03 percent in 
august but business sales gained a hefty 31 percent the 
government reported today 
the combination of sales advancing far faster than the 
accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots normally is good news 
for the economy if inventories were to pile up excessively it 
could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs 
the commerce department said inventories climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 7899 billion in august following a gain of 09 percent 
in july 
business sales meanwhile rose to a seasonally adjusted 5268 
billion after dropping 09 percent in july 
the august business activity produced a decrease in the ratio of 
inventories to sales it was 150 meaning it would take one and 
onehalf months to exhaust inventories at the august pace the 
ratio stood at 154 in july 
the business picture could have continued to improve last month 
the commerce department reported last week that september retail 
sales were up a moderate 05 percent after a 07 percent gain in 
august 
manufacturers inventories which represent about 45 percent of 
the total rose 03 percent while retailers backlogs increased 07 
percent wholesalers registered a 01 drop 
overall inventories were 71 percent above those of a year ago 
manufacturers sales on the other hand rose 56 percent 
retailers sales were up 07 percent and wholesalers 15 percent 
total sales were up 71 percent from august 1988

the first of more than 1300 east german 
refugees here renounced their citizenship today and received 
special permits allowing them to join thousands of their countrymen 
who have fled to the west 
we are free read a handlettered banner unfurled as the 
cheering refugees emerged from the east german embassy 
even as preparations were made for the departures several dozen 
more refugees arrived today seeking help at the west german 
embassy diplomatic sources said 200 to 300 new refugees were taken 
in over the weekend 
the first group of a dozen refugees mainly mothers and 
children arrived for processing at the east german embassy from a 
holiday camp outside warsaw 
they first signed a form labeled request for release from 
citzenship of the german democratic republic then they were 
given a new identity card allowing them to leave the country and 
were taken to the west german compound 
checks also were made for any criminal background east german 
ambassador juergen van zwoll said 
the east germans will be allowed to go to the country of their 
choice without crossing their communist homeland said falko 
schreiber press attache of the east german embassy the 
arrangement was announced saturday 
a west german official said it was possible some refugees could 
leave as early as this afternoon but that was unlikely because 
transport arrangements had not been completed 
the west german government which will pay to get the refugees 
to the west contacted lot polish airlines to discuss possible 
arrangements but no flights were confirmed said jacek jaworksi of 
the lot charter department 
the west german embassy here is having difficulty finding room 
for the increasing number of refugees its staff taxed by two 
months of handling the refugees is being augmented by officials 
flown in from bonn to help with the complex housing and 
transportation arrangements and the issuing of new citizenship 
papers 
a west german diplomat overseeing the refugee situation said a 
better solution must be found 
at this rate this thing could take a half a year with more of 
them coming in he said 
there was no indication of any time limit to the exit permits 
agreed to by communist east berlin which has been shaken in recent 
months by the exodus of thousands of its citizens and widespread 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
the action will last as long it is necessary schreiber said 
polish foreign ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski said the 
agreement has no term and poland may be a transit point for 
more refugees for some time to come 
it looks that we may have to deal with it for a long period of 
time he said it will all depend on the situation in east 
germany 
the exodus grew elsewhere over the weekend as more than 3800 
east germans escaped west through hungary 
more than 52000 east germans have flooded into west germany 
since sept 10 from hungary czechoslovakia and poland some 70000 
more have been allowed to emigrate legally so far this year or 
have refused to return to their homeland

from the april 22 1974 crash in indonesia of a pan am plane 
flying from hong kong to los angeles all 96 passengers and 11 crew 
members died in the accident 
lawyers for pan am say the airlines liability should not have 
exceeded 75000 per victim 
numerous lawsuits were filed after the crash and all but three 
cases were settled the unsettled suits centered on the deaths of 
john and virginia causey of west point va and john w ryder 
identified in court documents as a citizen of australia 
treaties set the 75000perpassenger liability limit for 
deaths in international flight crashes but the causey and ryder 
families contended that the limit should not apply because pan am 
had been guilty of willful misconduct 
a federal jury in california concluded that the airline had 
committed willful misconduct by entrusting the flight to an 
incompetent pilot 
the causey family was awarded 300000 in damages the ryder 
family 651500 
the awards were upheld by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
last march 27 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for pan am said a special

investigation of the pan am crash in indonesia and earlier 
accidents wrongly was admitted as trial evidence

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a righttowork group that sought to limit the power of unions to 
collect dues from nonmembers 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments in an 
illinois case that the group was treated unfairly by a federal 
appeals court 
the justices also turned down a related appeal by the heirs to a 
nonunion worker who had opposed the way his dues were spent 
the national right to work legal defense and education 
foundation of springfield va said it was unfairly maligned in a 
january ruling by the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court in that decision ruled against nine nonunion 
employees of illinois state and local agencies 
the workers had sued the american federation of state county 
and municipal employees afsme accusing the union of using 
nonmembers dues to promote political and ideological causes 
the 7th circuit court upheld a federal judges decision that 
noted the union had agreed to refund any improper overcharges 
what sparked the main appeal acted on today were references by 
the 7th circuit court to the role of the national right to work 
foundation 
for example the appeals court said the foundation was trying 
to hamstring the union 
the foundation said it was not involved in the illinois workers 
suit and sought vindication from the supreme court 
afsme in urging the justices to reject the appeal said a 
foundation lawyer did represent the illinois workers and that the 
appeals court references to the group were proper 
in the companion appeal heirs to the late jack gilpin one of 
the nonunion workers asked the high court to throw out the 7th 
circuit court ruling 
the cases are national right to work foundation vs afsme 
89287 and gilpin vs afscme 89292

nancy reagan says she began consulting an 
astrologer during her husbands years in the white house as a way 
of dealing with the fear she felt after an assassination attempt on 
the president 
in her soontobepublished memoirs mrs reagan said her 
consultation with astrologer joan quigley began as a crutch 
after ronald reagan was shot in 1981 and was something i did to 
hedge our bets to try to keep ronnie from getting shot again 
it eventually became an enormous embarrassment to reagan 
when it was revealed to the news media 
the book my turn the memoirs of nancy reagan written with 
ghostwriter william novak is excerpted in the oct 23 issue of 
newsweek magazine it will be published later this month by random 
house 
she said she started talking to quigley after entertainer merv 
griffin told her quigley had predicted ahead of time that the day 
reagan was shot would be a dangerous day for him she called her 
sessions with quigley helpful and comforting and likened her to 
a therapist 
in an interview broadcast sunday on cbs 60 minutes program 
mrs reagan confirmed that her astrologer advised her on dates for 
presidential trips and news conferences 
she would pick out dates that were good or bad mrs 
reagan said of her husbands planned trips 
if it was if he were going say to chicago and and i 
would say to her gee is it better if he leaves in the morning or 
the afternoon or maybe the night before and shed tell me i 
didnt see anything wrong with that 
mrs reagan said the same was true with news conferences but no 
political decisions were ever based on astrology 
the president learned she was talking to an astrologer when he 
overheard a conversation with quigley on the telephone she wrote 
if it makes you feel better go ahead and do it she quotes him 
as saying but be careful it might look a little odd if it ever 
came out 
in the interview the former first lady said she is no longer 
consulting quigley or any astrologer 
mrs reagan wrote that the biggest mistake of her husbands 
presidency was allowing donald regan and james a baker iii to 
switch jobs in january 1985 
in the book she sharply criticized regan who moved from 
treasury secretary to white house chief of staff in the job swap 
and said he often acted as if he were president 
she denied she engineered regans departure from the white 
house but detailed her role in making her husband aware of growing 
complaints about him at the height of the irancontra affair 
in an interview wednesday that was broadcast sunday on the 
associated press radio network mrs reagan said the book was not 
intended as an attempt to get even for slights she suffered during 
the white house years 
i hope it doesnt read that way she said in on the ap 
network program newsweek on air i tried very hard not to be 
vindictive 
mrs reagan said all she wanted to do was set the record 
straight about a lot of things that had not been straight during 
the white house years 
the book renders harsh judgment on several other top officials 
of the reagan administration reagans first secretary of state 
alexander haig was ronnies biggest mistake in the first term 
she says calling him power hungry belligerent and 
obsessed with matters of status 
she called former budget director david stockman a shrewd and 
crafty man who violated the presidents trust 
former attorney general edwin meese iii by waiting far too long 
to resign after getting into trouble over finances weakened both 
the justice department and the presidency she wrote 
mrs reagan said she thinks the press made too much of her 
supposed feud with soviet first lady raisa gorbachev but admitted 
she didnt like her saying mrs gorbachev struck me as a woman 
who expected to be deferred to 
my fundamental impression of raisa gorbachev was that she 
never stopped talking or lecturing to be more accurate

the supreme court today backed out of deciding 
whether the internal revenue service when assessing inheritance 
taxes may challenge deductions state courts have allowed for legal 
fees and executors commission 
the justices agreed last february to decide the issue in an 
appeal by a new york lawyer who acted as executor and attorney for 
a 450000 estate 
in a brief announcement today the court said without further 
explanation that the appeal had been improvidently granted 
the court voted 81 to dismiss the case justice byron r 
white dissented 
the justices action has the effect of permitting an irs 
subpoena of the files of james m white a rochester attorney who 
handled the will of helen p smith after she died in november 1982 
a state judge who presided over enforcement of the will a 
procedure known as probate ruled in 1984 that white should be paid 
16800 for his legal services and 17548 as an executors 
commission 
white deducted those amounts when calculating the federal tax 
owed by the estate 
the irs said white must provide records to justify the 
deductions the lawyer refused to comply contending the amount of 
time he spent handling the settling of the will and the hourly 
rates he charged did not bear on whether the fees were reasonable 
under new york law 
a federal judge ruled that the irs failed to show its 
investigation of the case is reasonable the judge said the irs did 
not demonstrate any reason to suspect fraud overreaching or 
excessiveness by white to justify inspecting his records 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals overturned the federal 
judges decision and said white must provide the documents even 
though there is no claim he acted improperly 
the irs has the authority to require the information in its 
investigation of the tax liability of the smith estate the appeals 
court said 
in appealing to the supreme court white said no federal 
interest is served by permitting the internal revenue service or 
the federal court to redetermine the reasonableness of an 
attorneys fee that has already been considered and approved by a 
state probate court 
the case is white vs us 88928

thousands demonstrated their support of abortion rights in new 
jersey and in california where the state attorney general 
announced he would sponsor a ballot initiative to protect a womans 
right to have an abortion 
in trenton nj several thousand prochoice demonstrators 
chanted waved banners and marched on the statehouse on sunday to 
urge lawmakers not to change laws that allow abortion 
the battle over abortion has heated up nationwide since the us 
supreme court issued a ruling in july broadening states rights to 
restrict abortion and the issue figures in the new jersey 
governors race 
eleanor smeal former president of the national organization for 
women urged the demonstrators in trenton to use the election to 
send a message to the rest of the country 
its a political fight its a medical fight and its a public 
health fight ms smeal said 
democratic gubernatorial candidate james florio opposes any new 
restrictions on abortion james courter the gop candidate has a 
long antiabortion voting record but in recent weeks has said he 
wouldnt impose his personal views on new jersey women 
state police estimated the crowd at 6500 organizers claimed 
10000 
in san francisco a crowd estimated by police at 30000 marched 
down market street on sunday carrying signs and chanting their 
support for abortion rights 
california attorney general john van de kamp sporting a 
choice button told the crowd he would sponsor a ballot 
initiative to protect abortion rights 
as in new jersey the issue is becoming a matter of 
gubernatorial politics 
the ballot measure proposed by van de kamp one of three 
democratic hopefuls in the 1990 governors race if the measure 
attracts enough signatures it will appear on the ballot in november 
1990 
the measure is designed to negate a provision of a crime 
initiative that will appear on the ballot in june that is sponsored 
by sen pete wilson the expected republican candidate for 
governor and local prosecutors 
the wilsonbacked measure would repeal a wide range of state 
constitutional rights in criminal cases including the right to 
privacy 
van de kamp backed by several constitutional scholars and major 
abortionrights groups contends the initiative could lead to 
criminal prosecution for some abortions that is because abortion 
rights in california are based on the state constitutional right of 
privacy

the seawall was erected after galveston was devastated in a 1900 
hurricane in which 6000 or more people died it was the deadliest 
hurricane on record in the united states 
a tornado spun off by jerry damaged several buildings in the 
town of orange near the louisiana line and another twister ripped 
the door off a galveston fire truck and damaged the fire station 
and a shed at the airport 
tornadoes or funnel clouds were sighted around galveston bay in 
hitchcock baytown beach city webster and a nearby spot northeast 
of texas highway 6 tornado damage generally was confined to roofs 
and power lines 
two tornadoes were spotted early today in inland polk county 
damaging some houses and barns said sheriffs spokeswoman genace 
chapman 
at least 52000 homes and businesses lost power most of them in 
galveston island said houston lighting amp power spokeswoman graham 
painter but by 5 am today 80 percent of the power was restored 
phone service to much of the island also was disrupted 
the center of the hurricane made landfall sunday evening with 
sustained winds of 80 mph and 100 mph gusts according to the 
national hurricane center in coral gables fla within 3 hours 
jerry was downgraded to a tropical storm after its maximum 
sustained winds fell below 74 mph 
on galveston which bore the brunt of the storm an early 
assessment found minor street flooding but little serious damage 
said gary vasquez of the emergency operations center the biggest 
task appeared to be cleaning up debris scattered by the wind he 
said 
i think we did very well said mayor jan coggeshall 
schools were open as usual today except for one elementary 
school closed because of a power outage 
jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane the least severe 
possible hurricane hugo which devastated parts of the caribbean 
and south carolina last month was a category 4 with winds of 135 
mph jerry was much smaller too with hurricaneforce winds 
extending just 15 to 25 miles out from the eye as compared with 
100 miles for hugo 
but jerry was still enough to cause fear in lowlying areas 
particularly because it coincided with an unusually high tide 
caused by a rare alignment of the earth moon and sun the 
combination of astronomical forces and the storm sent tides 5 to 8 
feet above normal 
in louisianas cameron parish officials sunday urged voluntary 
evacuation of 8000 to 10000 residents were just concerned 
about getting people to higher ground said scott henry a civil 
defense volunteer 
the evacuation advisory was lifted this morning 
earlier hundreds of workers had been evacuated from offshore 
oil rigs as jerry zigzagged through the gulf during the weekend 
most of galvestons 62000 residents decided to stay in their 
homes instead of evacuating for jerry 
by 11 pm those who had moved to shelters were told they could 
return home said gary stone spokesman for galvestons emergency 
operations center 
jerry was the seventh hurricane of the sixmonth atlantic 
season which ends in november hugo was easily the most 
destructive killing 33 people in the caribbean and 29 on the us 
mainland and causing billions of dollars in damage

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states and possibly private citizens may use federal 
antitrust law to break up corporate mergers 
the court said it will hear arguments by california officials 
seeking to scuttle the 25 billion merger of the lucky and alpha 
beta supermarket chains 
todays action kept in effect an order issued by justice sandra 
day oconnor in august that blocks completion of the merger 
lucky californias largest supermarket chain and alpha beta 
the fourth largest operate 550 stores between them 
alpha betas parent company american stores acquired lucky in 
june 1988 intending to merge the two chains under the lucky name 
american stores said california customers would save more than 
50 million a year because of increased efficiency from the merger 
but lawyers in the california attorney generals office said in a 
lawsuit filed last year that a merger means less competition 
leading to 440 million in higher prices each year 
us district judge david kenyon in los angeles temporarily 
blocked completion of the merger ordering continued separate 
operation of the chains even though the financial acquisition had 
occurred 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
ruling in march 
in effect the appeals court said attorney general john van de 
kamp of california waited too long to sue 
in other action the court 
turned away an appeal by a political action committee linked 
to fringe presidential candidate lyndon larouche it now faces 
having to pay 27 million in contemptofcourt fines 
the justices without comment refused to hear the national 
democratic policy committees challenge to fines stemming from a 
federal mail fraud and conspiracy prosecution 
rejected an appeal by a righttowork group that sought to 
limit the power of unions to collect dues from nonmembers 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments in an 
illinois case that the group was treated unfairly by a federal 
appeals court 
refused to free pan american world airways from having to pay 
951500 plus interest to two families of 1974 crash victims 
the justices without comment left intact the awards stemming 
from the april 22 1974 crash in indonesia of a pan am plane 
flying from hong kong to los angeles all 96 passengers and 11 crew 
members died in the accident 
in the merger case the appeals court said california officials 
if they had moved quickly enough could prevent the merger but the 
appeals court said only the federal government not states and 
private citizens has the power to break up mergers after financial 
arrangements are completed 
oconnors order in august had the effect of temporarily setting 
aside the 9th circuit courts ruling 
the federal trade commission temporarily blocked the merger last 
year but later reached an agreement with the corporations allowing 
the acquisition as long as certain conditions were met 
van de kamp had been ordered to post a 163 million bond while 
the state pursued its supreme court appeal but kenyon later reduced 
the amount to 10000 
in the states appeal van de kamp said the 9th circuit court 
ruling conflicts with rulings by federal appeals courts elsewhere 
the case is california vs american stores 89258

a 7yearold massachusetts girl whose liver 
transplant in 1982 helped shape the nations organ transplant 
policy remained hospitalized today after suffering a mysterious 
bout of internal bleeding 
jamie fiske was in stable condition at university of minnesota 
hospital officials said it was the same hospital where she 
received a liver transplant as an infant after he father charles 
fiske made a dramatic televised appeal for her life 
jamie of bridgewater mass left the hospital with her parents 
saturday after removal of her enlarged spleen on oct 9 she was to 
stay one night at a hotel before returning home but was readmitted 
to the hospital at 5 am sunday with internal bleeding said 
hospital spokeswoman mary stanik 
the bleeding had stopped today but doctors did not know where 
the bleeding came from and planned to conduct more tests stanik 
said she didnt know how long the child would be hospitalized 
jamie was admitted to the hospital oct 6 after suffering three 
bouts of internal bleeding in a month her spleen which doctors 
said was seven or eight times the normal size for a child her age 
was removed and doctors believed that would end the bleeding 
exploratory surgery found no problems with jamies liver said 
her physician dr john najarian 
when she received a liver as an infant jamies case raised 
questions about the procedures for determining who should receive 
organ transplants and the propriety of awarding organs on the basis 
of publicity campaigns partly as a result the national transplant 
act was passed to create a national computer system used to match 
donors to recipients 
jamie was born nov 26 1981 with biliary atresia a condition 
in which the livers bile ducts are blocked months later her 
parents learned that only a liver transplant could save her life 
she received a liver in 1982 a few days after charles fiske made 
his appeal for a donor during a convention at the american academy 
of pediatricians television networks showed him singing a line 
from an old song please dont take my sunshine away

a rebuilt jewish temple 
the militants who call themselves the temple mount faithful 
want to rebuild the temple destroyed by the romans in 70 ad

19monthold ban on federal funding for research using fetal 
tissue the new york times reported today

lifted

the rev ralph david abernathy today he meant 
only to tell the truth with his controversial autobiography in 
which he says martin luther king jr had extramarital affairs 
i held martin luther king in the highest regard abernathy 
said at a news conference a week after news of the book made 
headlines he is my dearest friend dead or unborn i would do 
nothing to harm dr king i loved him dearly 
but abernathy said king was not a jesus he was not a saint 
he was not an infallible person i have told no lies 
in and the walls came tumbling down published this month 
abernathy wrote that king had difficulty resisting sexual 
temptation abernathy a king confidant also wrote that the civil 
rights leader spent parts of the night before his april 4 1968 
assassination in tennessee with two different women and that he 
then struck a third woman during an argument 
civil rights leaders including former king colleagues jesse 
jackson andrew young and john lewis denounced the book last week 
and demanded that abernathy repudiate its statements the said they 
doubted he wrote the section about kings last night alive 
in a statement issued to reporters today at his west hunter 
street baptist church in atlanta abernathy said his purpose in 
writing the book was to focus attention once again on the civil 
rights movement i wanted to tell the truth and set the record 
straight once and for all 
with kings private life already documented by historians he 
said he knew people would not believe his autobiography if he did 
not tell the truth about kings infidelity 
abernathy said envy prompted fellow civil rights leaders to 
denounce his autobiography 
i think people are jealous of the fact that ralph david 
abernathy has written a goodlooking book and i was not supposed to 
do that because they thought i was finished with the movement 
abernathy said sunday 
i may make some money for the first time in my life 
abernathy said people are funny i can name five or six 
movement people who are now millionaires 
black leaders also said in a statement that the revelations 
about kings last night could rob abernathy of his rightful place 
in history 
abernathy 62 dismissed those suggestions after a service at 
his church 
you may be able to crop me out of a photo marching next to 
martin luther king jr he said but you cannot take me out of 
history because i have earned my place 
the service took place with scarcely a hint of the controversy 
generated by his autobiography and its passages on kings private 
life 
abernathy pastor of west hunter street baptist church didnt 
address his congregation instead a guest minister preached in a 
service honoring abernathy on his 28th anniversary at the church 
several members of the congregation applauded when it was 
announced that the book would soon be available at the church and 
that their pastor would autograph their copies 
at ebenezer baptist church where king was pastor the rev 
joseph roberts called on the congregation to boycott abernathys 
book 
the book already has gone into a second printing adding 10000 
copies to the 30000 copies ordered according to harper amp row

the supreme court today agreed to provide some 
guidelines for penalizing lawyers who file improper lawsuits 
the court said it will hear an appeal by a washington dc law 
firm penalized 21402 for filing an antitrust suit based on 
inadequate research 
the fine was ordered against cooter amp gell which represented 
dashs designer a nowbankrupt discount mens clothing store 
dashs filed an antitrust suit against hartmarx corp 
manufacturers and distributors of hickeyfreeman and hart 
schaffner amp marx mens clothing 
dashs said hartmarx illegally sold the brands exclusively to 
only one retailer in each of various major cities nationwide 
cooter amp gell filed a second suit after a secretary at the law 
firm telephoned some retailers in washington and three other cities 
to determine whether hartmarx had such an exclusivity policy 
hartmarx later asked for dismissal of the cooter amp gell suit 
after submitting affidavits that it distributed to as many as 20 
different retailers in some markets 
the law firm agreed to drop the suit 
the us circuit court of appeals here ordered the 21402 
penalty against cooter amp gell last may 
the appeals court said cooter amp gell claimed a nationwide 
conspiracy after polling merchants in only four eastern cities 
cooter amp gell had not made an inquiry reasonably commensurate with 
the extent of their allegations 
the supreme court said today it will decide whether the appeals 
court had authority to impose the fine after the lawsuit was 
withdrawn voluntarily the justices also will determine whether the 
appeals court used the right test to decide the law firm acted 
improperly 
the case is cooter amp gell vs hartmarx corp 89275

beijings communist party embraced an orthodoxy 
unheard of for a decade by demanding the ouster from its ranks of 
wealthy private businessmen whom it called exploiters 
the decision to rid itself of the businessmen and other 
hostile and antiparty elements came during a meeting of the 
capital chapters central committee that ended sunday 
in another development the government announced today that more 
than 13600 people have turned themselves in for embezzlement 
taking bribes and other economic crimes since august when the 
government announced a 10week leniency period 
official corruption had been one of the chief complaints 
expressed by leaders of the prodemocracy campaign 
those who do not surrender will be severely punished said 
government prosecutor zhang siqing 
during the gathering sunday beijing party secretary li ximing 
emphasized the need to carry on the class struggle against 
party enemies 
li an ideological hardliner said the party must rely on the 
workers class wholeheartedly and fight all who belittle and 
deny the workers position and role the official beijing daily 
reported today 
the attack on private entrepreneurs and reference to class 
struggle a concept largely ignored in the past 10 years of reform 
were indications of the antiliberal campaigns continued 
momentum four months after troops crushed the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing 
the official xinhua news agency said the beijing party committee 
demanded that all members in the city reregister in the coming 
year as part of a drive to purify the party organizations 
a drive will be conducted to examine and investigate how party 
members especially officials with a party membership behaved in 
ending the national turmoil and quelling the antigovernment 
rioting it said 
the paper was referring to the spring student protests for 
democratic reform which the government ended with a military 
assault that left hundreds of unarmed civilians dead 
the report which did not mention how many of beijings 10 
million residents are party members said only a very small 
number of hostile and antiparty elements will be resolutely purged 
from the party 
it indicated that private businessmen called exploiters 
will be a prime target 
the resolution stipulated that exploiters cannot be admitted 
into the party and those who have already been party members must 
adhere to the partys ideals xinhua said 
besides getting their own due pay they should spend their 
posttax profits on production and public welfare and should not 
use them for their own private needs if they fail to do so they 
can no longer be party members 
former capitalists faced constant persecution during the first 
three decades of communist rule over the past 10 years however 
private businessmen have flourished under senior leader deng 
xiaopings economic reforms and his slogan of to get rich is 
glorious 
but since the june crackdown on dissent and the ascendancy of 
ideological hardliners the party has insisted there can be no 
challenge to the socialist system it has said that those people 
allowed to do business on their own must be kept under close 
surveillance 
some cities have put limits on how much private businessmen may 
pay themselves and tax collectors have been told to tighten their 
monitoring of the 19 million privately employed in china 
the workers daily reminded readers last week that the abolition 
of private property is the foundation of marxist theory and while 
private ownership is tolerated today because of chinas weak 
economic base the eventual goal remains to eliminate it 
party secretary li took a swipe at another stalled political 
reform the separation of party and administrative functions by 
saying the leadership of the party in the workplace must not be 
denied 
party secretaries should respect managers and shouldnt take 
over every administrative thing but managers should accept party 
control not as bondage but as an essential guarantee for wellrun 
socialist enterprises 
former party general secretary zhao ziyang ousted in june after 
he was accused of supporting the students is also charged with 
weakening the party by calling for less intervention in daily 
operations of government offices and factories 
li said china must sincerely uphold the partys leadership on 
every front as the battles against infiltration subversion and 
evolution toward capitalism reach new levels of intensity

environment while using the earths resources to feed the poor 
fao directorgeneral edouard saouma said there is a 
fundamental paradox between providing enough food and 
safeguarding the environment 
in developed countries pesticides and fertilizers have caused 
pollution while developing countries have abused natural resources 
to feed a growing population saouma said an estimated 27 million

the governments attempt to suppress independent 
suppliers and restore monopoly control over distribution of farm 
supplies and equipment have caused major disruptions in the market 
an official daily said monday 
the government decision this year to reassert control over farm 
materials has aggravated the shortage reduced production 
blocked transfer between provinces created official speculation 
and furthered price hikes the china daily said 
the daily citing a survey taken by the beijingbased newspaper 
economic information said producers of fertilizer pesticides and 
plastic sheeting are going broke because of low stateset prices 
for their goods while high markups on products then sold by the 
state are arousing resentment of producers and consumers 
the government moved last year to restore central controls over 
agriculture and industry to counter rising prices and profiteering 
that have accompanied economic reforms under which commodity value 
is to some extent determined by market forces 
requirements that producers must sell to state monopoly 
departments rather than directly to farmers have led to delays and 
economic losses the report said 
in the central province of anhui 60 percent of fertilizer 
factories lost money in the first quarter of 1989 overall 52 of 
the countrys 91 factories making plastic sheeting halted 
operations and another 21 reduced production because of low prices 
and delayed payment from the state 
both stockpiling and supply shortages have occurred because some 
state offices to protect local interests have imposed 
restrictions on selling materials to other provinces 
some government companies taking advantage of the monopoly 
have speculated in hardtoget materials the state price bureau 
found that 95 percent of illegal price rises during a threemonth 
period this spring were done by state monopoly companies 
prices of agricultural materials were up 238 percent in the 
first quarter of the year and sales declined 
grain production has stagnated for four straight years largely 
because farmers put off by rising costs and low statedetermined 
prices for their crops have switched to other cash crops or gone 
into sideline businesses 
one major problem apparently unresolved has been a 
doubletrack pricing system where some materials are sold by the 
state at low prices and others are available on the free markets at 
usually much higher prices 
the system has led to widespread corruption with producers and 
officials diverting fertilizer seeds and other goods from state 
channels and forcing farmers to turn to the free markets

civilian government now prevails in latin 
america and gen manuel antonio noriega of panama is being 
isolated to a degree not seen since the cases three decades ago of 
gen rafael trujillo and fidel castro 
what role if any the rejection will play in bringing noriega 
down is a question while indicating solid support for president 
bushs efforts to oust noriega the condemnation clearly does not 
include support for direct us intervention 
on friday in washington bush said he believes his feelings 
about noriega who commands the panamanian military and controls 
the government are shared by my colleagues south of the border 
seven latin american leaders meeting last week in this desert 
city 185 miles southeast of lima condemned the continued lack of 
democracy and human rights violations in panama 
they continued the indefinite suspension of the noriega 
regime from the group of eight an informal group of which panama 
was a founding member three years ago 
at the same time the presidents of argentina brazil colombia 
mexico peru uruguay and venezuela said the 1977 treaties that 
turn the panama canal over to panama at the end of 1999 should be 
respected fully 
heat started building on noriega after us officials accused 
him of trafficking in drugs in february 1988 he was indicted in 
florida on federal narcotics charges 
at the recent meeting of the inter american press association in 
monterrey mexico roberto eisenmann editor of an opposition 
newspaper in panama said noriega had created the first 
narcomilitary regime in the world 
noriega has responded to pressure with increasingly harsh 
treatment of opponents 
he is seen in the region as a throwback to the oldstyle 
military dictator noriega summed up his view of power recently as 
blows for the weak bullets for enemies money for friends 
president alan garcia of peru who extended the red carpet two 
years ago when noriega visited lima now is among the generals 
severest critics 
garcia told the opening summit session he was using the occasion 
to express publicly the peruvian peoples and the peruvian 
governments repudiation and condemnation of the military 
dictatorship in panama 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela who once had warm 
relations with noriega called his regime a masked dictatorship 
and guillermo larcos cox perus foreign minister declared we 
cannot allow a country like panama that scoffs at and ridicules the 
democratic system to continue with us 
in may after annulling elections outside observers said were 
swept by the opposition noriega chose economist francisco 
rodriguez to be president 
peru and venezuela immediately recalled their ambassadors and 
virtually all other latin american countries followed suit even 
president augusto pinochet of chile a general often criticized for 
a poor human rights record quietly ordered his envoy back to 
santiago 
now noriega finds himself isolated from other latin american 
nations an example of rejection not seen in more than a generation 
in the late 1950s and early 1960s trujillo suffered similar 
repudiation but only after venezuela presented evidence of the 
dominican republic dictators involvement in an attempt to 
assassinate the venezuelan president romulo betancourt 
venezuela again sought regional solidarity in the early 1960s 
when castros cuba trained and financed leftist guerrillas fighting 
the venezuelan government 
cuba was expelled from the organization of american states and 
all latin american countries but mexico broke relations most 
governments have restored ties since however and the ica summit 
urged the renewal of cubas oas membership 
efforts to isolate castro were hampered by enthusiastic support 
for him among leftist groups throughout latin america but no 
pronoriega voices are being heard 
whether latin american rejection will have an effect on noriega 
remains to be seen it appeared to have little on trujillo or 
castro trujillo resisted the pressure until his assassination in 
1963 and castro remains in power

the pilotmanagement group trying to take over 
the parent of united airlines will have to consider wooing those 
who oppose the deal bringing in other backers or making an offer 
with more securities analysts said 
the groups 675 billion cash offer for ual corp collapsed 
last week when banks largely japanese refused to finance the 
deal that helped trigger the steepest oneday decline in the stock 
market since the oct 19 1987 crash 
ual stock plunged 60 a share to 21934 by midday today on the 
new york stock exchange trading in the companys shares was halted 
friday and many traders trying to unload the stock were forced to 
postpone their sales until today 
all parties to the bid the air line pilots association 
uniteds managers and british airways plc spent the weekend 
restructuring the offer said pilots union spokesman hank krakowski 
we are confident we can restructure the transaction and can 
move ahead he said sunday all i can say is were not 
committing to any timetable but we intend to move as rapidly as we 
can 
united spokesman joe hopkins said today that the company was not 
in a position to comment on a revised offer a british airways 
statement from london reiterated the companys commitment to 
reviewing any revised bid and completing the deal 
published reports today said a new bid might be disclosed early 
this week the chicago tribune quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the original allcash offer might be a package of cash and 
scurities with a nominal value of 300 a share the same pershare 
value as the initial bid 
one speculator whom the newspaper did not identify said the 
revised offer might contain 250 to 270 a share in cash with the 
remainder in securities 
bankers who turned down the ual proposal said in interviews with 
the wall street journal that the market might have misinterpreted 
the significance of the collapsed deal they said banks didnt 
suddenly become unwilling to finance takeovers they just didnt 
like this particular ual buyout plan which called for unattractive 
fees and interest rates to banks 
industry analyst louis marckesano said the pilotmanagement 
group should move quickly with a restructured plan to calm the 
market which tumbled on friday with a 190point drop on the dow 
jones industrial average 
i dont think it has to be done today but there has to be 
some indication theyre working on a revised bid said 
marckesano of the philadelphia brokerage janney montgomery scott 
inc 
at this stage everybodys waiting to see what the revised 
bid will look like said marckesano itll be two weeks before we 
know what the ultimate outcome will be and how its going to be 
structured 
he suggested the buyout group try to enlist the backing of the 
machinists union which had vehemently opposed the takeover bid to 
make the offer more attractive 
or perhaps bring in outside financing somebody like a 
friend of the group marckesano said perhaps marvin davis 
restating his backup bid at 300 a share could contribute to the 
deal in some form or another 
but robert joedicke an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc said he doubted davis a california billionaire whose bid 
was rejected by the ual board could find financing for his offer 
since the pilotmanagement group could not 
i doubt very much if he would be anxious at this point to 
press a bid joedicke said predicting the restructuring of the 
pilotsmanagement offer would involve a combination of cash and 
securities 
a spokesman for davis said friday that davis had no statement on 
whether he would pursue his offer

there will be more than 1 million new babies in 
china in 1989 than last year because of failures to follow through 
on the governments tough family planning policies a senior 
government official has said 
state family planning commission head peng peiyun said more than 
23 million babies will be born in 1989 about 118 million more 
than in 1988 the official china daily reported monday 
peng speaking to family planners said this years birth rate 
will exceed 21 per thousand and natural population growth 15 per 
thousand last year the birth rate was 208 and the growth rate 
142 per thousand 
chinas population growth which reached as high as 33 per 
thousand in 1963 decreased dramatically when the government in the 
1970s inaugurated a family planning policy based on one child per 
family 
the natural growth rate fell to 108 per thousand in 1984 and 
112 per thousand in 1985 but it has since been rising again as 
women born in the baby boom period of the early 1960s reach 
childbearing age and more people in rural areas defy the onechild 
rule 
a growth rate of 15 per thousand would be the highest since 1975 
chinas population which stood at 540 million when communist 
rule began in 1949 hit 11 billion in april this year china had 
hoped to keep population down to 12 billion at the end of the 
century but demographers now say it will be closer to 13 billion 
about onefifth of the worlds people 
one must keep a sober mind over the countrys serious 
population issue and make greater efforts to publicize the 
importance of family planning peng said 
she said programs had fallen short in rural areas where the 
reinstitution of family farming under chinas economic reforms has 
encouraged farmers to have more children to help in the fields 
affluent farmers also are able to pay fines imposed for having 
more than one child and many rural areas bowing to the strong 
desire for sons to carry on the family name are allowing farmers 
whose first child is a girl to try again 
peng said better publicity and education are needed at the 
grassroots level especially in areas where poverty is high saying 
such methods work better than tough policies and fines

a countdown suspended for five days 
by a failed engine computer resumed without a hitch today and a 
federal appeals court removed a legal obstacle to tuesdays launch 
of space shuttle atlantis 
hours after the countdown started up an appeals court in 
washington dismissed environmentalists request to stop the launch 
because of the nuclearpowered galileo spaceship that will be 
aboard 
the antinuclear activists who had appealed a lower courts 
rejection of their request fear that a challengerstyle accident 
could poison the atmosphere with plutonium from galileos power 
pack 
but the threejudge appeals panel headed by chief judge 
patricia wald said last weeks order by us district judge oliver 
gasch was not appealable 
more than 30 activists marched this morning on a kennedy space 
center gate about 10 miles from the launch pad eight of them were 
arrested on trespassing charges after they walked through a line of 
security guards at the gate 
the florida coalition for peace and justice has threatened to 
stop tuesdays liftoff by infiltrating the launch area danger zone 
the countdown was resumed at 1201 am when the traditional 
call to stations summoned workers to their posts in the control 
center and on the launch pad 
we see nothing standing up and going to bite us nasa test 
director al sofge said today after workers had completed early 
tasks including checks of the guidance system and preparations for 
fueling the spaceship 
liftoff of atlantis and its crew of five astronauts was set for 
a 26minute period starting at 1257 pm tuesday thats when 
earth and jupiter will be aligned properly for galileo to orbit the 
giant planet in 1995 after a sixyear voyage 
the weather outlook was improving with forecasters today 
increasing from 70 to 80 percent the chance that conditions will be 
good at launch time 
shuttle managers on sunday gave the goahead to restart the 
countdown after assessing the readiness of the shuttle and 
replacing the bad computer that forced a postponement of the 
launch scheduled originally for last thursday 
we retested the computer and everything looks fine test 
director mike leinbach told reporters 
astronaut donald williams who commands atlantis crew praised 
technicians who worked around the clock for four days to make the 
computer swap saying they did a super job 
launch preparations were taking place under the tightest 
security ever for a shuttle flight because of the threats from 
antinuclear activists in all 494 pounds of radioactive 
plutonium238 will be aboard to provide electricity to operate 
galileos systems 
large areas of the kennedy space center were closed to the 
public and the national aeronautics and space administration 
mobilized more than 200 armed guards and helicopter and boat 
patrols 
the astronauts are to release the 15 billion galileo from 
atlantis cargo bay about 6 hours after they reach orbit an hour 
later a rocket motor will start the 6700pound craft on a 
roundabout trip that will cover 24 billion miles to jupiter 
in december 1995 a 737pound probe released from galileo is to 
plunge into jupiters cloud layers and take the first samples of 
the jovian atmosphere 
the main galileo craft will enter an orbit around the planet 
and its cameras and 10 scientific instruments will gather 
information on temperatures magnetic fields radiation cloud 
characteristics and gravity 
galileo also will study jupiter for clues to the formation of 
the solar system many scientists believe the planet still holds 
much of the material in the original state from which the sun and 
planets formed 46 billion years ago 
planners say the crafts investigations of jupiter will be the 
most scientifically rich interplanetary mission yet the pictures 
it relays will be up to 1000 times sharper than those obtained by 
the voyager spacecrafts 
galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing as 
the voyagers did said edward c stone one of the mission 
scientists being there and observing over a period of nearly two 
years will allow us to sort out the dynamics of jupiter and its 
moons

the us forest service wants people to forget 
some of the camping techniques they learned as boy scouts 
and recognizing that times have changed the boy scouts have 
revised their handbook and are urging young campers to leave their 
hatchets at home 
rangers such as michelle kaptur who patrols the high wilderness 
of the cascade range are telling campers that its no longer good 
enough to leave a clean camp in the wilderness the forest service 
wants you to leave no trace of a camp at all especially not a ring 
of rocks where you built a fire 
when you leave a fire ring the next person says hey 
theres a camp lets use it kaptur explained to a group of 
campers at quinn meadows outside bend after 300 people use it 
its not a wilderness anymore 
there is this whole cultural image of what camping is she 
said in an interview in the new star trek movie theres a scene 
where theyre sitting around a campfire they had looked through 
the computer log to find out what camping is and its exactly 
true you have to have a fire ring you have to have marshmallows 
thats all true 
but it doesnt work anymore theres too many of us for it to 
work 
the urge to build a campfire what kaptur calls the television 
of the wilderness is so strong that the most popular wilderness 
areas of the deschutes national forest no longer have any dead wood 
for fires within reach of a human 
people dont realize that at ground level all those little 
twigs they use for fires have a purpose kaptur said they 
decompose and feed the trees 
the 10th edition of the official boy scout handbook due out in 
january for the first time advises young campers to cook on a 
stove rather than a fire and to leave their hatchets behind 
since the first handbook came out in 1910 the book that has 
taught millions of americans how to camp has described the joys of 
cooking over an open fire and using an ax to hew a camp from the 
wilderness 
thats when youll really feel yourself akin to the early 
american pioneers hewing their homes out of the wilderness reads 
the 1962 handbook 
the handbooks latest edition doesnt even feature the official 
boy scout hand axe handbook editor jd owen said from his office 
in irving texas 
in the old days you could go pitch a camp anywhere and chop 
down trees to build pioneer projects and nobody would care said 
owen these days they do care highimpact techniques are not 
suitable anymore and we dont teach them 
robert c birkby author of the new handbook said the boy 
scouts want to influence beginning campers 
here is a real opportunity to make a difference in the way 
that young people future adults view the environment in which 
they live and can take an active part in making some substantial 
changes in the quality of that environment birkby said from his 
home in seattle 
when people think of scout camping now i hope they will think 
of small very environmentally aware groups that are able to go 
deep into the backcountry and leave no trace of their passing he 
said 
cliff blake national coordinator for the forest services no 
trace camping program has a tough job trying to spread the word 
with a meager budget and no animal champion to help the way smokey 
bear sniffs for forest fires and woodsy owl hoots at polluters 
blake went to the boy scouts for help about five years ago and 
now counts on them to help promote no trace camping 
we were talking about 18 million visitors to the national 
forest system back in 1946 said blake now we are looking at 
225 million per year doing their thing the land hasnt expanded 
any but the people certainly have

gloria horowitz thinks her husband sheldon is 
the greatest thing since sliced bread and thats the way she wants 
him immortalized with a sandwich named in his honor at the stage 
delicatessen 
the stage home of overstuffed sandwiches named for celebrities 
is running a contest to select a common person for a spot on the 
menu alongside the mike tyson triple decker knockout and the 
donald trump power special and mrs horowitz thinks sheldon is 
a winner 
because my husband is renowned for his honesty this sandwich 
should be openfaced revealing all the beautiful truth of its 
contents she writes 
the ingredients in a sheldon horowitz sandwich tongue because 
sheldon loves to talk red bell peppers halfsour pickles 
lumpfish caviar smoked turkey greenleaf lettuce and mustard on 
pumpernickel bread 
the tuckahoe couple will learn thursday whether this horowitz 
hoagie will triumph over more than 150 other entries in the contest 
sponsored by stage coowners paul zolenge and louis auerbach 
the idea for the contest zolenge said stemmed from the 
restaurants traditional practice of taking polaroid snapshots of 
celebrities who dined there other customers often wanted to have 
their pictures taken and asked why they were not given the 
spotlight 
the common customer really is more important than the stars 
said zolenge if not for them we wouldnt be here 
the winner is to appear on stage menus in all three of the 
delis locations the original on seventh avenue in manhattan as 
well as branches in boston and los angeles in addition the winner 
will receive 100 and a dinner for four at the stage deli in new 
york 
the rules specified no one who has made a significant 
contribution to the arts theater music literature pop culture 
or sports may enter in other words woody allen need not apply 
brett eidman of manhattan took the rules seriously 
be assured he wrote i have not made any significant 
contribution to the arts or to mankind in fact sometimes my 
uselessness even gets to me and i try to sleep it off 
his sandwich would be corned beef on club but the meat would be 
sliced so thin that it resembles ham which befits him eidman says 
who could be more appropriate ask friends of the unfamous 
producer wheeler jackson than the man who has done it all or at 
least tried to 
a regular guy just slugging it out day by day doing the best 
he can reads his description jackson they say appears in a 
recent new york lottery commercial as a real person sure 
testimony to his typicality 
bubbles helfman insists that she is even more typical my 
problem she says is that i want the whole left side of the 
stages menu 
so i end up tasting a little of each from my plate my 
husbands plate my bosss plate tourists from south dakotas 
plates im not proud ill schnorr from anyone said 
helfman about her sandwich sampling 
as a solution helfman proposes the bubs a platter 
comprising five minisandwiches to satisfy the palates of fickle 
eaters 
three judges will select the winner among them baseball players 
gary carter and don mattingly both of whom have left their mark on 
the game and on the stage delis menu 
evidently there are ordinary sandwich fans everywhere entries 
came from throughout the metropolitan area from several states and 
from both coasts 
some were in prose some in verse one woman signed her rhyming 
recipe with apologies to shakespeare another could think of no 
better wedding present for her fiance than to have a sandwich named 
for him

business sales far outpaced inventory 
accumulation in august the government said monday in a report that 
one analyst attributed to a miniinventory correction 
the commerce department said inventories edged up 03 percent to 
a seasonally adjusted 7899 billion while sales advanced a steep 
31 percent to 5268 billion the pace in inventories was down 
from a 09 percent hike in july while sales rose from a 09 decline 
the previous month 
the combination of sales advancing far faster than the 
accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots is good news for the 
economy if inventories were to pile up excessively it could mean 
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs 
basically the inventories do not appear to show any signs of 
vulnerability said robert g dederick chief economist for the 
northern trust co of chicago 
ive been impressed by how managements have been keeping 
inventories from getting seriously out of hand he said 
the commerce report showed a decrease in the ratio of 
inventories to sales from 154 in july to 150 in august that 
means it would take one and a half months to exhaust inventories at 
the august pace 
manufacturers inventories which represent about 45 percent of 
the total were up only 03 percent while wholesalers backlogs 
actually dropped 01 percent 
retailers inventories however rose 07 percent which 
economist michael p niemira of mitsubishi bank in new york 
attributed in large part to a 16 percent advance in automobiles 
niemira described the slowing pace of inventory growth as a 
miniinventory correction that began last year in manufacturing 
and has been working its way through the other sectors 
manufacturers sales on the other hand rose 56 percent 
followed by wholesalers up 15 percent retailers sales gained 
07 percent 
overall both inventories and sales were 71 percent above those 
of august 1988

e robert wallach a close associate of former 
attorney general edwin meese iii was sentenced today to six years 
in prison and fined 250000 for his racketeering conviction in the 
wedtech corp scandal 
us district judge richard owen said wallach used his influence 
to gain access to the back steps of the white house and made 
almost half a million dollars as a result 
wallach 55 a prominent personal injury lawyer from san 
francisco was found to have illegally received 425000 from the 
nowdefunct south bronx defense contractor to influence meese and 
other government officials as part of wedtechs efforts to gain 
government business 
he was convicted aug 8 by a jury in manhattan federal court of 
racketeering fraud and conspiracy to defraud the us government 
his codefendants r kent london and w franklyn chinn were 
convicted at the same trial of racketeering racketeering 
conspiracy and fraud charges stemming from payments they received 
from wedtech 
chinn 47 of san francisco meeses former financial adviser 
was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 100000 london 
46 of honolulu a chinn business associate was sentenced to five 
years in prison and fined 250000 
in a statement ot the judge before sentencing wallach said 
there was a maxim that went too much success can bring failure 
i am the epitome of that and i am paying for it he said 
the judge denied defense motions to throw out the verdict based 
on the dismissal of a juror who called in sick and based on 
defense arguments that the law wallach was convicted of breaking 
was unconstitutionally vague 
wallach who was hired by wedtech as a consultant was found to 
have defrauded the company and its shareholders of a 125000 
payment in 1983 which he billed as work for the companys public 
stock offering but was actually for his efforts to influence meese 
and others to secure an army contract for wedtech 
he also was convicted of illegally receiving 300000 from 
wedtech officials purportedly for helping the company acquire 
shipyards and a michigan tugbarge system 
the jury found the money was actually a payment in anticipation 
of wallachs employment at the justice department where he could 
influence meese and other officials wallach was hired by the 
justice department 
the 300000 payment also was the basis for the conspiracy to 
defraud the government charge 
wedtech once a small machine shop grew into a 100 million 
government contractor through a small business administration 
program that set aside contracts without competitive bidding for 
minoritycontrolled companies 
evidence at trials has shown that wedtech continued to receive 
the nobid contracts through a series of bribe schemes 
wallach testified at the trial that he has been a close friend 
of meese since they attended law school together he represented 
meese during his confirmation hearings for the attorney general 
post and at a special prosecutors investigation in 1984 
meese was never charged in the wedtech scandal although his 
ethics were questioned by a special prosecutor in washington who 
said messe could have been hit with tax and conflict of interest 
charges 
the former attorney general testified for wallach and said 
wallach had never asked him to do anything improper for wedtech

attorneys for a judge facing charges before a 
state judicial panel say a reporter took advantage of the judge 
when she published what he thought were offtherecord remarks 
about homosexuals 
cliff hutchison attorney for state district judge jack hampton 
said dallas timesherald reporter lori montgomery took advantage 
of the friendship she cultivated with judge hampton to write a 
slanted article about the judge 
the statement came out in a factfinding hearing monday on the 
charges made by the state commission on judicial conduct there was 
no testimony at the hearing but attorneys handed in depositions 
and affidavits 
hampton told ms montgomery in an interview published dec 16 
that he gave a light sentence to convicted murderer richard 
bednarski 18 in part because bednarskis two victims were 
queers he made similar statements to the associated press 
the judge said in the interview that victims john lloyd griffin 
and tommy lee trimble were asking for trouble by soliciting sex 
these two guys that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
hampton said two weeks after sentencing bednarski to a 30year 
prison term 
i dont much care for queers cruising the streets for teenage 
boys he said 
hampton later apologized for a poor choice of words and 
insisted that he believed the interview was off the record he has 
refused to talk to reporters since 
ms montgomery later received awards by the dallas bar 
association and a gay advocacy group for her work 
a may 31 letter from the judicial commission announced hampton 
was charged with violating conduct canons barring judges from 
commenting on pending cases bednarskis attorney had filed a 
motion for a new trial at the time the statements were published 
hampton also is accused of damaging public confidence in the 
integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
the 11member commission could dismiss the allegations censure 
hampton or urge his removal from office by a sevenjudge panel 
after hampsons remarks came to light he predicted no one would 
remember them in 1990 
we are here to remind them that we have not forgotten dan 
perry a member of the gay urban truth squad said outside the 
courts building monday we are here to remind judge hampton and 
the commission we are not going to forget

the supreme court said monday it will consider 
bolstering the power of states and private citizens to break up 
corporate mergers 
the justices agreed to hear an appeal by california officials 
seeking to use federal antitrust law to kill the 25 billion 
merger of the lucky and alpha beta supermarket chains 
the high court acted at a time when much of the nations anxious 
attention was focused on wall street developments following 
fridays market tailspin last weeks steep drop was attributed in 
part to investor worries over the future of debtfinanced corporate 
takeovers 
in other action the justices 
agreed to take a new look at the rights of motorists suspected 
of drunken driving the court will hear an appeal by pennsylvania 
officials seeking to reinstate the drunkendriving conviction of a 
man videotaped answering police questions before he was warned of 
his right to a lawyer or to remain silent 
rejected an appeal by a political action committee linked to 
fringe presidential candidate lyndon larouche the group now may 
have to pay 27 million in contemptofcourt fines 
refused to free pan american world airways from having to pay 
951500 plus interest to two families of victims of a 1974 crash 
in indonesia that claimed 107 lives 
agreed to use a washington dc case to set guidelines for 
penalizing lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits 
the supermarket case focuses on the merger of lucky 
californias largest supermarket chain and alpha beta the fourth 
largest they operate 550 stores between them 
the high court action monday will keep in effect an order 
justice sandra day oconnor issued in august blocking completion of 
the merger oconnors stay will remain in force until the court 
announces a decision in the case expected by july 
alpha betas parent company american stores acquired lucky in 
june 1988 intending to merge the two chains under the lucky name 
american stores spokesman troy dambrosio said monday that 
american is losing 15 million a week due to the blocked merger 
on hold since september 1988 
american stores said california customers would save more than 
50 million a year because of increased efficiency from the merger 
but lawyers in the california attorney generals office said in a 
lawsuit filed last year that a merger will mean less competition 
leading to 440 million in higher prices each year 
us district judge david kenyon in los angeles temporarily 
blocked completion of the merger ordering continued separate 
operation of the chains even though the financial acquisition had 
occurred 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
ruling in march 
in effect the appeals court said attorney general john van de 
kamp of california waited too long to sue 
the appeals court said california officials had the power to 
prevent the merger by acting quickly but the appeals court said 
only the federal government not states and private citizens may 
sue to break up mergers after acquistions are completed 
oconnors order in august had the effect of temporarily setting 
aside the 9th circuit courts ruling 
the federal trade commission temporarily blocked the merger last 
year but later reached an agreement with the corporations that 
removed its opposition to the acquisition as long as certain 
conditions were met

prime minister rajiv gandhi and his 
fractious opposition are drawing the battle lines as the deadline 
approaches for calling national elections 
the issues sharpened in recent days with new accusations of 
highlevel deceit and ineptitude involving the gandhi governments 
14 billion purchase of artillery guns from the swedish company ab 
bofors 
the scandal in which newspapers and opposition politicians 
allege that bofors paid as much as 50 million in kickbacks to 
clinch the 1986 arms contract has been alternately simmering and 
boiling for 2 years but with parliamentary elections due no later 
than january and speculation heightening that the date will be set 
any day now the opposition has seized upon bofors with renewed 
intensity 
bofors came to a boil again friday the same day gandhi failed 
to push through parliament one of his pet projects a 
constitutional amendment to give greater powers to grassroots 
governmental groups 
it was the first time in 21 years and only the second time in 
indias 42 years of independence that a government motion had 
failed 
gandhis congress party mustered 158 votes to the opposition 
parties 83 in parliaments upper house but it fell three votes 
short of the necessary twothirds majority in a midnight friday 
vote 
this defeat could give gandhi a rallying cry for his reelection 
campaign fueling his offensive against those who opposed his bill 
on panchayati raj whose literal meaning is fiveman rule a 
name derived from traditional village councils composed of five men 
gandhi and his congress party billed panchayati raj as a 
powertothepeople program but the opposition maintained it was 
actually designed to strip state governments of their power and 
extend federal control to local levels 
vishwanath pratap singh gandhis foremost political foe said 
saturday the national front coalition of opposition parties would 
come up with its own and much better panchayati raj bill 
singh who once belonged to gandhis congress party and served 
as his defense and finance minister heads the janata dal peoples 
party and is the national fronts convenor a top position it 
is indicative of the coalitions internal rivalries and its need to 
placate egos that it also has a chairman and a president 
the failure of gandhis panchayati raj amendment came about 12 
hours after parliament had again debated the bofors issue with the 
oppositions usual demands for gandhi to resign over the alleged 
kickbacks 
the latest bofors debate was sparked by reports carried by the 
statesman indian express and other newspapers that senior members 
of the gandhi government had colluded with bofors to conceal 
the identity of a swissbased company that allegedly received a 12 
million payoff for helping bofors snatch the 1986 arms contract 
from other bidders 
exactly where any such payoffs went is the mystery since 1987 
newspapers and opposition politicians have charged that bofors paid 
up to 50 million in commissions or kickbacks that ultimately 
ended up in the hands of indians some of them close to gandhi or 
the congress party 
gandhi has repeatedly denied that any commissions were paid or 
that any indians received payoffs 
while the 45yearold former airline pilot has not been accused 
of personally receiving kickbacks he has been pilloried for 
allowing such alleged payoffs to happen 
with 880 million people india is the worlds largest democracy 
but it is an unruly one the congress party founded by gandhis 
grandfather jawaharlal nehru has governed india for all but three 
years since the asian subcontinent was freed from british colonial 
rule in 1947 
other parties have usually been fractured along regional 
religious and ideological lines rarely able to come together with 
a unified voice according to unicef and other statistics about 40 
percent of all adults are illiterate reports of voting influenced 
by fraud and thuggery recur with election 
expectations that an election date would be set soon rose when 
parliament adjourned its monsoon session friday night the next 
step is the dissolution of parliament by president ramaswamy 
venkataraman whose largely ceremonial post is awarded by the prime 
ministers cabinet 
once parliament is dissolved the election commission must set a 
date to vote for new legislators 
with the january deadline drawing near it was appropriate that 
a group of social workers called the servants of the people society 
organized a discussion called criminalization of politics how 
to combat and reverse it 
the speakers were drawn from the leadership of the major 
political parties

former black panther bobby seale may not go to 
trial on charges of theft and passing bad checks to cover an 
11000 debt from a barbecue cookoff 
the debt stems from seales participation with a 12member team 
in the may 1988 national rib cookoff to promote a book he wrote on 
barbecue techniques 
seale 52 was indicted in february on two counts of theft and 
six charges of writing bad checks to cover the cost of pork ribs 
and chicken sold to his team and to pay the motel where the group 
stayed 
seale has paid off most of the debt his lawyers said his trial 
was to begin monday in common pleas court but it was postponed 
until nov 20 to allow him to pay off the rest 
im sure i can reach total restitution by then seale said 
seale who works as a community liaison in temple universitys 
africanamerican studies department said he underestimated the 
cost of competing in the cookoff and overestimated sales 
his lawyer terry gilbert said its a simple restitution case 
and not for a criminal court 
roger kramer an assistant prosecutor handling seales case 
said theres a good chance charges will be revised or dropped

president bush has complete confidence in cia 
director william h webster and is fully satisfied with him 
the white house said monday disputing a report that senior 
administration officials were unhappy with his performance 
rumors of white house displeasure are totally false said 
brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bill 
webster knows hes in good shape he doesnt have any problems 
hes always been that way theres never been any problem 
asked how long webster would have his job fitzwater said 
everybody comes in with the understanding we serve at the 
presidents pleasure 
in a frontpage story the washington post said that 
unidentified senior officials in the bush administration were 
frustrated with websters lowprofile performance and had begun 
talk of replacing him with a more active player 
the post quoted white house chief of staff john h sununu as 
saying during a recent staff meeting that he had learned more about 
the attempted coup from watching cable news network than from 
websters central intelligence agency however fitzwater said that 
was incorrect 
he said sununus comment was made at the time of the crackdown 
on prodemocracy forces in china not the coup attempt in panama 
and that it did not refer to director webster 
fitzwater said he talked with bush extensively about the post 
story and the president thinks the newspaper report was 
outrageous 
fitzwater said bush had not actually used the word 
outrageous saying that was my characterization of his 
overall comments which were somewhat more extensive im not going 
to give you any quotes 
even before fitzwater denied the story at his regular news 
briefing scowcroft took the unusual step of issuing a 
stronglyworded written statement on his own 
the president is fully satisfied with the performance of the 
intelligence community including during the panama episode 
scowcroft said the president strongly supports director 
webster 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said scowcroft 
was trying to quell speculation that webster might be on his way 
out 
fitzwater said bush has complete confidence in director 
webster and the leadership hes providing at cia 
the white house has been criticized by members of congress for 
not having a more organized flow of information during the oct 3 
coup some members have criticized bush for not doing more to 
assist those seeking to overthrow panamanian strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
webster was the head of the fbi from 1978 to 1987 when 
thenpresident reagan moved him to the cia post after the 
irancontra affair bush a former cia chief himself decided to 
retain him in that job

international business machines corp today 
announced what it called a disappointing 297 percent decline in 
its thirdquarter earnings an outcome that the company signaled 
last month 
the computer giant reiterated that its earnings were hurt by the 
strength of the dollar difficulties making transitions to new 
products and an increase in leasing instead of buying by customers 
on the positive side ibm said revenue and shipments were up 
from a year earlier 
while these shortterm financial results are disappointing 
demand for ibm products and services continues to be good 
worldwide said ibm chairman john f akers in a statement the 
company was confident about the longterm prospects for our 
business akers said 
ibm said it earned 877 million in the three months ended sept 
30 or 151 a share down from 125 billion or 210 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose 43 percent to 143 billion from 137 
billion a year earlier 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year ibm said its 
earnings fell 84 percent to 317 billion or 543 a share from 
346 billion or 583 a share a year earlier revenue rose 65 
percent to 422 billion from 397 billion a year earlier 
ibms stock dropped sharply last month after the company said it 
expected thirdquarter earnings to come in below the thencurrent 
range of analysts estimates 
a strong dollar decreases the dollar value of profits earned 
overseas in foreign currencies a switch to leasing lowers the 
shortrun income from product placements and a delay in 
introduction of a new ibm disk drive for data storage in large 
computers has hurt shortterm results

the grammrudman deficitreduction law was 
scheduled to trigger 161 billion in federal spending cuts on 
monday following the failure of congress and president bush to 
agree on a plan to cut the governments budget deficit 
what the grammrudman law is passed in 1985 and amended two 
years later the law sets a series of declining targets for 
projected deficits for each fiscal year culminating in a balanced 
budget in 1993 the cuts are triggered automatically if the targets 
are exceeded 
why the cuts are being made grammrudman requires the cuts to 
be made oct 16 if the projected deficit for fiscal 1990 which 
started oct 1 surpasses 100 billion by more than 10 billion 
the white houses office of management and budget projected the 
deficit monday to be 1161 billion 
has it happened before twice in 1986 117 billon were 
imposed in january and remained in effect through september the 
end of the fiscal year in 1987 23 billion in reductions were 
imposed in october and were rolled back in december 
how this years cuts are applied half to defense half to 
domestic programs or 805 billion to each because the cuts are 
from different dollar totals that calculates to 43 percent cuts 
in defense and 53 percent in domestic programs 
what programs are affected all defense programs except for 
money owed in contracts many domestic programs are exempted 
including social security many other benefit programs and 
payments on the national debt certain other programs such as 
medicare can be sliced no more than 2 percent 
examples of cuts defense programs cut from 2914 billion to 
2833 billion foreign aid from 163 billion to 158 billion 
science and space from 137 billion to 133 billion agriculture 
from 188 billion to 182 billion transportation from 291 
billion to 285 billion education and social services from 382 
billion to 375 billion health from 566 billion to 562 
billion 
what the public will feel very little initially because of the 
many exemptions and because agencies have the flexibility to shift 
money around within programs many people believe most citizens 
will not notice anything at all for several weeks 
how long the cuts last technically they took effect 
temporarily oct 1 by law they were invoked permanently monday 
but congress can pass legislation at any time rolling them back

the bush adminstration trying to ward off a 
diplomatic rift with turkey summoned sen bob dole rkan to the 
white house monday to discuss his proposed resolution memorializing 
the armenian genocide 75 years ago a dole aide said 
the turks are up in arms about the resolution because they 
dont want to be compared with hitler said mike mcnamara a 
lobbyist for turkey 
it is the most offensive thing that congress can do to 
usturkish relations said daryal batibay the deputy chief of 
the turkish embassy he said the measure if passed would damage 
ties between the united states and turkey a close nato ally that 
plays host to american military bases 
against that backdrop brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser asked dole the senate minority leader to meet 
with him on the issue according to an aide to dole who asked that 
he not be quoted by name 
publicly the administration has remained mute on the emotional 
resolution which has caught president bush in a bind 
during the 1988 presidential campaign bush said the united 
states must acknowledge the attempted genocide of the armenian 
people in the last years of the ottoman empire some 15 
million armenians were killed in the early part of the century 
but marlin fitzwater bushs spokesman said the administration 
had not taken any position on the dole resolution the reagan 
administration opposed such resolutions when they previously came 
up and were defeated in the house 
with the senate judiciary committee scheduled to vote on the 
resolution tuesday turkeys lobbyists and bush administration 
officials including morton abramowitz the us ambassador to 
turkey worked frantically behind the scenes to convince senators 
to drop their support for the dole resolution 
several senators including patrick leahy dvt strom 
thurmond rsc and robert kasten rwis have already withdrawn 
their sponsorship others like daniel moynihan dny and frank 
lautenberg dnj have added their names to the resolution 
dole needs 50 cosponsors half of them republican to have the 
judiciary committee consider the measure which would designate 
april 24 1990 as the national day of remembrance of the 75th 
anniversary of the genocide of 19151923 
in a letter to other senators dole said the resolution was 
prompted by his august visit to armenia a part of the soviet 
union to visit earthquake victims 
and i can attest from my own recent visit to armenia that 
the armenian people feel real friendship for the united states and 
our people he said 
both dole and sen pete wilson rcalif said they didnt want 
the resolution to be misunderstood as a slap at turkey 
i would also like to point out that the resolution does not 
implicate the government of the republic of turkey in this terrible 
event wilson said wilson is running for governor in california 
a state with a large population of armenian descendants 
thurmond the ranking republican on the judiciary committee 
said he pulled his name as a cosponsor since ive learned the 
administration strongly opposes the resolution he said he was 
weighing whether to support the measure 
leahy said he withdrew his name because the turkish ambassador 
said the turks will allow scholars to study the events from ottoman 
empire archives he thinks next year would be a better time for a 
resolution said leahys spokesman joe jamele 
kastens name had been put on the resolution by a staff member 
without the senators knowledge said kastens spokesman jim sims 
kasten asked that it be taken off sims said

a soviet official said monday that the 
kremlin regrets the past use of psychiatry as a political weapon 
the comment by peter morozov the secretary of international 
relations for the statesanctioned allunion society of soviet 
psychiatrists was a depature from the kremlin view that has only 
hinted at possible isolated cases of abuse in the soviet union 
its clear that we regret our past not only political 
abuses but the whole system morozov said in an interview 
his comments came on the eve of a vote by the world psychiatric 
association on whether to readmit the soviet group to its ranks 
the soviet group was forced to withdraw from the world body in 
1983 under threat of expulsion because of allegations that 
dissidents in the soviet union were being certified as insane and 
interned in mental hospitals 
we know of a lot of cases of political abuse that have been 
reported on medical or legal grounds morozov said now we 
want western psychiatrists to come and see suspicious cases and 
visit psychiatric hospitals 
earlier monday soviet officials told a news conference that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of reforming society 
has led to changes in psychiatric practices in the soviet union 
yuri reshetov the head of the soviet foreign ministrys human 
rights department said the government has not yet appointed the 
members of an independent soviet commission to monitor soviet 
psychiatry 
a soviet official told a us congressional panel this month 
that the eightmember commission had already been set up to prevent 
the use of psychiatry for nonmedical reasons and to ensure 
maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of psychiatry 
reshetov said the authorities were still looking for 
professionals to become members of the commission which he said is 
not connected to any government department or organization 
the soviets say 45 million people are registered as mentally 
ill in the soviet union a decrease of 1 million in the past 1 
years 
fini schulsinger the secretarygeneral of the world body who 
backs readmission for the soviet group said he believes delegates 
will vote tuesday to its unconditional readmission 
but some delegates speaking on condition of anonymity expected 
a fierce debate and said readmission might require the soviets to 
guarantee there will be no political abuse 
the association also will vote tuesday on whether to admit a 
second soviet group the independent psychiatric association both 
soviet groups can be admitted 
congressional sources predicted the independent group would be 
admitted because it ws set up to oppose political abuse of 
psychiatry

communist party general secretary jiang zemin has 
ordered a purge of opportunists in leading positions in the 
party an official report said monday without identifying his 
targets 
jiangs speech was publicized one day after the beijing city 
party committee voted to purge its own ranks by requiring all 
members to reregister for examination of their qualifications 
however the official xinhua news agency said jiang delivered 
his speech in august at a meeting of party organization departments 
from around the country the speech will appear in this weeks 
issue of seek truth the party magazine 
xinhua did not explain the delay in releasing the speech which 
may have been due to disagreement within top party ranks over how 
far to go in carrying out the crackdown on dissent the crackdown 
is part of a hardline backlash to the spring prodemocracy 
protests that were crushed by the army in june 
many rank and file party members in cities expressed sympathy 
with the protests and some took part former party chief zhao 
ziyang was accused of supporting the protests and ousted from 
office along with several top allies but the party has yet to deal 
with many zhao supporters who remain in place 
xinhua quoted jiang as saying in his speech that to ensure the 
purity of the party it is necessary to uncover the opportunists 
especially those in leading positions within the party but he 
did not identify them and xinhua gave no further information 
jiang also said the role of party cells should be strengthened 
and that exploiters a traditional word for wealthy private 
businessmen should be barred from the party because it is the 
vanguard of the working class 
the party has stepped up its emphasis on class identification 
and class struggle since june private businesses were allowed to 
make a comeback in the past decade under senior leader deng 
xiaopings policy of reforming the centralized economy and the 
party had preached that it was acceptable for some people to get 
rich at least one millionaire was admitted to the party 
since june however the party has denounced unequal 
distribution of wealth and accused businessmen of evading taxes 
and breaking other laws 
in the initial stage of socialism various economic sectors 
are allowed to coexist with the sector under public ownership 
being predominant xinhua quoted jiang as saying but we should 
not attach undue emphasis to the individual and private economies 
for they can only be a supplement to the public economy 
in its weekend resolution the beijing party committee also 
banned socalled exploiters from its ranks and urged a stronger 
party role at the workplace 
the disclosure of jiangs speech shows that the beijing 
committees actions are not those of a radical fringe but 
represent decisions of the party center 
government spokesman yuan mu meanwhile said he was confident 
that economic relations between china and the west will resume 
developing despite western censure of chinas crackdown on dissent 
no country in the world can deny that socialist china with a 
population of 11 billion stands like a giant in the east it 
is impossible for anyone to isolate china he said in an 
interview with japans kyodo news agency his comments were carried 
by xinhua 
japan and most western countries condemned the chinese armys 
attack on the protesters in which hundreds and perhaps thousands 
were killed japan initially froze its aid to china but said last 
month it was gradually resuming work on existing projects 
yuan continuing chinas policy of trying to discourage japan 
from forming a united front with the west on human rights demands 
said japans actions hurt relations but that china had noted 
differences between japans stand and that of the west i hope 
the current unpleasantness will only be a shortlived episode he 
said 
yuan spoke more harshly of the united states again accusing it 
of interfering in chinese affairs by condemning the crackdown he 
said it was up to the united states to take the first step in 
restoring friendly relations 
yuan said the partys top policymaking body the central 
committee will meet to make decisions on overcoming economic 
disorder but did not give a specific date he said it may meet 
late this month or early in november 
there has been speculation the party could announce a decision 
on any further action against zhao at the session some hardline 
leaders are believed to be pressing for his expulsion from the 
party and trial

a blind man who has been trying to join the 
state department for more than a decade said monday he has been 
told his wish will be granted under the reversal of a policy that 
dates back to the 18th century 
avraham rabby of new york city said in a telephone interview 
he was informed of the decision last friday after the state 
department notified congress of its intention to hire qualified 
blind people for the career diplomatic service 
state department officials said the decision was based primarily 
on technological advances including optical scanners capable of 
speaking written words through a conversion process 
these advances enable the blind to improve efficiency and limit 
the need for readers and other types of outside assistance 
another factor contributing to the policy reversal was a federal 
law that states that the government cannot disqualify prospective 
employees persons because of blindness or other handicaps it must 
also provide reasonable accommodations to help them overcome 
their handicaps 
in the past the state department has insisted on a general 
exemption from this law because of the unique circumstances under 
which diplomats must work 
the decision to grant rabby 47 an appointment to the foreign 
service came less than a year after he had been told that blind 
people would no longer be allowed to take entrance examinations in 
braille or to use other forms of outside help 
he had passed five state department entrance examinations since 
1985 but has been attempting to join the foreign service since the 
ford administration 
last november state department officials said they agreed that 
they had been following a contradictory policy toward the blind 
allowing them to take the written and oral examinations but never 
accepting them as foreign service officers 
officials attributed the decision to hire the blind to the newly 
installed director general of the foreign service edward j 
perkins a former ambassador to south africa 
rabby is a graduate of oxford university in england with degrees 
in spanish and french and has a masters degree in business 
administration from the university of chicago 
born in what is now israel 47 years ago he has been blind since 
age 8 he lived for 15 years in england and six months each in 
france and spain he has his own consulting business helping 
disabled people find employment 
asked where he would like to serve rabby listed posts such as 
japan the soviet union and england but said that issue is yet to 
be worked out 
one official who asked not to be identified said the decision 
to hire qualified blind applicants means there could be some 
relaxation of the state department policy that all foreign service 
officers must be worldwide available 
the official acknowledged that it would not be appropriate for 
rabby to serve in an area faced with wartime conditions 
some officials have argued against hiring the blind contending 
that while the united states has facilities for helping the blind 
overcome their handicap most foreign countries lack such 
accommodations 
these officials have said that much of diplomacy involves 
reading the body language of foreign envoys during diplomatic 
discussions such gestures as winks and nods form part of the 
overall message a diplomat must assimilate the officials said 
rabby said the blind are no less able than sighted people to 
read other peoples language be it silent or verbal

secretary of state james a baker iii 
expressed concern monday over reports that a united nations 
official demanded nicaraguan resistance fighters return home 
without assurances they will not suffer reprisals from sandinista 
authorities 
baker outlined his thoughts in a letter to un secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar following a report in saturdays 
washington post that the un official francesc vendrell had told 
the rebels that they had ceased to have any raison detre or 
reason for existence 
perez de cuellar expressed regret over any misunderstandings 
that may have arisen and said un policy on central america is 
rigorously impartial 
vendrell was quoted as telling thousands of rebels assembled in 
southern honduras you are nicaraguans and not the objects of a 
us policy that is anachronistic and has been abandoned by the 
country that helped you 
baker expressed deep concern that the remarks as reported 
contradict the goals that all parties share the achievement of 
democracy in nicaragua a necessary condition to assure resistance 
members that they have the option to return with safety and freedom 
 
baker noted that the nicaraguan government agreed to these 
conditions in three separate meetings with other central american 
countries over the past two years 
vendrell went to the border area last thursday in his capacity 
as a member of a unorganization of american states commission 
set up to monitor compliance with a resolution approved by the five 
central american presidents 
among other measures the presidents called for the voluntary 
demobilization of the contras by dec 5 in return the sandinista 
government has promised to hold free and fair elections next feb 
25 
baker said the contras are unlikely to demobilize voluntarily 
and return to what is recognized as hostile control and 
recrimination from the sandinista government 
in a similar vein state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said the political and security situation in nicaragua 
must improve and accommodate resistance concerns before they can be 
expected to voluntarily demobilize and repatriate 
perez de cuellar issued a statement at un headquarters 
asserting that the comments attributed to vendrell were selected 
from an impromptu statement 
unfortunately the comments as quoted in the article have 
given rise to misunderstandings concerning the rigorously impartial 
position of the united nations he said this the 
secretarygeneral regrets 
perez de cuellar said vendrell naturally emphasized that the 
purpose of the commission was to ensure the voluntary character 
of the process of demobilization and repatriation which of course 
entails full access by members of the resistance to information as 
well as the free expression of their wishes

a drug used for more than a decade to treat 
the skin disease psoriasis is preventing and halting the rejection 
of transplanted organs in animals a researcher said monday 
the compound will be tested on human transplant patients when 
that is approved the us food and drug administration said dr 
randall morris director of stanford universitys laboratory for 
transplant immunology 
its a promising new addition to the drugs we already have and 
is an example of how we are engineering drugs based on our 
knowledge of dna synthesis morris said 
the drug mycophenolic acid produced by a fungus inhibits the 
formation of dna the genetic material that also is critical in the 
growth of skin lesions common to psoriasis 
researchers altered mycophenolic acid to make it more easily 
absorbed by the body in its altered form mycophenolic acid 
morpholinoethylester or rs 61443 it blocks the dna process 
required for white blood cells to attack transplanted organs 
according to morris 
its not shutting down dna all over the body its shutting 
down dna synthesis in these white blood cells which is exactly 
where we want to shut it off morris said from atlanta where he 
presented his findings monday to members of the american college of 
surgeons 
morris said it is too early to predict the role rs 61443 might 
play in relation to cyclosporine the popular antirejection drug 
whose use was pioneered by dr thomas starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh 
the two drugs are extremely effective when used together morris 
said 
it allows you to lower the dose of both drugs thereby 
minimizing the toxic effect he said 
cyclosporine approved for general use by the fda in 1983 
suppresses the bodys entire immune system and therefore enhances 
the risk of infection side effects include kidney failure 
high doses of rs 61443 have produced anemia morris said 
rejection is responsible for most failed transplants experts 
say there were 12798 organ transplants in the united states in 
1988 according to the united network for organ sharing 
anything that comes along that would lower rejection rates 
would be great said dr william vaughn the networks director 
of research 
morris and other stanford researchers have used rs 61443 in more 
than 150 heart transplants involving rats mice and most recently 
monkeys 
the drug is manufactured by syntex inc of palo alto calif 
oral doses of rs 61443 were administered daily for 50 days 
morris said the transplanted hearts of rats receiving high doses 
functioned properly for more than 200 days animals transplanted 
hearts failed within a week when no medication was given 
the new drug effectively halted and sometimes even reversed 
rejection of the rats transplanted hearts when administered for 
the first time five days after surgery he said 
morris said rs 61443 stands out from other experimental 
antirejection drugs in that its action on the body is fully 
understood 
this drug represents a more rational way of affecting or 
controlling the immune system because were actually going to the 
heart of biochemistry that we understand he said were using 
our knowledge to develop drugs that control the immune system in a 
very predictable way

lawmakers imposed price controls monday on the 
private businesses president mikhail s gorbachev fostered to 
supply goods and services the state cannot provide 
the 542member supreme soviet legislature took the action in 
response to public accusations that the businesses known as 
cooperatives have engaged in price gouging 
when it began debating restrictions in september legislator 
veniamin yarin accused cooperatives of open robbery of the 
working man 
cooperatives are one of the few successes of gorbachevs 
economic reform program his economic adviser leonid abalkin has 
said soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are an 
important part of the economy agree to treat them equally with 
staterun business and allow local governments to regulate them 
since they were legalized 2 years ago they have grown 
dramatically and provide 20 billion in goods and services abalkin 
has said 
but last year the government began taxing the cooperatives and 
expects to receive 23 billion from these levies next year 
on monday more restrictions were imposed the official tass 
news agency said local governing councils will set price ceilings 
on consumer goods and services of cooperatives the ceilings will 
apply to products the state has contracted to buy from cooperatives 
and items cooperatives manufacture using statesupplied resources 
the businesses also will come under state price control when 
they resell goods purchased from the state many cooperatives make 
huge profits by buying scarce goods from the state and reselling 
them at higher prices 
another provision forbids cooperatives from reselling imported 
goods at a higher price than the state would charge 
legislator anatoly sobchak was quoted by tass as saying the 
restrictions make it possible to keep cooperative associations 
intact and at the same time eliminate profiteering 
one deputy had proposed closing all wholesale and retail 
cooperatives 
previously cooperatives were exempt from state control over 
their prices and they have been able to obtain scarce goods by 
paying off people with access to them 
in the sept 26 debate gorbachev asked the legislature how the 
cooperatives manage to find soap when no one else can he noted the 
cooperative price might be 774 for a bar of soap when a state 
store would charge just 62 cents to 155 
gorbachev stood by his creations however 
the main thing for us is to preserve cooperatives he said 
people see the evident difference between them those providing 
services manufacturing producing construction materials 
repairing helping are more than welcome by the people all those 
intermediary cooperatives are considered to be thieves

the contiguglias said the curse even struck them before 
in 1986 when they were to perform the piece at an annual liszt 
festival in holland the 58page manuscript was seized by the dutch 
government which thought liszts notes were coded espionage 
secrets being passed from east germany to the west

florida real estate developer joseph 
zappala presented his credentials monday to king juan carlos as 
us ambassador to spain 
after the ceremony at the royal palace the new us envoy and 
the king met privately for 15 minutes 
zappalas nomination by president bush set off a round of 
controversy but he was confirmed two weeks ago 
according to an editorial in the new york times in july the 
nomination of the 56yearold businessman was due to a 
distinctively large contribution to the republican party 
reportedly 126000 
zappala replaces reginald bartholomew who assumed the post in 
september 1986 
zappala said last week in madrid his primary mission would be to 
strengthen the already excellent relations between the united 
states and spain 
the signing in december 1988 of a new eightyear 
spanishamerican defense agreement that stipulates the withdrawal 
of approximately onethird of the us forces stationed in the 
country spelled an end to a period of tension 
zappala presented his credentials two days before prime minister 
felipe gonzalez is to arrive in washington on his second official 
visit to the united states since his socialist party scored a 
landslide victory in 1982 elections polls indicate gonzalez will 
win an unprecedented third term in general elections oct 29

federal regulators opened hearings monday to 
consider revamping the rules for labels describing the contents and 
claims of packaged foods a growing concern among healthconscious 
american consumers 
theres a lot more known now about the relationship of diet 
and health said luther c mckinney a senior vice president at 
the quaker oats co who addressed the hearing the first of four 
planned around the country 
the public has a lot higher awareness of some of those 
relationships and a desire for a lot more knowledge than they 
presently have 
industry groups food companies and consumer groups lined up 
for the food and drug administrations allday session to discuss 
nutrition and ingredient labeling descriptive terms for food and 
health messages 
their concerns ranged from preservatives to pesticides to baby 
foods to the need for national standards 
jan schakowsky of the illinois public action group said that in 
addition to sodium and cholesterol the public is equally 
concerned about the impact of pesticides and other known 
carcinogens and reproductive toxins in their food 
consumers have an unequivocal right to know if and when they 
are exposing their families to dangerous chemicals in the food 
they eat 
ms schakowsky also noted that the environmental protection 
agency has failed to establish safe exposure levels for all but a 
few of 600 active pesticide ingredients 
carol berland 51 described before the hearing her sensitivity 
to certain preservatives sometimes used in packaging which leave 
her gasping for breath 
you can actually feel the bones in your body shaking said 
ms berland concerned about the use of claims such as all 
natural 
speaking for gerber products co sandra bartholmey said the 
fremont michbased company will work to ensure that infantfood 
labels reflect the differences in infant and adult diets 
she noted the importance of feeding your baby like a baby 
avoiding excessive fiber and recognizing the need for fat and 
cholesterol 
ms bartholmey urged the hearing panel to exempt food for babies 
under 2 years old from labeling requirements for these nutrients 
noting such information likely will be misleading to many adults 
and may lead to a nutritionally inadequate diet 
mckinney speaking for the washingtonbased national food 
processors association called for national uniformity of 
labeling requirements saying they would allow a much needed 
nationwide nutrition education program that would go hand in hand 
with the new labeling rules 
an association survey of 1000 consumers is under way to 
determine what consumers want and need in food labeling mckinney 
said 
i believe research will show strong consumer interest in 
labeling for fat cholesterol and sodium content he said 
chicagobased quaker has been involved in an oat bran war 
over ads claiming its oat cereal can reduce the risk of heart 
disease by helping lower cholesterol the federal trade commission 
cleared quaker in june but in september texas attorney general 
jim mattox sued the company which filed a countersuit 
the fda hearings follow the august introduction in congress of a 
tough new foodlabeling bill the nutritional labeling and 
education act 
the agency part of the department of health and human services 
has scheduled additional hearings nov 1 in san antonio texas 
dec 7 in seattle and dec 13 in atlanta

the prosecutor in the irancontra 
investigation monday accused attorney general dick thornburgh of 
deliberately sidetracking with no legitimate reason the 
criminal case against a former cia station chief 
there is every reason to proceed promptly in the criminal 
prosecution of joseph fernandez the cias exstation chief in 
costa rica independent counsel lawrence walsh said in a court 
brief 
fernandez assisted oliver norths secret contra supply network 
during a congressional ban on us military aid to the rebel force 
on friday the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond 
va granted the justice departments request for a months time to 
consider whether it wants to appeal its ruling that thornburgh 
couldnt intervene in the fernandez prosecution on secrecy issues 
walshs brief asked the court to reconsider its order 
fernandez was scheduled to go on trial in july but the justice 
department went to the appeals court after us district court 
judge claude hilton in alexandria va said fernandez was entitled 
to disclose certain government secrets 
those include the fact that the cia has stations in honduras and 
el salvador 
thornburgh has repeatedly thwarted the prosecution by 
lastminute unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie 
this case in a knot of endless litigation said walsh 
walsh said thornburgh has asserted no legitimate reason for 
delay and that there is every reason to proceed promptly 
walsh complained that the attorney general provided no notice 
that he had decided to file the request for an extension the 
justice department and walshs office have worked closely on 
secrecy issues for three years in this instance the justice 
department mailed walsh a copy of his request depriving the 
independent counsel of an opportunity to respond before the court 
acted the court papers stated 
the departments request for the extension was prepared on oct 
11 the day justice department spokesman david runkel assured 
reporters in a memo that there are no new developments in the 
fernandez case 
asked last friday about the discrepancy between his statement 
and the departments actions runkel said he was unaware that 
government lawyers were preparing to file the request for the 
extension 
walsh said the information thornburgh seeks to protect is 
widely known to the public such as the existence of cia stations 
in latin america the independent counsel said thornburghs only 
course in protecting the information is to file an affidavit which 
would prohibit its use at fernandezs trial 
such a step could lead to dropping the criminal charges against 
the excia officer who is accused of obstructing the tower 
commission and the cia inspector generals offices and making false 
statements 
in the court papers walsh said he was told by assistant 
attorney general edward dennis on oct 2 that the justice 
department probably would not seek further court review dennis 
head of the departments criminal division said that thornburgh 
probably would file an affidavit prohibiting disclosure of the 
information at the fernandez trial said walsh 
in addition said walsh a criminal division attorney indicated 
on oct 11 that the division had sent a memo to the solicitor 
general recommending against seeking further appeals court review

the dow jones industrial average managed a 
rebound today defying fears of a black mondaystyle crash in some 
of the heaviest trading in the history of the new york stock 
exchange 
the dow average which represents stock prices of americas 30 
biggest industrial companies closed 8812 points higher at 
265738 a gain of 343 percent or nearly half the loss posted on 
friday 
the leap came after the average gyrated in early trading 
starting with a decline of about 63 points shortly after the 
opening bell 
most of the stocks that comprise the dow average were posting 
gains as investors snapped up bluechip issues other stocks lagged 
behind 
the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks 
recovered its early loss and was up 421 to 18977 at the close 
but big board losers led advancing issues by a 5to4 margin at the 
close with 942 down 766 down and 286 unchanged 
the dow jones average had plunged 19058 points on friday in the 
worst decline since the 508point black monday crash of oct 19 
1987 some had feared today would be a rerun of that monday two 
years ago because it had been preceded by a sharp 100pluspoint 
drop in the dow the previous friday 
analysts were encouraged that the market avoided that scenario 
but said stock prices were still volatile 
perhaps through the next week or so we will experience a 
continued high degree of volatility said jack conlon an 
executive vice president at nikko securities co international 
after setting a morning sales volume record trading slowed 
somewhat during the afternoon but the final total of 416 million 
shares was still easily double the typical days volume 
the big boards computer system was expanded following the crash 
to be able to accommodate 600 million shares a day 
in washington the federal reserve made good on its promise to 
keep the markets moving by injecting 2 billion into the banking 
system analysts described the move as restrained 
the fed had indicated over the weekend that it would move 
quickly to meet any demands for cash that might result from a 
deluge of sell orders hitting the us markets 
turmoil continued in the airline sector donald trump announced 
he was withdrawing his 7 billion bid for amr corp parent of 
american airlines after the companys stock slid more than 13 a 
share however he said he would consider lowering his offer 
program trading which exacerbated fridays decline worked to 
accentuate the markets volatility today 
its very difficult to tell where we are said hugh johnson 
first vice president at first albany corp bargainhunting 
institutional investors bought highquality stocks which helped 
push up the dow but johnson said the fact that the broader market 
was still off was troublesome 
takeover rumors and leveraged buyouts had pushed the stock 
market to record heights in recent months it was trouble with one 
of those deals the employeemanagement buyout of united airines 
parent ual corp that sparked fridays selloff 
ual which ceased trading late friday plummeted 55 to 22475 
when it began trading late in the morning 
initial dow readings were complicated because computers were 
running behind the heavy trading texaco opened at 1006 am edt 
the last dow component to begin trading torrenzano said 
were getting through the initial tremor of the opening 
said eugene peroni an analyst with janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia the market is holding up pretty well its not 
showing real signs of breaking 
but peroni also cautioned that the markets real test will 
come later this afternoon when everything is opened and has had a 
chance to trade on a normalized basis 
sell orders had been accumulating over the weekend and stock 
futures contracts were at a discount to stocks giving an incentive 
for investors to sell stocks and buy futures 
stock index futures plunged at the opening in chicago creating 
a further drag on the stock market in new york but the futures 
later moved into plus territory helping the stock market recoup 
its losses 
overseas where markets reopened for the first time since wall 
streets friday the 13th scare declines registered from moderate 
to large in asia european markets initially were hit hard but 
rebounded somewhat after wall street opened 
londons financial timesstock exchange 100stock index down 
nearly 200 points at midday recovered to finish the day down 7050 
points or 32 percent at 21634 in extremely heavy trading 
the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 issues 
closed at 3446869 down 64733 points a drop of 18 percent from 
friday when the index rose 32997 points the previous biggest 
decline of the year was 48411 points on sept 26 
the dollars value sank in early trading today in europe and in 
tokyo before recovering somewhat 
trading in tokyo was the first opportunity a major foreign 
market had to react to fridays 190point plunge in the dow 
industrials 
the trading there and in other major foreign markets had been 
expected to set the tone for the activity that resumed later in new 
york 
on wall street the new york stock exchange opened its computers 
to receive orders at 730 am edt an hour earlier than usual 
because it expected heavy volume thousands of worried investors 
called sell orders into their brokers over the weekend setting the 
stage for a flood of activity when wall street opens for business

amateur radio operators would be hit with 
firstever registration fees under pending deficit reduction 
legislation a slap at people who perform a valuable service when 
disaster strikes sen carl levin said monday 
senate leaders will try to remove the fees from the bill during 
negotiations with the house over the budget and tax package said 
levin dmich 
these are people who are critically needed in emergencies 
they ask for nothing and they charge nothing levon said 
the house and senate versions of the budget bill would levy a 
35 fee on amateur radio operators also known as ham 
operators when they receive their initial licenses which must be 
renewed every 10 years 
that is not much money acknowledged perry williams spokesman 
for the american amateur radio league which represents about 
160000 of the nations 450000 licensed ham operators 
but he said operators would have to pay the fees each time they 
upgrade their licenses 
you get kicked in the teeth for advancing your skills 
williams said 
it costs the federal communications commission about 5 to 
process each license levin said higher fees than that would be 
like taxing a hobby which doesnt make sense he said 
ham operators have played a vital role in disasters such as 
earthquakes in mexico in 1985 and in el salvador in 1986 the crash 
at detroit metropolitan airport in 1987 and hurricane hugo last 
month levin said 
it was they who got word to the us government of the need for 
troops to quell looting in the virgin islands after hugo williams 
said 
the proposed fees are among provisions that would raise 43 
million to cover the fccs administrative costs in licensing radio 
stations although levin said it is not clear whose idea it was to 
apply the charges to ham operators 
i havent found anyone who defends it he said

stock markets around the world tumbled monday as foreigners 
reacted to wall streets friday the 13th plunge with a deluge of 
sell orders that clogged exchanges from tokyo to lisbon 
the general perception is there was a bit of a panic said 
guy stern a research analyst at abd securities corp in new york 
but analysts said that despite sharp drops in stock prices the 
global backlash was nowhere near what it was two years ago in the 
wake of wall streets black monday collapse 
some also said wall streets rebound on monday which saw the 
dow jones industrial average rise nearly 90 points could spark a 
similar upturn when foreign exchanges reopened tuesday 
in tokyo the first major market to open following fridays 
abrupt 190point plunge in the dow industrial average the key

from extremely heavy trading plagued the markets

designed to calm roiled markets in paris dealing was temporarily 
suspended twice due to insufficient buying orders 
a mass of sell orders caused computer problems in brussels 
where there was little trading all session amsterdam also had 
computer problems during its session 
exchanges in frankfurt the netherlands and elsewhere stayed 
open late to compensate for the trading difficulties 
some european exchanges considered closing for the day but 
decided against it several took extra precautions to stem a 
freefall in milan for example traders were prohibited from short 
selling the practice of selling borrowed shares in speculation 
they can be bought back later at a lower price 
things started off more or less the same as two years ago but 
the big difference is that when trading came back to new york 
the market had rebounded said robert brusca chief economist at 
nikko securities co international inc 
after gyrating wildly throughout the morning the dow average 
had moved into plus territory and stabilized finishing the day up 
8812 at 265738 a 343 percent gain

improve my chance by increasing my abilities and my experience it 
was my goal to accomplish in my life something of value and to do 
it with selfrespect and integrity

sherwood forest beyond mombasa omar khayyam 
constantine and the cross and the fifth musketeer 
the 1955 movie the big combo which he produced and starred

scene is shown for no reason except to shock then it is bad 
he also acted in directed and produced beach red storm 
fear devils hairpin maracaibo sword of lancelot 
and sharks treasure wildes last movie was my very wilde

poverty unemployment and infant mortality add 
up to misery in the lower mississippi river region and the remedy 
must include help from the federal government a commission said 
monday 
the lower mississippi river delta development commission 
acknowledged the economic ills that burden seven states bordering 
the river and said those woes should not prevent the region from 
participating as a full partner in americas future 
in short the region is not only worth saving but because of 
its location resources and climate could make a major 
contribution to the rest of the nation and the world the 
commission said 
the commission was created by congress in 1988 to come up with a 
10year plan to aid 214 counties near the mississippi it did not 
offer specific recommendations monday those are due in may 
the commission however did address some issues that could get 
attention in the final report 
flood control local communities are required to pay a 25 
percent share of federal floodcontrol projects 
for some of the poorest counties in the delta we should have 
no match or at least a much smaller match than 25 percent said 
arkansas gov bill clinton the commission chairman 
infant mortality support for provision of midwives would

the navy said monday it suspended a california 
defense contractor from doing business with the government saying 
the company supplied untested circuit boards for tactical missiles 
if flawed the suspect boards could keep the missiles from going 
off 
the boards made by asher engineering corp of baldwin park 
calif went into the navys phoenix longrange airtoair missile 
the harpoon antiship missile the harm antiradar missile 
tomahawk cruise missile sidewinder heatseeking missile sparrow 
radardirected missile and the advanced mediumrange airtoair 
missile the statement said 
the action was taken against asher because it did not keep 
adequate records of tests to see whether the boards met contract 
specifications the navy said in a statement issued at the pentagon 
the firm made printed wiring boards that were put into arming 
switches made by another defense contractor micronics 
international of brea calif 
micronics was the sole source of the arming devices for such 
vital missiles as the phoenix and the amraam or advanced 
mediumrange airtoair missile 
last month the pentagon said it had cut off all purchases of 
the items from micronics resulting in a delay in the deployment of 
some missiles and forcing the navy to take parts from old missiles 
until a new supplier begins production 
because of the problems with the parts the pentagon said last 
month that deployment of new phoenix missiles to the navys fleet 
would have to be delayed and cause delays in testing the amraam 
aboard navy f18 and air force f15 fighters until new parts were 
secured from another source 
but the service insisted that it had a full inventory of 
missiles for its operational forces to compensate for an expected 
stop in deliveries of the safety and arming device 
the devices will be produced by raymond engineering in 
massachusetts starting in 1991 
and the navy said problems with the boards had not been found to 
cause any detrimental missile performance 
the suspension is temporary pending the outcome of an 
investigation and any resulting legal proceedings the navy said 
although the boards did not meet contract specficiations 
missile components were tested at other levels when they were built 
into the full missile the navy said 
the action against asher was taken based on adequate evidence 
that this company and these individuals defrauded the government in 
performing subcontracts to manufacture printed wiring boards the 
statement said 
the navy said asher engineering badhadursinh asher jayant 
hathi and james menzies would be barred from contracting with any 
agency of the government for the temporary period 
each of the individuals named signed certificates saying the 
wiring boards were manufactured in accordance with the contract 
specifications 
however the statement said investigation shows that asher 
engineering does not have the capability to perform the required 
tests inhouse and there is no evidence that outside test 
facilities were utilized 
the arming device roughly comparable to the safety on a gun is 
built into the missiles fuze to prevent premature firing of the 
missile it also prevents explosions in accidents such as dropping 
a warhead on a carrier deck but allows the warhead to explode when 
it hits a target after being fired

the agriculture department eventually will 
have to furlough some chicken inspectors and other employees to 
reduce spending under the grammrudman balancedbudget law a 
budget official said monday 
but dennis kaplan chief of usdas budget control and analysis 
division said there is widespread belief that congress will pass 
some kind of reconciliation measure soon that will make the 
grammrudman mandatory cuts or sequester unnecessary 
the departments programs are going to go on basically as they 
always have over the next couple of weeks therell be no real 
impact on programs during that time he said in an interview 
even if we go through the sequester youre not going to see 
any major impact until toward the end of the year kaplan said 
some usda agencies that have big payrolls would be hit hard 
eventually the food safety and inspection service for example 
which handles federal meat and poultry inspections will probably 
furlough a lot of their employees he said but that wont 
occur until august or september 
other agencies in a similar boat include the forest service 
with its vast organization of regional and lowerechelon offices 
the farmers home administration including county offices that 
service loans for financially pressed farmers and the animal and 
plant health inspection service including its quarantine and 
diseasecontrol activities 
kaplan said much of usdas spending is exempt from grammrudman 
cuts including the vast food stamp school lunch and other child 
nutrition programs 
farm price support operations are subject to the grammrudman 
cutback which averages 53 percent for domestic agencies or about 
81 billion defense cuts also must total 81 billion or 43 
percent 
after deducting all the exempted programs from usdas projected 
spending for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 the base used for the 
cuts is about 959 billion kaplan said the 53 percent 
grammrudman reduction would amount to around 509 million 
two years ago in another grammrudman round that was later 
rolled back by congress usda underwent an 85 percent pruning of a 
base exceeding 825 billion meaning a reduction of around 702 
million

a car bomb wrecked the vanguardia 
liberal newspaper building in northeastern colombia on monday and 
killed four employees of the paper which had joined in a 
condemnation of cocaine barons 
reports said a soldier helped a drug trafficking suspect wanted 
in the united states escape from a hospital in barranquilla 
the newspapers publisher blamed drug traffickers for the 
bombing in bucaramanga a city of 400000 people 175 miles north of 
bogota he said he did not know whether the paper could continue 
publishing 
the vanguardia liberal is the main daily of northeastern 
colombia 
although i cant identify the perpetrators i can say that 
basically they are the same group of drug traffickers that have 
carried out these types of attacks in the past alejandro galvis 
ramirez said in a radio interview 
vanguardia is a member of colombias main newspaper association 
which recently condemned the drug gangs 
right now were evaluating the extent of the damage to see 
if the paper can be published galvis said on the caracol radio 
network we dont yet know if the machines are still functioning 
or even if we have electricity 
four journalists were assassinated by unidentified gunmen last 
week in the cities of medellin and monterria medellin is the base 
of the most notorious cocaine cartel 
drug traffickers claimed responsibilty for killing two of the 
journalists both from el espectador a crusader against the drug 
gangs 
the attack on vanguardia was the second major bombing of a 
newspaper since the government began a crackdown on drug 
traffickers aug 19 
a car bomb seriously damaged the el espectator offices in bogota 
last month the papers directors have said since that it is near 
bankruptcy 
journalists at the paper blamed traffickers enraged by its 
editorial campaign against them 
jose domingo caceres a vanguardia editor reached by telephone 
in bucaramanga about mondays bombing said 110130 pounds of 
dynamite were packed into a renault he said the explosion at 610 
am killed a night watchman a maintenance worker and two 
deliverymen 
col jorge ernest ferrero a police commander in the city said 
in an interview with caracol that seven people were injured 
he said the car was parked outside the modern structure housing 
vanguardia and the bombers fled in another car no arrests have 
been made 
caceres said the explosion brought down the roof of the 
threestory building and severely damaged computers printing 
equipment and administrative and editorial offices 
ferrero said 15 houses were damaged some as far away as three 
blocks and three homes facing the newspaper building were 
destroyed 
damage was estimated initially at 12 million but authorities 
said a final estimate would not be available for days 
el espectador was distributed monday in medellin under military 
protection 
in a telephone call to el espectador after the killings oct 10 
a man claiming to represent the extraditables a group linked to 
the medellin cartel said the papers remaining staff members in 
the city would be killed unless its medellin office was closed 
bruce gelb director of the us information agency said during 
a visit to the paper sunday that foreign publishers had pledged 1 
million to help el espectador 
drug traffickers killed guillermo cano then the publisher in 
1986 gelb said his visit to the paper had convinced him of the 
need for action by the international community to help the 
colombian press defend its freedom 
an association of colombian journalists the reporters club has 
reported 40 newspaper employees killed in colombia since 1977 it 
says many were victims of drug traffickers but that no precise 
breakdown is available 
barranquillas el heraldo newspaper quoted gen juan salcedo 
mora brigade commander in the city as saying drug suspect carlos 
humberto gomez zapata escaped sunday in a military uniform salcedo 
was quoted as saying cpl carlos carrillo also fled 
two national radio chains also reported the escape calls by the 
associated press to brigade headquarters in barranquilla were not 
answered 
gomez was admitted to the hospital last week for treatment of an 
appendicitis authorities notified him of pending extradition to 
the united states where he was indicted by a federal grand jury in 
miami and were preparing to move him to a bogota jail the 
newspaper el tiempo reported sunday 
he was captured sept 21 in a police raid on an apartment in the 
port city 
president virgilio barcos government has extradited four drug 
figures three men and a woman since the crackdown began gomez 
is accused in a 1984 indictment of masterminding a ring that 
shipped tons of methaqualone from west germany and austria to the

the remnants of small but deadly 
hurricane jerry blew out of texas and into louisiana and arkansas 
on monday after causing scattered damage estimated at less than 10 
million 
at least two people were killed 
the small storm grew unexpectedly from a tropical storm to a 
hurricane early sunday and roared ashore with wind gusting to 100 
mph toppling trees and power lines tearing up roofs and 
shattering windows in cars and residences 
cleanup crews began collecting downed tree limbs and debris 
monday and the city of some 62000 southeast of houston quickly was 
returning to normal 
all but one of the citys schools were open monday that school 
was closed because of a power failure 
mayor jan coggeshall said the city would not seek a disaster 
declaration from the governor 
weve had much more serious storms but for the people who did 
have damage it was very serious for them the mayor said 
initial damage estimates ranged as high as 25 million but mrs 
coggeshall said that after an aerial survey and ground inspection 
by city officials damage was put at 5 million to 825 million 
we dont think its as serious as alicia she said 
referring to the 1983 hurricane which caused hundreds of millions 
of dollars in damage 
some 75000 houston lighting amp power customers were without 
electricity at the height of the storm most power was restored 
monday 
after slamming into the island community of galveston the storm 
drove up the houston ship channel crumpling four houston lighting 
amp power transmission towers built to withstand 90 mph wind 
although customers were not affected seriously by the collapse of 
the towers traffic on the ship channel was halted by the downed 
wires and the channel likely would be closed until tuesday utility 
spokeswoman geri konigsberg said 
most galveston residents decided to stay in their homes behind 
the seawall instead of evacuating no mandatory evacuations were 
ordered although a curfew was in effect overnight to discourage 
looting 
several hundred residents who sought protection in shelters were 
allowed to return home sunday night 
the hurricane barely brushed louisiana but it stirred up enough 
waves to eat away more of the delicate coastline of grand isle 
la a barrier island and popular resort community 
grand isle mayor andy valence said wind was light and tides were 
only about 23 feet above normal but more than 4 feet of beach was 
eroded in some areas 
we had to get in touch with a couple of the camp owners to 
have them come down and perhaps shore up some of the building 
sections said valence 
at least six tornadoes accompanied the hurricane which was 
downgraded to a tropical storm at 11 pm sunday with winds at 45 
mph by 5 am monday the national weather service reduced the 
storm again to a tropical depression the tornadoes caused mostly 
roof and powerline damage 
by midday monday the storm was moving through northern 
louisiana and into arkansas with forecasters warning of 3 to 5 
inches of rain and possible tornadoes during the afternoon the 
low pressure center that once was the hurricane was moving 
northeastward out of southwestern arkansas and showers and 
thunderstorms were scattered across the lower mississippi valley 
into the lower ohio valley 
the only fatalities were a 26yearold coast guardsman and his 
2yearold daughter whose bodies were found on the rock jetties of 
galvestons protective seawall they were in a pickup that 
apparently got blown off the seawall detective sgt leo singleton 
said monday 
a third person was believed to have been in the pickup but had 
not been found police said

jan p syse who became norways prime 
minister on monday is a bright witty eloquent and capable lawyer 
who calls himself just a boy from the country 
but many easygoing norwegians view him as a bit too polished and 
urbane 
standing for the first time as party leader in an election syse 
failed to galvanize the electorate and his conservative party came 
out of the sept 11 vote with its worst showing in 20 years 
but syse patched together the three centrist nonsocialist 
parties in a coalition to replace gro harlem brundtlands labor 
government which also experienced its worst election since world 
war ii 
the contrast between the two leaders in the public mind goes 
deeper than politics 
mrs brundtland is known abroad as a stateswoman 
environmentalist and champion of womens rights in norway she is 
simply known as gro 
the new prime minister is normally referred to as syse proper 
but formal 
the 58yearold attorney usually appears controlled measured 
and reserved mrs brundtland a 50yearold physician and 
harvardeducated public health specialist has a fiery temper but 
also will openly show grief 
syse is an excellent speaker philosphical and funny he is a 
relatively moderate politician said bernt ole aardal of the 
institute for social research 
syse became chairman of norways second largest party upon the 
sudden death of rolf presthus in january 1988 when the party was 
in the midst of a structuring crisis he had little time to 
establish his leadership before the elections aardal noted 
critics call syse a tough and clever politician strong on 
lawandorder and moral issues but he is burdened with his image 
he is seen as what norwegians would call too oslo west 
meaning that hes from the wealthy part of town very high society 
and implying that he is above other people said aardal 
born on nov 25 1930 syse was in fact raised on the pastoral 
island of notteroey south of oslo he stresses his rural 
upbringing even after almost 40 years in the capital 
i really have trouble comprehending this resilient myth that 
im so urbane said syse i am a country boy from noetteroey 
but his heavyrimmed glasses flawless diction and rigid posture 
enhance the image of an intellectual an oslo newspaper joked that 
syse would wear a tie with his towel in parliaments sauna 
syses quest for a folksier image has sometimes backfired 
he invited news media to record him fishing from a trawler this 
summer and ended up with a giant hook through his finger removed 
in a highly publicized effort involving a hacksaw and pliers 
the son of a dentistlocal politician and his school principal 
wife syse was politically active early on and was elected chairman 
of the conservative students association in 1952 he earned a law 
degree from the university of oslo in 1957 
he began his career as a lawyer for a shipowner later working 
in nonpolitical upperechelon government jobs he married teacher 
else walstad in 1959 and has two sons one who also is a politician 
he trod a familiar path through party ranks and was elected to 
parliament in 1973 
political scientist gunnar vogt said syse may prove to be a 
surprisingly strong leader as demonstrated by his ability to 
stitch together a coalition from three deeply divided parties the 
conservatives the christian peoples party and the center party 
mrs brundtland became norways first woman prime minister in 
1981 and at 44 its youngest her first term lasted seven months 
she returned to power in may 1986 and gained international 
stature as head the un world commission on the environment and 
development norwegians prefer her international record to her 
domestic one 
mrs brundtland quickly set some new rules eight of the 18 
cabinet ministers were women and her labor party made it a rule 
that each sex must have at least 40 percent of all party positions 
syses 19member cabinet also has eight women

capitol police arrested 55 protesters monday 
after they blocked the entrance to a house office building 
disrupted a house session and staged demonstrations in two 
congressional offices to protest us military aid to el salvador 
about 200 demonstrators rallied outside the capitol then 
marched to the rayburn house office building carrying banners 
denouncing rightwing death squads and us aid to el salvador 
fortyfour of the demonstrators then stationed themselves in 
front of one entrance to the building and chanted 70000 dead 
no more us out of el salvador until they were surrounded by 
police and arrested 
one protestor sustained a bloody nose during the arrests but 
there were no other injuries said capitol police spokesman dan 
nichols 
at about the same time two other small groups of demonstrators 
disrupted the offices of sen christopher dodd dconn and rep 
stephen solarz dny by chanting and reading in loud voices 
four protesters were arrested in each office nichols said neither 
lawmaker was present during the protests 
and later three demonstrators began chanting in the house 
visitors gallery during a vote republican lawmakers cheered when 
capitol police dragged them from the gallery 
the protests were sponsored by the committee in solidarity with 
the people of el salvador which opposes the central american 
countrys rightist government and supports the leftist farabundo 
marti liberation front rebels 
the action coincided with the opening of talks in san jose 
costa rica aimed at arranging a ceasefire in el salvadors 
decadelong civil war 
a foreign aid bill that includes 85 million in military aid to 
el salvador is scheduled to go to a housesenate conference 
committee as early as this week 
supporters of the aid contend that it is needed to demonstrate 
us confidence in alfredo cristiani newly elected president of 
the rightist arena party opponents say conditions should be placed 
on the aid to ensure that activities of rightwing death squads are 
curtailed

members of congress who sided consistently 
against a strong clean air bill during a recent series of committee 
votes each received on average 73430 in campaign contributions 
from groups opposed to the legislation an advocacy group said 
monday 
the public interest research group which frequently supports 
environmental groups said those contributions were nearly four 
times as great as the average contributed by the same organizations 
19765 to members who voted consistently for toughening the 
proposed bill 
the environmental group said it compared a series of five key 
votes on the clean air legislation in the house health and 
environment subcommittee with campaign contributions to 
subcommittee members over the last eight years the contributions 
were from political action committees or pacs representing 
interests that have lobbied against strong clean air legislation 
the subcommittee last week unanimously approved a clean air 
bill but only after a number of close votes on amendments dealing 
with critical details of the bill the legislation has yet to be 
considered on the house floor 
according to the pirg analysis 11 members of the subcommittees 
who voted against proenvironmental positions on five amendments 
each received an average of 73430 in contributions from the pacs 
examined the nine congressmen who in each case voted in favor of 
proenvironmental positions received on average 19765 from the 
same pacs said the pirg 
among the subcommittee members those receiving the largest 
amount of money from the pacs examined were rep ralph hall 
dtexas 143000 rep john dingell dmich 134195 and rep 
jack fields rtexas 121755 
hall and fields were sponsors of prooil industry amendments to 
the clean air bill they and dingell were key in pushing through 
the subcommittee an amendment that scuttled by a 1210 vote a 
provision that would require automakers to build up to 1 million 
alternativefueled cars by 1997 
the auto and oil industries had lobbied against the 
alternativefueled cars provision 
at the same time rep henry waxman dcalif sponsor of a 
series of amendments aimed at strengthening the legislation 
received 8600 in contributions over the eight years from the same 
pacs the environmental group said 
the contributions were reported to the federal election 
commission by more than 60 pacs representing interests including 
the national automobile dealers association the big three 
automakers oil and coal companies electric utilities and the 
chemical industry

interior minister vadim bakatin told the national 
legislature monday an investigation was made into a purported 
attempt to drown maverick communist boris yeltsin and yeltsin said 
on state tv that it was all a joke 
the formal report to the supreme soviet legislature which was 
televised on national tv was the latest twist in the tale of 
yeltsin a highly popular politician who pokes fun at the soviet 
elite 
rumors that yeltsin died were rampant in moscow when he 
disappeared from public view for two weeks shortly after being 
accused in print of drinking and shopping his way through an 
american speaking tour but yeltsin reappeared on sunday and told a 
rally hed been recovering from a cold 
bakatin told the supreme soviet that yeltsin had reported to a 
policeman that he had been assaulted and thrown into the moscow 
river with a bag over his head yeltsin supposedly escaped but 
asked the policeman not to report the incident 
investigation proved this untrue bakatin said for example he 
said no one could have fallen 50 feet into 5 feet of water at the 
bridge in question without suffering injuries 
yeltsin told bakatin on sept 30 two days after the alleged 
incident that the policeman misunderstood a joke on monday he 
had to tell the supreme soviet and the entire nation 
the official tass news agency said mikhail gorbachev who 
presided over the afternoon session said the need to clear up the 
matter was caused by political speculations in connection with the 
alleged attempt 
bakatin said the report showed yeltsin told police at 1110 pm 
on sept 28 that he let his driver go two hours earlier about a 
third of a mile from his home and was walking the rest of the way 
yeltsin said that a car overtook him and unknown persons made 
him get into the car pulled a bag over his head and on reaching a 
bridge across the moscow river threw him into the water 
yeltsin said he managed to reach the bank rested to regain 
his breath and then turned to the militia however he asked the 
militia people not to let anyone know what had happened 
according to the tass account 
noting that the militia men had no right to withhold the 
report bakatin said that legal action was started to establish the 
objective circumstances behind the statement made by yeltsin as it 
referred to a criminal case involving an attempt on a persons life 
the investigation established that the circumstances contained

curious tourists scraggly anarchists screaming 
sell today jump tomorrow and a man handing out free antacid 
tablets turned the streets around the cavernous new york stock 
exchange into a spectacle monday 
inside frenzied traders sweated through hairrising price 
swings 
its just crazy said a bluejacketed exchange worker who 
identified himself only as billy stepping out for a smoke while 
the dow jones industrial average bounced around in some of the 
heaviest trading in history 
the bestknown stock barometer of 30 stocks gyrated wildly and 
finished with an 8812 point gain erasing nearly half its 
19058point drop of last friday 
the rebound helped the market avert another black monday like 
oct 19 1987 when the average tumbled a record 508 points 
the big board as the nyse is known in wall street parlance 
decided to keep its visitors gallery closed deploying its 
tanuniformed sentries at all entrances but that didnt stop 
scores of curious tourists from coming down to the exchange 
building hoping for a glimpse inside 
ive got some money in there too so that makes it more 
exciting said robert overton 21 of chapel hill nc an 
accounting major in his senior year at the university of north 
carolina he expressed optimism 
it crashed two years ago and it really didnt hurt the 
economy he said business is going to be in business no 
matter what happens today 
others werent so sanguine john egan 24 a new yorker with a 
couple of hours to kill said i feel like im watching a car 
accident 
as on previous occasions when the stock market has made big 
news protesters flocked to wall street about a dozen police 
officers some on horseback and others on motorcycles deployed 
themselves nearby

blackscarved man in a group of anarchistsquatters whove been

it crashes today tomorrow or next week isnt the question 
said one member of the group who identified himself as john squat 
its the fundamental economy were talking about 
laura januzzi a 26yearold tourist from cincinnati said 
where theres dead meat theres the flock 
perhaps the most enterprising spectator was a man wearing a

argentina and britain begin talks tuesday 
on restoring diplomatic relations broken in 1982 by a 74day war 
over the bleak windswept falkland islands that cost nearly 1000 
lives 
neither side would comment on the talks set for tuesday and 
wednesday but a joint statement issued aug 18 said both sought 
normalization of relations and the furtherance of their mutual 
interests in peace and stability in the south atlantic 
the agenda of the closed negotiations in madrid is expected to 
center on renewal of consular ties and air and sea links 
argentina is expected to seek an end to the 150mile exclusion 
zone britain has imposed around the islands which keeps argentine 
boats out of rich fishing grounds 300 miles off its coast 
spanish diplomats said argentina probably would call for a 
reductions in the 2000man military force britain has kept in the 
islands since the war the argentines invaded the falklands which 
they claim and call the malvinas on april 2 1983 
indirect relations have been handled through a british interests 
section at the swiss embassy in buenos aires and an argentine 
interests section at brazils embassy in london 
argentinas delegation to the madrid talks is led by roving 
ambassador lucio garcia del solar leading negotiations for britain 
is its un ambassador sir crispin tickell 
sovereignty over the 200island archipelago is not an issue 
because president carlos menem dropped the argentine insistence 
that its claim to the british colony be the first issue considered 
in a discussion of normal relations 
an attempt at talks in march 1984 in bern switzerland 
foundered over sovereignty 
although the argentine invasion force surrendered on june 14 
1982 no formal end to hostilities has been declared 
when the joint communique was issued aug 18 at un 
headquarters in new york garcia del solar said he felt hostilities 
ended in 1982 and no formal declaration to normalize relations was 
necessary 
most of the 1900 falklanders whose economic mainstays are 
sheepranching and fishing are descendants of british sailors 
the islands were believed sighted in 1592 by the english 
navigator john davis the british established a naval base at what 
is now saunders island in 1765 then the spanish drove them out in 
1770 
louisantoine de bougainville of france established the first 
settlement in 1764 and named it les malouines because most of his 
crewmen were from the french port of st malo spain later bought 
out the french 
argentina bases its claim on the 1494 treaty of tordesillas in 
which spain and portugal settled new world territorial disputes and 
agreed on spanish possession of the falklands to which argentina 
succeeded after independence in 1816 
a british warship regained control of the islands for britain in 
1833 without firing a shot

attorney general dick thornburgh said monday he 
will support new legislation that could admit 30000 more soviet 
jews a year to the united states than allowed by immigration quotas 
american officials said last month that 7000080000 soviets 
could enter the united states next year but they expect 300000 
applications as more citizens of all nationalities seek to leave 
the soviet union 
thornburgh the first us attorney general to visit the soviet 
union met with soviet jewish activists to calm their fears that 
new us quotas would force emigrants to go elsewhere 
under rules effective oct 1 soviet jews no longer can leave 
the country with visas for israel then apply in vienna or rome for 
refugee status in the united states 
when the new regulations were announced thousands of jews and 
armenians went to the us embassy seeking explanations and 
application forms 
jewish activist leonid d stonov 50 told thornburgh 
antisemitism was growing in the soviet union and the new rules 
should be eased 
jewish emigration is now more on the order of an evacuation 
stonov who has tried to leave for 10 years said in a meeting with 
thornburgh at the us embassy 
soviet jewish emigration has increased dramatically under 
president mikhail s gorbachev from 8000 in 1987 to 19000 last 
year and a projected 35000 in 1989 nonjewish emigration this 
year is expected to reach 15000 
thornburgh said he understood the concerns of soviet jews and 
would support proposed legislation allowing president bush to raise 
the soviet quota by 30000 a year for five years 
we have urged that the congress act so it will act 
somewhat as a safety valve for the conditions you describe 
thornburgh told the activists 
an aide said most of those getting special emigration status 
probably would be soviet jews 
thornburgh arrived sunday for a fiveday visit

president bushs plan to curb chemical weapons 
raised concerns in congress on monday and may anger other nations 
because it could affect a multilateral pact already partially 
negotiated 
the changes apparently would give the united states the right to 
continue producing chemical weapons after the treaty was signed 
and would allow the united states to maintain a portion of its 
stockpile until all nations capable of making chemical weapons sign 
the proposed treaty 
the shift is going to cause a little commotion in the 
negotiations said an administration arms control expert who 
spoke on condition of anonymity it will cause us difficulties in 
geneva where the multilateral negotiations are under way 
senate majority leader george mitchell said monday that unless 
the president clarifies his position on this issue makes a 
decision and makes it known it is likely that little progress 
will be made in geneva toward achieving the multilateral treaty 
prohibiting chemical weapons which the president ironically has 
stated is one of his highest priorities 
bush as vice president in 1984 carried a draft text to the 
geneva negotiations proposing that nations signing a chemical 
weapons ban cease producing such arms right away and destroy their 
stockpiles over a 10year period about 40 nations are taking part 
in those talks which resume in november 
on sept 25 bush proposed in a speech to the united nations 
that the united states and the soviet union cut their existing 
chemical stockpiles by 80 percent as an impetus to the geneva 
negotiations 
but bush has also signed a classified order allowing the 
pentagon to continue producing a new generation of chemical weapons 
for an unspecified period of time according to administration 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it is the unannounced and unexplained shift on the production of 
chemicals weapons that critics say will stimulate rather than curb 
chemical weapons proliferation 
although soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze immediately 
applauded bushs un speech the kremlin is concerned over the 
classified order to continue production of a new generation of 
chemical weapons said a soviet diplomat 
there is some controvery over this said the soviet diplomat 
who spoke on condition he not be further identified administration 
officials discussed the un speech with shevardnadze beforehand 
but we were not told about the continued production said the 
diplomat 
members of congress are urging the president to explain and 
reconsider his shift 
mitchell dmaine called bushs stance a major step 
backward 
timidity mixed signals inconsistent statements all of 
which is what has been coming from the administration could 
result in the loss of an historic opportunity to prevent the spread 
of chemical arsenals around the world mitchell said in a senate 
speech 
the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee rep dante 
fascell dfla said on oct 12 that he was disturbed by the 
conflicting statements that are coming out from the administration 
concerning continued chemical weapons production and a treaty 
another congressman rep jim moody dwis on the same day 
called the new stance a very serious reversal in george bushs 
historic position it is a very serious reversal in our national 
position clearly it opens the door to other countries that want 
to get in under the wire and commence production 
the change in position was pushed by pentagon officials who 
want to continue to produce a new generation of chemical weapons 
said the administration source 
the new weapons are called binary arms because they consist of 
two nonlethal substances that become deadly when mixed 
the pentagon said the adminisration official was concerned 
over delays in production of the bigeye a bomb that would 
contain the binary chemicals for delivery by airplanes 
asked to explain the pentagon position spokeswoman maj kathy 
wood read a statement that said in order to ensure that the 
small remaining stockpile that will be destroyed last under the 
comprehensive treaty is safe and effective we will continue to 
produce binary weapons of course the binary program would be 
restructured as necessary to stay within the timing and limits of 
the us chemical weapons stocks as outlined by the president 
bush in his sept 25 speech threw in another provision that 
one critic called a treaty stopper that the united states 
would not eliminate the final 2 percent of its chemical weapons 
until all nations capable of producing such arms implement the pact 
that provision means the united states would hold about 500 tons 
of its chemical weapons in reserve according to administration 
officials 
elisa d harris an analyst at the brookings institution in 
washington called bushs position a sharp change because it 
implies that those nations with chemical stockpiles would be 
allowed to keep some of them as a deterrent 
although the us government does not disclose the exact extent 
of its chemical weapons stockpile outside analysts say they figure 
is 32000 tons and administration officials said that is roughly 
accurate

the head of the biggest 
farright political party said monday there would be chaos and 
conflict if the government allows freed black nationalist leaders 
to pursue militant opposition activity 
andries treurnicht of the segregationist conservative party who 
won 31 percent of the white vote in last months parliamentary 
elections said the government had undermined its own ban on the 
african national congress guerrilla movement by freeing seven anc 
leaders unconditionally 
the seven at a news conference after their release sunday said 
they would intensify pressure on the government to legalize the 
anc lift the state of emergency and release all political 
prisoners as preconditions for talks 
antiapartheid groups said monday that 71 people remained 
detained without charge nationwide and that six of them had begun a 
hunger strike to press for their release 
treurnicht in a statement said either the government 
dispossesses us whites of our country by giving in to the anc 
ultimatum or the government disallows further demonstrations and 
rejects all radical claims which will disturb the peace destroy 
freedom and land the country in a situation of chaos and conflict 
the seven anc leaders freed along with a member of a smaller 
guerrilla group kept a low profile monday after their emotional 
news conference sunday 
walter sisulu the highestranking of the group and a close 
friend of jailed anc leader nelson mandela spent most of the day 
at his home in soweto he emerged at one point to greet several 
hundred schoolchildren gathered outside telling them they should 
work hard at school and maintain discipline in their political 
activities 
the only freed prisoners not aligned to the anc jafta masemola 
held a news conference in pretoria to convey the position of his 
organization the pan africanist congress 
he said his group unlike the anc opposed negotiations with the 
government because it doubted blacks could gain power this way he 
said antigovernment violence remained one of his groups tactics 
the ancs 28yearold campaign of sabotage and bombings has 
virtually ceased in recent months although sisulu and his 
colleagues said they still support the principle of violent 
resistance 
were not concerned about rhetoric said con botha a 
spokesman for the governing national party when asked about the 
freed prisoners remarks 
in the past the government has said it would include the anc in 
negotiations only if its leaders repudiated violence but south 
africas ambassador to britain rae killen was quoted in 
newspapers monday as telling a british radio interviewer there no 
longer were any preconditions 
the state south african broadcasting corp in a commentary 
said the ancs concept of armed struggle belongs to a past 
political era 
today the doors are open to all political leaders who are 
willing to take part in peaceful democratic action it said 
participation in the negotiation process must be comprehensive 
involving authentic leaders of constituencies across the political 
spectrum from left to right 
the prisoner releases were approved by president fw de klerk 
as part of his attempt to launch negotiations on a new constitution 
that will extend political rights to blacks he envisions an 
arrangement that protects white interests and avoids blackmajority 
rule 
the 28 million blacks now have no vote in national affairs 
which are dominated by the 5 million whites 
all but one of the eight freed prisoners served at least 25 
years in jail five including sisulu were sentenced to life 
prison terms in 1964 along with mandela for plotting 
antigovernment sabotage 
mandela 71 remains imprisoned although his release is widely 
expected within months

the state department urged the palestine 
liberation organization on monday to authorize talks with israel 
if we are ever to get the negotiating process off the ground 
at the same time spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the bush 
administration was not fazed by criticism of its strategy by 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
specifically shamir objected to having egyptian president hosni 
mubarak select the palestinians for the talks and to holding the 
session in cairo 
we are not upset we do not think it is a step backwards 
ms tutwiler said of shamirs statements to the israeli newspaper 
maariv 
she said secretary of state james a baker iii would keep 
working with foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmet 
abdelmeguid of egypt to get negotiations started 
but her criticism of the plo was clear 
if we are ever to get the process off the ground palestinians 
are going to have to find a way to respond positively ms 
tutwiler said 
the plo central council at the end of a twoday meeting in 
baghdad iraq on monday rejected bakers plan and said the plo 
alone has the right to decide who should talk to israel 
a declaration by the central council accused the bush 
administration of ignoring the plo as the sole legitimate 
representative of the palestinians it said the american 
proposals were only a version of the israeli peace plan 
robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia met last 
friday with plo officials mubarak meanwhile is acting as a 
middleman between baker and plo chairman yasser arafat 
plo approval is considered essential before any palestinians 
would negotiations with israel 
baker is working on a plan to have palestinians and israelis 
meet in cairo on shamirs proposal for an election on the west bank 
and in gaza 
the elected palestinians then would negotiate limited selfrule 
with israel to be followed after five years by negotiations for an 
overall middle east settlement 
the plo has denounced the proposal as a ploy to prevent 
establishment of a palestinian state on israeliheld territory 
on another subject ms tutwiler indirectly criticized mubarak 
for his recent meeting with col moammar gadhafi the libyan leader 
our position on libya its support for terrorism and other 
regional activities involving destabilization is well known the 
spokeswoman said we have made known to egypt our views and 
concerns 
president bush talked to mubarak about libya when the egyptian 
president was at the white house last month ms tutwiler said 
we are confident that egypt understands our position on 
libya she said

children under state care would no 
longer be shuffled from place to place at night but would have 
permanent places to stay under an agreement presented monday to a 
judge 
child advocate laureen dambra who works for the state to 
protect childrens rights said rhode islands department for 
children and their families promised to add 45 beds in foster homes 
and group programs by june 30 and to spend 1 million to add 45 
more by jan 31 1991 
us district judge raymond j pettine said he would decide 
within three days whether to accept the agreement dambra said the 
department acted in good faith and she believed it would try to 
adhere to the agreement 
the agreement would end dambras quest for a contempt citation 
against department director joseph j picano who did not meet a 
july 15 deadline to end most nighttonight placement to settle the 
child advocates 1986 lawsuit against the department 
the department now has agreed to shuffle children on a 
nighttonight basis for no more than three consecutive nights by 
nov 30 and eliminate any nighttonight placement by june 30 
except for emergencies 
the state pays foster homes and other facilities 20 per night 
per child beyond the their licensed capacity dambra said 
it was easy for them she said but the children had to 
leave every morning and fend for themselves at various day programs 
before finding out where they would sleep the next night they do 
not go to school dambra said 
theyre carrying their clothes around in trashbags and they 
are certainly not in a postion to receive counseling said 
dambra the routine wears them down to the point of hopelessness 
in many cases 
some children under 13 not allowed in the various day programs 
have been forced to stay in the departments offices during the 
day said dambra 
she estimated an average of five children per night dont know 
where they will sleep stephan h lieberman the departments 
assistant director of community resources said the caseload of 
those up to age 21 who need placement has grown 8 percent to 10 
percent yearly or about 200 children a year ranging from new 
children in the system to those kicked out of other programs 
there also has been a decrease in the number of foster homes 
dambra said 
among the alternatives are more group homes residential 
programs and apartments for older teenagers dambra said 
lieberman said the state had created 45 beds exceeding the 40 
called for in the original settlement of the 1986 lawsuit but then 
lost 21 through the closing of the overnight section of a group 
home

israels secret service used a druse 
woman to lure the syrian air force pilot who defected to israel 
last week with his sovietmade mig23 fighter jet the newspaper 
addiyar reported monday 
the oct 11 flight into northern israel caused a public uproar 
in israel over possible flaws in the air defense system along the 
border with syria 
in jerusalem the israeli army said monday a military 
investigation team concluded a faulty report and mistaken 
decisionmaking process in israels air force led to a failure in 
intercepting the flight it recommended an officer be reprimanded 
and military officials said the air force was expected to update 
its standing orders and procedures related to air infiltrations 
addiyar a conservative daily based in christian east beirut 
said in an unsourced frontpage reportthat a druse woman who was 
not identified confessed she had been recruited by israeli 
intelligence following her arrest after her boyfriend defected 
maj mohammed bassam adel 34 was on a training flight over 
southern syria when he flew into israel and landed at an airstrip 
used by cropdusting planes 
addiyar said israel was interested in gaining direct 
information from a syrian pilot on the mig23 syria is israels 
archfoe in the middle east 
after some surveillance an israeli secret service officer 
found out that a syrian druse girl was having an affair with a 
syrian pilot the paper said 
it said the woman from soweida the provincial capital of 
southern syria frequently visited druse relatives in hasbaya just 
outside an israelicontrolled security zone in south lebanon 
the officer approached the woman and recruited her to work for 
mossad giving her enough money to lure adel to defect to israel 
addiyar said 
the girl told her boyfriend that israel would provide them 
with a house and a large amount of money estimated at millions of 
dollars or new documents with which the couple could travel to the 
united states it added 
it said mossad provided adel with a special radio frequency for 
contacting israeli authorities once in the air so he could be given 
a flight plan 
after the warning adel would revert to the normal syrian air 
force frequency and continue his routine training flight for about 
20 minutes to give israel time to prepare for his arrival 
the newspaper said adel was ordered on a training flight the day 
after receiving the israeli instructions and had no time to warn 
his girlfriend 
addiyar said the girl was at home unaware of the actual 
defection preparing to leave for israel two days later via 
hasbaya to join adel 
it said syrian secret police arrested a number of people 
connected to adel including his girlfriend after the defection 
she revealed everything during interrogation addiyar said 
adel asked for political asylum in israel he said he defected 
in search of freedom and democracy 
israeli reports said adel flew for seven minutes over israeli 
territory before radar detected his plane leading to an uproar 
over what appeared to be an air defense failure 
prime minister yitzhak shamir appealed for calm and chief of 
staff lt gen dan shomron ordered an investigation 
a military command statement said monday that investigators 
recommended the colonel in charge of israels air defenses at the 
time be reprimanded for his actions following a mistaken decision 
they recommended that the air traffic controller in charge at 
the time a lieutenant colonel be notified of the faulty report 
that contributed to a mistaken decision 
a number of technical malfunctions have been identified and 
will be dealt with by the air force the statement said shomron 
told israel tv these were secondary malfunctions 
the army said shomron accepted the teams recommendations 
one question not answered was why adel spent 20 minutes on the 
ground with no security officials around after landing at megiddo 
a few minutes flight from haifa a port city of 250000

south korea and north korea reached 
tentative agreement monday to allow visits between divided families 
for only the second time since 1945 but they remained divided on 
conditions for the exchanges 
the two sides meeting at red cross talks agreed to allow 300 
people from each nation to visit their relatives dec 8 they 
failed to agree on how long the visits would last or where visitors 
would be allowed to go 
the nations also failed to agree on terms for an exchange of 
artists and entertainers as part of the family visits both sides 
agreed to meet again at panmunjom nov 8 to try to iron out details 
the tentative breakthrough came after months of stalemate in 
various talks on easing tension the agreement could collapse if 
the two sides fail to resolve the differences 
the nations divided in 1945 have only once allowed visits by 
divided families when 50 people from each side were allowed to 
visit relatives for three days before returning home in 1985 
north korea and south korea are bitter rivals that have clashed 
frequently over the years the border is sealed and more than 10 
million divided relatives on both sides are unable to have any 
contact 
both sides said in separate news conferences that they also 
tentatively decided to hold a red cross conference on the reunion 
of separated families in north koreas capital of pyongyang on dec 
15 
song youngdae chief south korean delegate and his north 
korean counterpart park young soo acknolwedged the proposed 
exchange visits and red cross meeting wouldnt take place unless 
remaining problems are solved 
neverthless song said the agreement represented some 
progress 
i think a compromise might be possible if both sides negotiate 
on the principle of mutual concession song said 
when asked about prospects for a final agreement park said 
lets wait and see until how it comes out at the next session 
song said north korea insisted on sending 300 relatives and 300 
artists and entertainers while south korea had stuck to its 
position of each side sending 300 relatives and 50 entertainers 
the two sides also disagreed on how long the visits would last 
south korea proposed relatives be permitted to visit their 
hometowns in the north but north korean delegates refused saying 
the visits must be confined to seoul and pyongyang 
park said the south korean request was unrealistic because there 
was no guarantee that visiting south koreans would still find 
relatives in their hometowns 
park said north korea wanted to send more art performers as a 
symbolic gesture on the occasion of the second exchange of 
relatives the two sides exchanged 50 artists in the 1985 visit by 
relatives 
south korea said emphasis should be on the relative exchanges 
with the performers remaining a secondary matter some south korean 
officials say north korea wants to send entertainers to perform 
communist propaganda

british designers abandoned power dressing in 
their first collections for the 1990s some returning to the wacky 
madness that made london fashions famous and others launching the 
decade in a relaxed flowing style 
after putting women in statusconscious superstructured

designers have followed milan in loosening up their styles for next 
summer 
but theres no uniform look and individuality remains the key 
fashion word in the british collections being shown through 
tuesday 
i would say its anything flows in the 1990s and 
superstructure is out said bernie ozer vicepresident of amc 
corp the giant new york buying company the structured jacket 
is out but jackets in softer varieties and shapes are a must for 
the 90s it will also be the decade of the accessory which has 
never gotten its proper due 
the big names in british fashion rifat ozbek arabella pollen 
bruce oldfield edina ronay and bellville sassoon turned out some 
beautiful clothes but the big news was in the youth market where 
there was a revival of kooky fun and sometimes offthewall 
clothes 
the street look here has always been good ozer said 
sometimes its fashionable to like it sometimes its 
unfashionable to like it its now in fashion 
bodymap did their first catwalk show in three years on the theme 
life is featuring rock stars drag queens miniskirts with 
plants and roses victorianstyle bathing suits and oneshoulder 
cycle suits 
red or deads spacebaby collection which admittedly looks at 
the future with tongue firmly in cheek was a hit with buyers 
including the us chain nordstrom and new yorks trash and 
vaudeville boutique and los angeles roppongi boutique 
it features seethrough plastics appliqued with a logo of a 
smiling spacebaby in a plastic helmet micro shorts skirts and 
jackets cheekily cut away to reveal flesh the skirts with two 
waistbands and two transparent spacebaby belts 
its just a fresh approach rather than all the powerdressing 
thats been around for years said 28yearold coowner wayne 
hemingway its bright cheerful fun and the reaction has been 
brilliant 
vivienne westwood the 48yearold godmother of british fashion 
innovation who instituted the punk cult during the 1970s and is a 
nominee for designer of the year showed her collection britain 
must go pagan monday evening though it had its wild moments

outrageous gold phallus many designs were decorated with 
rhinestone chains some draped in tiers down to the floor and 
others dangling from the calf 
pam hogg a young scottish designer who used to show with 
hyperhyper did her first solo collection another very sexy show 
with bras like belts leggings and skintight bustier tops laceup 
corsets and clinging trousers with stretch patent leather in back 
and a series of straps in front with a bikini peeping through 
much of the media and buyer attention focused on the six 
contenders for the designer of the year that is being presented 
tuesday night by princess diana 
rifat ozbek last years winner and a hot contender again this 
year abandoned his love of color for a stunning allwhite 
collection called new age nirvana which won raves from the 
critics 
his quest for purity features silky knit jogging pants softly 
wrapped skirts topped by loose and layered tunics shimmering 
sequinned offtheshoulder dresses boleros and hooded bomber 
jackets one studded with crystal rhinestones the yin yang symbol 
and the appliqued message release it 
workers for freedom the design duo of graham fraser and richard 
nott who were also nominated did linen shirts trimmed in lace 
frilled and fitted waistcoats over soft cropped silk trousers and 
anklelength chiffon skirts strewn with artificial flowers and worn 
with slinky silk tank tops 
nominee katharine hamnett did a raunchy 1950s baby doll 
collection and fellow contender joe caselyhayford chose the four 
elements earth air fire and water for his show 
the spanish gypsy inspired arabella pollen one of princess 
dianas favorite designers and another contender who showed soft 
short shirtjackets and decorative waistcoats as well as natural

the government started cutting the 
public payroll with dismissals monday and gen manuel antonio 
noriega rearranged military ranks thinned by disloyalty 
noriega who commands the panamanian defense forces and runs the 
country named close associates to several key posts over the 
weekend but many important positions including the chief of 
intelligence remained open 
col guillermo wong the former intelligence chief was among 
those arrested after an unsuccessful coup oct 3 failure to 
replace him suggested noriega may be having trouble finding enough 
trustworthy senior officers 
gustavo gonzalez the planning and economic policy minister 
told journalists monday there would be no massive firings of 
public employees but said the public payroll must be reduced 
we do not have a budget he told reporters at a luncheon 
with the bankers association we are operating on a cash flow 
basis and that flow is now about 50 per cent of what it was two 
years ago 
panamas economy has been hurt badly by us economic sanctions 
imposed after noriega was indicted on us drug trafficking and 
money laundering charges in february 1988 
noriega claims the charges and the coup attempt are part of a 
us plot to remove him and keep the panama canal which by treaty 
is to be turned over to panama at the end of 1999 
bankers association president edgardo lasso said lack of 
confidence caused by the sanctions and political instability had 
caused a serious recession he denied panama was a center for 
laundering drug money 
gonzalez said high public officials had taken salary reductions 
ranging from 20 to 30 percent and that includes gen noriega 
one public employee told journalists she and four others had 
been accused of conspiring against the state monday and fired 
government officials including noriega urged the dismissal of 
public employees who celebrated or showed disloyalty while the 
attempted coup was in process 
war laws announced by noriega after the coup include 
disloyalty among the reasons for dismissal of public employees 
the government said an international monetary fund mission was 
arriving to evaluate the countrys situation and study measures 
the government is considering to improve the economic situation 
panamas foreign debt is 38 billion and it is 12 billion 
behind in payments on interest and principal 
capt rafael gaytan for two years the director of noriegas 
personal security was named head of the special antiterrorist 
forces an elite unit said to have been blocked by us forces from 
aiding noreiga the day of the coup 
capt rafael cedeno another officer close to noriega was named 
deputy director of intelligence cedeno has worked closely with 
noriega since the early 80s 
capt rafael jurado became commander of the 2nd military zone 
near the costa rican border and col roberto armijo was named 
director of personnel replacing col julio ow young arrested in

the justice department urged the supreme court 
on monday to uphold a missouri decision barring doctors from 
shutting off a lifesupport system for a severely braindamaged 
woman 
siding with the state of missouri in the first rightdodie 
case before the high court the department argued that the parents 
of nancy cruzan 31 did not have a right to stop their daughters 
treatment without a court order 
the justice department urged the high court to uphold a 43 
decision of the missouri supreme court that barred joe and joyce 
cruzan from allowing doctors to remove a feeding tube surgically 
implanted in their daughters stomach 
ms cruzan who breathes normally and has periods of 
wakefulness is kept alive by feedings through the tube doctors 
say that ms cruzan is incapable of interacting with her 
environment and has no thoughts or emotions 
a mentally competent adult may have a right to refuse or end 
treatment but the decision to withdraw lifesupport systems cannot 
be left to guardians acting on behalf of a person unable to express 
a choice the justice department said 
there is no basis for concluding that petitioners parents 
have a due process right to halt her treatment that is somehow 
independent of petitioners own desires the department said in a 
friendofthecourt brief 
whatever may be said about the rights of a currently competent 
adult an adult who is now incompetent cannot make an informed 
decision to refuse treatment and thus cannot be said to have a 
qualified fundamental right the justice department said in its 
brief submitted by solicitor general kenneth starr 
the justice department offered an argument that was at odds with 
the american medical association and other groups which joined the 
cruzans in urging the high court to allow withdrawal of the tube 
the department said the federal government has an interest in 
the case because it operates 443 hospitals and nursing homes where 
issues about termination of treatment arise on a continuing 
basis 
reasonable minds can differ on whether courts are best suited 
to determine an incompetent patients preferences but the 
missouri court applied reasonable rules in this case the brief 
argued 
the missouri court reasonably concluded that any error should 
be made on the side of life it continued 
in so doing however the court did not take an unreasonably 
rigid approach to the evidence of petitioners wishes 
the cruzans testified that at one point their daughter told them 
she would not want to be kept alive in a permanent coma but the 
missouri court did not accept their statement as deciding the issue 
in view of the states powerful interests in protecting 
incompetent persons against abuse an ensuring that any decision 
made in the past was wellconsidered state rules of evidence and 
procedure designed to give effect to previous decisions to refuse 
treatment should be upheld as long as they are reasonably 
designed to serve an important state interest the justice 
department said 
the department has argued that this standard should also be 
applied to laws that prohibit or restrict abortion the briefs 
discussion of privacy rights mirrored the position the justice 
department has taken on the abortion issue 
the department said the court should decline petitioners 
invitation to extend the right of privacy to cover all types of 
decisions about medical treatment and procedures

soviet grandmasters artur yusupov and anatoly 
karpov agreed to a 61move draw monday in the seventh game in their 
world chess championship candidates semifinal to leave the match 
tied 3535 with one round remaining 
in the other semifinal jan timman of the netherlands took a 
timeout postponing the eighth game of his tied semifinal with jon 
speelman of england after seven games each player has scored 35 
points 
final round faceoffs in both contests are set for tuesday 
after a zigzag battle karpov emerged from a nervewracking 
time scramble a pawn behind in an endgame but in a position where 
yusupov had very few chances to win 
the winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world 
champion garri kasparov for his title in a 24game contest starting 
october 1990 the winning semifinalists will face off in the 
candidates final next march 
if either of the eightgame contests ends in a 44 tie a 
twogame minimatch will be played followed if necessary by sudden 
death tiebreakers 
a win scores one point and a draw a half 
karpov held the world title for 10 years until 1985 and had been 
widely expected to crush his opponent 
his poor performance led spanish chess commentator leontxo 
garcia to remark karpov is very close to the abyss and only the 
advantage of the white pieces can save him 
karpov and speelman will play white on tuesday 
a decisive victory in the sixth game on saturday left speelman 
with the psychological initiative 
playing white on monday yusupov failed to gain any advantage 
from the opening and began to fall dangerously short of time 
but a faulty plan from karpov starting on the 24th move let 
yusupov escape the pressure and white suddenly gained the 
initiative in the center by combining a battery of two rooks and a 
queen 
karpov sank deep into thought leaving himself three minutes to 
make 10 moves 
as yusopov exchanged down to reach an ending with an extra pawn 
karpovs nerves began to show 
but after reaching the time control karpov had few problems in 
achieving a draw 
yusupov played on for a further 20 moves but finally gave up 
and offered a draw after playing his 61st move

poland on monday weathered a test of its 
resolve to endure painful economic reform as parliament approved 
curbs on automatic wage increases without special provisions for 
food price rises 
it was the second day of parliamentary debate on a plan to 
modify the system of pegging wage raises to price increases the 
system was devised during roundtable talks last spring between 
communist authorities and the thenopposition to offset the worst 
effects of the shift to a market economy 
the solidarityled government said some limit was needed to 
reign in rocketing inflation it estimated that the special 
provision for covering food prices would cost more than 833 
million 
the national bank meanwhile devalued the zloty monday for the 
12th time this year from the previous rate of 1791 zlotys to the 
dollar to 2100 zlotys to the dollar or 172 percent as efforts 
to align the official rate and a higher commercial rate continued 
parliament endorsed the limited indexation plan by a lukewarm 
vote of 188 in favor 27 against and 133 abstaining 
members of the democratic party one of the two minor parties 
that shifted from the communist bloc to form a majority coalition 
with solidarity abstained 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz told state tv he was 
satisfied 
however incomes will still grow at a high rate he said 
next year we will have to take more decisive steps to slow the 
inflationary growth of incomes 
since food price controls were lifted on aug 1 the last act of 
the communistled government prices of items such as butter have 
increased 1000 percent and meat prices have gone up sevenfold 
but the east blocs first noncommunist government is faced with 
reducing a huge budget defict and curbing raging inflation that 
accelerated in august to a 600 percent annual rate 
full compensation of food price increases until the end of the 
year would surely make societys situation easier from the 
point of view of the budget however the situation is serious 
said labor minister jacek kuron the veteran solidarity activist in 
charge of indexation 
experts say the 1989 budget deficit could could total 53 
billion without radical controls 
prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis cabinet studied such 
measures during weekend meetings a 15month moratorium on 
starting major new governmentfunded projects a massive shift of 
military food medicine and industrial capacity to the civilian 
side and ending subsidies to some mines and food enterprises 
but the government said the most important step was revising 
indexation rules 
the initial plan raised all wages by 80 percent of the increase 
of the cost of living from july to december regardless of raises 
already received 
the government revision provides for raises covering 100 percent 
of the price increases less raises already awarded retroactively 
for the third quarter of the year and covering 80 percent of the 
increase for the last three months 
because most workers have received substantial raises as 
managers struggled to keep up with inflation the revised proposal 
means a much more modest indexation program overall 
the higher cost alternative proposed by some solidarity union 
representatives would have compensated 100 percent of the increase 
in food prices a popular idea among priceshocked poles 
sejm deputy jan krol of the solidarity delegation told 
parliament it must be understood that the transition to a market 
economy will result in some people having higher incomes than 
others and that the costs of reform cannot be spread evenly 
the safeguarding of minimal living standards means that nobody 
in poland as a result of reforms should suffer hunger he 
said 
however a reimbursement of the cost of living as a result of 
indexation at 100 percent is out of the question and the 
society should not be presented with such illusions he said

president bush signed an order monday night 
cutting federal programs by 161 billion after giving up hopes for 
a lastminute compromise with congress 
its the law were ready to implement it said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater he said that while the 
administration had sought to avoid the almost acrosstheboard cuts 
triggered by the nations grammrudman budgetcutting law it 
might even be good if the budget ax does fall 
the order bush signed shortly before 7 pm to take effect at 
midnight was largely procedural as the spending cuts were 
automatic under the law 
well continue to work with the congress in seeking to 
develop a compromise to reduce the deficit to roll back the 
spending cuts fitzwater said but there is some feeling here 
that the automatic cuts are the way to go it will reduce 
spending in a very effective fashion 
everyones going to have to take in their belts he 
addedit will have a hit theres no doubt about it 
earlier budget director richard darman said we are doing what 
the law requires 
the cutbacks are required under the grammrudman law because of 
the failure of congress and the white house to agree on a 
deficitreduction package 
the only hope for averting the cuts had been for the house and 
senate to agree to a compromise budgetcutting bill and send it to 
bush for his signature by midnight 
such quick work was made virtually impossible by the situation 
on capitol hill the house version of the measure was studded with 
dozens of controversial provisions ranging from bushs cherished 
capital gains tax cut to an expansion of child care services and 
many lawmakers were out of town 
fitzwater said bushs order would appear in tuesdays federal 
register specifying the acrosstheboard cuts in most federal 
programs outside of social security and other entitlements 
house leaders met during the day to see if there was any way to 
accomplish a lightningfast completion of a budgetcutting bill 
acceptable to the white house by midnight but this came to nought 
and the house recessed for the evening 
they said a more attainable goal was for house and senate 
leaders to complete a deficitreduction measure in days or weeks 
were going to try to reach agreement with the senate and 
avoid sequester as a permanent matter said house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash using the formal name for the grammrudman cuts 
lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back 
the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficitcutting 
bill 
imposition of the cuts as occurred in 1986 and 1987 remaining 
in place the first year being rolled back the second is 
nonetheless a political embarrassment to members of both political 
parties adding to a public perception of a congress congenitally 
unable to do its budget work properly 
the practical effects for the first several weeks are expected 
to be nil however because agencies can juggle their funds to make 
up for spot shortfalls 
darman in a move apparently aimed at increasing pressure on 
congress to finish the deficitreduction bill quickly said monday 
that the cuts would be imposed at a more detailed level than in 
1987 he said the effect would be to give bureaucrats less 
flexibility and accelerate the time in which the cutbacks would be 
felt 
it has a little more discipline to it darman said of the 
new method of applying the cuts 
darman said administration officials want congress to send bush 
the streamlined 14 billion deficitcutting measure the senate 
approved late friday then he said the administration and gop 
lawmakers would work for congressional approval of a capital gains 
tax cut on a separate bill 
if the house and senate try instead to reach middle ground on 
their deficitreduction bills he said were going to insist on 
preserving capital gains in the final measure 
darman reiterated his preference for keeping the grammrudman 
cuts permanent 
house leaders said their bill would reduce the deficit by 11 
billion but darman said it contains just 28 billion in true 
savings it also includes a broadening of child care programs and 
other provisions the administration opposes 
its not necessarily all that bad to go with the real 
automatic cuts he said 
the cuts are triggered because the projected budget deficit for 
fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 is 1161 billion the 
grammrudman law requires the reductions if the projected deficit 
exceeds the 100 billion target by more than 10 billion 
the cuts are applied evenly between defense and nondefense 
programs 805 billion to each 
that translates to a 43 percent cut in defense programs and 53 
percent in domestic spending large amounts of spending are exempt 
from the reductions including social security many benefit

the bush administration on monday repeated 
that it would not oppose including the khmer rouge in a cambodian 
coalition government as a means of ending the civil war in that 
country 
the us position remained that the khmer rouge the communist 
force that slaughtered thousands of their compatriots while in 
power in the 1970s should have no more than a minimal role in any 
new government in cambodia 
state department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the us position had changed little since a multilateral 
conference in july failed to find a solution to the cambodian civil 
war 
administration officials have met representatives of china and 
the soviet union to discuss the formation of a coalition cambodian 
government to replace the hun sen regime currently in power state 
department spokesman margaret tutwiler told a briefing 
hun sen installed after the vietnamese invasion that drove the 
khmer rouge from power in 1978 remains in charge despite the 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops and he has refused proposals for a 
coalition government 
secretary of state james a baker iii discussed the issue with 
his soviet counterpart eduard a shevardnadze at their meeting in 
wyoming last month but neither tutwiler nor other state department 
officials would discuss the behindthescenes negotiations 
tutwiler told reporters that we have made clear that our 
ability to support any cambodian government is directly and 
inversely related to the degree of khmer rouge participation if 
any in it 
tutwilers statement differed only slightly from the position 
enunciated before congress earlier this month by david f 
lambertson deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs 
unfortunately absent a viable political process the 
cambodian factions are likely to turn increasingly to military 
means to resolve their conflict a result most likely to benefit 
the khmer rouge lambertson told the senate foreign relations 
committee on oct 2 
the united states remains unalterably opposed to a return to 
dominance of this abhorrent group which left a legacy of brutality 
and depravity from its reign of terror in the 1970s he said 
a durable settlement in this conflict must be constructed to 
ensure that the khmer rouge can never regain control and subject 
the cambodian people once again to the horrors of the past he 
said

hong kongs british governor said monday that 
china must assure the city that both political liberty and economic 
freedom will continue after the 1997 chinese takeover if it wants 
to reap the financial rewards 
a crucial time in the transition is next spring when the beijing 
government will publish the basic law or constitution for hong 
kong said sir david wilson 
the 1984 britishchinese agreement provides one country two 
systems for at least 50 years after 1997 and this must include 
a different political system as well as economic system he said 
i hope the chinese draftees of the basic law will pay full 
attention to this he added because it is tremendously 
important not only for post1997 but for the pre1997 vision 
people will have of their future in hong kong he added 
i believe it enormously important that china not dampen hong 
kongers confidence in the future wilson said at a luncheon at the 
national press club 
the basic law is a chinese document and what the draftees 
will finally put into it i dont know he said 
but hong kong can continue benefitting china only if the full 
play of capitalism and all the political freedoms that go with it 
continue after 1997 he said the benefits flow from the fact 
that china is quintessentially a capitalist society he said 
providing china a source of foreign exchange a bridge to western 
technology and a window on the west 
there is no use pretending wilson said the crackdown last 
june on democracy in china shook confidence in the future for 
hong kong hong kongers now require assurances about the future to 
encourage them to stay there 
the british government has declared it will not allow unlimited 
migration to britain of its millions of hong kong subjects 
emigration from hong kong to all countries was running at 20000 
a year from 198186 and this year 42000 departures are expected 
wilson said 
wilson is on a quick visit to washington los angeles and san 
francisco to generate continued confidence in hong kong and its 
economy on the part of officials and business people in the united 
states hong kongs major export market and investment source

top state officials and the american civil 
liberties union said they made headway monday toward settling a 
lawsuit the state attorney general fears will be used by the us 
supreme court to restrict abortions 
it was the first facetoface meeting of the major figures in a 
physicians lawsuit challenging state regulations for abortion 
clinics since the supreme court agreed in july to consider dr 
richard ragsdales lawsuit 
attorney general neil hartigan state public health chief dr 
bernard turnock and aclu attorney colleen connell agreed to meet 
again next week to discuss the case 
neither hartigan and turnock who are named as defendants in the 
lawsuit by dr richard ragsdale of rockford nor connell who 
represents the physician would elaborate on mondays meeting or 
identify any obstacles to a settlement 
clinics that perform abortions contend the regulations are 
unncecessary for patient safety ragsdale of rockford operates an 
abortion clinic 
in march 1988 the 7th us circuit court of appeals struck down 
the regulations agreeing with a trial judge who said they would 
force abortion clinics to become the functional equivalent of 
small hospitals 
the states appeal is one of three cases abortionrights 
activists fear the supreme court will use to severely limit 
abortions antiabortion activists fighting to overturn roe vs 
wade the 1973 case that legalized abortion wanted the high court 
to consider the illinois case 
the supreme court is scheduled to take up the case in december 
hartigan who is prochoice said monday that he opposes the 
idea of illinois being used as a football for a much broader 
decision hartigan a democrat who has announced he will run for 
governor next year said his defense of the abortion clinic rules 
should not be viewed as an attempt to overturn roe vs wade 
because that is not our intent 
hartigan indicated the settlement talks are aimed at preventing 
the supreme court from using the ragsdale case to overturn roe vs 
wade 
i dont think theres any question that in fact this case 
might be used for something else he told reporters 
at issue are state requirements for nonhospital surgical 
centers ragsdale contends the requirements are medically 
unnecessary and designed to discourage abortion providers by 
forcing them to build the equivalent of a small hospital an 
expensive proposition 
requirements include 80squarefoot examining rooms 
250squarefoot surgical rooms some corridor widths of 8 feet 
lounges lockers and separate toilets for male and female 
employees and a janitors closet adjoining surgical suites 
in 1985 us district judge a nordberg certified the lawsuit 
as a class action thus suspending enforcement of the challenged 
provisions for all illinois doctors

the space shuttle atlantis freed 
from technical and legal barriers was declared ready for a tuesday 
launch with its nuclearpowered cargo nasa said it expected 
neither weather nor demonstrators to interfere 
the vehicle is in good shape the crew is ready to go fly and 
the weather looks like well have a good chance to get airborne 
nasa administrator richard h truly said monday its been a long 
haul for this mission 
the launch from the seaside pad at the kennedy space center is 
scheduled for 1257 pm edt 
environmental activists concerned that an accident could spread 
nuclear poison into the atmosphere demonstrated at a gate leading 
to the kennedy space center headquarters and eight were arrested 
this is just only the beginning of the governments plan to 
use nuclear power and weapons in space including in the star wars 
program said jane brown of the florida coalition for peace and 
justice 
the coalition is one of three groups that lost a suit to stop 
the launch in us district court last week a threejudge panel of 
the us court of appeals in washington upheld the judge monday 
saying his ruling was not appealable 
the protesters vowed to infiltrate a 30by10mile security zone 
and stop the launch nasa had 200 armed security guards in the area 
and there were sea and airborne patrols 
the space center security chief said perhaps the best protection 
is the natural barrier surrounding the launch pad 
we have about 7000 alligators there i dont know how many 
rattlesnakes a lot of wild hogs and probably millions of 
mosquitoes gary wistrand said 
galileo weighing 6700 pounds will be released from atlantiss 
cargo bay 6 hours after the ship is in orbit the start of a 
sixyear 24 billionmile journey to jupiter the largest planet 
in the solar system 
electricity to run the space probe will come from two nuclear 
power packs each loaded with 247 pounds of plutonium238 nasa 
has used such radioactive fuel on 22 previous flights three have 
been involved in accidents but no plutonium was released 
the space agency said in court last week that detailed studies 
show the chances of release of radioactive material are 
statistically low and that the environmentalists fears are 
unwarranted 
a large team of experts will be scattered around the center with 
detection devices to sample the air in case there is an accident as 
the shuttle lifts off the department of energy will have an 
airplane aloft and another 150 people standing by said agency 
spokesman chris west 
the mission was originally planned to begin in 1982 but was 
delayed first by money troubles and then by the explosion of the 
space shuttle challenger the cost of the project to date is 15 
billion nasa said 
galileos been a long time in coming and its delightful to 
sit here and be ready to fly said lennard fisk nasas chief 
scientist these are very exciting times for space science in 
general magellan is on its way to venus voyager is on its way to 
interstellar space having gone by neptune galileo is sitting on 
the pad and there is even more to come 
astronaut donald williams is the commander of the crew of five 
the others are mike mcculley the pilot and mission specialists 
shannon lucid ellen baker and franklin changdiaz 
their liftoff was scheduled for last thursday but one of the 
shuttles engine computers malfunctioned and had to be replaced 
the countdown for tuesdays launch began at 1201 am monday 
in december 1995 a 737pound probe is to be released from 
galileo and plunge into jupiters cloud layers to take the first 
samples of the jovian atmosphere 
the main galileo craft will enter an orbit around the planet 
and its cameras and 10 scientific instruments will gather 
information on temperatures magnetic fields radiation cloud 
characteristics and gravity 
galileo also will study jupiter for clues to the formation of 
the solar system many scientists believe the planet still holds 
much of the material in its original state from which the sun and 
planets formed 46 billion years ago 
planners say the crafts examination of jupiter will be the most 
scientifically rich interplanetary mission yet the pictures it 
relays will be up to 1000 times sharper than those obtained by the 
voyager spacecrafts 
it is indeed a correct statement to make said fisk that 
this is the second golden age of space science for the united 
states

militant israelis tried to lay a cornerstone 
for a new jewish temple in jerusalems old city on monday sparking 
a riot by palestinians that injured at least 20 people 
police barred the jewish group from bringing the threeton 
cornerstone within the ancient citys walls foiling an effort by 
the temple mount faithful movement to take a first step toward 
rebuilding the temple destroyed in 70 ad by the romans 
high school students in arab east jerusalem apparently enraged 
at reports of the planned ceremony threw rocks at police and 
paramilitary border police 
fifteen palestinian students and five policemen were reported 
hurt in the melee one of the most violent incidents in jerusalem 
during the 22monthold palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
at least 40 students were arrested police said 
in the occupied gaza strip jewish settlers dedicated a new 
settlement on the ruins of kefar darom a kibbutz overrun by the 
egyptian army in 1948 
the new kefar darom is one of the eight new settlements approved 
for construction this year it joins 132 others already set up in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
near jericho israeli soldiers prevented another group of 
settlers from establishing still another settlement because they 
failed to get permission israel radio said 
meanwhile an 8yearold palestinian boy died monday three days 
after he was shot by israeli troops during a demonstration in the 
occupied gaza strip he was identified by the army as qassem 
abdallah abu lubda of the khan yunis refugee camp 
abu lubdas death raised to 596 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising began in 
december 1987 at least 130 palestinians have been killed by fellow 
arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with israel forty 
israelis have died in the violence 
also monday the national news agency itim said the attorney 
general ruled that an israeli colonel reprimanded for ordering his 
troops to break the limbs of palestinian rioters will not be tried 
in a civilian court 
the official made the decision following an appeal by human 
rights groups to try the officer the attorney general said the 
reprimand was sufficient and that the officer would be allowed to 
remain in the army until he retires in three years itim reported 
about 100 followers of the temple mount faithful group had 
planned to place the threeton stone at the foot of a ramp leading 
to the temple mount two of islams holiest shrines the al aqsa 
and dome of the rock mosques sit atop the 35acre mount 
but police blocked the metallic gray truck carrying the 
cornerstone from entering the old city they also prevented the 
group from going up to the temple mount area 
gershon salomon the 53yearold leader of the group sat 
crosslegged at the foot of the ramp he sang israeli folk songs 
and promised to return daily until the cornerstone was allowed 
inside the old city 
they will throw stones and we will put up cornerstones here 
on the temple mount salomon said he vowed to place a second 
stone for the new temple during the jewish holiday of hanukkah in 
december 
the demonstrators were largely ignored by thousands of israelis 
and tourists making the traditional pilgrimage to the western wall 
the sole remnant of the second temple during the eightday jewish 
sukkot holiday

christian legislators from lebanon 
pushed monday for a quicker withdrawal of syrian troops than arab 
mediators have proposed sources said at a peace conference in this 
city 
they demanded written guarantees that syria withdraw its 40000 
troops from lebanon altogether after an initial pullback from the 
capital to the eastern bekaa valley the sources said on condition 
of anonymity 
the lawmakers also said the first withdrawal should be made 
faster than the two years proposed by arab mediators the sources 
reported 
in beirut christian leader gen michel aoun said the 63 members 
of lebanons parliament gathered in taif a saudi resort must not 
weaken their demand for the withdrawal of the occupation army 
the christian deputies position was contained in a memorandum 
handed to saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal he relayed 
its contents to king fahd 
the saudi monarch late monday chaired a cabinet meeting to 
discuss the document but few details were released afterwards 
saudi arabia is hosting the conference that began sept 30 in an 
effort to end lebanons 14yearold civil war and the latest round 
of violence between syrian and allied moslem fighters and christian 
forces 
syria sent troops to lebanon in 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate however aoun says the syrians have violated 
that mandate by siding with the moslems 
the syrian pullout is being debated as part of a peace plan that 
would give more power to lebanons moslems

the lower house unanimously approved 
a bill late monday allowing filipinos to vote whether to allow the 
united states to keep its military bases in this country 
the move was seen as an effort to counter opposition to the 
bases in the philippines senate however the upper chamber of 
congress must now vote on the referendum bill which a majority of 
senators opposes 
us and filipino negotiators began talks in manila in december 
on extending the lease on clark air base the subic bay naval base 
and four smaller installations after the current agreement expires 
in september 1991 
any agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 23member 
senate twelve senators say they oppose any extension most 
surveys however show a majority of filipinos support the bases 
in its unanimous decision monday the 199member house of 
representatives approved a proposal by deputy speaker antonio 
cuenco for a national referendum within 60 days of completion of 
talks on a new bases agreement 
under the house bill results of the referendum would be 
nonbinding but political analysts say a strong vote in favor of 
the bases would put political pressure on the senate to approve an 
extension 
the best way to give the people the opportunity to participate 
in the resolution of the issue is to submit the same in a 
referendum to clearly reflect the choice and thus guide the 
government in its decision on the matter cuenco said in his 
proposal 
on friday president corazon aquino told abctvs good 
morning america that the public should be consulted before the 
senate decides the issue 
us officials say the bases contribute about 1 billion a year 
to the philippine economy through salaries to local workers 
purchases from local suppliers and spending by 40000 troops 
military dependents and civilian employees 
however opponents of the bases have been riding a wave of 
antiamericanism

the armed forces chief monday 
denied a published report that he sold military equipment donated 
by the united states and deposited the income in an account he 
controlled 
those press reports are totally false gen humberto 
regalado hernandez told the associated press by telephone 
apparently it is a crude and vulgar press campaign against the 
armed forces 
he called a meeting of the armed forces general staff to 
analyze the serious accusations presented by the new york times 
which damage me personally and also all our armed institution 
the times citing highranking honduran officers who want to see 
the general replaced reported sunday that regalado had sold 
donated us military equipment to the honduran military and 
deposited the proceeds in a special account he controlled 
the newspaper said many of the officers who spoke on condition 
of anonymity were among regalados most loyal supporters until 
they discovered the arms deals 
the times said honduras has asked the us defense department to 
investigate corruption complaints against regalado because of a 
possible congressional cutoff of military aid to the country 
its a wild tale against me regalado said i dont 
control one cent of those funds i live from my salary and i am 
not rich 
his official salary is believed to be about 5000 a month 
regalado 50 has been chief of the armed forces since january 
1987 
the united states began increasing military aid to honduras 
after the leftist sandinistas came to power in nicaragua military 
aid for 1989 was 411 million and 613 million is planned for

plo officials rejected the middle east 
peace plan of secretary of state james a baker iii on monday 
because it excludes their organization 
diplomats in baghdad said the palestine liberation organization 
position also represented a rejection of a peace plan put forth by 
president hosni mubarak of egypt 
in a final declaration after two days of meetings the plo 
central council said only the plo had the right to decide what 
palestinians should talk to israel 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
urged the plo to authorize talks with israel if we are ever to 
get the negotiating process off the ground 
bakers plan does not mention the plo and prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of israel has rejected plo participation in talks about 
elections in the israelioccupied territories israel views the plo 
as a terrorist group 
ms tutwiler said the bush administration was not fazed by 
shamirs criticism of its strategy she said baker would keep 
working with foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmet 
abdelmeguid of egypt to get negotiations started 
the plo and the plo alone has the right to name the 
palestinian side to any talks with israel whether they be 
palestinians inside the occupied territories or outside the plo 
central council declaration said monday 
the council acts as an intermediary between the policymaking 
palestine national council and the plo executive committee 
its declaration accused washington of ignoring the plo as the 
sole legitimate representative of the palestinians and said the 
american proposals were only a version of the israeli plan 
it said palestinianisraeli peace talks proposed recently by the 
united states and egypt could only be preliminary leading to an 
international peace conference under un auspices 
sheik abdelhamid sayeh chairman of the palestine national 
council said there has been a clearcut and overwhelming 
opposition to the new american move by all participants in the 
meetings 
the 80seat central council convened to unify positions on us 
israeli and egyptian peace proposals 
sayeh stopped short of specifically criticizing mubaraks plan 
which also did not mention the plo 
the general consensus is that the baker proposals are a new 
formula to sell the shamir plan he said 
shamir proposed in may that elections be held in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip to allow palestinians to choose their own 
representatives under a plan for limited selfrule he ruled out an 
israeli withdrawal and recognition of a palestinian state 
mubarak proposed a modified 10point election plan under which 
israel would accept the idea of trading land for peace and hold 
direct talks with the palestinians which he proposed be held in 
cairo 
baker later invited the foreign ministers of egypt and israel to 
preliminary talks in washington 
on monday the central council said the plo would reject all 
plans other than its own which it urged arabs to accept 
arab diplomatic sources said the reference to arab countries was 
meant as a rejection of the mubarak plan although the declaration 
did not mention it 
yasser abedrabbo of the plo executive committee the main 
negotiator in a plous dialogue initiated in december has said 
the plo accepts the concept of facetoface negotiations with 
israel provided it is allowed to choose the delegates 
radical palestinian leaders george habash and nayef hawatmeh had 
pushed for outright condemnation of the egyptian and us plans

the white house late monday abandoned a 
lastditch effort to reach a compromise with congress on expanding 
federally financed abortions to cover cases of rape and incest 
a veto of the provision which has already passed the house 
appeared inevitable 
its our judgement at this time that no one has been able to 
provide a convincing reason for the president to change his 
position opposing such funds presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said so the president will not change his position 
the white house and congressional conservatives had searched for 
a formula for compromise monday in hopes of defusing the 
politically charged debate 
on friday president bush said he was seeking room for 
flexibility 
im not looking for any conflict over this bush said last 
week im not going to change my position any but lets see how 
those negotiations come out 
the administration was looking for what one white house 
official insisting on anonymity called legislative wizardry or 
gimmickery that would have allowed bush to avoid a veto of the 
provision 
but abortionrights leaders stood firm in their unwillingness to 
yield and congressional democratic leaders held out little hope 
for a compromise that would ease the pressure building on bush 
i would think it is difficult to find a path to compromise on 
this house speaker tom foley said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine asked if there 
was a compromise brewing said i know of none 
white house chief of staff john sununu met monday with 
republican antiaborton leaders in congress reps vin weber 
rminn christopher smith rnj and henry hyde rill just 
as he did on friday 
we have made every effort and have decided basically there 
is not any possibility to find common ground fitzwater said 
i dont think really there was ever much opportunity to get 
close he added 
fitzwater said senior advisers to the president have 
recommended a veto 
although the sununu talks were private congressional sources 
said they were aimed at finding a way for bush to avoid vetoing the 
new abortion provisions or failing that to provide compromise 
language that bush could propose after using his veto that would 
soften its political impact 
fitzwater said talks included a proposal that bush sign the 
legislation while announcing government regulations requiring 
stricter reporting requirements those requirements would be aimed 
at preventing women from later claiming they had been victims of 
rape or incest merely as a way of obtaining a federally paid 
abortion 
the debate concerned the appropriations bill for the labor and 
health and human services departments that includes provisions 
dropping a decadelong ban on abortions for poor women in cases of 
rape or incest currently medicaid abortions are permitted only in 
cases where the mothers life is endangered by her pregnancy 
the house surprised antiabortion leaders last week by approving 
the provision which had been passed by the senate earlier 
some attempts at compromise centered on defining the time limit 
required for reporting rape or incest by the victims seeking an 
abortion the bill only says the victim must promptly report 
the rape or incest to authorities 
abortion rights leaders flatly rejected a gop proposal to set a 
48hour time limit congressional sources said other proposals were 
being circulated setting a time limit of 60 days on reporting 
incest and 72 hours on reporting rape 
bush had threatened to veto the proposal before the house vote 
but the houses vote is being viewed as part of a changing 
political climate in favor of abortion rights and prochoice 
leaders said a veto by bush would produce a political backlash 
against himself and congressional republicans 
if he vetos it it hurts him said sen robert packwood 
rore a supporter of abortion rights it hurts our party it 
hurts our candidates 
packwood said the veto coming now could prove particularly 
damaging for the republican candidates for governor in virginia and 
new jersey the two states with races this fall in which abortion 
has been successfully used by prochoice democrats against 
antiabortion republicans 
the bill next goes to the senate for agreement on a separate 
provision 
gary bauer president of the conservative family research 
council and a former policy adviser in the reagan administration 
predicted that following a veto conservatives would attempt to 
work out something that wouldnt give the righttolife people 
heartburn and at the same time allow the prochoice groups to claim 
some progress 
fitzwater meanwhile said bushs position on the bill is 
consistent although it has changed somewhat since he first ran for 
president in 1980 
bush he said opposes abortion except in the cases of rape 
incest or when the pregnancy endangers the mothers life but he 
supports federal financing of abortion only in cases where the 
mothers life is in danger 
asked why bush makes a distinction fitzwater said he was 
concerned that women would use rape or incest as a pretext to get 
federally financed abortions and therefore you have no 
restrictions at all thats why the president has a federal 
funding position thats somewhat different than his moral belief

a red cross team arrived monday to 
help trace missing people and provide humanitarian aid on this 
island nation where 13 more deaths from a sinhalese uprising were 
reported 
the red cross team came from switzerland after an invitation 
last week from president ranasinghe premadasa 
he invited the team following charges by opposition politicians 
that progovernment death squads were killing sympathizers of an 
underground group trying to overthrow the government 
the government has denied the charge it blames the peoples 
liberation front the ultranationalist sinhalese group that 
advocates overthrowing the government for most of the 5000 
killings the past two years 
human rights activists and opposition politicians welcomed 
premadasas invitation to the red cross but some said they feared 
it was prompted by economic concerns noting that major western aid 
donors are to meet in paris this week to consider sri lankas 750 
million request for foreign help 
members of the fourmember red cross team from geneva refused to 
speak to reporters their duties are expected to include visiting 
detention centers 
also monday the government said its troops shot and killed two 
sinhalese extremists who tried to escape arrest in matara 85 miles 
southeast of colombo 
other killings reported the previous 24 hours included two 
sinhalese youths whose bodies were found in kandy 55 miles east of 
colombo 
nine sinhalese civilians died in three separate attacks by 
sinhalese extremists in southern and central sri lanka a 
government communique said 
it also said two sinhalese buddhist monks had been abducted by 
unknown gunmen 
the peoples liberation front has accused the 
sinhalesedominated government of giving too many concessions to 
members of the tamil minority whose own ethnic war has claimed 
11000 lives since the tamil separatist insurrection began in 1983 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists make up 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people tamils who are mostly hindus comprise 
18 percent

jay ward the creator of such wacky 
witty cartoon characters as bullwinkle and rocky the flying 
squirrel was remembered monday as a man who just wanted to have 
fun 
the guiding force of jays life was the fun principle said 
bill hurtz a senior director at jay ward productions since the 
1950s if it wasnt fun to do he wouldnt do it 
hurtz was one of seven people who spoke at wards noontime 
memorial service at forest lawn memorial park about 10 miles north 
of downtown los angeles 
ward the creator of such hugely popular television cartoon 
stars as rocket j squirrel aka rocky bullwinkle moose crusader 
rabbit and dudley doright died thursday of kidney cancer he was 
69 
my memories are tripping the light fantastic said june 
foray the voice of rocky as she recalled the good times working 
with ward 
she told how ward once turned the grand ballroom of new york 
citys plaza hotel into a park complete with grass ants 
pickpockets and fortune tellers for a picnic 
ward a huge man with a walrus mustache who was intensely shy 
away from friends never set out to be a television cartoon creator 
instead he opened a real estate office in his hometown of 
berkeley after earning a masters degree from harvard business 
school 
but a truck careened into the office on his first day and broke 
both wards legs 
during his convalescence he and alex anderson created crusader 
rabbit who in 1949 became the star of the first cartoon show made 
expressly for television 
a decade later ward and his late partner bill scott brought 
rocky and bullwinkle to the small screen in shows that quickly 
became adored by both adults and children 
rocky and his friends ran on abc from 1959 through 1961 and 
the bullwinkle show believed to be the first primetime 
cartoon show for network television was carried by nbc for several 
years before going into syndication 
the puns came fast and furious on both shows as dimwitted hero 
dudley doright somehow always managed to rescue little nell and 
bumbling spies boris badanov and natasha fatale set out week after 
to week to get moose and squirrel 
throughout it all friends recalled monday ward carried forth 
his philosophy of fun 
it wasnt what he produced but how he lived that made jay 
special bringing joy to peoples lives said childhood friend

delegates from 91 nations agreed on 
monday to place african elephants on the endangered list and halt 
trade in ivory but five african nations immediately declared they 
would keep selling ivory anyway 
the lastminute proposal which passed 7611 with 4 abstentions 
allowed southern african nations to apply for exemptions to a 
special panel of experts 
the vote came at a meeting of the convention on trade in 
endangered species or cites and drew a loud cheer from 
environmentalists and delegates pushing for a ban 
the conference also is discussing 300 endangered plants and 
animals in its biennial session although the focus was on 
elephants 
the measure agreed to on monday must be confirmed in a full 
session before the 10day gathering ends friday but delegates 
called that a formality 
it amounts to at least a twoyear ban because no exemptions are 
likely to be considered before the next cites meeting 
we think this was a good compromise a place to work from 
said conny harriman head of the us delegation that championed 
east africas bid for a total ban 
i think its great said john grandy of the humane society 
of the united states 
costa mlay tanzanias director of wildlife said east africans 
were satisfied this is the best we could do now we must try to 
work together 
shirley macgreal of the international primate protection 
league based in summerville nc raised her fist in victory when 
asked for her reaction this is wonderful she said 
but rowan martin director of research for zimbabwes wildlife 
department was bitter 
this is a great pyrrhic he said they forced seven 
countries who seemed to be doing well at conservation out of the 
convention 
under cites rules members can declare reservations within 90 
days allowing them to trade with any other cites states declaring 
exemptions or with noncites members 
zimbabwe malawi mozambique botswana and burundi whose lands 
contain about onetenth of the african elephant herd said they 
would file for exemptions 
japan which has regularly consumed about 40 percent of world 
ivory exports declined comment our attitude will be determined 
in tokyo acting delegation head kiyohiko arafuni told reporters 
ivory is highly valued for its use in the signature stamps 
popular in many asian nations and for jewelry piano keys and 
carvings 
martin said southern africans would have no trouble finding 
markets even without japan 
thats the crazy part he said there are 67 nonparties 
to the convention think of all those arab states that would be 
happy to take over all that trade 
he blamed the vote on american activists describing them as 
fat little puppies from urban environments who dont know a thing 
about african reality 
environmentalists reactions ranged from guarded optimism to 
euphoria they had lobbied hard to block any compromise which would 
let southern africa keep its elephants on the threatened list 
appendix ii which allows limited trade in elephant products 
while the rest were moved to appendix i the endangered list which 
forbids all such trade 
this sends a single message to the world said cynthia moss 
of the african wildlife foundation author of elephant memories 
a split listing would have made people think there is good 
ivory and bad ivory she said now there is no question 
jeff canin of greenpeace international hailed the vote but 
called it only a first step toward protecting the elephant he said 
the main thing was to persuade people to stop buying invory 
a recent census estimated africa now has just over 600000 
elephants a decade ago it was l3 million 
zimbabwe botswana and south africa argued that their own 
antipoaching measures and management had increased herds forcing 
them to cull elephants for ecological balance 
the sale of ivory from culled elephants contributes millions of 
dollars to their wildlife management budgets they said 
the compromise proposed by somalia followed a failed attempt 
for an outright ban the united states kenya tanzania gambia 
austria and hungary proposed that all african elephants be shifted 
to appendix i without exceptions that vote was 5336 lacking the 
required twothirds majority 
desmond bradley martin a kenyabased american expert estimated 
it would now take at least 100 million a year to save major 
populations in africa 
african countries have to expand antipoaching patrols and 
intelligence gathering he said if international funds are not 
made available many elephant populations will decline 
drastically 
after the session cites secretarygeneral eugene lapointe of 
canada shrugged off criticism of his activities 
he said the us delegations request for an accounting of 
85000 from the sale by cites of south american caiman skins was 
the sort of request for information a member state was entitled to 
ask 
this is not the first time a government has asked the 
secretariat what happened in a specific case lapointe said 
he attributed harsh criticism from environmentalist groups 
including a request for police investigation to a misunderstanding 
of cites functions 
i am still sleeping easily at night lapointe said

a study shows that americas cities are 
starving for trees forestry experts said monday 
most cities in the united states could accommodate more than 
twice the number of trees that now line their streets said james 
kielbaso a forestry professor from michigan state university 
those cities are missing out on the cooling and energysaving 
benefits that trees provide he said 
kielbaso was one of the lead researchers in a recent study by 
the american forestry association which was released at the 
organizations fourth urban forest conference about 500 tree 
experts and activists attended the meeting 
if we double the number of trees in our cities we would in 
effect triple the environmental benefits of trees kielbaso said 
the study was compiled from the results of a random survey of 
street trees in about 300 communities in the united states 
kielbaso said 
there are an estimated 60 million street trees in the country 
kielbaso said there are an average of 78 street trees per mile he 
said spaced an average of 150 feet apart 
kielbaso said that decreasing the space between each tree to 50 
feet would allow for nearly 100 million new street trees 
a previous study found that street trees make up only onetenth 
of the urban forest in the nations cities he said yet they play 
an important role in providing shade and other benefits to city 
dwellers 
kielbaso said that among the conclusions of his study was that 
only half of 1 percent of city budgets are spent on trees 
underfunded tree maintenance programs and difficult growing 
conditions lead to early mortality rates for trees he said 
most street trees are small twothirds are under 12 inches in 
diameter and most medium to large trees are in fair to poor 
condition he said 
gary moll the afas vice president of urban forestry said that 
urban forests have been overlooked too often as ways to help slow 
global warming 
research is just now beginning to show the environmental and 
economic value of our urban forests moll said 
the afa has launched a citizens treeplanting campaign called 
global releaf which is aimed at getting 100 million trees planted 
in the nations communities by 1992

president bushs plan to curb chemical weapons 
raised concerns in congress on monday and may anger other nations 
because it could affect a multilateral pact already partially 
negotiated 
the changes apparently would give the united states the right to 
continue producing chemical weapons after the treaty was signed 
and would allow the united states to maintain a portion of its 
stockpile until all nations capable of making chemical weapons sign 
the proposed treaty 
the shift is going to cause a little commotion in the 
negotiations said an administration arms control expert who 
spoke on condition of anonymity it will cause us difficulties in 
geneva where the multilateral negotiations are under way 
senate majority leader george mitchell said monday that unless 
the president clarifies his position on this issue makes a 
decision and makes it known it is likely that little progress 
will be made in geneva toward achieving the multilateral treaty 
prohibiting chemical weapons which the president ironically has 
stated is one of his highest priorities

half cup of minced red onion two teaspoons of dried rosemary and 
salt and pepper spread on a butterflied pork tenderloin wrap in 
foil 
then stick it in your car engine and drive 250 miles 
voila 
it really does taste very good smells wonderfully when youre 
driving along and get to a toll booth said scheller coauthor 
of manifold destiny the one the only guide to cooking on your 
car engine 795 villard books 
it gives you a great sense of accomplishment to do something 
as formidable as a pork tenderloin agrees his partner maynard 
think of maynard a 39yearold travel writer as the james 
beard of the buick think of scheller a 41yearold photographer 
as the paul prudhomme of the pontiac together they have produced a 
compendium that gives new meaning to the phrase meals on wheels 
the two friends have been cooking on car engines since the 
summer of 1984 when they were returning from a canoe trip in 
canada and got a hankering for some of that good smoked meat from 
schwartzs deli in montreal 
a quick detour later they had their pastrami but they also 
were vaguely discontented wouldnt it be nice to savor a hot 
smoked meat sandwich 
in burlington vt they pulled off the interstate and opened 
the hood of schellers 1984 volkswagen rabbit they spied a nice 
spot under the air filter and stuck the foilwrapped meat there 
an hour later at a rest stop they enjoyed steaming smoked meat 
best of all they write we nearly made two women at the 
next picnic table choke on their sprouts when they saw that instead 
of a busted fan belt we had actually just dragged our lunch from 
the rabbits greasy maw 
that started their fascination with car cuisine they have spent 
the past five years developing recipes thruway thighs to 
grandmothers house road turkey blackened roadfish and lead foot 
stuffed cabbage among them 
each recipe includes the estimated mileage required to cook the 
meal for those who are not zipping along route 80 who are 
stalled on say philadelphias schuylkill expressway the authors 
provide cooking times 
a lot depends on the size of the cars engine and whether the 
car has a commodious and secure place to put comestibles a place 
where the food will not be crushed or wedged into the engines 
moving parts or knocked to the ground to become road pizza 
you try to retrieve an eggplant in traffic and were not 
responsible warn the authors 
exhaust manifolds are good so are injector housings maynard 
and scheller compare the culinary virtues of different cars 
ranging from the 1965 jaguar xke the best setup we have ever 
come across for easyaccess topoftheengine cooking to the 
1988 toyota camry which offers a space next to the right wheel 
well that functions as a bun warmer 
since the japanese culture places no great stock in baked 
goods we can only assume that this was yet another canny ploy to 
play to the american market maynard and scheller write 
through it all there is an emphasis on safety partly at the 
insistence of the publishers lawyers do not interfere with moving 
parts or block the flow of air or insert check or remove food with 
the motor running come back with the same number of fingers you 
started with the authors say 
also wrap the food three times in aluminum foil and dont use 
too much liquid no car owners manual calls for basting the 
engine 
scheller says a lot of people have reacted to the concept of car 
cooking with a wince convinced that under the hood theres some 
indescribable collection of gunky parts that would ruin food 
the authors calmly explain that the food is wrapped so engine 
grime in no problem and exhaust fumes are channeled outside 
through the exhaust pipe 
do maynard and scheller really cook this way they insist they 
do 
its a nice way to have a hot meal waiting somewhere down the 
road says maynard we dont do it all the time of course 
when were driving to a restaurant for example its hard to 
justify bringing food along 
and maynard and scheller do not suggest that all foods are 
appropriately cooked in a nissan sentra we once boned a whole 
capon stuffed it with alternating layers of chicken mousseline 
duxelles and spinach souffle and wrapped it in brioche but we had 
the good sense to cook it in an oven not on a car engine they 
write 
other recipes they say just dont pay off 
for instance you could bake a potato on a car engine but 
youd have to drive to des moines maynard says when youre 
all done you have a baked potato so what

every working day nearly 2000 lebanese 
pass through four good fence border crossings on their way to 
jobs in israel 
in doing so these lebanese christians moslems and druse 
contribute to israels security and are a sign of growing ties 
between israel and southern lebanon where the israelis have 
established a security zone 
israeli analysts said the loyalty of the 200000 lebanese 
residents of the security zone created as a buffer against 
palestinian and lebanese moslem militias would weaken if 
widespread unemployment took hold in the area 
the security zone is relatively quiet mainly because of the 
sense that economic stability prevails theres too much for the 
people to lose said yosef olmert a middle east expert at tel 
aviv university 
an israeli army official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said a requirement for entry for lebanese workers was having a 
relative serving in the south lebanon army a 2500member 
christianled militia that is trained and armed by israel to help 
defend the frontier 
the security zone is about 75 miles long and 2 to 12 miles 
deep it was established in 1985 after israel withdrew from lebanon 
following a threeyear occupation so far this year 71 guerrillas 
infiltrating the zone have been killed 
metullas good fence is a cluster of buildings a watchtower 
and a fence next to an israeli army post workers show identity 
cards present work permits and empty their pockets in a check for 
contraband 
we all are running away from the war in lebanon and we are 
here to work nadeen badawi 23 said after driving from the 
druse town of hasbaya 11 miles north of the border 
arriving about sunrise he works sunday through friday at an 
israeli textile factory 
awaiting a chartered bus to another factory a 48yearold 
lebanese christian said most of the workers earn the equivalent of 
17 a day 
most of the men are working in agriculture a few like me 
work in factories said the former electronics technician who 
declined to give his name for fear of reprisals 
some lebanese complained the israeli wages are too low but most 
conceded they could do no better in lebanon where purchasing power 
has been steadily eroded by inflation and the average monthly wage 
is the equivalent of 75 
israeli officials say 1500 to 2000 lebanese workers now enter 
the country daily compared to only a few hundred in past years 
half are women who work in hotels restaurants and as 
housekeepers 
men generally take jobs in factories or on farms where extra 
money can be made during harvests skilled automobile mechanics are 
also in demand most return home nightly but some are provided 
with housing for stays of up to several weeks 
israel provided about 13 million for road repairs last year in 
southern lebanon in addition to funds for schools and hospitals 
and salary supplements for city hall bureaucrats and police 
in areas where the central government in lebanon should have 
built infrastructure and promoted social activity and education 
and didnt take care of it we are taking care of it said uri 
lubrani israels coordinator for lebanon policy 
he recently opened a new crossing primarily for shiite moslems 
although iran has a strong influence among the shiites lubrani 
predicted 300 to 400 would cross daily and that the number would 
increase 
the israeli shekel currency also has begun to circulate in 
southern lebanon along with the us dollar and the lebanese lira 
frances rizk a lebanese official of the christian voice of hope 
radio estimated trade at 2 million a month with israel providing 
agricultural products and the lebanese providing labor 
our financial situation is still the best in all of lebanon 
rizk said 
officials say israel would withdraw if syria pulled out its 
40000 troops out of lebanon and a government was established in 
beirut that could maintain peace throughout the country 
israel has no territorial claims on lebanon said yossi 
amihud the foreign ministry spokesman israels concern is 
preventing the organization of terror and the use of lebanese 
territory for acts against israel he said

with its waters classified as 
biologically dead and its pacific beach turned a yellowgreen 
this former fishing community wants a small slice of chiles copper 
fortune to compensate for a shoreline buried in toxic sludge 
its not the first time chanarals 12700 inhabitants have 
played david to the goliath of the state copper mining corporation 
which is by far the countrys largest single company and producer 
of more than a third of chiles 8 billion in annual export 
earnings 
a year ago the chanaral citizens committee won a legal suit 
against the corporation known by the acronym codelco the supreme 
court ordered codelco to shut down a 100mile sluice that has 
carried millions of tons of waste westward from its massive el 
salvador mine in the andes to the pacific coast at chanaral 
such environmental victories are rare in latin america and the 
third world in general where governments trailing in the 
worldwide race for development generally give priority to 
industrial growth over damage to nature 
but ecological awareness and activism has begun taking root in 
latin america with new environmental and naturalist groups 
emerging and becoming increasingly vocal 
nowhere is that awareness more manifest than in chanaral 605 
miles north of santiago chiles capital 
the citizens committee is supported by a rainbow of local 
social groups and threw a rousing street party complete with a 
local rock band when the supreme courts ruling came down 
codelco was forced to start building another sluice from the el 
salvador pit to a remote uninhabitated plain on the desert that 
dominates northern chile the 135million project has run into 
delays but the company promises to complete it early next year 
with that legal victory under its belt the citizens are seeking 
more satisfaction 
the state must compensate us because the pollution buried our 
fishing maritime and port development for decades said julio 
palma a truck driver who was a leader in promoting the original 
suit 
in a new damage suit being planned the community will ask for 
the equivalent of one us cent for each pound of copper extracted 
from el salvador palma said the money will create a town 
development fund 
for the delays in building the new sluice which was supposed to 
be completed in april the citizens committee is asking 1 million 
in compensation 
in the existing sluices 51 years of operation 200 million to 
500 million tons of crushed rock and tainted water have been dumped 
onto chanarals shore palma said 
scientific studies used in the committees suit found waters and 
marine life around the community contaminated with dangerous levels 
of copper zinc molybdenum and arsenic which is used in 
extracting metal from ore 
as far back as 1975 a marine biologist rolf benhcke said in a 
study the chanaral beach is a biologically dead beach it 
has been impossible to detect a single living organism 
that same year the sluices mouth was moved from central 
chanaral to palitos cove five miles to the north but the 
communitys shore remains barren and a band of unnatural 
yellowgreen runs parallel to the water 
over the decades the waste piled up and pushed the shoreline out 
more than a mile buried in the process were commercial docks a 
threestory pier used by fishing boats and a shipwreck dating back 
to the 1940s that used to attract tourists residents said 
oldtimers like amanda venegas recall another era when there 
were so many fish that when we went bathing they swam between our 
legs 
nonetheless the community is proud of having successfully 
closed the sluice down and believe it could signal something for 
other third world countries 
the ruling is the most important in decades on ecological 
issues and creates a precedent for latin america said the 
citizens committees lawyer rafael asenjo 
he said ecology groups in the phillipines and peru have asked 
the committee for copies of the decision so has a group in canada 
although canada it is not part of the third world

in the shorthand of government the whole 
business is called quite simply catastrophic that turned out 
to be a good choice of word 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act of 1988 has itself proven 
to be a political catastrophe the program is a problem for the 
members of congress who approved it and now are in the process of 
undoing their unpopular handiwork for the administration that 
first supported it and then fell silent even for senior citizens 
lobbyists who endorsed the plan without anticipating the backlash 
now congress is trying to figure out how and what to try to 
salvage out of catastrophic the insurance program elderly 
americans at least those who know how to get a message to 
washington apparently did not want and clearly did not want to 
finance 
while the white house at one point said the program should be 
preserved president bush is offering no further advice we are 
letting the congressional process hash this out bush said friday 
the president said if congress produced something he deemed 
unsatisfactory he would not hesitate to step in the 
administration iprompt it to take action or even a position on a 
program bush a candidate 
after the house voted outright repeal secretary of health and 
human services louis sullivan endorsed a senate measure that would 
have pres the law and reduced the controversial surtax o that was 
to have financed it 
he did so ienate finance committee but the administrationly 
declared that sullivan was speaking only forudget director richard 
g darman sent up a letten nothing in this letter should be 
construed for or opposition to one catastrophic illness substantive 
amenas opposed to another darman decreed 
the catastrophic overage act was supposed to provide insurance 
to pay for costly hospital and doctor care to put a cap on outket 
medical costs it also offered new benefits escription drug costs 
the benefits were to be phased in gradually 
but the tax to pay for those benefitsich already is in place 
produced the backlash it is a surtax of 2250 for every 150 in 
fedd by the elderly that spared lowincome retirees imposing the 
surtax on about 40 percent of the people eligi the insurance the 
maximum tax is 800 a persoent of the elderly faced that top levy 
congress which hadpected gratitude and support reing the tax 
many of them already paying for their own catastrohic health 
insurance even peoplo surtax came to believe that theyd be 
assessed and joined th opposition the protection would have been 
mostlowerincome retired people the least organizedvocal of the 
nations seniors 
president reprogram in the first place but what he recommended 
in 1987 was a relatively modest plan to prohuge medical bills with 
an estimated price tag of 2 billion ar 
congress added benefits and costs when enacted 16 months ago 
the fiveyear cost was estimated at 32the estimate now is up to 
48 billion 
the reagan plan was osed to be financed with a flat 4 monthly 
pre to pay for the expanded program congress devised the 15 
percent income tax surcharge that stirred the senior rebellion 
even the most powerful of the senior lobbies the american 
association of retired persons got tangled in the issue after 
agreeing to go along with the financing system the aarp now says 
somewhat defensively that it strongly supports the benefits but 
never advocated the surtax system the association wants broader 
financingng an increase in the tobacco tax thats not likely 
what is likely is that congress will be far more wary of such 
programs and especially of such finaing systems in the future 
and whats certain is that costs the program would have covered 
will be paid in other ways out of pocket in higher premiums for 
private health insurance and in taxes local state and federal 
in signing the bill he counted a major destic achievement 
reagan nonetheless offered aand it proved too true he said that 
without dit controls the program could be too expensive 
this could be more than a budget problem it could be a 
tragedy the program after ae paid for by the elderly themselves 
so we mushese new benefits or well harm the very people we are 
trying t

the stock markets volume today is many times 
greater than it was two or three decades ago data and rumors 
spread infinitely faster the dollar power of the players is in 
multiples of yesterdays 
it is a very different place than its stereotyped view as a 
public forum where people vote with their wallets and which 
reflects the hopes and fears of the american public 
a oneday price collapse of more than 190 dow jones points is 
shocking but it is at least better understood in light of market 
size mechanics liquidity fads trading patterns and devices and 
valuations 
anyone trying to understand todays volatile stock market might 
consider 
there are always two separate activities involved one is 
relatively longterm investing on the basis of corporate values and 
economic conditions the other in various forms is playing the 
market trying to outguess it 
are the values there 
priceearnings ratios or the number of times earnings at which 
a stock sells have not been unusually high the post1950 average 
pe for the standard amp poors 500 stock index is 12 just prior to 
oct 13 the pe was 14 
its a different story when prices are matched against book 
values the sampp before october 13 was about 24 times book value 
since 1930 the valuation has been higher only once just before 
the 1987 crash 
investors must also consider stocks vs bonds in the 1980s the 
bond market has averaged nearly a 13 percent annual return best of 
the century that gives stocks competition for the investment 
dollar 
a statement early last week by federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan was widely interpreted as indicating the possibility of 
higher interest rates a move generally regarded as bad for stocks 
good for investors in debt issues 
adding to this fear was a report friday that wholesale prices 
were rising and fears that septembers consumer price index would 
when announced add to fears that inflation considered subdued 
might not yet have surrendered 
recent advances in the stock market probably were generated 
more by the prospects of corporate takeovers and a runup in 
prices rather than basic values primarily the earnings of 
corporations 
corporate earnings have been fading earnings gains last year 
for the standard amp poors composite stock index were 36 percent 
over the previous year in this years first quarter the gain was 
22 percent in the second 5 percent 
takeover activity can disguise such a deterioration because 
firstly the excitement of takeover companies offering prices far 
above market and secondly the elimination of stock through such 
takeovers 
in the years 19841988 a total of 369 billion of us equities 
was removed from the market much of it replaced by debt fewer 
shares and more potential buyers tends to push up prices 
in contrast during the years 19691983 newly issued stock 
generally exceeded withdrawals by an average of 9 billion a year 
that is the amount of stock on the market grew rather than shrank 
doubts about the continued ability to raise money by those 
seeking to take over large corporations and the ability of already 
debtridden companies to continue making payments deflated the 
prices of the shares involved 
todays trading techniques as opposed to investing techniques 
might have much to do with price surges or collapses the market 
has been programmed with many automatic triggers pulled by 
computers often simultaneously 
the players trade in scores of millions of dollars 
institutions such as mutual and pension funds trust departments 
foundations and more rather than individuals do most of the 
trading 
do they think alike act alike react to each other to some 
extent how much is likely to be studied more intensely by those 
concerned about the markets volatility 
exchanges usually deny it but stock market liquidity appears to 
be badly damaged otherwise it is difficult to explain why drops 
of such magnitude as that of october 13 1989 can occur 
liquidity means the ability to match buyers and sellers years 
ago individual investors made up a socalled randomness of views 
but institutions are often think alikes as they rise in 
importance individuals shrink 
in 1988 alone household stock holdings shrank by 105 billion 
in the five years 19841988 individual investors cashed in a half 
trillion dollars of blue chip stocks much of which was replaced by 
debt often rickety debt 
perhaps even worse by cashing in they removed themselves as 
voices in the marketplace a multiplicity of views a randomness 
of thinking that the market could use today

scotland has its loch ness monster and england 
has its cropfield rings 
perfectly neat swirls of flattened crops 10 to 100 feet in 
diameter show up in the farmlands of southern england each year 
and have intrigued researchers for a decade 
the geometric formations found amid otherwise undisturbed 
crops have yielded a maze of interpretations electrically charged 
spinning balls of air tiny holes in the ozone layer rutting deer 
flying saucers helicopters flying upside down herds of demented 
hedgehogs rotating in unison 
tongueincheek theorists say it would take 40000 hedgehogs 
running around at the same time to create the circle effect 
hoaxes have been effectively ruled out local military bases say 
helicopters have difficulty flying upside down 
if animals are to blame they leave no trail of bent or broken 
stems 
violent storms or whirlwinds dont create the precise patterns 
of crops crushed flat with the tautness of thatch 
crops are never damaged and continue to ripen until harvest 
more than 600 configurations have been recorded since 1980 in 
fields of grass barley oats or wheat as well as in stretches of 
sand soil or snow of this summers 270 twothirds appeared in a 
squaremile zone near avebury in wiltshires rural terrain 
including 28 in one field 
at first they were simple circles or had concentric saturn 
rings this year one was ornamented with a long curling tail like 
a tadpoles a celtic cross of four circles surrounding one 
large middle circle looks like it might have been formed by the 
landing pods of the standardimage alien spaceship 
terence meaden a physicist is convinced they are caused by a 
previously unknown vortex an inverse dust devil that instead 
of sucking the surface slams violently down into it 
weve got a movable monster meaden said in an interview 
the scottish one seldom gets its head above water 
more than 4000 people have reported see the loch ness monster 
in modern times and monster hunters have used everything from 
bread crumbs to submarines to try to find the 1400yearold legend 
the difference is that the monster rarely hangs around for long 
whereas the rings are there for all to see 
serious research into the circles mystery began in 1980 four 
years after the first recorded sighting at headbourne worthy in 
hampshire chroniclers have now traced sporadic sightings as far 
back as 1918 in countries as far apart as france canada and japan 
a circle 14 feet in diameter with a onefootwide outer ring 
appeared one morning this past august on fred cullimores 190acre 
wheat farm near bath in southwest england 
it was absolutely perfect there was no possibility of any 
animal or person doing it cullimore said 
hes not sure if he suspects people from outer space 
ive never seriously entertained the idea of little green 
men he said its too frightening to think but im not 100 
percent certain its stormrelated 
geoff cooper 52 said the rings have been proliferating on his 
farm near westbury in wiltshire since 1980 
its the wind he surmises having said that has the 
weather changed that much in the last nine years i dont know 
two new books on the phenomenon take opposite approaches one 
scientific one fantastical 
in the circle effect and its mysteries the physicist meaden 
speculates that an unusual atmospheric disturbance created by winds 
passing over a hill in south englands undulating landscape creates 
a spinning ball of air highly charged with electricity it 
eventually plunges downward and leaves its uniform mark he thinks 
he says witnesses have told of a vortex that gives off a humming 
sound like the sound you get from electric power lines and it 
is luminous at night 
summerlong attempts to photograph the phenomenon have all been 
in vain one group of 50 scientists and engineers armed with 
hightech sensors and scanners settled down for a nightlong vigil 
in june and when dawn broke discovered an elaborate pattern had 
formed directly behind their camp 
it was as though some intelligence was saying so you think 
you can pin us down says pat delgado coauthor of circular 
evidence with electrical engineer colin andrews 
delgado an electromechanical design engineer is convinced 
that by a process of elimination what we are we left with is the 
paranormal 
he estimates 4000 pounds of pressure is needed to induce the 
crop to lie flat and continue to grow and shed its seed in a 
natural way 
the rapeseed plant snaps like celery when bent at the stem 
but in this instance a softening procedure takes place and i 
dont know what sort of energy can do that he said in an 
interview 
just imagine what you could do with this free energy if it 
could be harnessed

when sun yatsen the father of modern china 
challenged the crumbling manchu dynasty from exile nearly a century 
ago he found support throughout the world from sympathetic hua 
qiao overseas chinese 
now with the brutal military crushing of the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing this past spring a new generation of chinese 
exiles is looking to hua qiao for help in toppling chinas leaders 
wang gungwu vice chancellor of the university of hong kong and 
an expert on overseas chinese hears echoes from the past as he 
surveys the situation survival will not be a problem for the new 
exiles they can expect to be sustained by their brethren abroad 
he says 
the story of the hua qiao spans many centuries as wave upon 
wave of chinese have left their native land to escape grinding 
poverty to flee political persecution or just to seek fortune 
one estimate puts the current overseas chinese population at 
roughly 30 million 
they can be found in every corner of the globe 
among them are worldfamous architects im pei bestselling 
novelists maxine hong kingston and leaders of nations prime 
minister lee kuan yew of singapore they are prominent 
businessmen and every major city has restaurants run by them 
but the overseas chinese also have maintained ties to their 
homeland and at times some have become deeply involved in its 
politics 
the most obvious example was their support for sun yatsen a 
leading figure in the fight against the manchu dynasty that had 
been in place since 1644 and was also known as the qing dynasty it 
finally fell in 1911 with sun as a leading player in chinas 
revolutionary movement until his death in 1925 
in explaining why overseas chinese supported sun against the 
weak manchu empire his biographer harold z schiffrin wrote if 
as minorities they were persecuted or discriminated against abroad 
they wanted a powerful home government for protection 
sun owed a large debt to the overseas chinese 
whenever he went overseas he was looked after by the overseas 
chinese said wang of the university of hong kong they clothed 
him fed him and protected him 
they also provided some financial backing he added the 
support was vital he couldnt have survived 
other hua qiao have since answered appeals from chinese leaders 
for help 
soon after mao tsetungs communist party took power in 1949 it 
urged chinese intellectuals living abroad to return and help build 
new china 
although no reliable estimate is available on the number of 
professionals who answered the call thousands did return and 
played a key role in chinas development especially nuclear 
physicists many later paid the price during political purges of 
intellectuals 
the chinese diaspora is once again in the spotlight because of 
the spring prodemocracy demonstrations and the new exile movement 
seeking help from the hua qiao 
but the exiles have found that the overseas chinese are not a 
monolithic community their political and economic outlooks vary 
widely perhaps the only common thread is that they are an ethnic 
minority in almost every country in which they live 
the degree of assimilation by chinese abroad varies tremendously 
and to some extent determines how closely tied they are to mainland 
china affairs 
some of the most assimilated and the oldest overseas chinese 
communities are in southeast asia where reaction to the 
prodemocracy movement generally was muted 
in thailand precise figures on the ethnic chinese population 
are difficult if not impossible to determine because of widespread 
intermarriage since the first wave of migration more than 200 years 
ago 
but up to 12 percent of the population is believed to have solid 
chinese roots including a dozen chinesethai families that can be 
said to largely run the private economy and the prime minister who 
has a chineseborn grandfather 
i was born here my parents are chinese from china but i love 
thailand and i feel i belong to this country said one ethnic 
chinese businessmen in bangkok the thai capital i have never 
been to mainland china i think that it would be very difficult to 
live there 
chinese in the philippines who began arriving even before the 
spanish colonizers in the late 16th century also have assimilated 
rapidly by intermarrying taking hispanic names and adopting roman 
catholicism they too are very influential in economic and 
political life

north america and europe also have their share of 
longestablished overseas chinese communities ethnic chinese first 
arrived in the san francisco area in the mid1800s and now number 
about 200000 they sit on virtually all the major boards of the 
city 
many of the ethnic chinese in san francisco and elsewhere in the 
united states are only first and secondgeneration americans the 
1980 us census found that of nearly 900000 americans reporting 
chinese ancestry more than half spoke chinese at home nearly 
300000 people said they were born in china and 155000 others 
listed taiwan and hong kong as their birth places 
wang believes the relative newcomers among chineseamericans 
are much more likely to be sensitive to developments in china 
indeed many ethnic chinese in north america have actively 
backed the prodemocracy movement 
the chinese community of san francisco organized several groups 
in support of the beijing students and staged dozens of rallies and 
fundraising dinners 
chineseamericans in chicago donated money to buy facsimile 
machines computers and other equipment for the prodemocracy 
movement 
in toronto as many as 30000 people many of them 
chinesecanadians demonstrated june 4 to protest the harsh 
military crackdown on the beijing students in tiananmen square the 
turnouts were considered extraordinary for the traditionally placid 
community 
some chinesecanadians also strongly criticized the canadian 
government foreign secretary joe clark in particular for 
approving a large loan to china in august 
how can joe clark turn around and do that said tom pang 
president of the chinese community center the blood on the 
square is barely dry 
but support for the democracy movement among overseas chinese in 
the west was by no means universal 
there are a number of chinese entrepreneurs in london who 
dont want to rock the boat and in fact some of them have openly 
condemned the democracy movement said anthony shang 36 a 
television producer who has lived in the british capital for 20 
years 
he said that among the people who have adopted very cautious 
attitudes are some operators of the 6000 chinese restaurants and 
supermarkets in britain who buy foodstuffs from china 
there is a degree of hypocrisy amongst the older community 
leaders who are inevitably tied up with business shang added 
to what degree then is there a sense of dual loyalty to both 
china and the country in which the hua qiao live 
if a white man asks me that hes questioning my loyalty by 
merely asking said david liu chairman of the chicago chapter of 
the washingtonbased organization of chinese americans its an 
insult why dont the caucasians ask russian immigrants about their 
loyalty 
but rolland lowe president of the foundation for chinese 
democracy in the san francisco area acknowledged that some hua 
qiao have a conflict 
they are americans but somehow they think they are chinese 
he said 
but he added i keep my hat straight as to who i am 
that is to say he is an american

standing larger than life in front of the 
chenjinglun middle school is a white marble statue of a man in a 
threepiece suit 
the 13000 statue is of chen jinglun a native son of xinhui 
county who built the school with part of the fortune he made as a 
rice merchant in nearby hong kong 
behind the statue is an olympicsize swimming pool a gymnasium 
and classrooms filled with brighteyed students some hunched over 
expensive computerized typewriters all far more advanced that the 
usual chinese school 
to show respect to mr chen the local government and people 
of xinhui named the school after him said guan yunjin the 
school president the love from mr chen is very precious 
chens largesse is just one example of the historically strong 
ties between chinese who move abroad and their motherland in 
particular this coastal region of southern china which is the 
ancestral home to hundreds of thousands of overseas chinese 
jiangmen a region in the pearl river delta prides itself as 
the hometown of overseas chinese 
a main reason for the worldwandering ways of jiangmen chinese 
has to do with the regions proximity to hong kong the british 
colony from which shipping lines lead to all corners of the globe 
about 258 million chinese living in 95 countries hong kong and 
the nearby portuguese territory of macao trace their roots to 
jiangmen many of them return to visit relatives to donate money 
for social services or to invest in local enterprises 
in nearby taishan country a bridge has been built with 940000 
in contributions from native chinese now living abroad springing 
up throughout the countryside are three and fourstory villas 
built by overseas chinese for relatives still here 
a museum with pictures of chinese in the california gold rush of 
1849 also has a list of about 100 local schools that have received 
donations from chinese abroad 
feng yuanchao director of a local foreign affairs office runs 
down the list of north american cities where his kin can be found 
vancouver seattle toronto and chicago 
as he drives past rice fields in his small van he points to a 
village of low graybrick homes in the distance 
that village has sent many people to chicago he says if 
you meet a chinese in chicagos chinatown the chances are 60 
percent he is from the town 
some overseas chinese come back for more than a visit 
one is tommy quan 56 who left taishan in 1949 when the 
chinese communists came to power he made seattle his home and 
became a successful businessman 
but when he returned in the early 1980s he found the land 
barren i kept asking myself why dont people do something 
about it 
quan did he established a 400acre orange orchard that now 
employs about 150 people he spent seven months in china this year 
and will spend almost half of 1990 to see his business through its 
first critical years 
local officials are appreciative of efforts by quan and other 
overseas chinese to help the jiangmen area blossom and seem 
unconcerned about the possibility of contamination by bourgeois 
liberalization the communist term for unwanted liberal western 
influences 
ill put it this way said guan the school president 
wherever they go the chinese love their hometown and country 
when they get rich they wont forget their country or hometown 
this is one of the merits of the chinese people

president bushs 79 billion war on drugs in the 
united states has raised official fears in western europe that 
cocaine barons will broaden their alreadyexpanding market on the 
continent some officials say terrorists may be drawn into the 
lucrative trade to finance their own causes 
so far the streets of europe have been largely spared the 
cocaine storm that has buried the united states where seizures of 
the drug now are sometimes weighed in tons 
among those who fear the blizzard will now hit europe is antonio 
gava italys interior minister 
gava said he supports the us measures and cooperates with 
american officials but is alarmed about italy and its neighbors 
all of europe must have a heightened capacity for the battle 
to keep the tentacles of drugs from spreading on this continent 
during the massive effort by the united states gava said 
many other european leaders such as prime minister margaret 
thatcher of britain also support the us crackdown but some also 
share gavas concern 
the drug cartels in latin america have shifted their strategy 
toward europe because of increased antidrug activity by the united 
states said karlheinz lenhard the chief of the bavarian state 
criminal police in west germany 
lenhards investigators last august made the largest cocaine 
bust of the year in europe seizing 1430 pounds valued at 108 
million 
dont compare seizures with the united states said one 
european investigator speaking on condition of anonymity europe 
may be 10 years behind the united states but cocaine is already a 
major problem in europe authorities from scandinavia to the 
mediterranean say cocaine seizures doubled or tripled in the last 
few years last year european authorities seized 15400 pounds of 
cocaine and nobody knows how much entered the continent undetected 
in portugal the amount taken in the first eight months of this 
year totaled 1450 pounds double that for 1988 and triple that of 
1987 
gava fears the consequences of new and enormous cocaine profits 
for italys underworld the sicilian mafia and naples camorra he 
also points to what he says is evidence of some mafia cooperation 
with terrorists whom he fears may turn to drug trafficking to 
finance their activities 
a highranking drug agent who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said investigators share the fear that terrorists might 
run drugs themselves or turn to traffickers for money 
italys underworld bosses control a worldwide drug trafficking 
network that rakes in an estimated 20 billion a year that figure 
exceeds the national budgets of some small european countries but 
investigators believe it is dwarfed by the profits of the cocaine 
cartels 
investigators say the cartels already work with the mafia and 
camorra to distribute cocaine that usually is smuggled into spain 
the biggest point of entry or italy the second 
the profit incentive is enormous drug agents say the cartels 
have kept the price artifically high in europe 40000 to 50000 
a kilogram 22 pounds compared to 10000 to 20000 in the 
united states 
we fear a cocaine wave not just because of bushs program but 
because the north american cocaine market has been satisfied and 
when a market is satisfied then a new market will always be 
found said ketil bensen an adviser to norways ministry of 
social affairs 
investigators agree saying cocaine cartels already had begun to 
target europe before the american crackdown because the us market 
was saturated 
they have been moving into europe very systematically for the 
last four or five years said the highranking drug agent 
they want to increase the quantity and lower the price to the 
point where it is profitable to sell crack crack becomes the 
cocaine of the poor 
heroin now is the main drug of the european market from the 
poppy fields of the middle east and southwest asia it reaches 
mafia distributors by land through turkey bulgaria and yugoslavia 
or by ship to southern italy 
the number of european heroin addicts numbers in the hundreds of 
thousands the number of deaths from heroin overdoses now exceeds 
2000 a year italy alone had 809 such deaths last year and west 
germay 670 in the first eight months of this year italy had 599 
deaths and west germany 543 
miguel solans the head of spains national plan for drugs 
agency said us research indicates cocaine deaths in europe could 
match or surpass those related to heroin use within three years 
drug investigators say gava and rafael vera spains secretary 
of state for security have spoken out the loudest about what the 
us crackdown could mean in europe and why the europeans need to 
join coordinated multinational efforts to combat the trafficking 
in september italy spain and the united states agreed to work 
together to battle traffickers in colombia bolivia and peru 
officials declined to release the details of the agreement but said 
it dealt with training latin american police sharing intelligence 
helping to protect threatened judges and providing equipment 
france and britain have sent experts to colombia to assist in 
training security forces and in protecting judges and others 
threatened with death britain also sent a navy frigate to help 
patrol colombias coast 
police in denmark france spain portugal west germany and 
italy report they are conducting intensified efforts against drug 
traffickers at home drugrelated arrests are also up in britain 
belgium austria sweden and the netherlands 
interior minister pierre joxe of france strengthened antidrug 
forces in september doubling the number of investigators in the 
central drug office sending specially trained narcotics officers 
to cities around the country and hiring financial specialists to 
trace money launderers 
the west german government is considering plans to propose a 
special european antidrug police force from countries of the 
12nation european economic community it is also drafting laws to 
give tougher sentences to drug traffickers accomplices and money 
launderers 
efforts to deny the drug traffickers their profits by going 
after money launderers is considered an essential part of antidrug 
strategies 
still spains solans expressed dismay at the lack of 
international progress in stiffening the monitoring of the cash 
flows of major banks in the world to try to strangle the money 
laundering activities of drug traffickers 
some in europe fear it will become easier for drug traffickers 
to operate and launder their money in western europe when it 
becomes a unified market at the end of 1992 
gava acknowledges the problems but he also notes the steady 
rise in drug trafficking of all types 
for narcotraffickers he said it is already a europe 
without frontiers

heres a school that undoubtedly benefits from 
being in new york city its curriculum is all about crime and its 
students are very aware that the content is lethal welcome to the 
john jay college of criminal justice 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
by kay bartlett 
ap newsfeatures writer 
new york ap john salamy a 22yearold aspiring fbi agent 
was a bit disconcerted when he looked down during an exam and saw a 
38caliber revolver strapped to the ankle of the student next to 
him 
on this campus you may smoke only in designated areas you may 
carry your gun anywhere 
the john jay college of criminal justice part of the city 
university of new york system is indeed an unusual institution of 
higher learning 
it is a liberal arts college where you cannot major in english 
history or philosophy but you can major in forensic psychology 
criminology or deviant behavior and social control 
a science lab is equipped to do dna testing the ultimate in 
identification kojak is now filming in the environs a vintage 
firetruck enclosed in glass is the major artwork of one building 
its the only school where you might have an exfelon a 
recovering alcoholic an fbi man and a cop all taking notes in the 
same class says dr charles bahn a psychology professor 
in fact we used to joke back when it was nearly all cops 
how do you grade a class where everybody is armed we told them 
we gave credit for time served and were open to plea bargaining 
john jay is one of only a few colleges of criminal justice 
including those at the universities of chicago nebraska at omaha 
wisconsin louisville baltimore and east tennessee state 
soon to celebrate its 25th anniversary john jay is still called 
the cop school but it has expanded its horizons since it was 
housed in the police academy and all the students were new yorks 
finest 
in the ensuing years the college moved to several different 
locations in manhattan but up until the 1970s about 70 percent of 
its students were police officers 
now housed in two buildings near lincoln center and just south 
of a housing project the student body is predominantly civilian 
with only a quarter of them cops or others in uniformed services 
still the coffee shopdeli down the street would not make the 
day of an armed robber there is a lot of firepower beyond those 
pastrami and corned beef sandwiches 
there are more than 8000 students most of them pursuing 
associate and bachelors degrees in addition 550 are working for 
their masters and 103 their doctorate 
john jay named after the first us chief justice has a 
special mission within the cuny system the largest urban 
university in the country with 19 schools and 194000 students 
says jays president gerald lynch 
we hope john jay will help professionalize the criminal 
justice system teach people in law enforcement that life is 
ambiguous that life is made up of grays that it will give them 
more compassion 
we dont teach fingerprinting here we have a library which i 
insisted be the first thing people see when they enter the new 
building we have a 625seat theater 
the students learn things here they will use outside of their 
professional life things to enrich their personal life 
students often complain about the liberal arts courses since 
many have already decided on a career salamy for example wants 
to become either an fbi man or a dea agent 
despite the similarity of interest there is great diversity 
students here want to be anything from probation officers to 
judges to senators says julia bryant a school spokeswoman 
there are 19yearolds who want to be on 21 jump street and 
older cops who want to be commissioner 
there are also indications that some of the police students are 
preparing for a second career security management is an 
increasingly popular major 
maybe the biggest thrill of going to john jay is knowing you 
are going to have a job when you get out says dr lawrence 
kobilinsky who is a recognized dnafingerprinting expert 
graduates are heavily recruited by wouldbe employers including 
law enforcement agencies the rochester ny police department 
set up a recruitment table early this semester 
the schools alumni include two dozen to three dozen police 
chiefs across the country 
the criminal justice center housed at jay is sort of an advanced 
cop school but students dont take formal courses it offers 
workshops and seminars on such things as hostage negotiation 
stakeout and surveillance techniques confidential informants 
clandestine drug labs bomb awareness the classroom is often the 
street 
these specials usually given for law enforcement agencies but 
occasionally for private industry are not open for public 
inspection they dont want to give away secrets of the sleuthing 
trade 
the mutts dont know these things said one of the 35 new 
york city housing cops who attended a fiveday workshop on 
narcotics investigation 
the workshop was conducted by lt frank bunting division chief 
of a drug enforcement task force that includes federal state and 
city agents 
bunting presented the latest technology and offered advice 
growing out of his own experience in discussing surveillance he 
talked of ghosts and uncles and other undercover operatives 
the students roleplay a drug bust and sometimes they make 
mistakes in one the major suspect simply strolls out of the room 
while the arresting officers question the lesser crooks

once upon a time nobody could tell time well 
they sure can now down to the nanosecond on the day we return to 
standard time here are some ruminations by one of americas secret 
addicts a time freak 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there is a time to reap and a time to sow and a 
time to set the clocks back today for a growing number of 
americans it is a time fraught with excitement 
i am one of that number i am a time freak high time i 
confessed 
no telling how many of us there are in america addiction isnt 
something you go around talking about one time freak however can 
spot another the other day someone asked my friend jim smith 
what time it was he replied eightthirtytwoohthree no 
doubt about it jim smith is one of us 
a time freak would no more say about half past eight than a 
brain surgeon would say about three or four centimeters 
time addiction a compulsion for splitsecond exactitude began 
its insidious boring into the american psyche during the 1970s the 
specific date is inexcusably imprecise but the culprit is not 
it was the infliction upon an unsuspecting populace of the 
quartz watch 
like most addictive agents quartz watches come cheap and easy 
in new york you can buy one on the street 
experts will tell you that when it comes to accuracy the most 
bejeweled chronometer ever crafted by a swiss master cant hold a 
candle once used to tell time by the way to a plastic stickon 
quartz watch you can pick up at the supermarket checkout for 249 
time addicts aside america seems to have become a nation of 
clock addicts as well theres a difference 
when i was a boy my father had a pocket watch and my mother had 
a clock in the kitchen that was it the time change was 
accomplished as it were in no time 
today or last night rather i had the following to reset 
my watch her watch the kitchen wall clock the stove clock 
the microwave clock the telephone clock the radio clock five in 
the kitchen five the den wall clock the vcr clock the foyer 
clock the two clocks in the living room the four radioalarm 
clocks upstairs the travel alarm and finally the car 
eighteen then and if youre a time freak this cant be done 
casually no indeed all those clocks must agree precisely and all 
must be right 
so first you must determine the exact time from the radio from 
the local number in the phone book never not if youre serious 
about this business if youre truly timeaddicted you go to the 
source 
you phone 1900410time its a toll call but money is of no 
consequence time is of the essence or you phone 2026531800 
either number will connect you with the nations master clock at 
the us naval observatory in washington dc a recording will 
give you the exact time to the second at the tone 
but wait just to be sure you must also phone 3034997111 you 
will reach the national institute of time and technology in 
boulder colo where the tone will tell you coordinated universal 
time universal 
and if youre wondering how many time freaks are loose in the 
land out there glancing at their quartz watches heres one 
indication the observatory averages about 6000 calls a day on 
both its numbers the nitt in boulder about 5000 
thats nearly 7 million longdistance calls a year folks just 
to find out what time it is could this addiction be nearing an 
epidemic 
the numbers keep increasing says sheila faulkner who keeps 
track of the observatory calls thats why we added the 900 
number the other line was often busy the 900 number can handle 
8000 calls simultaneously 
ms faulkner also observes that the heaviest calling periods are 
monday mornings and friday afternoons the daylightstandard change 
days and new years eve both our numbers have peaked on new 
years eve 40000 on one phone and 36000 on the other 
all those new years eve callers probably arent true time 
freaks though like new years eve drinkers they likely include a 
fair number of amateurs 
if time freaks are a fairly recent breed their opposites those 
who could not care less about exactitude have been around for ages 
the navajos for instance feel it is far more important to live 
in harmony with natures own rhythms a favorite of tribal 
festivals is a prankster dressed in a threepiece suit waving a 
big alarm clock and shouting time to be hungry 
confound the man wrote a roman poet named plautus in 200 
bc who in this place set up a sundial to cut and hack my days 
so wretchedly into small portions 
you have to wonder what old plautus would have thought of david 
allan allan can cut and hack a second of time one tick into a 
billion parts into nanoseconds 
he is the head of the time laboratory at boulders national 
institute of time and technology formerly the bureau of standards 
you might say david allan is americas father time it is allan who 
decides how long a second is in the first place his lab sets the 
standard 
before 1967 time was measured by astronomical instruments they 
were accurate to a millisecond a thousandth of a second since 
then the standard has been an atomic second measured by an 
electron spinning around the nucleus of a cesium atom like the 
earth around the sun its more complex but theres no time to go 
into it 
lets just say that that electron spins around that nucleus in a 
regular pattern a frequency when it spins 9192631770 times 
thats a second 
it takes a good counter to count it allan says but we 
can do that 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO> AP891016-0204 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
the basis of the atomic clock came from the pioneering work of 
norman f ramsey of harvard who just recently was awarded the nobel 
prize in physics his discoveries have enabled science to refine 
accuracy to a nanosecond a billionth a million times more 
accurate than before david allans vocabulary also includes 
picosecond a trillionth 
apart from causing time freaks to drool is that degree of 
accuracy of any practical use 
voyager iis encounter with neptune could not have been 
navigated without atomic clocks in various places around the world 
coordinated to the nanosecond yes it is necessary says allan 
well we time addicts get enough of a fix with our simple quartz 
watches set at the tone to coordinated universal time 
quartz allan explains has a special quality when you pass an 
electric current over a piece of it it sets up a resonance like a 
plucked guitar string or a tuning fork except that as long as the 
electricity lasts the resonance remains steady it doesnt die 
down hence its remarkable accuracy 
david allan incidentally wears a quartz wristwatch an obvious 
seal of approval i should note that most freaks disdain digital 
watches we need to see each universally coordinated second go by 
tick by tick 
we feel smug if a bit foolish going about with our quartz 
watches noticing for example that the lovely sidewalk clock in 
front of the bank in closter nj is a bit slow that the 6 
oclock whistle in rivervale nj a local convenience blows a 
shade early that the newsweek building in new york has a clock 
though a tad fast and that the time building has none no time 
clock a pity 
those of you who have resisted the quartzaccuracy narcotic and 
dont go around babbling about picoseconds take heart the clock 
is striking back 
thomas bartels reports that membership in his organization is 
growing apace and so is the demand for oldfashioned watchmakers 
bartels is executive director of the national association of 
watch and clock collectors inc an organization of 34000 members 
nationwide its museum in columbia pa is the repository of more 
than 9000 artifacts none of them digital none of them quartz 
old mechanical watches have become extremely popular in the 
last couple of years says bartels theres a whole new 
generation of collectors 
he believes this horological renaissance is a reaction to the 
clinical view of timekeeping by people such as me overlooking the 
beauty and artistry of watchmaking the poetry of craftsmanship 
i see it all around the country he says young people 
interested in mechanical watches and as a result a great demand 
put on our remaining watchmakers who were a vanishing breed our 
watchmaking clinics are busier than ever 
bartels keeps 400 to 500 of the museum clocks running at all 
times people like to hear the ticks and the chimes so imagine 
his timechange chore 
its something we dread twice a year it takes the whole staff 
all day to reset them 
tom bartels not incidentally carries a mechanical pocket 
watch he is having the time of his life

she came out of grief for her lost husband 
soothed by music and now she has returned the favor on friday her 
philharmonic center for the arts opens and she and her community 
are the richer 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in her new career as a fundraiser for the arts 
myra daniels tried to sell bricks for the new philharmonic center 
for the arts in naples fla for 100 apiece 
we bought saturation tv ads thats the way we were taught to 
sell soap says the former advertising executive so she got 
before camera and said a wonderful thing is happening in this 
community and we want you to be a part of it 
the bricks were not a hit but a little boy recognized her in a 
grocery store and asked how much a brick cost i asked how much 
he had 129 i took 119 without any shame that kid is a part 
of the building 
the arts need advertising youve got a product here and you 
have to sell it myra daniels says firmly 
she adds i believe more top business people should be ceos of 
arts organizations you can run the arts as a business you can 
remain in the black you can do anything if you have the funds to 
do it and the knowledge to move it 
the fact that the 194 million philharmonic center for the arts 
will open in naples fla on friday debtfree is a tribute to 
mrs daniels acting on her belief and her 33 years of advertising 
experience 
she put an ad in the local newspaper with a coupon to cut out 
and mail in a check of a minimum donation of 1000 the publisher 
phoned and said she should save her 1700 for the ad people with 
1000 to donate dont clip coupons out of newspapers she said she 
wanted it to run 
five hundred and eight coupons and 22 million came in they 
wouldnt buy 100 bricks but theyd clip coupons for 10 times that 
much it says something about the economic level of naples fla 
residents 
there are more blue chip corporation ceos retired in our area 
than anywhere else mrs daniels says however some of them have 
informed her that theyve also retired from supporting arts 
organizations 
the center on 6 acres contains 1221seat frances pew hayes 
hall 300seat myra daniels pavilion four museum galleries and an 
outdoor sculpture garden the board wanted to name it all for mrs 
daniels she as board president vetoed it 
the center will present 200 events in the first season tickets 
are sold singly or in subscription groups such as for three 
evenings by the miami city ballet four orchestral concerts or five 
jazz programs 
mrs daniels added a line on the order form i want 
everything 1695 two hundred people marked that 
we know our breakeven point is 70 percent of the hall filled 
we know well do better than that 
it all started with something even smaller than a dream to build 
a performing arts center in an area of florida that didnt have 
one it started with grief and a reaching out for the soothing 
healing properties of music 
the year 1965 that myra janco of chicago was named ad woman of 
the year by the advertising federation of america she met draper 
daniels when he came to her office to buy her advertising agency 
he chairman of the board of his agency named her president they 
married in 1967 he was an advertising genius she says he 
fathered the marlboro man the jolly green giant in the valley and 
sorry charlie for starkist tuna 
in 1978 they retired to marco island fla daniels died in 
1983 after a fouryear illness his widow took personal inventory 
she knew after concentrating so long on nursing and then grieving 
that she needed to rejoin the world im not very good on a 
tennis court any more i never was good on a golf course i thought 
about going back to chicago 
i went to a concert by 12 people in a church in naples 
theres a sound of live music that mesmerizes you 
she invited a friend state rep mary ellen hawkins to go with 
her she said i hate amateur music i said not as much as i 
do well sit by the door if its bad well sneak out 
the man running it spoke to mary ellen at intermission and 
said they owed money she said myra will help you 
mrs daniels was not pleased then but says now she pushed me 
and gave me the greatest gift 
thats how this 63yearold with a marketing phd from indiana 
university got back in action reluctantly she invited the 
concertgivers to her home the next morning to give them advice 
and send them away she remembers 
i didnt want to get mixed up with a volunteer group but you 
have to help your community i told them you cant play again 
unless you have 100000 in the bank they were going concert by 
concert 
i said they needed a telephone campaign they didnt know how 
i said id test it for a week thinking id get them out of my 
hair you put a red dot by every so many names in the phone book 
which gives you a random statistical response for the community i 
decided i wouldnt call anyone i knew theyd be nice to the poor 
little widow 
one person she called was frances pew hayes from philadelphia 
who said she had already gone through her donation budget but 
ill give you twentyfive when the check came it was for 
25000 mrs daniels says within a week i got 100000 they 
thought i could walk on water they wouldnt let me go 
so mrs daniels who had had childhood piano lessons and loved 
music thought the next step should be an orchestra instead of 10 
amateur and two professional players i started buying musicians 
i worked on the idea that you find fine principal players and let 
them build up their sections we went to 38

she invited mrs hayes whose acquaintance she had made by that 
time made to the first concert in a high school she said 
youll never get any better unless you have a hall of your own i 
thought is the woman crazy she said ill buy the land so 
youll have it when youre ready to build 
the next morning i put on boots and went to the boondocks 
looking at land then i thought why dont i put her money in 
escrow and look for land that could be donated to us westinghouse 
communities of naples gave us the majority of the land 
then came fund raising for a hall for the symphony stabilized 
at 70 members which became two halls under one roof i dont 
feel im asking anyone for money im giving them the chance to 
build the future civilization of this part of the country and an 
opportunity to make their lives better 
i gained 40 pounds we would bring people to suppers and tell 
our story i have been to more rotary and optimist clubs i go 
anyplace people want to hear about this i say ladies and 
gentlemen its a matter of money if you want itzhak perlman to 
play here the acclaimed violinist is booked for a recital 
feb 5 
i was a brunette when i started this project maybe ill be a 
brunette again if i ever get time to go to the beauty parlor 
mrs daniels says touching her gray hair 
i never sit at intermissions im up and many times im 
collecting funds i met curtiss e frank who was vice chairman of 
dun and bradstreet at an intermission he has given 228 million 
the foyer will be named for him 
mrs daniels wrote a proposal that brought in 35 million from 
the state got donations of concrete windows and marble from near 
naples italy hugh de pree then president of furnituremaker 
herman miller inc told her she could go to his michigan company 
and choose concert chairs and office furniture he didnt know her 
well she says she chose the best 
a retired conductor who intended to give his library to a 
university saw the center being built and donated it there one man 
is giving his collection of vintage movies 
mrs daniels moved from marco island to naples so she could walk 
to work and says i dont feel any less juices than i did when i 
was a 24yearold kid going out to conquer the world in 
advertising im happy i guess because im in control of what i 
can do you can be a sweet little old lady widow having everyone 
feel sorry for you and invite you to dinner parties once in a while 
or you can do something for the place youre in 
dan was a great one to share a great deal of himself i used 
to think we should have more private time when he was dying and in 
and out of a coma one day he said myra dont ever forget every 
private person has a public responsibility and he went off again

oscar carlson a 79yearold dairy farmer 
thought hed sooner die than go to prison for the mercy killing of 
his wife who suffered from alzheimers disease but after serving 
half his sentence carlson is delighted with his new life at 
stillwater prison where officials describe him as a refreshing 
prison oddity who adores his job tending a vegetable garden 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the eve of his imprisonment for the 
mercy killing of his diseased and bedridden wife oscar whelem 
carlson begged god to strike him dead 
i was so afraid that i prayed that night that i could have a 
heart attack and die carlson said i was at my lowest 
the 79yearold retired dairy farmer and former bus driver said 
he was petrified at the thought of living in a maximum security 
penitentiary with rapists thieves drug dealers and psycho killers 
he was at peace with his earlier decision to pump four bullets 
into his wife of 47 years agnes but he had hoped for a more 
lenient sentence than 3 years at minnesotas stillwater prison 
about halfway into his stay carlson is delighted with the place 
if he could draw an occasional furlough to visit his wifes 
grave in evansville he says he wouldnt mind making it his 
permanent home 
id much sooner stay here than in an old folks home said 
the bespectacled carlson who shares laughs and meals with 
convicted felons onefourth his age agnes was in that nursing 
home and she didnt like it there one day 
on feb 29 1988 carlson sneaked an old revolver into the 
nursing home room where agnes 71 lay suffering from alzheimers 
disease and a broken hip he spoke with her briefly then pulled 
the trigger repeatedly at his trial two months later carlson 
pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder 
carlson said many of his fellow inmates arent aware of his 
past but when they ask questions he doesnt hesitate to answer 
i talk to them like i was one of the boys and they treat me 
that way carlson said 
prison caseworker glenn hall said carlson is a refreshing prison 
oddity a secure gentle man who adores his job as caretaker of a 
prison garden brimming with melons tomatoes corn and other crops 
they all kind of treat him like a grandpa hall said even 
i do in a way 
carlson spent his first 11 months in the big house before 
getting a bed march 20 in a minimum security building just outside 
the prison walls with credit for good behavior he could be 
released next september 
carlson said he didnt seek the transfer and actually missed the 
maximum security unit for its assortment of religious services he 
grew up lutheran but participated in spiritual gatherings of all 
sorts and had befriended a roman catholic priest 
marcene cole of fergus falls carlsons oldest daughter said 
she was surprised at the speed of her fathers adjustment 
i think he was awfully scared at first cole said but he 
made the best of it he seems to look at things positively 
bill schroeder carlsons longtime friend said prison may have 
been a blessing in disguise because many people in the evansville 
area would have shunned carlson had he been ordered instead to do 
community service 
carlson said marcene and his youngest daughter millie 
supported his decision but he said his other daughter mary beth 
was angered that her mothers life albeit miserable at times 
was cut short she declined to discuss the ordeal 
i wasnt too happy at first said schroeder i was really 
shocked and really angry with him it took me quite a while to get 
myself together on this to realize that oscar was at his breaking 
point everybody has a breaking point 
for carlson the breaking point arrived when he received word 
from a hospital in alexandria that agnes would have to undergo hip 
surgery 
thats when my mind slipped and i got my gun carlson said 
carlson retrieved the weapon from his woodshed drove to the 
nursing home and prayed before asking his wife if she wanted to 
have the surgery done 
when she declined carlson said he asked her if she wanted a 
shot a term she understood from his days as a butcher when he 
used the revolver to kill pigs and cattle 
she looked right at me and she said yes carlson said 
i shot her twice in the heart she knew i was pretty handy with 
the gun 
seeing her mouth open and fearing doctors would rush in and 
attempt to revive her carlson said he shot her again once in the 
eye and once in the mouth before sheriffs deputies arrived about 
20 minutes later carlson said he wept and prayed over his wifes 
body 
asked by douglas county district judge paul ballard why he 
killed her carlson said because she was suffering and i 
couldnt stand to see her suffer any longer 
he said his only regret about agnes was placing her in the 
nursing home in the first place but alzheimers had warped her 
mind he said and he was weary from providing 24hour care 
although the carlsons rural evansville house had indoor 
plumbing agnes began insisting on using the outhouse and carlson 
said he had to accompany her to prevent her from wandering away 
she had long since started to believe that carlson was her father 
and she often didnt recognize her children carlson said in 
addition the vegetable garden that had been the centerpiece of 
their lives had gone to weeds 
inside the nursing home carlson said agnes took a turn for the 
worse she had been there about 10 months before he killed her 
i wouldnt care to stay in that place any more than she did 
carlson said they called it murder what i did but she very much 
agreed on it so i think i helped her out of a lot of mess 
while carlson enjoyed maximum security he said minimum security 
provides for group outings that allows him to bowl attend sunday 
religious services in stillwater and shop 
better yet the spry carlson can tend to the prisons halfacre 
garden situated near the prison golf course carlson said he works 
from 730 am until 11 breaks for a 90minute lunch and ends his 
day in the garden at 3 pm 
we got bankers hours he said 
despite being wellliked carlson said he hasnt made any close 
friends in minimum security because they come and go too soon 
but he said three strangers have written to him to offer their 
companionship upon his release the most serious offer came from a 
73yearold florida woman who read about his plight and offered to 
care for him the rest of my days carlson said 
its a possibility he said but like they tell me ive 
got a long time to make up my mind im in no hurry to leave

breathe new life into the 50yearold endeavor one of the three 
remaining jclass sailboats 
five years and 10 million later endeavor is racing again 
jboats are to sailors what mount everest is to climbers 
says meyer 36 a lifelong yachtswoman who spent more than 20 years 
following the jclass yachts ive always been in love with their 
history 
only 10 jclass sloops were ever built the last in 1937 the 
endeavor which had eight owners in its 55 years and two others 
are left 
when the 130foot boat that challenged for the americas cup in 
1934 came up for sale it was berthed at calshot spit england 
wrecked out of the water it once ruled so gracefully 
when i saw endeavor i said somebody has to do 
something meyer says she decided in a thunderclap that she 
was the one to undertake the challenge 
i didnt hesitate and i havent regretted it she says 
meyer the granddaughter of financier eugene meyer jr a former 
owner of the washington post could certainly afford the whim 
in order to do something like that properly it takes a lot 
more than money it takes a lot of attention to detail thats what 
i gave it and thats what the people i hired gave it she says 
meyer has the sense of quality to not just get things right 
but make them perfect says gary jobson a member of the team 
that defended the 1977 americas cup and recently skippered the 
endeavor off newport this boat is nicer now than it ever was 
meyer would not disclose the negligible sum she paid for the 
boat its former owners paid approximately 16 for it in 1979 when 
it no longer floated 
among those who helped meyer rebuild endeavor was frank murdock 
one of the boats original designers and crew 
meyer also met with sir thomas sopwith for whom the endeavor 
was built in 1934 although he was interested in her undertaking 
sopwith who died in january told her that the boat was 
ridiculous then and theyre worse now according to meyer 
he told her it was a monstrosity wild and dangerous meyer 
however says that when she sailed the endeavor she found the boat 
to have very good manners 
i was not prepared for how good she was says meyer she 
was quick and responsive its just so much fun to sail that boat 
the monstrosity boasts a solid cherry interior and carved marble 
fireplace 
its the jboat aesthetics as seen by elizabeth meyer she 
says beauty took precedence over safety good sense 
practicality because the prime function of a jboat is to be 
beautiful and sail wicked good 
jobson calls the endeavor the finest yacht in the world 
donald trumps yacht is a statement in glitz its 
expensive its big the endeavor is a statement of excellence 
he says 
meyer moved to england for 18 months while the ship was rebuilt 
and oversaw the reconstruction of the hull the weather was 
miserable and it was often difficult to get supplies for work on 
the boat 
it was hard a lot of the time but i never wanted to sell the 
boat get rid of it or walk away from it meyer says 
meyer says it was necessary for the sake of the boat that she 
be the sole voice in its rebuilding 
a group cant do a boat like this its got to have one owner 
who calls the shots and pays the money you have to assume you know 
whats right the minute you start to wonder you fall apart 
but while stern and decisive on the outside meyer says there were 
many nights when she cried herself to sleep 
things are easier now on the endeavor 
you go below offwatch to the air conditioning take a hot 
bath watch the vcr meyer says 
but even in the luxury below are reminders of the trying times 
in the boats salon above the 10place dining room table hangs 
a friends painting of a flying pig embellished with the caption 
endeavor when pigs fly

mario lanza died 30 years ago but his legacy is 
still going strong it lives on in fan clubs that are still active 
records that still sell and a neighborhood that still fondly 
remembers the man known as the new caruso 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thirty years have passed since the death of 
mario lanza the curly haired movie star with the booming tenor 
voice that earned him the nickname the new caruso 
but memories of lanza live on in his fan clubs in his 
records which still sell briskly and especially in his old 
neighborhood the little italy section of south philadelphia where 
opera once was as popular as baseball in brooklyn 
lanza was just 38 when he died of a heart attack on oct 7 
1959 10 years after the opening of the first of his seven movies 
but you see it didnt really end there says nicholas 
petrella who owned a corner record store in lanzas old 
neighborhood he did 38 a day in business until lanza came home a 
star that day petrella did over 4000 
today he is president of the mario lanza institute and museum 
on the third floor of the settlement music school where lanza 
studied violin and piano as a boy the voice that he had and his 
spirit still live today right here in philadelphia all over the 
world petrella says 
the only son of immigrant parents lanza was born alfredo arnold 
cocozza in 1921 the same year opera lovers mourned carusos 
passing a member of his old neighborhood gang recalled freddie 
cocozza as loud and raucous a superb athlete who loved the 
summer beaches of wildwood nj 
lanza grew up listening to the family collection of caruso 
records his voice began to develop and one day he sang along with 
the great tenors recording of vesti la giubba 
to my utter amazement i found i could reach the high notes 
with comparative ease i was overjoyed my heart was bursting 
lanza said years later 
his mother had wanted to be an opera singer a career denied 
proper young ladies so maria lanza married instead 
according to her sisters julia alioto and hilda lanza it was 
she who encouraged her son to choose hollywood over the opera he 
thanked her by adopting her maiden name and the masculine form of 
her first name 
the singer had little formal training enrico rosatti a 
wellknown teacher of the old school once told lanza no one can 
teach you to sing my boy you had the greatest teacher of all 
god 
at his grandfathers summer home in wildwood however he took 
lessons from a blind man named paul bosco godfather to the lanza 
brood 
years later hollywood hype held that lanza had been a truck 
driver and piano mover prior to his movie career he never worked 
like that a day in his life said his uncle arnold lanza but he 
did pose as a piano mover to get into the philadelphia academy of 
music for an impromptu audition the ruse worked conductor serge 
koussevitsky took him to the berkshire music festival 
world war ii made him a private in the army air corps in texas 
a bad eye kept him away from combat he discovered special services 
and decided to try for the winged victory show his throat was 
sore the day of the audition so he ripped the label from a caruso 
record and submitted it as his own 
also in the show was actor bert hicks who introduced lanza to 
his sister betty they later married and had four children 
discharged back in new york the singer met rca vice president 
jim murray and signed a record contract with the same company that 
had recorded caruso lanza also later hired carusos old agent 
ultimately he decided he could reach many more through films than 
from the stage and he performed only one opera madame 
butterfly with the grand opera in new orleans 
in hollywood terry robinson was given the job of helping lanza 
trim pounds for the camera he also became a close friend when 
lanzas wife died in march 1960 robinson and his late friends 
parents raised their four children 
there are so many things to remember robinson said the 
nights when mario would take one of the girls and i would take the 
other then we would go up the stairs to their bedrooms as he sang 
to them the nights he was out and the maid would play one of his 
records so they would sleep a 50 tip to a waitress and picking up 
the lunch checks of those who recognized him 
in 1950 lanza filmed the toast of new orleans followed in 
1951 by the box office smash the great caruso lanzas 
favorite he threw himself into the role even gaining weight to 
match the accounts of carusos growing bulk 
for me the film was an unbelievable dream come true he 
said 
two more movies followed because youre mine and 
serenade he then got into a fight with mgm over the student 
prince and was replaced the movie was a flop although the 
soundtrack featuring lanza was an album smash but concerts were 
canceled due to health and other problems his managers allowed him 
to sink into debt and friends turned away from him 
he and his family fled to italy in 1957 where he made two more 
movies the hills of rome and for the first time concert 
tours sold out as quickly as they were announced 
at the time of his death lanzas comeback was well under way 
his body lay in state in philadelphia and thousands filed past 
holding the funeral home open until 3 am antionette marzano 71 
an old family friend collapsed and died after passing the casket 
lanza was buried in los angeles near the tomb of comic lou 
costello 
today 30 years later lanzas legacy includes scholarships for 
young singers financed by an annual ball held each november 
his records also survive and rca continues to sell them 
updating them now into compact disks they yield about 100000 a 
year in royalties 
mario lanza fan clubs are still active in orlando fla 
banbury england pflugersstr germany budapest hungary dublin 
ireland and new zealand 
none of the lanza children followed him into show business but 
two of todays bestknown tenors luciano pavarotti and placido 
domingo both claim lanza as an inspiration and two scholarship 
winners are now regular performers of opera petrella says 
if theres one wish i could have its that i want him always 
to be heard and to be appreciated said lanzas daughter lisa 
bergman of los angeles i just feel he should go on and on

james earl jones who plays a pool hall owner in 
third and oak the pool hall has a pool table in his suburban 
home he piles books on it but in case his 6yearold son ever 
wants to learn to play its there 
third and oak the pool hall a threecharacter play by 
marsha norman will be shown on the aampe cable network on thursday 
at 9 pm est and again on sunday nov 5 its the first of four 
onehour plays by pulitzer prizewinning playwrights to be shown on 
aampe on the first thursday of four months as american playwrights 
theater a gm mark of excellence presentation 
at first jones wasnt sure he wanted to play the character he 
says since he likes to portray people who whether or not theyre 
poor are worthwhile that was the problem here i had to accept 
he was a jerk im playing not a villain but not a right guy i had 
to readjust my thinking 
he is one of the blind ones i defined troy maxson in fences 
jones played maxson on broadway as a man who didnt distinguish 
his principles from his prejudices this is such a man he seemed 
gratuitously racialist if not racist when it came to references to 
people outside his race particularly to the girl who visits the 
pool hall she is blond she qualifies in his eyes for derision 
i had a problem with that i dont like to promote gratuitous 
racialism at all 
i had to understand that white people had never meant anything 
good to him he cant understand how on a romantic level they can 
mean something good to the man he thinks of essentially as his son 
he cant see shared genuine affection and love between people who 
come from different worlds he cant see she is as desperate as the 
young man is and their desperation is very similar they resolve it 
without having a messy affair as my character had been afraid 
my character whos in a closed society behaves as if hes a 
mafia don he expects obedience and the mantle to be passed 
mario van peebles star of the tv series sonny spoon and 
debra cole act with jones 
marsha norman won the pulitzer prize in 1983 for night 
mother the other playwrights in the series are eugene oneill 
paul zindel and tennessee williams 
having been around a long time doesnt mean good scripts are 
going to come flowing your way in excess jones says there are 
more good actors than good works 
but jones stays busy he was a poet in the film field of 
dreams played civil rights leader vernon jordan in the first 
saturday night with connie chung docudrama on nbctv and 
recently narrated ivory wars about african elephants on the 
discovery channel 
he has made several movies not yet released since field of 
dreams i have a 6yearold i have to keep working i dont 
make multimillions per movie i dont think anybody should frankly 
i like the young crowd of actors coming up the young man who 
played my son in fences courtney vance is in hamburger hill 
its on cable this week ive seen it five times to see his 
scenes hes a phenomenal actor he ranks with young actors like 
eric roberts terence booth alec baldwin kevin costner theyre 
strong without being macho bulls theyre strong as people 
next jones goes to louisiana to play the man who runs the 
company store in the movie convicts the wardrobe mistress told 
him to bring clothes he wore in matewan which was about coal 
miners in the 1920s 
some moviegoers recognized his voice as darth vader in star 
wars though the credits listed the actor inside the costume and 
helmet using his voice was an afterthought after the movie was 
shot jones says i didnt feel it was proper for me to take 
credit i had been a member of the board of directors of the 
academy of motion pictures arts and sciences when mercedes 
mccambridges voice was in linda blairs body in the exorcist 
i didnt want to get involved with that sort of thing again i 
denied it during the whole exposure of the first episode i took 
credit in the third return of the jedi because i was going to 
be bumped off 
when a criticism that black voices shouldnt be used for 
villains is quoted jones explosively utters a barnyard word 
thats a racialist point of view as destructive limiting and 
negative as racism is i heard a lot of it thats when black 
people who need a platform cant find anything better to talk 
about thats embarrassing there are a lot of really important 
issues and they had to light on that to talk about 
jones whose training was on stage mostly acts in movies and tv 
now the energy factor gets more and more difficult im not 
happy unless i have a role thats totally engaging i commit for 
more than six months and i get burned out if i did a small part 
id be happier but i wouldnt be able to make a living from it 
so i will do less stage work only special things and probably 
short engagements i think my days of commercial theater are 
probably coming to an end ill go to pasture in movies and tv 
but he wont retire jones says when we stop doing we stop 
being most actors can keep functioning till they cant walk any 
more spencer tracy couldnt hear but kept functioning 
he says with a laugh that hes considering modifying his rich 
deep voice for tv commercials i just finished doing the voice of 
a car they wanted a kind of darth vader voice i did enjoy doing 
those commercials i will have to look for another road to do 
commercials maybe some squeaky voice i dont know

right now the days and nights of televisions 
molly dodd also known as actress blair brown are spent on a 
shabby block of west 47th street at broadways ethel barrymore 
theatre 
shes starring in the secret rapture a new play by british 
playwright david hare her boyfriend the drama was written 
specifically for brown for blair as ever says hares 
dedication and she plays one of its three choice female roles 
it tells of two sisters brown and frances conroy who return 
home after the death of their father and who must deal with their 
lives as well as the life of their alcoholic stepmother mary beth 
hurt marion played by conroy is an ambitious junior minister in 
the thatcher government and isobel the role played by brown is 
an ineffectual but wellintentioned graphic designer 
the secret rapture was a big hit at englands national 
theatre where it was performed by a different cast and with a 
different director hare does the honors here 
whats hard for some people about davids plays is that they 
are not manuals about how to live brown says everyone in 
them not unlike life is a mixture of good and bad strengths and 
weaknesses and thats sometimes difficult for mass american 
audiences to accept 
shes confident that new york theatergoers wont have trouble 
relating to very english characters and will have an easier time 
picking up on the family drama than the british politics 
so many of the characters sound very american like marion 
who is a real achiever or her husband tom a christian 
businessman brown says i thought the united states had the 
corner on that profession and that they were all southern 
whether the secret rapture will succeed on broadway brown 
doesnt know but she has an affection for the character she plays 
isobel is a woman sensitive to a certain kind of emotional 
blackmail probably a person whos living her life according to the 
path of least resistance the actress says she is not a 
victim she hangs on to her own integrity but to a fault isobel 
is a good daughter 
not unlike the slightly bewildered woman brown plays on the 
television series the days and nights of molly dodd now seen 
on lifetime a cable channel 
molly dodds history is worthy of soap opera if not sitcom 
it began more than two years ago with producer jay tarses for 
whom brown had done a television pilot that abc decided not to pick 
up they had gotten along immediately 
we had the same sense of humor he was so twisted brown 
laughs 
then brandon tarikoff of nbc called jay and without ever 
mentioning the mary word said he wanted to do a series about a 
single woman in the big city she recalls 
what tarses came up with was molly dodd which premiered on 
nbc during the summer of 1987 despite cheers from the critics it 
never lived up to the networks expectations what nbc got was an 
unusual comedy in which molly struggled to cope with her mother 
exhusband sister various boyfriends and life some of the time 
she didnt succeed 
the show moved from time slot to time slot eventually was cast 
off by nbc and picked up by lifetime and instead of being filmed 
in los angeles molly dodd is now done in new york where its 
production team can take advantage of the citys theater people 
the pool of actors here is much grittier much more 
interesting brown says now we have a little theatrical rep 
company 
most of the shows scripts are written by playwright eric 
overmyer author of on the verge and directed by don scardino 
a veteran theater performer who will direct the play a few good 
men on broadway later this season 
everyone took a salary cut when the show moved to cable because 
the licensing fees are less 
but it was worth it brown says whats your choice not 
to do it because you are going to make more money doing something 
you dont like 
the size of the audience on cable is smaller too we were 
worried viewers wouldnt be able to find us but people still 
recognize brown on the street 
its nice but then molly is kind of a benevolent personality 
its not like judy carnes sockittome girl on laugh in they 
dont want to see how tough i am they basically think im their 
neighbor 
and most dont think of her as a theater actress audiences 
dont realize that before there was the days and nights of molly 
dodd or movies like continental divide with john belushi or 
tv miniseries like kennedy and captains and the kings 
there was the stage 
brown a native of washington dc has extensive and 
impressive credits starting with her training at the national 
theatre of canada she ended up working at the shakespeare festival 
in stratford ontario and in regional theaters across canada and 
the united states including two seasons at the guthrie in 
minneapolis 
i was an ingenue so i could always get work because i looked 
the right way she says 
a couple years ago i was going in for an audition and i could 
see this director thinking oh this is a television actress im 
going to cross over she says i wanted to take him by the 
throat and yell look at my credits 
brown was given six months off from molly dodd to do the 
secret rapture if it runs long enough shell leave the play 
next february to resume production of the television series 
its very rare to have this much good material to do 
especially material that is written for you brown says so 
its just bad sportsmanship to complain just keep your mouth shut 
and count your lucky stars because it will soon be over

knocking on doors in the early 
evening just before people settle down to watch soap operas 
imported from brazil the polite campaign workers ask citizens how 
they are going to vote in nicaraguas presidential election 
then they make a smooth pitch for the fsln the sandinista 
national liberation front which has run the country since 1979 
at a news conference on a sunny morning at the foreign 
correspondents club president daniel ortega answers questions 
with quotable wellrehearsed phrases in his quest for reelection 
afterwards everyone is handed a yellow tshirt with daniel 
presidente on the front and vota por fsln vote for the fsln 
in back pinned to each shirt is the name of the recipient neatly 
written in ink on a square of paper 
if nicaraguas presidential election feb 25 hinges on 
organization party discipline and attention to detail the 
sandinistas have a decided edge at this stage of the campaign 
their main challenger a coalition called the national 
opposition union has been relying on rallies campaign appearances 
and the newspaper la prensa published by its presidential 
candidate violeta barrios de chamarro 
nobodys going to vote for dona violeta because of a 
tshirt said antonio lacayo mrs chamorros soninlaw and 
campaign manager 
in contrast to the sandinistas the opposition is fractured into 
20 parties 12 of them supporting mrs chamorro the sandinistas 
have more and better television ads a neighborhood organization 
that knows the registration status of every household and the power 
and patronage of a governing party 
the sandinistas have painted walls with red and black signs 
reading daniel or fsln 
the oppositions most pervasive slogans are white painted 
graffiti that read uno equals democracy uno are the spanish 
initials of the opposition coalition 
our resources dont allow us great projects said lacayo 
who is taking six months off from running a company that produces 
cooking oil 
lacayo denies sandinista accusations that 5 million has entered 
nicaragua secretly to finance the opposition he said uno has 
received only meager donations from exiled nicaraguans along with 
a few loudspeakers three taperecorders batteries and an 
electricity generator 
but he said he isnt worried 
unos most important tasks now are to make sure the voter 
registration stations are well watched and to make people lose 
their fear he said 
fear indeed is evident 
wed better not talk about that why look for problems said 
a 72yearold woman when asked what she thought of the opposition 
like other potential voters she talked to a reporter only on 
condition that her name not be used 
four sundays in october were set aside for voter registration 
reporters who surveyed registration posts found uno and other 
opposition party representatives at about half of them the 
sandinistas were represented at all of those surveyed an estimated 
19 million people are eligible to register 
we have 40000 militants workers said the sandinista 
campaign manager bayardo arce we dont think the problem here 
is money what is important is the work we do house by house 
in a country where no single radio or tv station reaches the 
whole country and where most people cant read dont have access 
to or just plain cant afford a newspaper the surest way to reach 
each voter is facetoface 
with 40000 workers the sandinistas have one worker for every 
40 voters expected to register lacayo says uno has 16000 
sympathizers nationwide who help with rallies and encourage people 
to vote for uno 
in one lowerclass managua neighborhood a housewife and mother 
of two said sandinista campaign workers had come three times to her 
house she has seen no sign of the opposition 
the first time they asked us to register said the woman 
then they came again and said youre going to vote for the 
sandinista front right 
i said sure im not going to argue with these people but i 
told them everything is too expensive and the government is 
responsible they said it was the fault of yankee aggression 
that doesnt mean she will vote for mrs chamorro 
that woman doesnt know anything about anything the woman 
said 
the 72yearold woman said sandinista workers came by her house 
in august 
i told them i needed reading glasses because i dont have 
money to buy them she said they wrote my name down and said 
they would get me some 
the woman was amused when asked if she got the glasses 
look she relied these people have been promising us 
everything for 10 years and what have they given us 
while the sandinistas knock on doors uno has marches 
ortega tyrant your time is coming near is a uno chant 
heard frequently 
the campaign on television although less important is another 
contrast the opposition is given 30 minutes a night divided up 
among nine candidates so uno gets 10 minutes every three nights 
the uno ads show speakers assailing the sandinista governments 
economic performance the countrys economy is the most depressed 
in the hemisphere according to some experts 
the sandinistas time on tv is virtually unlimited and their 
ads produced in mexico sometimes appear during the most popular 
of the brazilian soap operas on the stateowned television 
this is a david and goliath confrontation said a uno 
campaign source who requested anonymity we cant fight like 
goliath so weve got to save our one shot for when it counts and 
then hit with all our might 
he added that the coalition was holding off its main effort 
until the final stretch 
money isnt everything even with all the money the gringos 
can give the human material is not here he said 
the people who have the organizational skills to make a party 
work have fled to the united states in the 10 years since the 
sandinistas toppled dictator anastasio somoza the source said 
with their advantage as the government party the sandinistas 
have been trying to coopt sectors that have threatened to drift 
away because of the economic crisis 
nationwide wildcat strikes by teachers last march were the first 
serious labor unrest this year after ortega announced a tough 
austerity program in january to combat runaway inflation ortega 
granted a 40 percent pay raise and the teachers fell back into line 
next came a strike by taxi drivers who protested a doubling of 
gasoline prices the government started distributing new 
sovietmade lada cars to replace a fleet of old brokendown 
usmade cars 
the sandinistas got 64 percent of the vote in the last election 
in november 1984 and arce says they will be pleased if they can do 
as well again 
any percentage above 60 percent is good and will push the 
revolutionary process forward arce said

framed by two crooked narcs and sentenced to six years in 
prison jimmy rainwood enters the vicious world of californias 
oroville state prison he is preyed upon by the hardened cons 
especially jingles who threatens to make rainwood the gangs 
pet 
veteran convict virgil cane advises jimmy that the only way to 
avoid degradation and probable death is to kill jingles a moral 
man jimmy battles his conscience should he kill or allow himself 
to be destroyed he kills 
the moral dilemma is not fully addressed in an innocent man 
his prison experience and the harassment of the two cops on his 
release turn jimmy into a creature of revenge and revenge is what 
sells movie tickets these days 
despite the skirting of issues an innocent man succeeds as 
an action melodrama peter yates who practically invented the 
carchase genre with bullit is an expert of hardedged action 
he has the advantage of a firstrate cast headed by the reliable 
tom selleck 
selleck has rarely displayed such depth of feeling behind the 
titles he is seen as the surehanded airline maintenance manager 
who wont allow a jetliner into the air before it has been 
thoroughly checked out because of an error in addresses narcotics 
officers david rasche and richard young raid his house and wound 
him in the process 
bewildered by the judicial process that believes the lying cops 
selleck is at first a meek prisoner then he makes his crucial 
decision and he becomes a hero to the inmates 
the prison sequences are the most gripping part of the film 
less convincing is sellecks complicated plot of revenge it ends 
with the carbashing cannonading and explosions that are standard 
in this genre 
sellecks strong performance is greatly enhanced by the work of 
f murray abraham as the proudly amoral con he delivers his prison 
philosophy with a cobralike confidence laila robins is properly 
sympathetic in the twodimensional role as sellecks wife david 
rasche looking like an overage surfer makes a marvelously 
sinister villain 
you might think that selleck would go to the police when the two 
bad cops threaten him and manhandle his wife after his prison 
release but thats not the way it works in revenge movies 
an innocent man is a touchstone picture written by larry 
brothers and produced by ted field and robert w cort rated r for

popular songs and irish ballads emi john mccormack 
 
john mccormack made his opera and recording debut in 1904 at age 
21 he left the opera stage 19 years later but continued making 
records and recital appearances for two more decades along the 
way he became one of the concert worlds first true superstars a 
stage idol who collected milliondollar salaries race horses 
homes and old master paintings but who never lost his feel for the 
popular music his concert audiences loved 
this son of ireland though a terrible opera actor was a 
tremendous artist whose vocal glory was renowned it was the great 
violinist fritz kreisler or in some versions jan kubelik who said 
mccormack had a stradivarius in his throat sounds beautiful 
sounds poured out effortlessly 
this emi rerelease under the series great recordings of the 
century an odd title since records havent been made in any 
other century presents the songs that his mass public loved and 
that mccormack loved to sing they range from 1930 to 1941 with 
one from 1908 the incomparable accompanist gerald moore appears on 
11 tracks 
the listener must have a bent for irish ballads or surrender

this disc if either is the case it can only delight 
the extremely generous program 23 songs at 7303 gives the 
range of the popularmusic mccormack the garden where the 
praties grow is a typical lighthearted ditty of the old sod 
mccormack sings a melancholy ballad of parting in terences 
farewell to kathleen in the charming off to philadelphia 
the tenor is the happygolucky immigrant who lately took the 
notion for to cross the briny ocean 
a more perfect interpretation of jeanie with the light brown

a sad story about mccormack who died in 1945 is told by henry 
pleasants in his book the great singers towards the end of 
his life when nothing but the records was left he would play them 
again and again exclaiming happily and a bit wistfully possibly 
a bit incredulously i was a damned good singer wasnt i 
he was even in the recordings made in his mid50s the timeless 
mccormack sounds like a brave lad about to step ashore in america

good evening warner bros marshall crenshaw 
 
singersongwriter marshall crenshaws bright and bouncy 
guitarbased tunes seem readymade for the top 40 but seven years 
after the release of a stunning debut album hes still looking for 
a commercial breakthrough 
so on good evening crenshaw turns to outside sources for 
half of the 10 songs the result is some of his best performances 
yet richard thompsons valerie bobby fullers let her 
dance and john hiatts someplace where love cant find me 
crenshaws own songs are strong too especially the lovely she 
hates to go home 
but artistically crenshaws problem has been the way he is 
recorded rather than his material crenshaw albums usually sound 
as though something is wrong with the stereo 
that hasnt changed on good evening instead of a clean 
sparse texture that would serve these hookfilled pop songs best 
crenshaw opts for a dense sometimes muddy sound the blatting bass 
and hissing cymbals mar an otherwise fine record

after 30 years of lending support to everyone 
from elizabeth taylor to cary grant martin landau has traveled a 
dizzying route to screen prominence from francis coppola to woody 
allen 
last year he astounded reviewers with his performance as jeff 
bridges reliable financial adviser abe karatz in tucker the 
man and his dream academy voters too they gave landau a 
nomination as supporting actor 
now he plays the central figure in allens comedydrama crimes 
and misdemeanors he portrays a highly respected ophthalmologist 
and benefactor who becomes involved in the murder of his mistress 
anjelica huston 
at 55 martin landau remains dazzled at the career happenings of 
the past two years its miraculous im very pleased that i have 
been given a sort of resurrection a renaissance im very happy 
about it 
landau first heard of the crimes and misdemeanors role when 
an allen aide called from new york landau asked to see a script 
not realizing that woody allen scripts are accorded the secrecy of 
the stealth bomber 
i was flown to new york and met with woody landau recalled 
he then had the script sent to the hotel the whole script which 
was unusual most actors get to read only their parts it was so 
powerful that it jumped off the page a tremendous impact so many 
resonating feelings 
i had another meeting with him the next day we talked and he 
hired me that day i was fitted for wardrobe before i went back to 
california i returned for makeup and wardrobe tests then we began 
a rather intense collaboration 
the role is very complicated and yet very delicate almost 
like lacework i felt very strongly that the audience had to 
empathize and identify with this character what he does is awful 
and unless you can take the trip with him its very easy to get 
turned off by this guy 
crimes and misdemeanors is an ensemble film like hannah 
and her sisters but with dark overtones allen mia farrow alan 
alda and joanna gleason carry the lighter elements and landau 
huston sam waterston claire bloom and jerry orbach enact the 
dramatic portions 
the perpetrators of the crime are not punished for their deed 
so what is the lesson here 
i think what woody is basically saying is that people must be 
responsible for their acts landau said in this day and age 
there are people who are not responsible for what they do the 
world is in bad shape because of that 
in the 40s this man would have had a moment of truth and 
come around and say i made a terrible mistake and i atone 
woody knows very well that there are people who do things that are 
less than honorable and go on living with those things 
having worked for such great directors as alfred hitchcock 
north by northwest joseph l mankiewicz cleopatra and 
george stevens the greatest story ever told landau was 
intrigued by the allen style 
he does long flowing takes not the usual kind of filmmaking 
which is the master shot overtheshoulders and singles he 
said as a result its a wonderful platform for an actor to do 
four or five or sixpage scenes at a clip where everything you do 
is going to be in the film ninetyeight percent is not good 
enough the other 2 percent makes it less than perfect and woody 
is a perfectionist 
martin landau was a brooklyn boy who started in the newspaper 
business at 17 as a cartoonist for the new york daily news he left 
the paper to begin the precarious search for an acting career the 
turning point came when he competed with 500 others to study with 
the actors studio only he and steve mcqueen were chosen 
landaus career grew with broadway plays and live television 
drama while he was touring with edward g robinson in middle of 
the night he won the villainous role in north by northwest 
besides supporting roles in films he starred with his exwife 
barbara bain in the tv series mission impossible and space 
1999 
the state of his career before tucker 
i was working which is always a blessing because i wasnt 
waiting on tables or driving a cab he said but i wasnt 
getting any roles that called on very much of me i always think of 
roles as a pie and what i was getting was a very small slice just 
a sliver just playing an outandout heavy in a mindless 
actionadventure film theres not a lot you can do with that 
youre a sort of functionary in the context of that 
for a lot of years i was stuck in that sort of mode there was 
a lot of frustration even though i was working as an actor i felt 
i wasnt using a lot that i had francis coppola opened the door 
for me in giving me a character that had a lot of dimension a lot 
of places to go im very grateful

when mo dafeng was a young boy he found 
himself attracted to what was a very precarious occupation in his 
native china he wanted to be like his father an artist and 
become a painter 
when i was probably 5 years old i liked drawing cars and the 
trains and the airplanes especially some american fighters he 
said 
but his father who had seen many of his artist friends banished 
to the countryside in 1957 because of their political views tried 
to channel his sons talent into other pursuits 
my father thought any son should not be an artist the 
32yearold mo recalled he thought i should be an architect 
mo however wasnt to be denied he studied oil painting and 
stage design at the peoples liberation army art institute in 
beijing eventually becoming an official army artist 
given his status in the army his early work was restricted to 
propaganda pieces and theater sets one of his assignments took him 
to the front lines of the border war between china and vietnam in 
1979 
if you want to become famous you have to paint history 
military paintings he said 
since leaving the army in 1983 hes used his canvas to capture 
scenes of personal significance riverfronts and cityscapes but 
never portraits the result is that mo is now considered by some 
collectors as one of the leading contemporary realism artists 
in china 
nine of his oil paintings are included in an exhibit of chinese 
contemporary realist paintings at the greenwich workshop inc 
gallery in the southport section of fairfield 
david p usher greenwich workshop president defined 
contemporary realism as paintings you can look at and you know 
what it is 
a total of 110 paintings from 30 chinese artists are included in 
the current show the paintings were selected from among 400 put on 
display earlier this year at the nanjing exhibition in china 
the paintings are bright bold and feature optimistic themes 
including landscapes portraits and posterstyle works that are 
markedly different from the traditional chinese ink and watercolor 
paintings done on rice paper 
i was amazed by the quality of the painting said usher who 
personally selected the pieces on exhibit during a visit to china 
when people think of chinese painting they think of birds 
bamboo and the mountains it was a little like andrew wyeth and 
norman rockwell going to china 
the contemporary realism style traces its roots to french 
academic realism and avantegarde styles and to the soviet style of 
socialist reform some of its more familiar examples are the huge 
patriotic or propaganda murals visible in major squares 
the exhibit is the second for greenwich workshop an art 
publishing firm it held an earlier exhibit of chinese paintings in 
november 1988 and had sales exceeding 250000 the exhibit also 
led to the introduction of limited edition prints which have sold 
well since their introduction this spring 
usher said his company is the only one in this country to 
maintain its ties with chinese artists many other firms severed 
their ties with the artists after the army crushed the student 
prodemocracy movement in beijings tiananmen square in june 
only one of the paintings in the current exhibit can be 
interpreted as making a statement on the tiananmen incident the 
painting by huang zhong yang shows a child releasing a dove from 
captivity 
we made the conscious effort to keep working with them 
usher said in all honesty i guess were a lifeline to the 
artists and if we stop doing what were doing there would be no 
exposure or market for their work 
the continuing relationship was made possible under an agreement 
usher reached in may with chinas cultural affairs ministry and the 
china artists association an elite organization representing about 
7000 artists the agreement established a network by which chinese 
art would pass through the greenwich workshop to about 1400 
dealers in the united states canada and britain 
both artists and the chinese government receive a share of the 
profits from sales said liu kuifang director of the china project 
for greenwich workshop 
the business connection is very important to chinese artists 
who while supported by the government dont learn how to market 
or exhibit their work abroad there is no market in china 
out of the 400 you could have put about 80 in any gallery in 
the world usher said 
mos contributions to the exhibit depict the river communities 
near his parents home his family lives in south china where mos 
father mo pu is the retired head of the hung zhou academy the 
countrys oldest art academy 
the color the river its very beautiful mo said 
landscape is one of my favorite objects if you want to find 
people to pose everyone is too busy 
mo who has been a professional artist since age 18 currently 
is a graduate student at the pratt institute in new york city 
where he is studying western art and artists he expects to 
complete his studies in about two years and then return to china to 
put his new skills into practice 
as artist in china its very hard they have knowledge but 
most artists know how to survive he said

boy george the androgynous former president 
of culture club is trying to climb back up the pop charts after 
surviving the crushing downers of heroin addiction and the overdose 
deaths of two friends 
im totally relaxed about my life he says declaring a new 
state of mind im totally relaxed about what i am and what i do 
and what i feel 
boy george has come to the united states on a temporary visa 
the first time he has been allowed to do so since his 1986 
conviction for heroin possession in england 
the conviction which led to the disintegration of the 
hitmaking culture club one year later forced the singer into a 
rehabilitation program treatment was complicated by the 
drugrelated deaths of two close friends one at boy georges 
london mansion 
during a recent visit to los angeles boy george whose real 
name is george odowd described himself as happy and healthy 
with an understanding that life isnt always perfect 
i think a lot of the things that happen to me are 
selfcreated he said there are still days when i get out of 
the bed on the wrong side and everything goes wrong that happens 
to all of us 
his current solo album high hat was released to favorable 
reviews earlier this year but didnt get much airplay in this 
country he hopes his us visit will spur interest in a 
soontobereleased single whisper 
the singles previously released from the album were quite 
funky and didnt appeal to top 40 radio stations he said he 
also believes some radio programmers dont think the public can 
forgive him for his past problems 
but boy george doesnt seem concerned that his popularity might 
have waned over the past three years 
i have a place in the music industry he said i have a 
really good following a loyal following i think you really cant 
ask for more than that 
now 28 boy george hit the music scene at the start of the 
decade as a backup singer with the british group bow wow wow in 
those days he was known as lieutenant lush he eventually formed 
his own group the sex gang children which later evolved into the 
internationally successful quartet culture club boy george assumed 
the role as the groups most visible member attracting attention 
with gobs of makeup and a smoothassilk voice in a 6foot frame 
if you look at the pop industry not a lot of people stick out 
as being particularly interesting he said i think at the time 
we were the most colorful thing happening 
culture clubs four albums kissing to be clever colour 
by numbers waking up with the house on fire and from 
luxury to heartache quickly became topsellers in the first 
half of the 1980s this was largely due to a unique style that 
combined pop funk reggae and soul 
boy george however remains humble when it comes to culture 
clubs popularity 
we were really lucky we were just in the right place at the 
right time he said its a bit like trying to catch a taxi 
but the culture clubs taxi took a wrong turn 
in july 1986 boy george was arrested in london for heroin 
possession he pleaded guilty to the charge was fined 370 and 
agreed to enter a treatment program for his drug addiction 
shortly after his conviction michael rudetski a friend and 
colleague died at the singers london mansion from a heroin 
overdose boy george was not home at the time however and no 
additional criminal charges were brought against him 
then on dec 20 1986 boy george and pal mark golding were 
arrested for marijuana possession outside a london nightclub the 
next day golding a 20yearold musician was found dead in his 
apartment from a drug overdose 
boy george was never connected to the death but he received a 
warning for the marijuana charge 
he is sensitive to questions about those troubled times 
asked what he has learned from those painful experiences he 
said i think its very difficult to put into words there are 
certain things that i feel that i couldnt possibly explain without 
making it sound really futile 
nonetheless the quickwitted star found a bit of humor in the 
ordeal which unfolded across the pages of the tabloids 
i used to think being in the papers was proof i was good he 
joked 
since that time he has been working to recoup his health his 
career and ultimately his life it took me maybe 2 years to get 
over it and thats a long time especially for someone like me 
because i wanted to work and i wanted to get out and do things it 
was hard 
sitting in his hotel room in hollywood boy george looked fit 
and content in a tshirt sweat pants and clunky hightop sneakers 
he appeared nothing like the old boy george who favored flowing 
caftans and ballet shoes 
his hair was crewcut and naturally light brown and during the 
interview he was without the customary cosmetics but he emphasized 
he would be made up after lunch and insisted he wasnt toning down 
his look 
i still wear makeup and as far as i know i still stand out 
in a crowd he said when i get on a lift people still look at 
me so i guess i must be doing something right 
he is jokingly critical of other male groups especially rock 
n roll bands that have adopted makeup and teased hair 
you look at these heavy metal bands they look like a bunch 
of ugly old women at least when i dressed up i looked good he 
said with a smirk 
but boy george isnt all jokes when it comes to his persona and 
career he is a serious businessman in england he has an 
independent record label more protein which releases some of his 
work as well as the music of others he also is in a new group 
called jesus loves you and hopes to eventually record enough songs 
with the band to release an album 
in the meantime hes sneaking around rumors that culture club 
might get back together 
theres a possibility well make an album together but at the 
moment its a possibility he said basically if the songs are 
good well do it if theyre not good we wont do it 
he says he still has discouraging days and now must take his 
life one step at a time the thing that keeps him going is his 
music whether it is successful or not 
im a songwriter i love singing and music is my life its 
not a means to and end for me he said then added with a smile 
im not making records so i can afford to keep up my mortgage

writer bill bryson wanted to tell the 
good folks of britain something about america in doing so he told 
americans something about themselves 
bryson the son of a sports writer drove through 38 states in 
his mothers chevy chevette to compile the material for his 
recently published book the lost continent its a witty 
insightful look into the united states poking fun at everything 
from southerners and recreational vehicles to historical markers 
and his own family 
it also speaks of what bryson enjoyed about america places such 
as the grand canyon zion national park gettysburg pa and 
charleston sc 
it was a fabulous experience bryson said in an interview 
it was something i had wanted a chance to do and almost nobody 
has a chance to go out and see the whole country all at once 
i cant believe how lucky i was to be able to do it not only 
to go back to all of the places that i wanted to but to go to 
places id never seen and to be paid to do it 
bryson who lives in england returned to des moines for his 
fathers funeral in 1987 as he and his brother and sister were 
reminiscing about their family vacations he was struck by the 
thought that america had become a foreign land to him he decided 
to retrace family vacations to find out how the country had changed 
after receiving several rejections from publishing houses a 
small british publisher secker amp warburg bought the rights for 
about 10000 it was just enough to cover brysons expenses 
one of the publishers who originally rejected the lost 
continent was harper amp row which eventually bought the us 
rights for 375000 harper amp rows rejection slip is in a frame 
hanging above brysons desk 
bryson said the american firm has been goodnatured about its 
earlier rejection and to his surprise made few changes in the 
book 
i thought i was writing a very small book for a british 
publisher he said i thought i was explaining what america was 
like to britons when i heard that harper amp row bought the book i 
thought theyd probably cut some things and change all this stuff 
americans already know for instance that washington and 
baltimore are right next door but they said oh no we like it 
like it is they didnt change much of anything the british 
version explains what bud light is thats the only thing that 
really got changed 
bryson writes that his intent was to find the perfect small 
town where bing crosby would be the priest jimmy stewart the 
mayor fred macmurray the high school principal 
from his opening line its clear that bryson was out to have 
fun i come from des moines somebody had to 
he describes des moines residents as being strangely serene 
and writes that people who have never been there drive in off the 
interstate looking for gas or hamburgers and stay forever 
once on the road bryson finds ample material for his zingers 
like southerners 
the average southerner has the speech patterns of someone 
slipping in and out of consciousness he wrote i can change my 
shoes and socks faster than most people in mississippi can speak a 
sentence 
or recreational vehicle owners 
these things these rvs are like lifesupport systems on 
wheels astronauts go to the moon with less backup rv people are 
another breed and a largely demented one at that 
then theres nebraska which bryson calls the nations most 
unexciting state compared with it iowa is a paradise he 
wrote iowa at least is fertile and green and has a hill 
nebraska is like a 75000squaremile bare patch 
bryson said he wrote the book with the idea that americans can 
laugh at themselves if anyone takes offense at what he said hes 
sorry 
i thought it was quite obvious that i was joking he said 
it was never meant to be taken seriously if you grew up in a 
place like nebraska and were really proud of the fact and then see 
the things i said i could see how you could take it 
seriously 
brysons kidding even extends to his own family he wrote that 
his father bill sr had two criteria for a vacation attraction 
was it educational and was it free 
his idea of holiday heaven was a museum without an admission 
charge bryson wrote he was so cheap on vacations that it 
always surprised me he didnt make us sift in litter bins for our 
lunch 
however he was worried that his father a longtime sports 
columnist for the des moines tribune would be perceived as a 
buffoon so he showed the manuscript to his mother before it was 
published 
i said to her look if theres anything youre unhappy with 
tell me bryson said she thought it actually was an 
affectionate account i was well aware i was using both my 
parents as comic book figures for purposes of humor my mother 
wasnt troubled by it at all 
bryson never did find his perfect small town although he 
visited some that came close among his favorites were columbus 
miss charleston sc savannah ga gettysburg pa 
chestertown md and pella and storm lake in iowa 
and if a foreigner had one place to visit in the united states 
bryson would recommend the grand canyon 
its the one experience america has that cant be duplicated 
anywhere else he said you can go to the alps if you want to 
see mountains you can go to the yangtze river and see a river 
thats as great as the mississippi but theres just no place in 
the world thats got a hole in the ground like the grand canyon 
his worst experience was in sundance wyo where a gumchewing 
waitress at the only restaurant in town wouldnt serve him because 
a group of shriners were having a private party there he had to 
make do on 6 worth of potato chips and candy bars from a gas 
station 
anywhere in iowa someone would have fixed me up with a 
sandwich bryson said they seemed to take a positive pleasure 
in the idea i was just going to eat potato chips and candy bars i 
never encountered that type of malice anywhere else

she once was a computer expert who 
helped fight crime with tvs knight rider but all rebecca 
holden ever really wanted to do was sing country music 
finally im getting to do what ive always wanted to do 
she said in an interview i think im happier than ive ever 
been 
after a modeling and acting career that included a brief stint 
on the soap opera general hospital holden has settled in 
nashville and is making records and music videos for tra star 
records 
on knight rider she portrayed april curtis a computer 
expert who helped fight crime this led to her role as the wicked 
elena on general hospital 
when her soap character died she turned to country music shes 
been the opening act at concerts by country stars such as lee 
greenwood tom t hall earl thomas conley and ronnie mcdowell she 
and her fourpiece band also made a concert tour of canada 
holden kept her hand in acting by appearing in music videos with 
the statler brothers and ronnie milsap 
singing is the only thing i ever wanted to do ever she 
said people get the idea that im an actress thats now trying 
to sing thats not right it just took me a while to make it 
happen if id had my druthers thats all i would have ever done 
holden raised in san antonio majored in piano and voice at 
north texas state university she had a modeling and tv career in 
new york where she also put together a country music band 
my television career blossomed into something i never 
expected she said i never had dreams of television or an 
acting career 
millions saw her astride a horse in a tv commercial carrying 
cologne on a tray to a waiting handsome young man 
they glued the bottle to the tray she recalled 
then later she loved the challenge of the soap opera daily 
grind 
there is a lot of dialogue to memorize you do 70 80 pages a 
day whereas on an episodic show maybe seven or eight the crews 
have to be commended because you turn out an enormous amount of 
material each day she said 
it was exciting i loved being put to the test 
she calls her singing style contemporary country and believes 
she can broaden the base of country music 
there are so many good young artists out there she said 
i think maybe some of the newer people coming in to an industry 
can bring a new audience in maybe young people will hear them and 
say hey i like that is it country i like it anyway maybe ill 
be able to bring in an audience who didnt like it before 
holden had to pay her dues in country music just like anyone 
else she said you have to prove yourself you cant just come 
and say just because i was in television im going to be a 
singer it doesnt work that way i wanted to prove myself and 
you have to you have to do your share of showcases 
showcases are performances by singers designed to show their 
talent to record producers and others its this kind of performing 
she enjoys most 
theres something about a live audience and the immediate 
response that i like she said theres really nothing like it 
theres magic that happens that you dont get if youre working on 
an isolated sound stage 
theres a high you get from it thats unexplainable theres a 
feeling of unity and togetherness from the people thats like no 
other 
when you are acting you get that from whoever you are doing 
the scene with you get those special moments when a scene really 
works she said 
another thing is that when you are acting you always are 
another character when you are on stage you are yourself

a dreamtraveler ready for intergalactic 
adventure climbs into a cockpit and steadies his hands on the 
controls the experience begins 
immense robotic creatures lug their massive frames over a rocky 
terrain waging war against the enemy every flip of a lever every 
tilt of the control stick fires shrieking deadly lasers 
decapitating other lumbering land giants and splashing metal body 
parts over the empty planet 
its the latest in video game technology what creator john 
weisman calls the worlds first computer sport it also is part of 
whats new in electronics at home and elsewhere 
the desire to be tom cruise in top gun or luke skywalker in 
star wars to not have to live that experience vicariously i think 
thats a very common fantasy said weisman president of the 
chicagobased esp corp which manufactures the battletech center 
players sit in four cockpits and must act as a team in a 
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles it took 
weisman eight years to develop the game and he plans to open the 
first battletech center along chicagos downtown lakefront by 
march adventureseekers would pay 6 for a halfhour session 
it got us hooked in two minutes said brian bayley 27 of 
st louis as he and a colleague stepped out of the cockpit at the 
consumer electronics show where the game made its debut in june 
other items for adults on display at the show included 
telephones that look like bowling pins hamburgers or fish a 
choice of largemouth bass chinook salmon or walleye pike 
for car buffs panasonic representatives showed systems that 
project a map on the windshield to keep drivers eyes on the road 
they also displayed camerarelayed rear and side vision on a screen 
in the dashboard 
you can even see videotapes like one that shows you how to 
change a tire said pat griffis a spokesman for panasonic 
and there were other hitech toys a microphone changes voice 
patterns to any of 16 octaves making it easy to mimic film 
characters including deepvoiced darth vader or squeaky mickey 
mouse the device was developed by ohio art co creators of etch a 
sketch and should carry a 48 price tag in retail stores by the 
holiday season 
among the new items offered by video game giants nintendo and

look out nintendo 
the newest player in home video games is out to zap and blast 
your super mario brothers with special effects so dazzling that its 
electronic athletes dance homerun shuffles and its space battles 
display arcadequality flash 
dad i got to get this system this is the greatest game i 
ever saw well sell the nintendo said joey silverman 9 after 
a trial run on the turbografx16 system made by nec home 
electronics usa inc 
ditching nintendo seems like heresy it is the hottestselling 
toy in america and super mario brothers named for its mustachioed 
heroes the most popular game 
yet the 20 people who played the systems in a weeklong 
sidebyside trial by the associated press unanimously praised 
necs sharper graphics blazing color and better sound 
necs system has twice the computing power and at least twice 
the pricetag the basic unit lists at 199 with a compact disc 
option for an extra 399 game cartridges the size of a credit card 
will sell for 45 and about 20 games will be available 
a nintendo unit costs about 80 its 120 games sell for 25 to 
40 each 
but even a telecommunications giant like nec is going to need 
more than heavyweight wizardry to challenge nintendo which 
dominates with 80 percent of the video game market 
eightyearold emmet ohanlon preferred necs graphics during a 
test run but said i wouldnt trade nintendo at all no way 
josh taylor 18 agreed after playing a baseball game that 
features a postgame show and lacks only gold chains and pine tar 
for realism 
nec blows it away its far superior still he said if i 
owned a nintendo i dont know if id go out and buy the new one 
jenny boyd 12 said it would take a million dollars to give 
up my nintendo but after playing nec she told her 9yearold 
sister start saving your money any money we get will go toward 
this this is a fresh game 
james herman 9 was particularly struck by one nec game in 
which a karatechopping warrior battles bullies the heros eyes 
blink his side bruises and his mouth bleeds 
thats what i call excellent graphics james said this is 
such an awesome game 
necs gadgetry has a 16bit microprocessor twice the power of a 
nintendo a bit measures how much information the processor can 
handle at once nintendo is testing a soupedup version and a sega 
of america inc subsidiary of japans sega enterprises ltd also 
has a 16bit system on the market 
the battle for the hearts and minds of video game players is far 
from childs play because of the megabucks at stake 
nintendos newest challenger is a handheld miniature called 
game boy which will be in the stores for christmas each game boy 
comes with tetris the new game originated by a soviet mathematics 
researcher and nearly two dozen other games will soon be available 
nintendo of america inc sold 17 billion worth of games last 
year and sales should reach 26 billion this year since it 
introduced its boxy toy in 1985 nintendo has sold 13 million in 
the united states and expects to have 19 million sold by years end 
more than 50 million game cartridges will be bought this year 
the hottest game super mario brothers is a morality play that 
weaves a mustachioed mario or his brother luigi each a blipping 
everyman through an electronic labyrinth of waterfalls and secret 
passages 
the farther mario goes in the fantasy yarn the tougher the 
surrealistic obstacles and hes apt to die a thousand deaths 
before rescuing the princess from the evil wart by flinging 
vegetables at antagonists 
one of the newest games wheel of fortune has an electronic 
handclapping letterturning vanna white 
theyre very compelling theyre so convenient exciting and 
accessible said david surrey professor of urban studies at st 
peters college in jersey city nj the games are a repetition 
of ageold themes its still cowboys and indians the boys save 
the girls and theres a fear of outsiders where you shoot aliens 
and monsters 
all games are addictive if theyre good said brian 
suttonsmith a psychologist at the university of pennsylvania 
theres nothing wrong with that its the nature of good play 
why shouldnt kids be addicted usually they grow out of their 
addiction

laser video introduced about a dozen years ago long before 
the compact disc monitorreceivers and the home video boom in 
general has come of age 
the format is the choice of consumers in japan where the 
industry is booming with sales of 15 billion annually 
its growing popularity in the united states probably is linked 
to the acceptance of the compact audio disc 
and since laserread optical videodiscs have remained compatible 
since their introduction older discs will play on todays new 
machines 
engineers have taken advantage of this compatibility and merged 
the laser videodisc and compact disc into a format they call cd 
video 
a wide variety of programming is available on optical discs 
ranging from audioonly cds to feature films such as gone with 
the wind and rain man 
it might be confusing if youre not familiar with the laser 
format so heres the lowdown on the discs and players 
compact audio discs are five inches in diameter and contain 
about 75 minutes of recorded material per side there also are 
threeinch cd singles 
the new cd videos also are five inches in diameter they can 
have up to five minutes of video and an additional 20 minutes of 
audio per side the current catalog of cdvs lists mostly pop 
artists featuring their hit videos and selected songs from audio 
albums 
laser videodiscs containing both video and audio programming are 
8 and 12 inches in diameter the smaller discs most often feature 
selections of popular music videos the big discs contain 
everything from hit movies to operas and concerts one even has an 
encyclopedia 
the 12inchers can hold up to 60 minutes of material per side 
laser cdv players are being sold in the united states by such 
manufacturers as sony yamaha magnavox and phillips other makers 
are expected to join the market soon 
pioneers laserdisc corp of america is the leading manufacturer 
of laser videodiscs in the united states with its long beach 
calif plant capable of turning out 600000 discs a month pioneer 
also imports discs from japan they are compatible with players 
being sold in the us 
the format is important to collectors of classic motion pictures 
because of quality 
laser videodiscs are capable of producing more than 400 lines of 
resolution and a picture much sharper than my vhs hq deck the 
higher resolution makes a noticeable difference especially on 
larger monitors 
many of the discs also contain digital sound tracks with the 
same quality as cds 
there are other assets to laser video 
price for one discs usually cost much less movies that might 
be 89 on videocassette go for as little as 25 on disc 
with the hardware competition heating up players also have come 
down in price with combination units available for under 500 at 
some outlets 
pioneer has a basic unit for only 8 and 12inch discs only its 
audio circuitry is analog rather than digital but consider that 
discs are easier to store and care for than tapes 
and the discs should theoretically last a lifetime 
other advantages of the format include programmability if 
youre watching a concert disc you can skip to any song you prefer 
simply by using the remote control the individual song you select 
no matter where it appears on the disc will be searched out by 
the player in just a few seconds 
discs also contain educational features with such discs 
programmed so users can freeze single frames for as long as they 
like with no jitter or glitches 
laser video also offers audio channel selection allowing 
consumers to choose full stereo or left and right channels 
individually 
a prime example of using channel selection to its fullest is the 
king kong disc from the criterion collection the first audio 
channel contains the original soundtrack the second channel 
carries a running commentary by film historian ronald haver this 
disc also contains a visual essay on the making of the movie 
discs with digital and dolby surround sound add a dimension to 
the home audiovideo experience as well 
the direction of technology points to the laserread optical 
disc as the format of the future

when et finally came home on video he did so ln letterbox 
style 
videophiles who purchased copies of the blockbuster steven 
spielberg film on laser videodisc were able see it in the original 
wide screen theatrical format better known as letterbox on home 
video 
presenting widescreen versions of popular releases on video 
discs and cassettes is a trend many of the major studios are 
grasping 
and in this age of highresolution largescreen 
monitorreceivers its no wonder that video connoisseurs are 
gobbling up letterbox videos 
the purpose of the widescreen videos is to present films for 
home viewing in their entirety 
take for instance the breathtaking countryside scenes in 
mgmuas dr zhivago or the spectacular chariot race in the 
studios benhur 
without letterboxing of these two films the viewer is missing 
up to twothirds of the actual original frame 
when movies are made for the wide screen they are generally 
twice as wide as they are tall a 2to1 ratio the ratio can be a 
large as 3to1 as are dr zhivago and benhur 
what most home video viewers have become accustomed to is a 
process known as pan and scan which keeps the action at the 
center of the screen 
but in the pan and scan process the picture must be 
cropped in some instances considerably to accommodate the 
television screen 
to make the widescreen process work on current televisions and 
highresolution monitors the letterboxed material appears 
centered with portions of the screen blacked out on both top and 
bottom for viewers who have not seen this type of video before it 
may take some getting used to 
critics have referred to letterboxing as band aid video saying 
they prefer a full screen in pan and scan 
but proletterboxers appreciate seeing films as they originally 
were intended to be viewed on a wide screen 
this may be too small on a 19inch television but on a 27inch 
monitor letterbox editions are preferred 
its refreshing to see judah benhur charlton heston talking 
to messala stephen boyd instead of carrying on a conversation by 
himself as in the pan and scan version and the thrilling 
20minute chariot race shown full instead of chopped to a third of 
its original width is obviously preferable 
the special effectsladen die hard becomes another favorite 
thanks to letterboxing 
because of high video resolution more letterboxed versions of 
collectors favorite movies are on laser videodiscs than on tapes 
other titles currently available in the widescreen format 
include blade runner the blob 1958 version with steve 
mcqueen the princess bride north by northwest 
invasion of the body snatchers 1956 version and the sound 
of music 
in fact many studios are reissuing previously released titles 
in letterbox 
some tapes such as benhur incorporate pan and scan and 
letterboxing the newest tape version switches to wide screen 
during spectacular scenes such as the chariot race 
video jackets state if the program material is in the letterbox 
or widescreen version

tired of watching movies at home because they dont have the 
same punch as the ones at the local cinema 
you can build a high quality theater at home where your family 
and friends can enjoy a real cinemalike experience and you dont 
have to be a millionaire to finance an entertainment room fitted 
out with thoughtfully selected basics 
the basic components of a home theater are a large screen 
monitorreceiver hifi vcr andor laser videodisc player and a 
quality audio system with surrounding sound 
depending on your tastes and pocketbook a complete home theater 
could cost a few thousand dollars or soar onto the megabucks scale 
it took me several years to finance and build my system 
since my theater room is relatively small i decided that a 
27inch sony monitorreceiver would do the job 
the only video source driving the screen is a magnavox videodisc 
player because im a collector of classic and blockbuster motion 
pictures i also have a vcr which i use on a portable tv in another 
room to view rental tapes once ive made up my mind i want a movie 
for my collections i buy a copy in the high quality disc format 
the audio system consists of an onkyo tx51 receiver 43 watts 
per channel a separate 10band graphic equalizer pioneer audio 
tape deck fisher dolby surround sound decoderamplifier 30 watts 
per channel a pair of magneticallyshielded speakers at the front 
of the room and a pair of surround speakers hung from the ceiling 
at the rear of the room 
since i had to place the front speakers near the 
monitorreceiver i bought magnetically shielded ones to prevent 
picture distortion 
the final result from this mixed bag of electronic components is 
a theaterlike experience in my own home 
the dolby surround sound decoder makes the jets in top gun 
sound like theyre soaring right past you it also puts the viewer 
right in the middle of the action in the barroom fight in raiders 
of the lost ark 
many of the other movies and concerts in my collection were 
processed with dolby sound tracks for added ambience and less 
distortion 
if you havent heard a surround sound processor on home video 
try one out at a local dealer it just may surprise you a note 
for unsuspecting consumers the processor must have a licensed 
dolby circuit to decode those hidden sound tracks on a tape or 
disc dont settle for a cheaper unit which only manufactures a 
surround mode look for the dolby logo on the component or ask the 
salesperson 
with the monitorreceiver offering more than 450 lines of 
horizontal resolution the picture achieved from the disc player is 
superb 
simply put my home theater gets the job done 
when selecting your components ask for a full instore 
demonstration since speakers are considered the heart of the audio 
system take some time to shop around for them be certain they fit 
your exact needs before investing in them 
if purchasing a large screen television or monitorreceiver 
consider the signal sources you will use at home for instance if 
you are using a standard vhs hq videocassette deck then insist 
that the salesperson give you a demonstration using a vhs hq deck 
those big screens can be made to look extremely impressive in 
stores when laser videodisc players ed beta or super vhs decks are 
driving them 
save yourself the trouble and disappointment of lugging a big 
set home if it will not perform as you expected 
there are a lot of audio components offered at varying prices on 
todays market 
select what is right for you and your pocketbook stay away from 
the frills if you wont use them select quality brand name audio 
components

sony corp says it has developed a portable digital 
videocassette recorder that allows tapes to be copied or edited 
more than 20 times with little loss in quality 
the machine dubbed the dvr1 is the first portable vcr that 
uses digital rather than analog recording resulting in better 
picture quality and little picture distortion when copies are made 
sony officials say 
in digital recording video and audio information is converted 
into a series of binary pulses such as those used by computers to 
process information compact discs also use digital recording to 
improve sound quality 
although the machine is intended primarily for professionals 
such as television journalists company officials said they plan 
eventually to develop one for consumers 
the recorder will go on sale in january for a list price of 
37000 sony says it weighs 24 pounds is batterypowered and can 
record up to 94 minutes on a single cassette tape 
we definitely plan to produce a consumer model and bring the 
price down eventually to about 760 says a sony official who 
requested anonymity 
sony has been selling a nonportable digital videotape recorder 
for studio use since july for about 87000 
when conventional analog videotapes are copied and recopied 
such as during editing at tv stations picture quality begins to 
decline after several copies or generations sony says tapes 
recorded on the dvr1 can go through more than 20 generations with 
little quality loss 
if sonys digital videotape format becomes widely accepted it 
could also reduce present problems of convertibility between the 
worlds many television systems because of the greater ease in 
processing digitally recorded information

tired of all those videocassettes cluttering 
up your house wouldnt it be nice to be able to tape 10 favorite 
tv soaps or five or six movies on one cassette 
how about 30 hours of recording per cassette 
west german videocassette manufacturer basf says that by 1991 it 
will be offering american viewers a tape with a 10hour capacity 
meanwhile a finnish company nokia says it has developed new 
technology for a line of vhs recorders to cram those 10 hours onto 
a tape without the loss of picture quality that results when 
todays vcrs are cranked down to their slowest speeds 
the picture quality is better than existing longplay 
systems says nokia spokesman lauri kivinen 
nokia a major manufacturer of television sets in europe hopes 
to license the technology to vcr manufacturers with the new 
recorders coming on the market sometime in 1990 kivinen said 
the basf tape will be usable on existing videocassette 
recorders basf will use a superstrong thin polyester film to pile 
more tape into each videocassette according to tv digest which 
reviewed the new nokia and basf products at the berlin audiovisual 
fair 
the basf cassette will allow up to 15 hours of taping on vcrs 
with a european system that uses a slower speed than american 
videocassette recorders

consumers have had it with commercials on the 
videocassettes they rent even as more car and softdrink spots are 
being spliced onto movie tapes 
sixtysix percent of vcr owners surveyed say they fastforward 
through commercials at the beginning of rented movies according to 
a nielsen media research study released at a recent video software 
dealers association convention 
and more than 60 percent of those surveyed say they zip through 
coming attractions 
despite the renters unhappiness though the commercials wont 
be going away anytime soon 
mca home videos upcoming release of the land before time 
will carry a pizza hut pitch 
rain man features a buick plug a fish called wanda 
hypes schweppes and young guns hawks nestle 
a number of promoters created a ruckus at the convention by 
offering to open prerecorded cassettes and attach commercials for 
local merchants 
video air time of midland texas will put spots for florists 
bowling alleys attorneys and department stores on any cassette 
where theres room 
were offering the video store owner an additional source of 
revenue said terry mathis video air times vice president for 
franchising the video store owns the cassette and if we dont 
make an unauthorized infringement of the copyrighted material we 
have violated no law 
video air time charges about 20 per commercial per cassette of 
which the store owner receives about 1 a tape 
paramount pictures has filed a 1 million lawsuit against st 
louisbased video broadcasting systems alleging that the company 
has placed commercials on beverly hills cop ii raiders of 
the lost ark and eddie murphy raw in some markets 
paramount argues that lowbudget local commercials damage the 
studios image paramount was the first studio to place a 
commercial on a major studio release adding a diet pepsi pitch to 
top gun in 1986 
the disapproval rate reflected in the new nielsen study comes as 
a major reversal from a nielsen study released in april that 
survey showed that 95 percent of households renting the a fish 
called wanda video watched the schweppes commercial 
besides its findings on fastforwarding commercials the new 
nielsen study showed that although video rental volume continues to 
grow customers are looking for other ways to spend time including 
other leisure activities business or education or regular 
television 
the nielsen inquiry also found that renters by a wide majority 
dont want to pay higher rental fees for newer films

the classroom is alive with activity and 
chatter women lean forward intently pasting together fabric 
paper and cardboard others draw with bright markers some sit 
still content just to be there 
florence skuce 87 gently claps her hands and inspects the 
small notebook she has created my book she squeals 
hooray 
dorothy ewin 89 says she may use her notebook to record 
little notations of things that are coming up 
emma maryman 93 does not speak but grins broadly at her 
finished product assembled with lots of help from workshop leaders 
within minutes dorothy has forgotten where her notebook came 
from others too soon will forget the workshop however has 
been a success 
it is one of dozens sponsored each month by arts for the aging 
a nonprofit group in washington that uses professional artists to 
bring art into the lives of the elderly particularly victims of 
alzheimers disease 
the program sends painters mimes harpists dancers 
storytellers and others to adult day care centers and nursing homes 
to involve older people in the arts and stimulate their creativity 
one week participants may help make a quilt another time they 
will learn pantomime sometimes they hear stories often they paint 
or draw 
the program succeeds where countless other arts and crafts 
projects never seem to achieve anything but frustration 
reports sara gibson of the bethesda fellowship house an adult day 
care center in suburban maryland the artists allow the often 
unusual creativity seen in alzheimers participants to flourish 
rather than attempting to stifle it with conformity 
melissa brown recreation director for iona house another 
center visited by arts for the aging said it gives patients with 
intellectual problems a new way to express themselves 
even the cognitively impaired elderly have the ability to 
appreciate art art can reach the emotional side of them which can 
still be functioning and in need of being utilized 
artists who conduct the workshops are specially trained to teach 
the aged and to help even alzheimers patients participate without 
getting frustrated at tasks that are too difficult 
we try to bring out whatever is left in people said lolo 
sarnoff a 73yearold retired scientist and active sculptor who 
created arts for the aging you have to be a little bit more 
patient a little bit more repetitive but they will do some very 
beautiful things 
working with the arts has a soothing effect on the 
alzheimers patients and reduces their agitation even though the 
classes themselves soon may be forgotten because of memory 
impairment mrs sarnoff said 
they are incredibly happy when they can accomplish something 
but you dont expect that they will remember we just live in the 
moment with them 
mark rooney a painter and art teacher who is arts for the 
agings program director said many patients learn and progress 
during workshops though some may never master drawing even the 
basic border that is the first step in his classes one student 
makes jackson pollocktype scribbling throughout the class period 
then holds it up with a sweet smile to ask is this what you 
wanted 
rooney is fascinated with the work of eccentrics such as pollock 
and vincent van gogh and sees arts for the aging as an opportunity 
to study that art in progress i personally respond to their art 
because it is very honest its not contrived in any way 
an estimated 25 million to 3 million americans have alzheimers 
disease the most common cause of severe intellectual impairment in 
older people the numbers are expected to mushroom as the nations 
population ages 
at first individuals may experience only subtle changes in 
memory but as the disease progresses it can cause serious 
forgetfulness confusion irritablility and changes in personality 
and judgment that leave patients unable to care for themselves 
bodil meleney a sculptor and parttime executive director of 
arts for the aging said it is one of many support systems family 
members need as they struggle with the daily demands of caring for 
a loved one with alzheimers 
we fit in as a small cog in the whole thing the artwork seems 
to calm them down they are pleased with what they have done 
mrs sarnoff started arts for the aging like everything else 
in my life by mistake she said she happened to answer the 
telephone at the art barn a communityrun art gallery when the 
national institutes of health called six years ago seeking someone 
to teach an art class for alzheimers victims 
that pilot program was so well received that she began 
organizing similar workshops from the art barn and last year she 
created a separate nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing 
the lives of the aging through art 
arts for the aging financed entirely by private grants and 
donations celebrated its first anniversary with a gala benefit 
oct 11 at the west german embassy that featured an exhibit of 
artwork by alzheimers patients 
the program now sends paid artists into 10 adult day care 
centers in the washington area and mrs sarnoff hopes to export the 
idea to other parts of the country arts for the aging also plans 
to create a pamphlet for teachers and caregivers at senior centers 
around the country and is seeking financing for a research project 
with georgetown medical centers department of gerontology to 
evaluate the effect of artistic stimulation on alzheimers 
patients behavior 
in addition the corcoran school of art in washington is 
offering a new course using teaching methods developed by arts for 
the aging 
carol simpson executive director of the washington area chapter 
of the alzheimers disease and related disorders association 
credits the program with recognizing that just because someone 
has alzheimers doesnt mean they cant be creative cant express 
themselves in fact many can express themselves better through 
art than verbally

civil rights laws aimed at race discrimination are 
increasingly being used by older workers who are fighting 
stereotypes and the nations unique disposable culture to keep 
their jobs officials say 
it has become the fastestgrowing category of employment 
discrimination said dorothy j porter head of colorados civil 
rights division it is also interesting that the majority of the 
people who file age discrimination complaints are not minorities 
the civil rights agencies formed to protect historically 
oppressed classes of people now are handling a growing number of 
complaints filed by white males over the age of 40 porter said 
age discrimination accounts for about a third of the 100000 
cases filed annually with the us equal employment opportunity 
commission said joseph r esquibel compliance manager of the 
regional eeoc office in denver 
the most common stereotypes applied to older workers are that 
they are unproductive untrainable and less adaptable esquibel 
said and older workers often are earning top wages while a younger 
worker could be hired for less 
this problem based on age is an american phenomenan instead of 
a worldwide phenomenon race and sex discrimination may be 
worldwide but the age discrimination appears to be a manifestation 
of our culture he said 
the majority of complaints are for firings but the most 
serious problem i believe is failure to hire esquibel said 
people seldom complaint about that however because applicants are 
psychologically deterred by hopes they still may be hired if 
they dont make waves he said 
i think it is the most pervasive form of discrimination it 
seems to cross all lines whether youre white black hispanic 
asian said steve newman executive director of colorados 
3600member chapter of the american federation of state county 
and municipal employees you reach a certain age and they 
want you out the door you are disposable you are human tissue 
youre gone this culture is just so disposable a mcdonalds 
culture after youve had your quick consumption of an employee 
you throw em out 
newman said management in both government and industry in many 
instances has adopted techniques to force out older middle managers 
you call a superintendent in and humiliate him in front of his 
staff if that fails you bring in a cronie layer him in over the 
old superintendent and take the superintendents duties away from 
him 
you push him off in a corner in charge of licking stamps 
counting how many times the phone rings until he or she takes 
early retirement 
however newman esquibel and civil rights commission 
spokeswoman judy fester emphasized that workers at all levels 
from clerks to secretaries to executives are the targets of age 
discrimination 
one of the tricky parts is that many times people dont know 
theyve been discriminated against when theyre laid off but when 
theyre replaced by somone half their age and at twothirds their 
salary they realize their age was probably a factor in their being 
laid off fester said 
some agediscrimination victims have won large settlements 
gerald v barrett a lawyer specializing in job law and head of the 
university of akrons psychology department said the small number 
of cases that go to trial are won as many times by the employer as 
by the complaining employee 
im sure if a company for example found a manager had said 
to an employee youre older and youre not doing the job they 
are going to settle that case especially when you have a smoking 
gun like that barrett said 
on the other end youre going to have cases where the 
plaintiff is not performing his or her job the way it should be 
performed these are the tough ones thats where the factfinding 
by the court comes into play 
esquibel said much age discrimination is the result of 
stereotyping 
its just an irrational prejudice in our society that the 
older you are the less productive you are thats a myth it cant 
be shown to be the case 
he took issue with the belief that ridding a work force of older 
workers and keeping younger ones leads to stability the 
55yearold will probably stay around 15 years while the 
23yearold may be gone tomorrow 
studies also show show older workers are involved in fewer 
instances of sexual harassment and racial discrimination 
esquibel sees a change for the better as the nation ages 
i think the society is changing slowly like a glacier this 
fascination with the youth culture is starting to wane the 
nations work force is getting older the ray of hope in all of 
this is that the employer is not going to have as many chances to 
discriminate in the future

ed tarangioli thrives on surprise 
looking at his blond hair and straight shoulders youd guess 
hes a wellpreserved 65 hes going on 81 but he saves his 
biggest surprises for tennis courts where after cancer and 
cataract operations he has reigned 
my kind of tennis is to do the unexpected tarangioli said 
during a chat at his victorian house on a treeshaded hillside in 
this new york suburb at this age youre not the powerful hitter 
you were but you play a very intelligent game you build up points 
almost like chess 
at the national level most of the players dont make mistakes 
theyve been playing for 50 60 years so you throw in as many 
surprises as you can the drop shot the lob the sudden serve and 
volley thats what works 
a top player also needs one great shot and his is the 
backhand drive 
the 5foot10 155pound tarangioli achieved no 1 ranking in 
both singles and doubles in the 80s age group after winning the 
national grass and indoor singles and three doubles tournaments 
with different partners in 1988 
rankings last one year the 1989 roster being based on 1988 
play so far this year tarangioli has lost in the finals of three 
national tournaments to jack staton of st petersburg fla whos 
playing for the first time in the division chances are staton will 
be no 1 and tarangioli no 2 in 1990 
thirtythree men hold us national rankings in the 80s division 
and 17 headed by kenneth beer of burlingame calif are ranked in 
the over85 group eightyeight names are listed in the 70s led by 
powell taylor of norfolk va 
the us tennis association strongly promotes the senior game 
organizing tournaments nationally and sectionally by fiveyear age 
increments seven women in the 75s hold national singles rankings 
for 1988 headed by liu shangku tao of san francisco stars of the 
past like bobby riggs gardnar mulloy tom brown and dorothy 
cheney are still playing 
tarangioli was a high school shortstop when he got into tennis 
with a friend who wanted someone to hit with the friend 
happened to be francis x shields then a national junior star 
later a toptenner they practiced on park courts where tarangioli 
recalls you brought your own net 
he learned fast going on to captain the new york university 
team and play three years in the national championships at forest 
hills his best performance was when he reached the finals of the 
new york metropolitan clay tournament in 1929 after defeating frank 
hunter ranked no 2 nationally jules seligson then beat him for 
the cup inscribed with illustrious names like bill tildens 
every player plays a tournament where he feels he cant miss a 
ball it looks so big tarangioli says that was mine 
after college and with no money in it tarangioli dropped 
out of tournament tennis got a law degree at nyu and became a wall 
street lawyer and teacher heading the law department of baruch 
college of the city university of new york for 30 years he met his 
wife harriet cullinan now dead at a tennis club in yonkers and 
they had two boys and two girls all good tennis players 
he returned to competitive tennis in his 40s reaching the 
finals of the national veterans indoor championship in new york in 
1956 i made history by losing he said because the winner was 
dr reginald weir the first time a black man had won a national 
championship a woman althea gibson won a us championship the 
following year and arthur ashe in 1968 
to keep in shape he does calisthenics 20 minutes a day and 
plays singles five times a week seven years ago he underwent 
surgery for colon cancer he also has had a prostate operation and 
cataracts removed from both eyes 
the great thing about supersenior tennis is that all these 
men have something to look forward to he said were very 
happy because we have goals ive won the 80s im very pleased 
with it i wanted to do it my next goal is i want to win the 85s

in the midst of summer harvest ive 
already started my indoor winter garden 
tiny tomato plants have formed true leaves in 4inch pots in my 
poor mans greenhouse a fluorescent stand in the dining room 
if all goes well their cherrysized fruit will redden in time to 
join my lettuce arugula basil parsley and chives in a christmas 
day salad 
if you crave fresh greens and flowers in snow time invest in 
lights for beginners its a good way to learn the fundamentals 
and retirees moving into apartments will find it a rewarding way to 
keep gardening skills alive 
as more people do it equipment has improved to meet their 
needs you can begin with basic twotube stands costing around 50 
and graduate to elaborate affairs that may run to four figures 
depending on the size and decor seed houses nurseries and 
hardware stores carry them or you can build your own 
my wife and i share a custombuilt stand six feet long six 
tall and one deep running along a wall of the dining room shes 
the flower gardener and im the vegetable man more or less 
amicably weve settled turf conflicts by allocating the two 
middle shelves to her plants and the top and bottom to my lettuces 
and herbs we also have a smaller catalogpurchased stand mainly 
for starting seeds for indoor plants and for transplanting outdoors 
in the spring 
although many different vegetables will grow indoors space 
limits most of us to salad greens herbs small tomatoes and some 
baby veggies like carrots 
some tomatoes like florida petite and red robin are perfect 
for shelves growing no taller than eight inches dont expect to 
raise big heads of iceberg or kneehigh romaine or feed large 
families tender leaf lettuces like oak leaf do excellently 
however succession plants providing us with salads a couple times 
a week all winter long the same with spicy arugula also known as 
rocket and roquette which develops a more delicate taste and 
texture indoors basil chives and broadleaf parsley also prosper 
my wife grows plants both from seeds and cuttings among flowers 
that have graced her shelves are african violets gloxinias 
cyclamens gardenias miniature roses jerusalem cherries 
christmas cacti and marigolds 
trial and error have taught us one vital rule about gardening 
under lights fluorescent tubes are infinitely weaker than 
sunlight this means you must keep pots or flats very close to the 
tubes at the sprouting stage or the seedlings will quickly become 
spindly and drawn and youve got to start over again 
by close i mean within one inch of the lights most stands 
have chains or pulleys letting you adjust the height of the tubes 
or you can use blocks of various sizes under your pots shoe boxes 
are good for this after the plants become sturdy i keep them 
within three or four inches of the lights 
although weaker than sunlight fluorescents have the advantage 
of steady light as long as you want it this beats windowsill 
growing which depends on the length and quality of the day i turn 
the lights on when i get up and turn them off at bedtime for a 
total of some 17 hours of light plants also need recuperative 
periods of darkness 
you can buy special fluorescents that promote growth by emitting 
blue and red rays you get similar results by combining cool white 
and warm white tubes 
sterilized potting soil obtainable at nurseries and hardware 
stores prevents diseases and eliminates weeding special mixes are 
also available adapted to the needs of certain plants 
plants vary widely on moisture but you can be sure vegetable 
greens need dampness lettuce in particular thrives in water 
becoming bitter without it before the seeds sprout you must keep 
the soil constantly moist this is done best with a sprayer that 
produces a fine mist 
fertilizing needs also vary i feed vegetables every two weeks 
or so with a spoonful of 202020 allpurpose fertilizer dropped 
into the watering can 
you might ask why all this in the dining room when icicles 
adorn the windows we think its nice to dine among freshblooming 
flowers also i like to lean over from the table and pick a sprig 
of parsely for my filet of sole

share prices plummeted in hectic trading on 
londons stock exchange this morning in response to wall streets 
plunge on friday 
investors were not reassured by a relatively calm response in 
tokyo earlier in the day 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index opened 1571 
points or 68 percent lower at 20768 
friday afternoons setback on wall street occurred long after 
the london market had closed for the weekend and some british 
analysts had been predicting an instant drop of up to 6 percent in 
the key london index 
but in unofficial trading before the exchange did open shares 
sank even lower with the key london index estimated to be 200 
points down at one point the bargain hunters entered the market 
and prices recovered somewhat 
dealers are allowed to trade stocks outside exchange hours 
the market is looking for a level which it is comfortable 
holding said charles larkum an equity analyst at the london 
investment firm james capel and co 
the dollar meanwhile sank in europe this morning the pound 
was quoted at 15865 compared with 15625 late friday the dollar 
also was quoted at 18490 west german marks and 14091 japanese 
yen compared with 19025 marks and 144 yen late friday 
earlier in tokyo where trading ends before london dealings 
begin the nikkei stock average fell 64733 points or 18 percent 
to close at 3446869 
london market makers moved prices sharply lower in an effort to 
protect themselves from any flood of sell orders which in turn 
prompted a heavy outbreak of selling pressure dealers said 
its havoc at the moment but we expect the market to stabilize 
at lower levels ahead of the new york opening later monday said 
richard dingwallsmith an economist at the london investment firm 
county natwest woodmac securities 
michael hughes an economist with barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
said the apparent determination of governments to prevent a 
1987style crash gives underlying support for the market so i 
wouldnt get overexcited about the danger of a full crash 
i think they have a vested interest in making sure that 87 
doesnt repeat itself and indeed they have the experience of 87 to 
draw on he told british broadcasting co televisionoin i 
think its particularly salutary that the american authorities do 
seem prepared to cut interest rates and that might help here 
analysts said the london market was concerned that a fresh burst 
of computerdriven selling on new york later monday could drag the 
market sharply lower stock exchange chairman andrew hugh smith 
said this morning i certainly do not think there is any reason 
to panic 
the securities association which governs the stock exchange 
held a precautionary meeting in london to assess the far east 
response to the slump in new york 
some stockbrokers stayed in central london hotels overnight to 
be at their screens early this morning 
the bank of england said saturday it saw no reason for such an 
exaggerated fall in london share values 
wall streets dow jones industrial average lost 190 points in 
the final hour of trading friday with a loss of nearly 200 billion 
in paper wealth the plunge occurred exactly two years after a 
108point dow drop presaged the oct 19 1987 black monday crash of 
a record 508 points 
the us federal reserve was reported ready to move large 
amounts of cash into the american banking system if money is needed 
to prevent a financial crisis 
but that is not seen as an option for britain because of 
inflation chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson last week 
raised base lending rates to an eightyear high of 15 percent to 
control inflation running at 76 percent 
british shares had been on the slide for three weeks amid gloom 
about inflation interest rates and the overall state of the 
economy

the federal reserve put out the word sunday 
that it stands ready to flood the banking system with money to 
prevent the secondbiggest point drop in the history of the stock 
market from developing into something worse 
the fed commitment came as the bush administration continued its 
own efforts to reassure investors reeling from fridays 190point 
plunge in the dow jones industrial average 
white house budget director richard darman who in recent weeks 
has been critical of the feds handling of monetary policy 
expressed total confidence sunday that the central bank and other 
government officials will do all that is necessary to contain the 
market turmoil 
darman said that treasury secretary nicholas brady federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and richard breeden the new 
chairman of the securities and exchange commission were keeping in 
close contact monitoring developments 
i am sure they will do what is right what is prudent what is 
sensible darman said in an interview on abcs this week with 
david brinkley 
darman declined to predict the course of the market monday and 
president bush gave no indication that he heard shouted questions 
about wall street as he returned to the white house from a weekend 
at camp david 
meanwhile a senior fed official said sunday that the central 
bank intended to follow the example that greenspan set following 
the october 1987 market crash 
we will be there with all the liquidity demand that is 
needed said the official who spoke on condition that his name 
not be used if there are any doubts about liquidity being 
available there is no reason to be concerned 
the term liquidity refers to the ready availability of cash 
the greenspanled effort two years ago was widely credited with 
keeping the 508point plunge of october 1987 from wreaking havoc on 
the banking system and perhaps toppling the entire country into a 
recession 
while a fed move to inject massive amounts of cash into the 
banking system cannot by itself push stock prices higher it does 
provide a measure of confidence that the government is prepared to 
counteract the damaging effects to the economy from a sudden loss 
of billions of dollars of wealth in stock prices 
the feds action to supply cash on a liberal basis to the 
banking system serves to reassure nervous bankers that they do not 
need to be panicked into cutting off credit to brokerage houses and 
securities firms suffering heavy losses from a plunge in stock 
prices 
brokerage firms assured of a line of credit from their bankers 
are not forced to sell off stocks as the price plunges simply to 
replenish their own dwindling supplies of cash such waves of 
forced stock sales can have the unintended effect of driving stock 
prices down even further 
the fed official said in a telephone interview that the us 
central bank had been in touch with central banks in japan and 
europe and had received assurances from them that those officials 
stood ready to supply needed cash in their countries to counteract 
any possible fallout from fridays plunge in stock prices 
officials at both the fed and the treasury were closely 
monitoring developments in the overseas markets primarily tokyo 
and hong kong developments in those markets could set the tone for 
how us markets perform when they open monday morning 
stocks were down sharply in the first few minutes of trading 
monday on the tokyo stock exchange and the dollar was also coming 
under heavy selling pressure but they steadied in later trading 
the federal reserve was expected to join with the bank of japan 
and other nations central banks to buy dollars on foreign 
exchanges in an effort to keep the us currency from tumbling 
precipitously 
aides to brady said the treasury secretary had spent the weekend 
on the telephone coordinating the administrations efforts to 
contain the damage from fridays market drop 
officials said they were mindful that the record 508plunge of 
the stock market on black monday in 1987 had been preceded by a 
109point fall the previous friday 
things are quite different now than they were in 1987 but no 
one knows what is going to happen monday a treasury official 
who spoke on condition his name not be used said sunday 
brady is insisting that regardless of what happens in the 
markets there should be little impact on the total us economy 
which is about to enter a record eighth year of expansion 
many private economists said they supported that view 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said that 
even though he was looking for another big selling day monday he 
was not changing his overall economic forecast for moderate growth 
next year he said the economy would be bolstered by growth in us 
export sales and continued consumer spending 
the average consumer west of the hudson river is going to say 
this market plunge is just a bad rerun they saw this movie two 
years ago and didnt get hurt so why should they worry now evans 
said 
before fridays market plunge darman and others in the 
administration had been pressuring the fed to lower interest rates 
in order to spur economic growth and also to drive the dollar lower 
as a way of supporting us export sales fed officials had been 
resisting that pressure contending that the dangers from inflation 
remained too great to significantly loosen credit 
while increasing the supply of money to the banking system could 
have the effect of lowering interest rates the fed official 
stressed that the central bank has the ability to add cash to the 
banking system now to take care of any shortterm liquidity 
problems and then drain off those extra reserves later when the 
market turmoil has subsided 
such an operation would have the effect of leaving interest 
rates essentially unchanged

most market strategists agree that a combination of events 
played a role including nervousness over higher inflation 
widespread use of computerized trading strategies and fears that a

group seeking to buy ual corp parent of united airlines had 
failed to obtain financing from banks for its 675 billion bid

in an atmosphere of apprehension and government 
silence the already battered british stock market awaited the 
opening of trading today to see if the city would mimic wall 
streets steep selloff 
some british analysts were predicting an instant drop of 100 to 
200 points on the key financial times stock exchange 100 share 
index when trading resumed for the first time since fridays 
nearrecord plunge in the us stock market the index closed 
friday at 223390 
however market experts said it was unclear how sustained any 
early london selloff would be 
wall streets dow jones industrial average tumbled 19058 points 
on friday mostly in the final hour of trading in a 691 percent 
market slide that wiped out 200 billion in paper wealth the 
plunge occurred almost exactly two years after a 108point dow drop 
presaged the oct 19 1987 black monday crash of 508 points 
the us federal reserve indicated it was ready to move large 
amounts of cash into the american banking system when us markets 
opened today if money was needed to prevent a financial crisis 
but that was not seen as an option for britain which has been 
tightening credit in an attempt to curb high inflation chancellor 
of the exchequer nigel lawson last week raised base lending rates 
to an eightyear high of 15 percent to control inflation that has 
been running at 76 percent 
we are looking over a cliff said one british broker who 
asked not to be identified the government cant help us this 
time and i think the chancellor might just let share prices take 
the strain 
british shares already had been declining for weeks falling 
about 8 percent since reaching a post1987 crash high in early 
september amid gloom about inflation interest rates and the 
overall state of the economy 
wall streets plunge friday dragged the dollar down and boosted 
the british pound nearly three cents to 158 taking pressure off 
the british government to increase interest rates yet again 
the staterun bank of england said saturday it saw no reason 
for such an exaggerated fall in london share values as occurred 
in the united states 
neither lawson nor prime minister margaret thatchers office 
issued statements on the stock market situation over the weekend 
mrs thatcher was scheduled to leave today for the commonwealth 
summit in malaysia and is to return oct 25 
the sunday telegraph said it was evident cabinet ministers 
feared political reaction could make the situation worse it quoted 
an unidentified treasury source as saying it is perfectly 
possible for people to talk themselves into a mess 
the observer newspaper on sunday said government officials did 
not anticipate as severe a fall in london as on wall street and 
that the bank of england was emphasizing it regards the new york 
crash as a special case sparked off by the collapse of the 
highrisk junk bond market which does not exist on anything like 
the same scale in london

opening of trading in europe in frankfurt it pulled back up from

frankfurt bank nobody knows what they should do everyone is 
just squaring positions

prices on the tokyo stock exchange took their 
biggest tumble of the year today but trading was calm despite 
fridays big plunge on wall street which tokyo analysts blamed on 
excessive us takeover activity 
the dollar opened sharply lower against the japanese yen then 
rebounded slightly in hectic trading 
other financial markets in the far east from new zealand and 
australia to manila and hong kong posted moderate to large 
declines but on the whole investors in the region especially in 
the rich tokyo market did not send share prices reeling deeply as 
happened two years ago when wall street crashed 
amid reports of pledges by world monetary authorities to do 
anything to buttress stock and foreign currency markets government 
officials sought to keep investors eyes on local conditions 
domestic economic conditions are still favorable japanese 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told reporters shortly after the 
market opened for the day saying he doubted the tokyo markets 
would plunge following fridays deep 190point or nearly 7 
percent slide in the dow jones average 
the closely watched 225issue nikkei stock average opened down 
about 600 points and quickly recovered about a third of its losses 
before falling again in the afternoon it closed at 3446869 down 
64733 points a drop of 18 percent from friday 
volume was a thin 520 million shares less than the 550 million 
shares traded friday when the nikkei index rose 32997 points 
as the nikkei index slid lower in the afternoon brokers were 
trying to resist panic 
i am telling you that its not time to sell yet its not too 
late if we wait until tomorrow and see how new york will do a 
broker at a nikko securities office in the central ginza district 
was overheard saying on the phone 
several dealers had said sunday they thought the market could 
have absorbed a 1000point drop mondays drop was the largest 
this year the previous biggest was a drop of 48411 points on 
sept 26 
the dollar opened in tokyo at 13995 yen sharply lower than its 
friday closes of 14400 yen in tokyo and 14205 yen in new york 
but it quickly picked up a yen and closed at 14075 yen 
there was no indication that the bank of japan had intervened in 
currency trading that was described as hectic with volume 30 
percent higher than friday 
masaru takagi chief economist at fuji bank ltd a major 
commercial bank said he expected the yen to continue to rise as 
stock markets show the difference in fundamentals between the 
japanese and us economies 
tokyo analysts pinned fridays wall street plunge on excessive 
takeover activity in the united states they said the situation 
otherwise was favorable for stock markets with interest rates not 
a big problem 
in hong kong the bluechip hang seng index closed at 26017 
down 18060 points or 65 percent an analyst at county natwest 
security asia ltd said if the market in new york tonight is 
holding or down by not more than 40 to 50 points i believe the 
hong kong market will be all right tomorrow 
the wave knocked about 8 percent off share prices in australia 
and new zealand 10 percent in singapore and 115 percent in 
malaysia stock indices in the philippines south korea singapore 
thailand and taiwan also fell 
if london and new york were watching tokyo for the most 
important sign of how the worlds markets would act after fridays 
plunge on wall street by the afternoon in tokyo and elsewhere 
people were wondering how wall streets monday would go 
keiishi nishida a dealer at the tokyo office of kidder peabody 
securities co said japanese investors were not placing buy orders 
because they want to make sure that the new york plunge was only 
a onetime thing and the dow jones will not go down further monday 
there 
nishida said todays market action was nothing like the crash 
two years ago when private investors rushed to the brokers from 
early in the morning and sold all they had i dont think any 
investors expect tokyo shares to drop like new york this time 
fridays drop in the dow jones raised fears that world markets 
might crash in series as they did in october 1987 when a similar 
big drop on a friday led to whopping plunges on the following 
monday black monday in new york which was followed by black 
tuesday in tokyo london and elsewhere 
in 1987 the dow jones dropped 23 percent on oct 19 the nikkei 
dropped a record 15 percent on oct 20 and the hong kong exchange 
was so flustered that it closed for a week

standard amp poors 500 stock index futures bounced 
higher early today on the chicago mercantile exchange rallying 
after a brief circuit breaker trading restriction was triggered 
by a selloff at the opening 
after the first hour of trading the contract for december 
delivery of the 500 stocks comprising the sampp 500 index was trading 
more than 8 points above fridays close of 32885 
the contract had opened 5 points below fridays close 
triggering a circuitbreaker rule preventing traders from 
selling below that level for 10 minutes but buying surfaced 
minutes after the opening trimming the loss and trading never 
came to a halt because there were always orders to sell at the 
limit or buy above the limit said merc spokeswoman julie jacobs 
now it looks like a normal trading day said iris poliski 
another merc spokeswoman 
meanwhile the chicago board of trade said today it had added a 
20point opening limit to its major market index contract a 
stockindex futures product that is not as heavily traded as the 
mercs sampp 500 contract 
the mmi opened sharply lower but did not immediately drop by 20 
points which would have triggered a 30minute halt to all trading 
in the contract said bot spokesman michael oconnell 
the limits are designed to slow the markets and prevent panic 
selling in the event of a sudden collapse of stock prices 
stockindex futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of 
stocks at specified prices by a specified date large institutional 
investors use stockindex futures in various trading strategies to 
profit from the difference between stock prices and futures prices 
the index futures had tumbled friday triggering a trading halt 
in the sampp 500 index futures when stocks plunged on wall street in 
the secondworst market selloff ever

grain and soybean futures prices edged lower in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting a 
weekend of good harvesting weather and heavy farmer selling of 
their crops 
fridays plunge in the stock market appeared to have little 
effect on the grain markets 
because of the advancing harvest and the farmer selling we 
would have opened lower anyway said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago

president bush trying to reassure troubled 
financial markets said today he was not worried about the stock 
markets plunge and he and the federal reserve board chairman said 
the central bank and other government agencies were keeping a close 
eye on developments 
it goes without saying that we at the federal reserve are 
watching developments in financial markets rather closely fed 
chairman alan greenspan told the american bankers association we 
maintained particular surveillance overnight of asian and european 
markets and have kept in productive contact with our counterparts 
abroad 
coordination exists at a detailed level here in the united 
states among the federal reserve the sec securities and exchange 
commission the cftc commodity futures trading commission and 
the treasury department greenspan said in his first comments 
since the stock market plummeted 190 points on friday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 4918 
points in the first 30 minutes of trading this morning but 
rebounded to go up 1865 points after 90 minutes 
bush was asked about the stock market today at a picturetaking 
session in the white house im not worried he said 
addressing a reporter the president said you ask if im 
worried no the federal reserve and the sec securities and 
exchange commission and the secretary of the treasury are 
monitoring the situation and thats where it stands right now 
a senior fed official speaking on condition of anonymity 
sunday said the central bank was prepared to flood the banking 
system with money to prevent any further stock decline from 
rippling out of control 
we will be there with all the liquidity demand that is 
needed the official said in a telephone interview if there 
are any doubts about liquidity being available there is no reason 
to be concerned 
the term liquidity refers to the ready availability of cash 
developments in overseas markets today were expected to set the 
tone for us markets 
in japan the tokyo stock exchange took its biggest tumble of 
the year but trading was calm in light of wall streets big 
plunge the dollar after opening sharply lower was firm in 
london share prices plummeted in heavy but orderly trading stocks 
fell sharply on other european exchanges but then firmed 
the fed official said the central banks counterparts in japan 
and europe had given assurances that they stood ready to supply 
needed cash to the banking systems in their countries to stem any 
fallout from the us plunge 
the worlds central banks also were prepared to intervene if 
necessary by buying dollars to keep the value of the us currency 
from falling precipitously the official said 
for the 6500 bankers gathered for cocktails and conferences 
market events are reminiscent of the opening of the groups 1987 
convention in dallas when the market crashed 508 points causing 
greenspan to abruptly cancel his speech and jet back to washington 
greenspan was widely credited with decisive action that 
prevented the 1987 crash from wreaking havoc on the banking system 
and perhaps toppling the entire country into a recession 
while the injection by the fed of massive amounts of cash into 
the system cannot by itself push stocks higher it does serve to 
reassure nervous bankers that they need not cut off credit to 
securities firms suffering heavy losses 
the brokerage houses assured of a reliable line of credit then 
can refrain from selling stock simply to replace their dwindling 
supplies of cash such waves of forced sales can drive prices down 
even further 
cc hope a board member of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said the regulatory agency had asked banks to stand ready to 
help if asked by the fed 
the banks are ready to participate the fed has lined up 
the players he said weve just expressed our concern to some 
people and said stand by and be ready to do some assistance if 
youre called upon 
meanwhile a senior bush administration official who last month 
sharply criticized the feds policy of fighting inflation with high 
interest rates expressed confidence in the central banks ability 
to contain market turmoil today 
i am sure they will do what is right what is prudent what is 
sensible budget director richard darman said sunday in an 
interview on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady in a statement friday 
said the stock plunge would not affect the continuation of moderate 
growth for the entire us economy 
the bankers at their convention sunday for the most part agreed 
some said the market shock may be a blessing in disguise if it 
encourages a new sense of caution about highly leveraged corporate 
buyouts 
it was a snag in bank financing for a buyout of united airlines 
that sparked fridays selloff 
what we were seeing was a house of cards bound to come 
tumbling down said donald t senterfitt vice chairman of sun 
trust bank inc in orlando fla i hope the united airlines thing 
marks a more conservative approach by banking throughout 
thomas p rideout outgoing president of the bankers 
association and vice chairman of first union national bank in 
charlotte nc said it is natural that with signs of economic 
softness emerging banks would apply tougher lending standards to 
buyouts 
this would be the wrong time to invest in an airline or any 
other industry if you think you have doubts about their bottom 
line he said

customers of fidelity investments the nations 
largest mutual fund company are shifting their money out of the 
stock market due to the turmoil on wall street but volume has been 
lower than during the 1987 crash a spokesman said today 
lawrence dwyer a spokesman for fidelity said this morning the 
company received about twice as many calls as normal since the dow 
jones industrial average plunged about 190 points on friday 
but he said that two years during the black monday collapse of 
oct 19 1987 the phone volume was about double that amount 
also while many people are asking to redeem their investments 
in stock funds redemptions are running just about under a third 
of what we ran into in the stock market crash he said 
dwyer said most people who redeem their stock investments simply 
move their money into a more conservative investment fund such as 
a money market mutual fund 
they still have their money and want to invest it he said 
but they just want to put it in more conservative investments 
a mutual fund is an organization that pools and invests money of 
its shareholders in a group of securities 
fidelity polled its customers over the weekend and 84 percent 
said they were investing for the long term dwyer said 
mutual fund investors in general have a pretty good 
understanding of what theyre in they just dont leap said 
betty hart a spokeswoman for the investment company institute a 
washington organization that represents mutual funds 
hart said her agency surveyed stock mutual fund customers around 
the country after the 1987 crash and found that only 4 percent 
withdrew their investments completely within the first six weeks 
were probably going to see investors staying the course 
said john woerth a spokesman for vanguard group a mutual fund 
company in valley forge pa 
theyve learned the lessons from 87 he said if they 
would have stayed put it would have been better than switching 
out

ramirez managing director and money market economist for drexel 
burnham lambert inc greater opportunities for profits like 
this dont come that often 
on friday prices of some government bonds rose as much as 25 
per 1000 face value and yields skidded to levels not seen in two 
years following a 19058point tumble on the dow jones industrial 
average concerns about corporate takeovers and the junk bonds that 
are often used to finance them helped stoke he panicky selling in 
stocks 
fixedincome securities especially treasury bonds often are 
viewed as a safe haven in times of turmoil on wall street 
today stock prices were mostly lower in volatile trading but 
bond traders said the fact that the stock market wasnt as far off 
as many speculated kept a lid on bond prices 
a lot of people thought the stock market would be a lot 
weaker said william v sullivan director of money market 
reserach for dean witter reynolds inc but the markets 
tentative it could rebound very sharply if the equity market goes 
into a fullfledged retreat

316 point intermediate maturities were down around 516 point

decline today although many traders said some issues that had

less severe losses of around 10 or 20 by midday

markets overseas which had closed by the time the new york 
slide started friday reacted with moderate to large declines today 
stocks rocked back and forth in morning activity in the united 
states substantial price declines encouraged some buyers to hunt 
for bargains which helped lift the dow jones industrial average 
computerdriven program trading also contributed to the price 
swings 
most components of the dow jones industrial average showed gains

amp telegraph up 1 to 41 usx up to 33 eastman kodak up to 
44 general electric up to 54 and philip morris up 1 to 42

stock market into a tailspin on friday disappointing inflation and 
interest rate prospects had an influence on the selling and program

billion had failed to secure financing was cited as the direct 
cause of the markets drop the news cast doubts on all future

stock prices plummeted across europe monday in 
their first response to wall streets friday the 13th plunge but 
then recovered on a betterthanexpected performance in new york 
later in the day 
trading was disrupted in several european financial centers as 
the price declines triggered european versions of circuit 
breakers and prompted authorities in some countries to step in 
and try to contain the damage 
european traders reported price declines of 3 percent to 15 
percent 
londons financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 
705 points or 32 percent to close at 21634 at its lowest 
point in the early afternoon the index was off nearly 200 points 
or 9 percent as investors grew nervous about wall streets 
approaching opening 
the narrower ftse 30stock index closed down 763 points or 
42 percent to 17387 
volume on the london exchange came to an extremely heavy 9593 
million shares more than double fridays volume of 4577 million 
shares 
but stock prices on the frankfurt stock exchange tumbled in 
their steepest fall ever with the german stock index plunging 
20356 points or 128 percent to close at 138572 
in athens the main market index fell 144 units or 113 
percent to 113032 at the close on the oslo market the main 
indicator fell 59 points or about 11 percent to close at 464 
wall streets big decline friday came after the european markets 
had closed for the weekend and the tokyo markets relatively calm 
response earlier monday did not reassure european investors 
british airways plc meanwhile reiterated monday it planned to 
pursue the acquisition of ual corp together with a united airlines 
management group although it said the terms of the deal were under 
review 
the failure of the bidding group to line up financing for the 
buyout contributed to fridays debacle on wall street 
nigel lawson britains chancellor of the exchequer said the 
british slump was not surprising and he saw no reason for it have 
an impact on the economy 
in tokyo where trading ended before the london market opened 
the nikkei stock average fell 64733 points or 18 percent to 
close at 3446869 monday 
but official trading was delayed indefinitely on the brussels 
exchange and for 30 minutes in frankfurt because of an excess of 
sell orders stock exchange officials said 
a spokesman for the west german central bank the bundesbank 
said were observing the situation very intensively weve been 
in constant contact with the affected countries he requested 
anonymity 
trading in most shares listed on the paris stock exchange was 
temporarily suspended monday morning because of insufficient buying 
orders traders said 
it was the largest number of stocks suspended since the october 
1987 world shares crash and not enough stocks were being traded to 
allow a percentage calculation of the paris market fall 
such suspensions take effect when shares fall by more than 15 
percent 
within the first 15 minutes of trading in milan stock market 
controllers had suspended trading in several shares for excessive 
price movements officials said the measures were urgent and 
temporary 
in amsterdam the bourses management limited share price 
changes to 3 guilders the equivalent of 143 requiring a 
15minute coolingoff period if they exceed that limit traders 
called the move highly unusual 
the london market europes largest was less feverish than 
during the 1987 crash dealers said and londons stock exchange 
said the trading system was holding up well 
there isnt the same panic as there was during the 1987 
crash said bob wade joint head of market making at robert 
fleming and co so the pressure on the dealing machinery hasnt 
been so intense 
the plunge of 190 points in wall streets dow jones industrial 
average friday occurred two years after a 108point dow drop 
presaged the oct 19 1987 black monday crash of a record 508 
points 
the bank of england said saturday it saw no reason for such an 
exaggerated fall in london share values 
it called the new york price fall a special case sparked off 
by the collapse of the highrisk junk bond market which does not 
exist on anything like the same scale in london 
michael hughes an economist with barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
said on bbctv that the apparent determination of governments to 
prevent a 1987style crash gives underlying support for the 
market so i wouldnt get overexcited about the danger of a full 
crash 
i think they have a vested interest in making sure that 87 
doesnt repeat itself and indeed they have the experience of 87 to 
draw on he said 
the us federal reserve was reported ready to move large 
amounts of cash into the american banking system if money was 
needed to prevent a financial crisis an option would be to lower 
interest rates 
but that was not seen as a choice for britain because of its 
76percent annual inflation rate chancellor of the exchequer 
nigel lawson last week raised base lending rates to an eightyear 
high of 15 percent to control inflation

president bush was poised to sign an order 
today cutting federal programs by 16 billion a spokesman said 
bush still hoped for a lastminute compromise but it might even 
be good if the budget ax does fall 
meanwhile budget director richard darman said the cuts will be 
felt faster than the last time they were invoked 
the cutbacks are required under the grammrudman balancedbudget 
law because of the failure of congress and the white house to agree 
on a deficitreduction package 
unless the house and senate work out a compromise version of 
their deficitcutting bills and send it to bush by midnight 
considered virtually impossible because many lawmakers were out of 
town the president is required to sign the order 
the very very high odds are that well end up in 
sequester the formal name for the automatic cuts richard 
darman director of the office of management and budget told 
reporters today 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would sign an order 
this afternoon that will appear in tuesdays federal register 
specifying the acrosstheboard cuts in most federal programs 
outside of social security and other entitlements 
if congress somehow managed to pass a strippeddown 
deficitreduction bill and sent it to bush before midnight the 
president would sign it and there would be no cuts fitzwater said 
but echoing comments that darman made sunday the white house 
spokesman said its not the end of the world and there are some 
reasons why it might even be good if the reductions took effect 
there would be sizable cuts and they would be real they 
wouldnt be any accounting changes theyd be real money that 
wouldnt be spent said fitzwater 
darman said the cuts will be imposed at a very low level of 
federal agency operations making it harder for bureaucrats to 
transfer money to compensate for the reductions 
when the automatic cuts were last invoked for two months in 
1987 they were applied at a higher level making them easier to 
deal with and they were barely noticed by most americans 
it has a little more discipline to it darman said of the 
changed method of imposing the cuts 
the reductions spread evenly across many defense and domestic 
programs are expected to total about 81 billion for defense and 
81 billion for domestic initiatives that works out to reductions 
of about 43 percent in defense programs and 53 percent in 
domestic agencies 
the cuts are expected to be rolled back as soon as congress 
works out a compromise deficitreduction bill the senate approved 
its version of the measure late friday and housesenate 
negotiators could begin their meetings this week 
but darman said sunday it might be best if congress left the 
spending cuts in place instead of rolling them back 
this time if it goes into effect i think it would be good if 
people would live with it and say dont restore the cuts 
darman said on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley 
automatic budget cuts took effect in 1986 and 1987 as well but 
congress acted quickly to restore the lost funds a process that 
darman called phony 
the reductions are not expected to be felt by many americans at 
least initially 
it affects a relatively small number of people in our society 
and affects them in a relatively small way rep bill frenzel of 
minnesota ranking republican on the house budget committee said 
last week 
the automatic grammrudman cuts when the law was enacted in 
1985 were intended to seem so horrific that congress and the 
president would be frightened into cutting the federal deficit in 
order to avoid them 
it didnt quite work out this year 
the law requires a projected deficit for fiscal 1990 which 
began oct 1 of no more than 100 billion if the projected 
shortfall exceeds the target by more than 10 billion today the 
law automatically triggers cuts in spending of whatever is required 
to slash the figure to 100 billion 
the white houses office of management and budget which makes 
the projections estimated in august that the 1990 deficit would 
be 1162 billion 
the cuts apply to all defense programs except for money already 
owed because of signed contracts that means that about 190 
billion out of the budgets 300 billion for defense is subject to 
reductions 
nearly 75 percent of domestic spending is exempt from the cuts 
under a series of special rules written into the law programs not 
subject to any cuts include social security payments on the 
national debt other federal retirement and disability programs 
veterans pensions and compensation and state unemployment 
benefits 
a host of other domestic programs are vulnerable to only limited 
cuts medicare veterans medical care community and migrant 
health centers and indian health facilities cannot be cut by more 
than 2 percent 
early on agencies which receive their budgets in monthly or 
quarterly allotments cope by delaying purchases leaving vacant 
jobs unfilled reducing travel and shifting money within accounts 
the law forbids officials to save money by cutting workers 
salaries this covers virtually all government workers the 
president members of congress judges civil servants with the 
exception of congressional staff workers whose pay is determined 
by senators and representatives 
technically the grammrudman cuts temporarily took effect 
oct 1 and agencies have been watching their budgets since then

currencies in hectic nervous european trading monday reflecting 
tremors in the stock market 
gold prices rose 
traders in london and frankfurt said the dollar swung wildly as 
it mirrored the sharp movements of the dow jones industrial average 
the dow has led the day said one london dealer who added 
that the foreign exchange markets had become considerably calmer 
toward the end of the day with market participants beginning to 
turn their attention to tuesdays us trade figures 
it was a very nervous market today said ernst pullmann 
chief trader at deutschegirozentrale deutsche kommunalbank in 
frankfurt first the dow jones was down 3 percent and then it 
was up 1 percent and the dollar followed right along but it looks 
like the dollar has decoupled itself from the stock market now

president bush trying to reassure troubled 
financial markets said today he was not worried about the stock 
markets plunge the federal reserve backed up the reassuring words 
with hard cash injecting 2 billion into the us financial system 
fed chairman alan greenspan in his first public comments about 
the market gyrations since fridays 190point plunge said the 
central bank and government agencies were watching development in 
financial markets rather closely 
we maintained particular surveillance overnight of asian and 
european markets and have kept in productive contact with our 
counterparts abroad greenspan said in a speech to the american 
bankers association 
coordination exists at a detailed level here in the united 
states among the federal reserve the sec securities and exchange 
commission the cftc commodity futures trading commission and 
the treasury department he said 
the federal reserve bank of new york accounced that it was 
pumping 2 billion into the banking system today it accomplished 
this by buying government securities from banks the money provided 
by the fed to purchase the securities increased the amount of 
reserves that banks have to make loans 
the fed had sent signals over the weekend that it would supply 
as much liquidity as needed to the banking system in an effort to 
contain the damage from the friday the 13th stock market plunge 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which skidded 
more than 49 points in the first 30 minutes of trading this 
morning sported a gain of 4324 points at 261209 by noon on wall 
street 
bush was asked about the stock market today at a picturetaking 
session in the white house im not worried he said 
addressing a reporter the president said you ask if im 
worried no the federal reserve and the sec securities and 
exchange commission and the secretary of the treasury are 
monitoring the situation and thats where it stands right now 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush also was keeping 
close tabs on the situation mainly through treasury secretary 
nicholas brady 
the president feels that the economy remains strong the 
economic outlook continues to look good fitzwater said 
he said bush would be alerted by brady who attended the 
morning senior staff meeting at the white house to discuss the 
situation if the government needed to take any specific 
marketcalming steps 
we wouldnt speculate on what steps might be taken the 
spokesman said well continue to watch it the markets its 
pretty hard to tell what the markets going to do 
a senior fed official speaking on condition of anonymity 
sunday said the central bank was prepared to flood the banking 
system with money to prevent any further stock decline from 
rippling out of control 
we will be there with all the liquidity demand that is 
needed the official said in a telephone interview if there 
are any doubts about liquidity being available there is no reason 
to be concerned 
the term liquidity refers to the ready availability of cash 
developments in overseas marneeded cash to the banking systems in their 
countries to stem any 
fallout from the us plunge 
the worlds central banks also were prepared to intervene if 
necessary by buying dollars to keep the value of the us currency 
from falling precipitously the official said 
for the 6500 bankers gathered for cocktails and conferences 
market events are reminiscent of the opening of the groups 1987 
convention in dallas when the market crashed 508 points causing 
greenspan to abruptly cancel his speech and jet back to washington 
greenspan was widely credited with decisive action that 
prevented the 1987 crash from wreaking havoc on the banking system 
and perhaps toppling the entire country into a recession 
while the injection by the fed of massive amounts of cash into 
the system cannot by itself push stocks higher it does serve to 
reassure nervous bankers that they need not cut off credit to 
securities firms suffering heavy losses 
the brokerage houses assured of a reliable line of credit then 
can refrain from selling stock simply to replace their dwindling 
supplies of cash such waves of forced sales can drive prices down 
even further 
cc hope a board member of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said the regulatory agency had asked banks to stand ready to 
help if asked by the fed 
the banks are ready to participate the fed has lined up 
the players he said weve just expressed our concern to some 
people and said stand by and be ready to do some assistance if 
youre called upon

the frenzied froth of wall street tapered off monday to more of 
a controlled simmer on main street partly because small investors 
prefer longterm strategies and have learned to ride out the 
storms market pros and investors said 
people havent been terribly spooked despite the wild 
gyrations in the market said tom rosencrants director of 
research for interstatejohnson lane in atlanta 
theyre not panicking at this point they are not jumping out 
the windows said earl silver a senior vice president of dean 
witter inc in chicago 
jitters mounted over the weekend after a frantic selloff in the 
last 90 minutes of trading friday plunged the dow jones industrial 
average 19058 points the friday the 13th swoon raised fears of a 
repeat of 1987s black monday when the dow crashed a record 508 
points 
out in the mainstream the monday mood was a mixture of calm and 
concern 
a heavyset man in casual dress watched the ticker at the charles 
schwab amp co office in pittsburgh with bemused calm its never 
the end of the world he said declining to give his name 
i go in for the longterm so im just going to hang in there 
i didnt panic or anything said leon straub 51 an unemployed 
electronics technician in appleton wis im optimistic 
in a week well have forgotten all about it said tom 
ohara executive director of the 132000member national 
association of investors corp fluctuation is part of life in the 
stock market the worst part is these things scare people out of 
the market 
only a fraction of americans own or trade stock so the impact 
of a roiling market merely stirs worries about the economy in 
general according to thomas juster professor of economics at the 
university of michigan 
there almost certainly isnt any direct impact on the vast 
bulk of americans because they arent in the stock market juster 
said but if there is a visible erosion in the economy they turn 
cautious they avoid making commitments on purchases 
john wright of wright investors inc in bridgeport conn said 
35 to 40 percent of the publicly owned stock has been removed from 
the market because of leveraged buyouts and takeovers in the past 
five years 
mr main street doesnt own much stock hes a bystander in a 
weak position i dont think there was much individual reaction 
this was a battle of computers wright said 
in todays market most trading is done by computers and is 
done in multimilliondollar transactions by trust departments 
foundations and institutions such as mutual and pension funds 
and those who have sunk money into stocks have learned not be be 
alarmed at market swings 
the general public is a little more sophisticated than they 
were two years ago said pat campbell senior vice president for 
trading at the ohio company in columbus ohio there is no crisis 
in confidence 
why panic said joan estep 60 a retired pharmacist from 
burien wash ive been through ups and downs before youre 
going to have gyrations im not making any changes in my 
portfolio 
gene armentrout president of gradison financial services in 
cincinnati ohio sensed a certain amount of skittishness but 
his brokers were generally advising people to hold on rather than 
sell 
were in this for the long haul armentrout said we have 
memories as to what happened to people who sold out at the bottom 
of the crash in 1987 they didnt do so well

donald trump scrapped his proposed 7 billion 
offer for amr corp monday but said he was still considering making 
a lower bid for the parent of american airlines 
it was the second unraveling of a giant airline deal since 
friday and came against a background of growing alarm over 
debtfinanced takeovers for large american companies 
i am currently reviewing all my options with respect to amr 
including making another offer at a lower price the new 
yorkbased developer said in a letter to amr chairman robert l 
crandall 
trump said he was also considering increasing his holdings in 
amr or selling his stock he said he would take any other actions 
that i may deem appropriate 
amr based in fort worth texas said it had no comment on 
trumps decision the airline which has said it wanted to remain 
independent had said it would study trumps proposal but the 
company made no other response to his overtures 
trump sent his letter after amrs stock dropped 1375 a share 
to 8487 on the new york stock exchange monday as volatile 
trading on wall street continued following fridays 190point 
decline in the dow jones industrial average trump had offered to 
buy amr for 120 a share 
fridays stock plunge was caused in part by word that the 
managementled employee group seeking to buy ual corp the parent 
of united airlines had been unable to secure financing for its 
proposed 675 billion buyout of that airline 
blue chip issues made a comeback monday but the broader stock 
market remained lower and trading was extremely heavy 
amrs stock was depressed amid the uncertain outlook for airline 
takeovers trading in the airlines shares was temporarily halted 
pending the announcement of trumps withdrawal 
trumps proposed bid announced oct 5 but never formally 
presented to stockholders had been shrouded in skepticism partly 
because of growing criticism over a rash of airline takeovers that 
rely on borrowed money 
the developer gave no details of his financing strategy besides 
a plan to include 1 billion of equity in his proposed offer 
fridays stock drop had cast further doubt on the proposed deal 
trumps decision to withdraw his bid was similar to actions 
taken by investors following the october 1987 stock market 
collapse when falling prices made precrash takeover offers too 
expensive 
at that time for example trans world airlines chairman carl 
icahn temporarily halted plans to take that company private and 
dart group corp canceled its hostile takeover offer for the 
retailer dayton hudson corp 
earlier monday before trump announced he was withdrawing his 
amr bid union leaders and several congressmen criticized his 
takeover proposal saying it would saddle the nations largest air 
carrier with such a heavy debt it would be forced to sell assets 
and cut corners on safety 
opponents of the bid testified before a house committee in 
support of a bill that would give the transportation department up 
to 50 days to block the takeover of at least 15 percent of the 
voting stock of a major air carrier 
the bill has strong backing in the house public works and 
transportation committee but rep john paul hammerschmidt of 
arkansas the panels ranking republican said the bush 
adminstration is likely to oppose it

the turmoil on wall street led mutual fund 
customers to shift money from stocks into safer havens monday but 
firms also reported that last weeks plunge attracted some 
bargainhunting investors 
were seeing a lot of buying as well as selling said steven 
norwitz a spokesman for t rowe price associates of baltimore 
some people are moving their money out of stock accounts but 
other people are looking at this as a good opportunity 
a mutual fund is a company that pools money from shareholders 
and invests it in a group of securities 
as opposed to an investor who might buy stock in one company 
hoping for a quick profit a mutual fund customer is buying a 
diversified portfolio theyre buying for the long term norwitz 
said 
fidelity investments the countrys largest mutual fund company 
received about twice as many calls as normal since the stock market 
plunged 190 points on friday said lawrence dwyer a spokesman for 
the bostonbased firm 
but he said the phone volume was about half of what it was 
during the october 1987 stock market crash 
while many people were asking to redeem their investments in 
stock funds redemptions are running just about under a third of 
what we ran into in the stock market crash he said 
also as the day progressed fidelity got an increasing number 
of orders to buy into stock funds he said 
dwyer noted that most people who redeem their stock investments 
simply move their money into a more conservative investment fund 
such as a money market 
they still have their money and want to invest it he said 
but they just want to put it in more conservative investments 
fidelity polled its customers over the weekend and 84 percent 
said they were investing for the long term dwyer said 
mutual fund investors in general have a pretty good 
understanding of what theyre in they just dont leap said 
betty hart a spokeswoman for the investment company institute a 
washington organization that represents mutual funds 
hart said her agency surveyed mutual stock fund customers around 
the country after the october 1987 crash and found that only 4 
percent withdrew their investments completely within the first six 
weeks 
at the end of august this year total assets in mutual stock 
funds stood at 2421 billion just below the 2429 billion of 
august 1987 
were probably going to see investors staying the course 
said john woerth a spokesman for vanguard group a mutual fund 
company in valley forge pa 
theyve learned the lessons from 87 he said if they 
would have stayed put it would have been better than switching 
out 
mutual fund companies said they had plenty of cash reserves to 
handle stock redemption orders and they would not be forced to 
sell stock in order to shift money from the accounts

the supreme court agreeing to hear a case 
involving the 25 billion merger of the lucky and alpha beta 
supermarket chains said monday it would decide whether states and 
possibly private citizens may use federal antitrust law to break up 
corporate mergers 
the justices agreed to hear arguments by california officials 
seeking to scuttle the luckyalpha beta deal which was placed on 
hold by an order issued by justice sandra day oconnor in august 
lucky californias largest supermarket chain and alpha beta 
the fourth largest operate 550 stores between them 
alpha betas parent company american stores acquired lucky in 
june 1988 
american stores said california customers would save more than 
50 million a year because of increased efficiency from the merger 
but the california attorney generals office said in a lawsuit last 
year that a merger means less competition leading to 440 million 
worth of higher prices each year 
us district judge david kenyon in los angeles temporarily 
blocked completion of the merger ordering continued separate 
operation of the chains even though the financial acquisition had 
occurred 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
ruling in march saying in effect that california attorney general 
john van de kamp waited too long to sue 
the appeals court said california officials if they had moved 
quickly enough could prevent the merger but the appeals court 
said only the federal government not states and private citizens 
has the power to break up mergers after financial arrangements are 
completed 
oconnors order in august had the effect of temporarily setting 
aside the 9th circuit courts ruling 
in other actions monday 
the court rejected an appeal by a righttowork group that 
sought to limit the power of unions to collect dues from 
nonmembers the court refused to hear arguments in an illinois 
case in which the group claimed it was treated unfairly by a 
federal appeals court 
the justices refused to free pan american world airways from 
having to pay 951500 plus interest to two families of 1974 crash 
victims 
the court without comment left intact awards stemming from the 
april 22 1974 crash in indonesia of a pan am plane flying from 
hong kong to los angeles in which 96 passengers and 11 crew members 
were killed 
the court decided not to consider whether the internal revenue 
service when assessing inheritance taxes may challenge deductions 
state courts have allowed for legal fees and executors commissions

striking boeing co workers welcomed news monday 
that contract talks with the company would resume wednesday but 
wondered whether the aerospace giant would offer anything new 
boeing and the machinists union were told a meeting would be 
held in the offices of federal mediator douglas hammond at 1 pm 
wednesday two weeks after 57800 workers walked off the job 
both sides will be here and well play it by ear from then 
on said hammond of the federal mediation and conciliation 
service 
hammond said there was no particular reason for choosing 
wednesday to resume negotiations it was just a matter of me 
assessing the situation and deciding it was time to get them 
back he said 
boeing spokesman harold carr would say little beyond confirming 
the new round of talks and that boeings chief negotiator larry 
mckean would be there 
asked whether boeing had modified its contract proposal to the 
machinists carr said i am not going to comment on anything 
having to do with the proposal itself really we just agreed to 
meet 
union spokesman matt bates said he didnt think hammond had told 
union officials of any specific reason for calling the parties back 
together 
whether there was movement or not i really wouldnt know 
bates said our position is that you cant settle a dispute 
without talking we welcome a chance to see whether boeing has 
reevaluated its position at this point we dont know 
the 57800 members of the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers at boeing struck oct 4 after 
voting 85 percent against a new contract offer from the worlds 
largest commercial jet builder which is enjoying its fifth 
straight year of recordhigh orders 
about 43300 strikers are in the seattle area 12000 in 
wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and lesser numbers at a 
halfdozen other locations 
paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york said he thinks both sides probably are feeling increasing 
pressure and that hammonds call back to the table illustrates a 
little bit of impatience with both sides not attempting to breach 
the gap between the two 
pressure would come not only from airlines concerned about 
ontime deliveries of their planes and from striking workers 
missing paychecks but also from a variety of government agencies 
worried about the inflationary effects of high wage demands the 
fallout from the strike on military contractors around the country 
and the effects on the nations trade balance in which expensive 
boeing airplanes play a significant role nisbet said 
with the total lack of any visible indication that theres any 
movement on either side theres growing concern outside the 
company he said 
the news of resumed negotiations came the same day that the 
first round of full facetoface negotiations began between boeing 
and its secondlargest union which represents engineers and 
technical workers mostly in the seattle area 
dan mahoney general counsel of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association was in the talks and not 
immediately for comment monday but he said earlier that talks 
probably would be held sporadically as needed over the next three 
weeks 
the enineering unions contract expires dec 1 but no one 
expects a strike by the unaffiliated group which represents nearly 
28000 engineers scientists manual writers draftsmen and other 
technical workers about 95 percent are in the puget sound area 
with the rest in portland ore and at scattered air bases in 
california utah and florida 
because of mail voting procedures the soonest a second strike 
could occur would be early january mahoney said 
boeings threeyear offer to the machinists included wage hikes 
of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent bonuses of 8 percent of 
gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990 a costofliving clause 
almost matching inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime and 
increases in some benefits 
after nearly two weeks on picket lines striking workers 
continue to be in good spirits bates said monday 
they know better than anybody that you cannot even dream of 
building airplanes without the people in there and their highly 
specialized skills he said and until boeing develops an offer 
they know there are no airplanes that are going to be built

the securities industry compares its 
circuitbreaker system of temporary market trading pauses with 
traffic lights at an intersection 
like traffic lights the circuit breakers are intended to help 
calm wild markets by halting severe price declines and giving 
traders and investors a chance to stop and check the financial 
landscape before continuing 
but critics argue that the system which takes effect 
automatically when prices fall wildly is possibly 
counterproductive and could worsen any downturn by causing a 
traffic jam of people who want to sell but cant do so 
the reality of it is it could really snowball and cause 
more selling said jack baker who handles trading of large 
blocks of stocks for shearson lehman hutton inc 
the circuit breakers essentially are temporary trading 
restrictions and halts that are imposed during major price swings 
on the new york stock exchange and chicago mercantile exchange 
stock index futures market 
the system was deployed on those markets a year ago to help 
restore investor confidence after the oct 19 1987 crash saw the 
dow jones industrial average plummet 508 points 
institutional investors employing computerized trading 
strategies often use stockindex futures traded on the chicago 
exchange to hedge against losses in the stock market but that kind 
of trading often can cause wild price swings on both markets and 
was blamed by many critics for worsening the 1987 crash 
the securities industry and federal regulators felt more 
coordination was needed between the equities and futures markets 
richard torrenzano spokesman for the new york stock exchange 
said that in a wild market the circuit breakerscan slow things 
down and let everyone assess what is going on 
the system kicked in on the merc last friday after stock index 
futures tumbled in response to a plunge in stock prices that saw 
the dow jones industrial average finish down 19058 points 
but on monday the circuit breakers barely figured in trading as 
the dow industrials shook off a sharp early decline and finished 
well above fridays close 
under the nyse system stock trading is halted for an hour if 
the dow falls 250 points from its previous close and for two hours 
if it falls an additional 150 points for a total of 400 points in a 
single day 
one feature of the system was tripped early monday when standard 
amp poors 500 index futures contracts fell 5 points at the opening 
an opening 5 point drop in those contracts traded on the chicago 
merc triggers a 10minute period during which those contracts 
cannot be traded at any lower price 
a spokeswoman for the merc julie jacobs said that on monday 
buyers surfaced within seconds at prices matching or higher than 
the opening price and trading was never interrupted 
on friday one mercantile exchange trading limit was imposed 
shortly after 2 pm when sampp futures contracts fell 12 points or 
the equivalent of almost 100 points in the dow industrials the 
price of those contracts was not allowed to fall for 30 minutes 
although trading could continue at that price or higher the next 
pause was reached about 45 minutes later when the sampp futures fell 
30 points from the previous days close the circuit breaker 
program calls for trading at that price or higher for an hour 
since fridays trading day was to end 30 minutes later the pause 
ended trading at any lower price for the day 
alfred e goldman director of technical analysis at the 
investment firm ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis said the 
restrictions in the futures market didnt do any good 
whatsoever he noted the bulk of the dows decline of 19058 
points friday came in the final hour of trading 
shearsons baker said that while the futures markets limits were 
in effect sell orders simply backed up people who cant go to 
the futures markets are going to sell stocks he said

blue chip stocks bounded ahead in unusually 
brisk trading today recovering from the worst setback on wall 
street since the crash of 1987 but share prices of many other 
companies trailed behind 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials knocked down by a 
powerful selling wave in the opening minutes of trading rallied as 
buyers flocked to the market to snap up bargains market analysts 
said the 190point plunge in the widely watched barometer on friday 
pushed many stocks to attractively low prices 
the broader market failed to overcome the impact of an early 
selloff however and losers still held a lead over gainers at the 
closing bell 
in morning trading stocks seesawed up and down as substantial 
price declines encouraged fresh buying but by midday the dow jones 
industrial average was embarked on an upward course for good 
computerdriven trading strategies intensified the early swings 
airline stocks bumped into more turbulence investor donald 
trump announced he was withdrawing his 7 billion bid for amr 
parent of american airlines after the companys stock slid more 
than 13 a share amr was halted briefly for the news and skidded 
21 to 76 after trading resumed 
ual parent of united airlines tumbled 56 to 223 word that an 
employeemanagement group seeking to buy ual for 675 billion had 
failed to secure financing for the deal had been cited as the 
direct cause of the markets drop on friday the news cast doubts 
on all future debtfinanced corporate takeovers 
most components of the dow jones industrial average finished 
higher 
besides worries about highly leveraged takeovers market 
strategists blamed a series of factors for sending the stock market 
into a tailspin on friday disappointing inflation and interest 
rate prospects motivated sellers while program trading added to the 
downward momentum 
market strategists were reluctant to speculate about how stocks 
will fare in the near future but they note that current economic 
and business conditions bare few similarities to two years ago

some clients had no desire to ride 
on mondays seesaw stock market others thought it was an ideal 
time to buy and one investor even threatened to sue because his 
regular broker was out sick 
as the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 60 points 
in the first hour of trading kidder peabody amp co broker john 
rodstrom jr sank into his swivel chair in his fort lauderdale 
office juggled calls and tapped at his computer terminal for stock 
quotes 
a raspy voice from wall street barked out advice over a speaker 
this is handholding time said rodstrom everyone gets so 
worked up on days like this that part of my job is just getting 
them to calm down 
on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 
19058 points to 256926 the secondlargest drop behind the 
508point black monday crash of oct 19 1987 most analysts 
said the 200 million drop was linked to an announcement that 
financing was unavailable for a 675 billion buyout of united 
airlines parent ual corp 
but forecasts of another frantic selloff monday were 
contradicted by midmorning with a rally that brought the market 
above the opening level 
while other brokers raced to put in orders rodstrom held back 
his advice to clients patience 
this market is going to testing how high it can go and testing 
how low it can go said rodstrom theres definitely going to 
be a new level come out of this correction figuring out where it 
will be is the trick 
theres a saying dont fight the tape its good advice 
when things are this crazy 
by 1015 am edt the selling frenzy reached a crescendo the 
tick the number of stocks either up or down had reached minus 
940 rodstrom usually uses minus 800 as a signal to buy 
he put in one order others were written out but not executed 
rodstrom took another call the client a wellheeled investor 
with a large stock portfolio was nervous and wanted an update 
everything was down 
just sit tight he told the client were a long way away 
from another black monday i just dont see it 
rodstrom noted that tokyos nikkei stock average was down 18 
percent from friday much less than many analysts had feared and 
the early drop on the new york stock exchange was steady not like 
the free fall of black monday 
the client decided not to sell rodstrom gave a quick thumbs up 
sign as the market rally began 
everyone seems a bit smarter after the 87 crash said 
rodstrom 37 whose desk was littered with market performance 
graphs and telephone message slips there doesnt seem to be that 
panic reaction to shifts in the market were more inclined to lay 
back than jump in screaming to sell 
other factors distinguishing the current market from october 
1987 are declining interest rates and a healthy us dollar 
and you dont hear anyone blaming the deficit for this latest 
drop he said theres the feeling grammrudman the federal 
deficitreduction law is working and the economy is going in the 
right direction 
by early afternoon with the dow up more than 70 points 
rodstrom was beginning to take orders from money managers for 
fastrising issues such as bristolmyers squibb co eastman kodak 
co and general electric co 
for individual investors rodstrom was touting utilities whose 
dividends would be more attractive if interest rates fall further 
back in the old days someone bought 100 shares of ibm and 
stuck it in a safedeposit box said rodstrom that whole idea 
is out the window its all oriented to the shortterm money and 
the immediate profit 
for a company holding stocks in their pension fund for 20 
years this is just a hiccup for someone who just got in the 
market last year this is a big event its all a matter of 
perspective

share prices nosedived across europe on monday in 
their first reaction to wall streets friday the 13th plunge but 
finished above their lows on optimism that new york prices would 
not collapse 
volatility and heavy volume helped disrupt trading in most 
european financial centers severe price drops triggered trading 
halts in some markets and computer problems in others although 
activity remained orderly in madrid and in london the continents 
biggest stock exchange 
were not out of the woods yet but at least we didnt 
crash said a dealer with a large british brokerage firm in 
london

percent lower on the day

million shares more than double fridays volume of 4577 million 
share prices on the frankfurt stock exchange tumbled in their 
steepest fall ever with the german stock index plunging 128 
percent in what one frankfurt dealer called a blood bath 
but other german and some norwegian traders reported that while 
individual investors were dumping stocks institutions were holding 
back 
sharp price drops triggered european versions of circuit 
breakers market procedures designed to calm roiled markets 
and prompted some authorities to step in to contain the damage 
price drops of 15 percent triggered trading suspensions in many 
shares in paris brussels and lisbon 
a deluge of sell orders caused computer problems in brussels 
where there was little trading all session amsterdam also had 
computer problems during its session 
the frankfurt exchange and others stayed open late to compensate 
for the trading difficulties 
right now with the dollar up and wall street up it certainly 
doesnt look like any crash said a zurich dealer 
its all wall street right now an equities analyst with the 
london investment firm james capel and co said adding that new 
yorks performance after the european markets closed would set 
tuesdays tone for europe 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials which 
plummeted 190 points on friday fell sharply after its opening 
before bouncing higher and lower throughout the session the 
widelyfollowed market index finished up 8812 points at 265738 
fridays debacle in new york occurred after european centers had 
closed for the weekend and european investors were not reassured by 
a modest setback in tokyo earlier monday 
britains chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson issued a 
statement after a routine meeting with prime minister margaret 
thatcher saying mondays share price declines were not 
surprising 
he blamed the largely american phenomenon of junk bonds 
lowrated securities used widely to help finance the us corporate 
takeover wave for the slide 
lawson also said as the events of 1987 demonstrated there is 
no need for sharp fluctuations in the stock market to have 
significant effects on the real economy 
a spokesman for the west german central bank the bundesbank 
said were observing the situation very intensively weve been 
in constant contact with the affected countries he requested 
anonymity 
madrid stock exchange president pedro guerrero said the main 
challenge was to maintain liquidity at all costs and this has 
been achieved totally he described trading as frenetic but

with a worldwide audience watching the stock 
market pulled off one of its favorite tricks monday heading off 
in a much different direction from where it was expected to go 
after a worried weekend government policymakers business 
managers and investors big and small arrived at work early braced 
for a possible reenactment of the crash of 1987 
instead they witnessed a rally among many bluechip stocks as 
the market zigzagged erratically in a barrage of trading that left 
analysts and statisticians who track its progress gasping to keep 
up 
this cant be right said a brokeragehouse economist at 
midmorning checking a quotation machine that showed a small gain 
in the dow jones industrial average only moments after it had been 
down some 60 points 
but the numbers were correct the widely recognized average of 
30 bigname stocks had begun a rebound from its early drop and 
from the 19058point loss it suffered on friday to sport a gain 
of 8812 points to 265738 
some broader gauges of stock price trends declined testifying 
that investors had not grown bold enough yet to chase 
enthusiastically after the shares of smaller lesserknown 
companies 
still it was clear that the market wasnt sticking to the 
script of almost exactly two years ago when it followed a friday 
afternoon selloff with a record 508point drop on black monday 
oct 19 1987 
the strength in the blue chips seemed to support the assertions 
of officials in washington and wall street that fridays 
massacre did not stem from any crisis in the outlook for the 
economy the dollar or interest rates 
for the moment at least the markets problems appeared to be 
confined to a collapse of enthusiasm for debtfinanced takeover 
deals intensified by word friday afternoon that financing could 
not be found for a planned buyout of the airline holding company 
ual corp 
in a separate deal investor donald trump said monday he was 
withdrawing a bid for amr corp parent of american airlines 
we had two days to reflect and people became aware of the 
sharp differences between now and 1987 said hugh johnson an 
analyst at first albany corp in albany ny 
like voters listening to campaign promises veteran investors 
have learned to be leery of official statements designed to bolster 
markets in trouble in the dark days of 1929 for instance 
repeated assurances were issued that conditions are fundamentally 
sound 
this time however the optimistic message evidently got 
through amplified by supportive comments from prominent advisers 
at several brokerage firms 
a good many wall streeters gave the federal reserve high marks 
for its tactics over the weekend making its presence felt subtly 
without issuing any formal statements that might have been heard as 
alarm bells 
that was enough to stabilize the confidence of institutional 
investors johnson said they went down their lists of stocks 
and found quite a few that looked cheap 
another theory to explain the markets resilience had little to 
do with the fed or the business outlook 
according to this view professional traders and money managers 
were acting on their memories of 1987 when those who bought stocks 
at depressed levels in the midst of the crash were handsomely 
rewarded by the markets subsequent revival 
mondays session so it seemed offered a second chance to play 
this profitable game 
whether that kind of thinking pays off once more remains to be 
seen in the meantime the activity in stocks monday provided a 
resounding affirmation of another principle summarized two decades 
ago by money manager george a chestnutt jr the market always 
does what it has to do to make the majority wrong

the dollar finished mixed in hectic us trading 
on monday as a rebound in a widely followed us stock market 
index propelled it above its closing levels earlier in the day on 
overseas markets 
gold prices finished higher republic national bank of new york 
quoted an afterhours bid for a troy ounce of gold at 36580 up 
1 from fridays late bid 
analysts credited a rebound in the dow jones industrial average 
for the dollars improved showing in domestic trading compared with 
its closing levels overseas despite the improvement the dollar 
finished below fridays new york closing levels against the west 
german mark japanese yen and swiss franc 
the rise in bluechip stock prices in new york following 
fridays huge selloff was viewed as taking some of the pressure off 
the federal reserve to reduce interest rates 
the dollar seemed to be moving in lockstep with the stocks 
said jeffrey mondschein managing director for foreign exchange at 
continental bank in chicago 
falling us interest rates would make the dollar less 
attractive to foreign investors 
the dow jones industrial average traded in plus territory for 
most of the afternoon and finished with a 8812point gain 
recovering about half of the 19058 points lost on friday 
but jack barbanel of first global asset management in princeton 
nj said the fact that the dollar did not finish broadly higher 
in the us compared with fridays closing levels here indicates 
a lack of confidence by foreign currency traders that the stock 
market has fully recovered from fridays loss 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar fell to 14075 yen from 14400 yen on friday 
later in london the dollar was quoted at 14110 yen in new york

painewebber also of new york said thirdquarter earnings 
totaled 1683 million or 41 cents per share on revenue of 
44487 million that compared with earnings of 2092 million or 
50 cents a share in 1988 
merrill lynch said the thirdquarter results reflected an 
industrywide softness in some of our core business activities 
the lower volume of underwritng activity and principal 
transactions were partially offset by revenue increases from 
commissions and asset management fees the company said in a 
statement 
for the first nine months of this year merrill lynch said it 
earned 1444 million from continuing operations or 123 a share 
compared with a profit of 1641 million or 145 a share in 
1988 
bear stearns chairman alan c greenberg said he was pleased with 
the firstquarter results because several of our departments 
were operating in a very difficult environment 
he said the company saw a decline in principal transactions 
during the quarter due to a drop in government bond trading 
activities among other things 
painewebber said third quarter results included a broadbased 
improvement in core businesses it said the 1988 results included a 
pretax gain of 463 million and without that the quarter would 
have shown a loss 
for the first nine months of 1989 painewebbers earnings 
totaled 4109 million or 85 cents a share on revenue of 127 
billion that compared with earnings of 4184 million or 77 
cents and 130 billion in revenue during the same period last 
year 
schwab said it earned 46 million or 16 cents a share in the 
third quarter on 1421 million in revenue that was up from 
earnings of 27 million or 10 cents a share and revenue of 98 
million 
for the first three quarters schwab earnings rose to 128 
million or 46 cents a share from 68 million or 25 cents 
revenue totaled 1856 million up from 1584 million

stockindex futures prices surged in heavy 
trading monday on the chicago mercantile exchange erasing a lot of 
investor fears and more than half of last fridays dizzying losses 
what we saw today was an avalanche of confidence said 
morris markovitz president of mercury management associates inc 
a commodities trading advisory firm based in new york 
the contract for december delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by 
the standard amp poors 500 index settled 1565 points higher at 
34450 the biggestoneday gain ever the contract is worth 500 
per point 
the contract opened at 32385 five points below fridays close 
triggering a circuitbreaker rule prohibiting further selling 
at prices below that level for 10 minutes 
but buying surfaced almost immediately lifting the contract to 
more than 8 points above fridays close within an hour of the 
opening 
traders and analysts attributed the rally to a resurgence of 
investor confidence following fridays 30point plunge in the sampp 
500 futures which corresponded to a 190point drop in the dow 
jones industrial average 
the dow average rallied 88 points on monday 
experts said mondays supportive factors included the strength 
of the tokyo stock exchange where the main market barometer fell 
by a modest 18 percent the lack of highvolume computerized 
strategies known as program trading and the stated determination 
of british airways plc to continue as a 15 percent partner in a 
group seeking to buy united airlines parent ual corp the collapse 
of the ual deal contributed to the friday selloff 
program trading involves the use of computers to buy and sell 
huge blocks of stocks and index futures in an attempt to profit 
from minute differences in prices on the two markets the practice 
can cause rapid price swings and is believed by some to have 
accelerated the stockmarket collapse of oct 19 1987 
bill finke a vice president of shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago speculated that program traders may have withdrawn from 
the market intentionally 
i would assume the firms that do program trading knew it was a 
crucial day for people to have confidence in the market he said 
stockindex futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of 
stocks at specified prices by a specified date large institutional 
investors use stockindex futures in various trading strategies 
aimed at profiting from the difference between stock prices and 
futures prices 
circuit breakers had halted trading in sampp 500 futures twice on 
friday for 30 minutes each time as prices plunged 
the halts were designed to slow the markets and prevent panic 
selling 
the circuitbreakers were installed last october as part of a 
coordinated effort to prevent another stockmarket crash like the 
508point plunge in the dow average that occurred two years ago 
the chicago board of trade said monday it had added a 20point 
opening limit to its major market index contract a stockindex 
futures product that is not as heavily traded as the mercs sampp 500 
contract

copper futures slumped to twoweek lows on new yorks commodity 
exchange partly on stockmarket jitters and partly on a report 
that a settlement of the 14weekold strike at canadas highland 
valley copper mine was imminent

president bush provided reassuring words 
monday in an effort to calm gyrating financial markets while the 
federal reserve backed up the words with 2 billion in cash poured 
into the us banking system 
the feds supply of cash was viewed as a sizable effort on the 
part of the central bank to contain the friday the 13th stock 
market plunge and make sure it did not have disastrous ripple 
effects through the rest of the economy 
private economists gave fed officials high marks for their 
handling of the matter praising the speed with which the fed 
played a key role in helping to calm the market jitters 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials after suffering a 
190point plunge friday rose 8812 points on monday in the fourth 
heaviest trading day in the history of the new york stock exchange 
richard breeden the new chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission said that the markets performance showed that the 
markets and government regulators had learned lessons from the 
market collapse two years ago when the dow jones average had 
plummeted a record 508 points 
todays developments demonstrate the value of the significant 
improvements that have been made in trading systems over the past 
two years breeden said in a statement after the markets had 
closed 
bush declared im not worried when asked by reporters 
about fridays market turmoil during a morning photo session at the 
white house 
the president stressed that treasury secretary nicholas brady 
and officials at the securities and exchange commission and the 
federal reserve were keeping close tabs on developments 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan echoed that sentiment in 
a speech before the american bankers association greenspan said 
the fed had also been in productive contact with foreign 
governments 
greenspan did not elaborate on what actions the united states 
and other governments were taking but one hour after his address 
the federal reserve bank of new york announced that it had injected 
2 billion into the banking system 
this sizable infusion of cash served to back up comments made by 
a senior fed official over the weekend that the central bank stood 
ready to flood the banking system with money if necessary to 
contain the damage from fridays plunge 
while an infusion of cash cannot by itself push stock prices 
higher it does serve to reassure nervous bankers that they need 
not cut off credit to securities firms that may have suffered heavy 
losses in a market dive 
the brokerage houses assured of a reliable line of credit are 
thus not forced to dump more stock to replenish their dwindling 
supplies of cash such forced stock sales can drive prices down 
even further 
the fed accomplished the 2 billion infusion of cash by buying 
that amount of government securities from banks the money provided 
by the fed to purchase the securities increased the amount of 
reserves banks have to make loans 
the process by which the fed buys and sells government 
securities from commercial banks is the principal method by which 
the central bank controls the growth of the us money supply 
the 2 billion infusion of money was termed sizable by private 
economists they said it if had not been for the market turmoil 
the fed more than likely would have been draining cash from the 
banking system in an effort to keep interest rates steady 
to mop up an excess supply of cash the fed reverses the 
procedure and sells government securities to commercial banks the 
banks are then left with smaller reserves of cash on which to make 
loans 
because of the feds efforts to expand the money supply the 
closely watched federal funds interest rate fell to 850 percent 
monday that rate at which banks make overnight loans to each 
other had been 882 percent last thursday 
the feds efforts to counteract the sudden loss of 200 billion 
in stock values friday had the effect of lowering interest rates 
something that the administration has been pressuring the central 
bank to do for some time as a way of keeping the country out of a 
recession next year 
the fed has been resisting those moves with fed officials 
contending that they were still concerned about inflationary 
pressures in the economy 
a fed official stressed that the central bank could insure that 
the shortterm effects of the feds moves did not lead to 
inflationary pressures by draining away any excess reserves once 
the immediate crisis has passed 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said that the 
fed had to be very careful that its efforts to calm the stock 
market turmoil did not lower interest rates so much that the us 
dollar came under heavy selling pressure 
lower us interest rates make dollardenominated investments 
less attractive and if pushed too far could trigger more stock 
market turmoil as foreign investors dumped their us investments 
in favor of higher returns in other countries 
the fed is conducting a tightwire act sinai said it 
needs to do a little easing to soothe the markets but not too much 
to damage the dollar 
while the dollar opened significantly lower in tokyo trading it 
steadied later in the day

perkinelmer corp announced monday that 
hughes aircraft co of california will buy the companys division 
that helped build nasas superpowerful hubble telescope 
the electrooptics technology division in danbury conn which 
employs 800 will be sold as part of a restructuring announced in 
april perkinelmer spokesman edward bloch said terms of the sale 
were not disclosed 
the division built the optical systems or innards of the 
hubble telescope which is scheduled to be launched next year 
aboard the space shuttle the telescope will allow scientists to 
look seven times deeper into space than earthbased telescopes 
with landbased telescopes we can see a certain distance out 
into space but a lot of what we see is obscured by haze around the 
earth bloch said but when its up 350 miles above the earth 
it will expand the volume by about 350 times from what we can see 
on the ground 
hughes is the nations largest defense electronics company with 
75000 employees and 74 billion in sales in 1988 the company 
designs and produces electrooptical sensors laser systems and 
data processing systems for use in space and on land 
the acquisition by hughes will strengthen its position as a 
leading supplier of electrooptical systems for scientific and 
military applications malcolm r currie hughes chairman and 
chief executive officer said in a statement 
the sale is the second this year in perkinelmers effort to 
unload three of its divisions late last month the norwalkbased 
company announced it was selling its german aerospace unit in 
ueberlingen west germany to the diehl group for an undisclosed 
price 
perkinelmer is also negotiating to sell its semiconductor 
equipment unit and hopes to negotiate a sale by the end of the 
year bloch said 
perkinelmer is retaining its analytical instruments division 
which produces scientific instruments used in laboratories and its 
material sciences division which involves the heat and 
wearresistant coatings used on jet engines 
the company said in april when the restructuring was announced 
that it wanted to focus on instruments and materials technology to 
provide more consistent growth and profits

two of japans smaller automakers 
formally entered the ranks of american transplants monday when 
subaruisuzu automotive inc dedicated its auto assembly plant 
fuji heavy industries ltd which owns a 51 percent share in the 
operation will produce its subaru legacy sedans and station wagons 
here while isuzu motors ltd which owns 49 percent will turn out 
pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles 
some auto industry analysts have expressed doubts about sias 
ability to compete with established transplants such as honda and 
nissan but neither that skepticism nor stormthreatening skies 
diminished a celebrative mood 
gov evan bayh headed the dignitaries at the ribboncutting 
the dedication ceremony commemorates the crosscultural 
relationship between sias two parent companies and the citizens of 
indiana tippecanoe county and greater lafayette said sia 
president tamon yamamoto 
the 550 million 23 millionsquarefoot facility at the 
intersection of interstate 65 and indiana 38 currently employs 
1000 including 60 japanese managers and coordinators employment 
is forecast to reach 1700 by mid1990 as sia approaches full 
production under its first phase and eventually 3200 
under the first phase sia said it should produce 60000 subaru 
cars and 60000 isuzu trucks annually plans call for expanding 
production to at least 200000 vehicles and possibly 240000 
yearly sia officials have said the sia plant is the only 
automobile assembly facility in the united states where two 
completely different product lines are built under one roof using 
the same workforce yamamoto said in prepared remarks 
sia received an 86 million incentive package that included 55 
million in state funds which bayh had criticized as too generous 
in his gubernatorial run a year ago however after his november 
election he and lt gov frank obannon visited sia executives and 
reaffirmed the states commitment to the project 
impact studies project that the plant will generate 39 million 
in local payroll dollars and more than 1 million in state taxes 
sia said 
we are proud of sias evolving role in the states economy 
executive vice president masahara masumitsu the chief financial 
officer said at a news briefing 
the plant is purchasing many of its parts in state including 
steel from northwest indiana transmissions from muncie computers 
from kokomo and glass from evansville 
we consider sia a partnership a blending of peoples 
masumitsu said 
the teamconcept philosophy sia executives espouse means the 
united auto workers wont be welcome at sia vice president james 
woroniecki head of human resources said sias starting pay for 
production workers ranges from 1160 to 1305 per hour with a 
benefits package similar to those at other japanese transplants 
management personnel have the same benefit package as hourly 
employees he said 
as for unions woroniecki said we dont think theyre 
necessary 
ninety percent of the employees hired locally come from within a 
60mile radius of lafayette and just 2 percent are from out of 
state woroniecki said one fifth of the workforce is female and 7 
percent are minorities he said 
sia as the smallest and latest of the japanese transplants may 
face the most uncertain future especially with the disappointing 
sales of the legacy which was introduced earlier this year

us treasury bonds monday returned most of 
their gains from the years biggest rally last week as investors 
cashed in on a previous move to safer fixedincome investments 
however the 200 billion market for highyield junk bonds 
which was partly blamed for fridays stockprice rout showed signs 
of improving with trading picking up from a nearstandstill 
prices were even to lower 
investmentgrade corporate bonds rose slightly while municipal 
bonds were unchanged to higher traders said 
and overseas bond prices were mostly higher reflecting a 
decline in stock prices abroad 
most of mondays slump in the us market came from 
profittaking particularly in treasury bonds following an 
improvement in stock prices here experts said 
were getting the flip side of friday said maria ramirez a 
managing director at drexel burnham lambert inc greater 
opportunities for profits like this dont come that often 
prices of some government bonds gained as much as 25 per 1000 
face value friday and yields skidded to levels not seen in two 
years following a 19058point tumble on the dow jones industrial 
average 
concerns about corporate takeovers and the junk bonds that are 
often used to finance them helped stoke the panicky selling in 
stocks as well as this years biggest government bond rally 
fixedincome securities especially treasury bonds benefited 
from that turmoil since theyre considered a safe haven for 
investors 
stock prices turned mixed in volatile trading monday with 
bluechip stocks recovering but prices of many other companies 
losing value the dow jones industrial average closed up 8812 
points to 265738 
some bond traders said the fact that the stock market didnt 
continue fridays freefall helped keep a lid on bond prices 
i think the profittaking in many bonds was generated by the 
fact that the stock market wasnt getting hit big again said 
elliott platt chief economist at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc 
f ward mccarthy a principal at stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc said the credit markets also were disappointed 
that the federal reserve didnt provide more than the 2 billion in 
funds it injected into the financial system 
in late trading monday in the secondary market for treasury 
bonds the bellwether 30year issue was off about 1 point or 
1750 per 1000 face amount after rising around 20 on friday 
its yield which moves inversely to the price jumped to 797 
percent from 788 percent the lowest level since early april 1987 
prices of shortterm government issues fell between 916 point 
and point intermediate maturities were down about a point and 
longterm issues declined by about 1 point according to figures 
provided by telerate inc a financialinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer stood at 118915 off 722 
meanwhile yields on threemonth treasury bills soared to 772 
percent as the discount rose 54 basis points to 749 percent 
yields on sixmonth bills jumped to 789 percent as the discount 
rose 25 basis points to 751 percent yields on oneyear bills 
increased to 784 percent as the discount rose 36 basis points to 
734 percent 
in corporate bond trading highly rated issues gained some 
ground moodys investment grade corporate bond index which 
measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer rose 023 to 33665 
junk bonds continued to decline although many traders said 
activity picked up significantly and some issues that had fallen as 
much as 30 or 50 per 1000 face value in mondays opening had 
less severe losses at the close 
i think youre seeing activity because people are saying at 
these levels you cant afford not to buy said joan greenberg a 
bond trader at dean witter reynolds inc 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose to 93 532 from 92 2632 friday the 
average yield to maturity slipped to 735 percent from 741 percent

the bush administration conferred closely with 
foreign allies the federal reserve board and wall street officials 
through the weekend in mapping a strategy for averting a black 
monday crisis that in the end never developed sources said 
within the first hour of trading on the new york stock exchange 
monday president bush pointedly told reporters im not 
worried behind the businessasusual image however the sources 
said was a weekend of intentive private consultations intended to 
forestall an escalation of fridays 190point drop in the dow jones 
industrial average 
the average ended monday up 8812 points 
bush federal reserve chairman alan greenspan treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and sec chairman richard breeden sought 
over the weekend to work together to avoid the kind of government 
missteps that may have contributed to the october 1987 crash said 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
their actions included making sure that officials comments not 
add to the markets confusion as was the case two years ago with 
sec comments suggesting the possiblity of a trading halt said the 
sources 
after mondays close breeden said todays developments 
demonstrate the value of the significant improvements that have 
been made in trading systems over the past two years 
also after the close white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said were pleased it stabilized things have worked out 
the strategy also called for close coordination with allied 
governments whose own markets faced the possibility of disruptions 
monday and getting the word out that the fed would pump money into 
the nations banking system to meet brokers cash needs 
brady who chaired the presidential commission that studied the 
1987 crash and recommended ways of dealing with future market 
plunges was assigned the lead role for the administration over the 
weekend said fitzwater

updates saturday and sunday by brady and michael boskin the 
chairman of the presidential council of economic advisers 
fitzwater said 
a senior treasury department official speaking on the condition 
of anonymity said there was constant communication over the 
weekend among brady wall street the fed the sec and the white 
house 
in addition we talked with officials in the united states 
six largest economic allies britain japan france west germany 
canada and italy in an effort to coordinate economic policies 
we wanted to make sure we understood the situation in the 
markets including the currency markets and then we kept a close 
watch when the overseas markets began to open last night the 
treasury official said 
wall street and administration officials credited better 
coordination among regulatory agencies and financial markets and 
some of the socalled circuitbreaker mechanisms adopted on the 
recommendation of the brady commission with helping to prevent a 
repeat of 1987s runaway fridaymonday selloffs 
under the game plan jointly put into effect by the treasury the 
sec and the fed 
the fed made clear over the weekend that it would move to pump 
cash into the banking system should it be necessary on monday it 
did this to the tune of 2 billion in the process providing easier 
credit to banks for overnight loans 
while treasury kept in constant touch with trading partners and 
us agencies administration officials publicly stressed the 
underlying health of the us economy 
the sec sent out teams to closely monitor activity on stock and 
option exchanges feeing the information back to headquarters 
brady also made an unusual appearance at the white house monday 
morning 
in addition to meeting with president bush the treasury 
secretary sat in on the daily meeting of senior white house aides 
and according to those present urged that an upbeat face be put 
on the situation 
while there is a limit to what a president can do to influence 
the stock market beyond rhetoric there is one drastic option he 
has at his command he can order a halt in trading 
fitzwater would not say whether such an option was even 
considered not wanting to advance any speculation that could make 
things worse 
in fact it was a comment during the stock crash of 1987 by 
thensec chairman david s ruder that anything was possible 
regarding a possible trading halt that brady cited in his report on 
the crash for driving stock prices down even further

lin broadcasting corp said monday its board 
took no position on the latest buyout offer from mccaw cellular 
communications inc and requested more information about the 
proposal 
lin also asked bellsouth corp the atlantabased regional 
telephone company with whom it has reached a separate agreement to 
merge cellular telelphone operations what it thought of mccaws 
offer for control of lin 
kirkland washbased mccaw the nations largest cellular 
telephone company said last week it would offer 125 a share or 
275 billion for 22 million of lins 539 million shares 
together with the 51 million shares of lin it already owns 
successful completion of the offer would give mccaw control of lin 
with slightly more than 50 percent of shares outstanding 
under the new offer mccaw indicated it would either buy the 
rest of the companys stock in five years or put the company up for 
auction 
the proposal replaced an earlier buyout offer under which mccaw 
said it would pay 110 a share for the 90 percent of lin that it 
did not already own that valued all of lin at 59 billion 
lin the new yorkbased cellular telephone giant which also 
operates television stations and has a small publishing business 
rejected mccaws earlier offer as inadequate and reached the deal 
with bellsouth 
in mondays announcement lin said its board expects to take a 
position on the mccaw offer before it expires now scheduled for 
oct 27 
but lin said its board wanted to know more about the offer 
including whether mccaw is prepared to guarantee that those shares 
not covered by the new partial tender offer would have a value of 
at least 125 a share 
it also wanted an explanation of how mccaw can be sure other 
bidders will be willing to pay an appropriate price for lin if it 
decides not to buy the rest of the companys shares in five years 
and how it can be sure mccaw will not act in a manner in the next 
five years that would diminish lins value 
in its statement lin said bellsouth indicated that it would 
respond to mccaws proposal in as full and effective a manner as 
is warranted and is carefuly reviewing alternatives

housesenate negotiators agreed monday to ban 
smoking on all continental us airline routes and on all flights 
to or from alaska and hawaii scheduled for six hours or less 
the restrictions would permanently prohibit smoking on nearly 
all scheduled flights within american territory there are about 
16000 airline flights scheduled daily within the united states 
and one tobacco industry lobbyist said he believed the rule would 
allow smoking on about 55 flights per day 
but lobbyist jo ellen deutsch of the association of flight 
attendants said she thought smoking would be permitted on fewer 
than 20 flights per day 
weve now gotten it down to the point where we have virtually 
banned smoking on airplanes said sen frank lautenberg dnj 
one of the architects of the provision 
flights from the west coast to hawaii and alaska are scheduled 
for less than six hours and would be covered by the ban lautenberg 
and others said 
but smoking would be permitted on nonstop flights scheduled at 
more than six hours to or from those states and points further east 
the prohibition would also apply to flights to or from us 
possessions in the caribbean but not to and from guam 
each leg of a nonstop flight counts as a separate flight under 
the smoking ban thus a new yorkhawaii flight with a stop in san 
francisco would be nonsmoking the new yorksan francisco segment 
would count as a domestic flight the san franciscohawaii segment 
would be covered because it is scheduled for less than six hours 
the scheduled time is what counts passengers could not light up 
if the san franciscohawaii leg is delayed in the air to take more 
than six hours 
current law prohibits smoking on flights of two hours or less 
covering 80 percent of us routes those restrictions are 
scheduled to expire in april 1990 
the new rules will take effect 95 days after they are signed 
into law 
the smoking provision is part of a bill appropriating 119 
billion for transportation programs in the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 the house and senate members of the conference committee 
still have to agree on other disputed provisions before the bill 
can go back to the two chambers for approvial of the final version 
to be sent to president bush for signing into law 
lautenberg and rep richard durbin dill who helped write the 
prohibition predicted the measure would be approved in their 
chambers 
the tobacco lobby will realize it could have been worse and 
accept it durbin said 
charlie whitley a consultant to the tobacco institute the 
trade group for cigarette manufacturers said the industry was 
happy that a permanent ban on all flights had been averted 
as much as it preserves well take that he told a reporter 
after the session 
whitley said cigarette makers hope that a department of 
transportation study on airline cabin air quality due out early 
next year will show that smoking is not the only problem with 
cabin air and will suggest ways to recycle it better 
cigarette smoke is a little like a canary in a coal mine 
said whitley a former democratic congressman from north carolina 
you can see it and smell it when there are all these other 
things in the air too 
health advocates and leaders of airline unions who have argued 
that tobacco smoke in a confined aircraft cabin is unhealthy for 
nonsmokers were elated 
im feeling very good said m arnita hannon lobbyist for 
the american lung association essentially weve covered 99 
percent of the flights 
the provision was a compromise between the senate which sought 
a permanent ban on all us flights and the house which preferred 
making permanent the current twohour restrictions 
during talks that lasted several hours lautenberg initially 
said he would insist that if house negotiators did not adopt the 
senate language he would force the house to vote on his proposal 
he said he would believed he would have prevailed on the house 
floor 
but after house whip william h gray iii dpa and several 
others objected lautenberg accepted the compromise which was 
offered by rep martin sabo dminn 
i just felt it was a long a very very long time for people 
not to be smoking sabo said of the flights lasting more than six 
hours 
the house voted 259169 on aug 2 to make permanent the current 
ban on smoking on airline flights of two hours or less that 
prohibition which covers fourfifths of all domestic flights has 
been in effect since april 1988 
on sept 14 the senate voted 7721 to end delaying tactics by 
tobaccostate lawmakers who were trying to block a permanent 
extension of that ban to all flights the chamber then adopted the 
stricter rules on a voice vote
