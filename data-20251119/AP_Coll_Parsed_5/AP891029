the black hills goldrush town where wild 
bill hickok was gunned down in an 1876 poker game begins 
limitedstakes gambling this week in a bid to resurrect the boom 
times of its frontier days 
players will be limited to 5 bets when gambling is ushered in 
at high noon wednesday but the stakes are much higher for deadwood 
city leaders are betting that the blackjack poker and slot 
machines will draw more tourists and generate enough revenue to 
finance restoration of deadwoods crumbling brick buildings on 
historic main street 
deadwood known in frontier days as the wickedest wildest place 
in the west was born in the 1876 gold strike and grew to 7000 
people in just seven months grand houses still perch on the steep 
sides of deadwood gulch forming a city seven blocks wide and three 
miles long 
illegal gambling flourished as recently as the 1930s and 40s 
and until state and federal officials stepped in a decade ago 
houses of ill repute operated fairly openly 
now the town is down to about 2000 people and depends on 
tourists who come to see the no 10 saloon where hickok a former 
us marshal was shot and the hillside cemetery where he is 
buried next to calamity jane a notorious local denizen for many 
travelers this is just a side trip on the road west to yellowstone 
national park or up from mount rushmore 50 miles south 
the despair engendered by a decline in tourism in recent years 
is giving way to excitement and investment said bill walsh owner 
of the 85yearold franklin hotel 
deadwoods going to be fun again that i believe with all my 
heart walsh said were returning to the good old times of 
deadwood and if we do that were going to be successful 
one new investor is actress rue mcclanahan of nbcs golden 
girls who is becoming a partner in calamity janes restaurant 
and art gallery she touted deadwood on a recent appearance on 
johnny carsons tonight show 
the betting begins wednesday in 33 licensed gambling 
establishments 
officials expect a few initial glitches as everyone gets 
accustomed to the fine points of the states new gambling rules 
said don gromer executive secretary of the state gaming commission 
the most obvious problem will be a dealer shortage many 
potential dealers applied late for their licenses and there wasnt 
enough time to complete the required background checks he said 
so far only 90 people have received licenses necessary to work 
as gambling employees owners of the gaming parlors have said at 
least 200 dealers will be needed the gaming commission will meet 
tuesday to approve some license applications filed the past few 
weeks aiming to issue licenses in time for wednesdays opening 
voters statewide approved a constitutional amendment in november 
allowing gambling in deadwood and requiring that the citys share 
of revenue be spent to restore historic buildings and other city 
facilities 
deadwood voters gave final approval in april 
its hard to predict how much money the games will bring into 
government coffers gromer said he thinks deadwood will get 
400000 the first year the state will get 500000 and lawrence 
county will receive 100000 
deadwoods gambling supporters realized their promotions must 
focus on the towns frontier reputation and its most celebrated 
character hickok who was shot from behind while playing poker on 
aug 2 1876 according to legend he was holding two pairs aces 
and eights known as the dead mans hand ever since 
deadwood could develop into a strip of neonlit gaming houses 
like some nevada towns walsh said he would rather see the town 
use its gambling prosperity to build good stores and fine 
restaurants and become a center for the arts like jackson hole 
wyo and aspen colo 
by limiting bets and allowing no more than 15 games in each 
establishment deadwood should be able to recapture its oldtime 
western atmosphere and avoid a las vegas image he said 
melodee nelson chairwoman of the promotional deadwood you bet 
committee said gambling could give the city a yearround tourism 
economy 
its exciting to be putting on extra help for november when 
you usually roll up the sidewalks she said

communist members of parliament on 
saturday endorsed a proposal to change the name of their party as a 
way to expand it into a broaderbased organization 
the party is now called the polish united workers party 
the planned change similar to one recently enacted by hungarian 
communists is expected to be passed at the polish partys 11th 
congress scheduled for jan 27 
a caucus of the 299 communist members of parliament issued an 
open letter saturday saying the puwp has already used up its 
time therefore it is necessary to set up a new party tailored to 
the real needs and aspirations of the working people 
the failure of prior methods of government and economic 
management of the state is a fact 
a party central committee panel met friday to discuss the draft 
of the new party statute that will be submitted to party members 
for discussion before the congress meets the official pap news 
agency reported 
it said there were 70 proposed names for a new party but did not 
list any 
a poll released at an oct 3 central committee meeting showed 72 
percent of the members surveyed favored changing the name charter 
and program of the party founded in 1948 
the survey which drew responses from 11 million of the 21 
million party members refuted the widespread view that our party 
attracts slowtoreform or conservative forces party first 
secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski said 
the communists who in august lost their iron grip on government 
to a noncommunist prime minister and his solidaritydominated 
administration have been seeking a new image 
they were trounced during elections in june winning only the 
seats guaranteed to the party and face the prospect of free 
elections within four years

police detained 355 people 
including 17 foreigners during saturdays rally for democratic 
reform by more than 10000 people marking the 71st anniversary of 
czechoslovak independence 
ten people were also injured in the melee that ensued when 
hundreds of helmeted riot police swinging batons moved in on the 
peaceful crowd the injured were three policemen and seven 
protesters 
the official news agency ctk giving the tally of those arrested 
and injured said the foreigners came from 11 different countries 
it did not identify any by either nationality or name 
official media accused usfunded radio stations and western 
media of encouraging the rally the largest antigovernment protest 
in 20 years 
the peaceful protest began at 3 pm saturday when thousands of 
czechoslovaks defied warnings from communist authorities to stay 
off the streets and rallied in memory of the proclamation of 
czechoslovak independence on oct 28 1918 
police moved in swiftly after the crowd began chanting demands 
for free elections and a new government the helmeted riot squads 
beat up several people and made those detained stand spreadeagled 
against police vans before whisking them away in waiting buses 
we want no violence protesters chanted as they were penned 
in by riot police weve got bare hands they shouted raising 
their hands to show they were unarmed 
ctk said police used mild means to break up the rally after 
about 3000 of the protesters ignored police loudspeaker warnings 
to disperse 
state television broadcast pictures of western camera crews 
filming the rally and a commentator suggested they were partly 
responsible for the demonstration 
ctk accused the usfunded radio stations voice of america and 
radio free europe of helping to organize the protest their 
broadcasts in czech and slovak can be widely heard in 
czechoslovakia 
city streets and most bridges across the vltava river that runs 
through prague were sealed off as sporadic demonstrations 
continued sirens wailed through the city and dozens of police vans 
raced through the streets 
police seized the film of several western photographers 
hours before the rally began the communist government held an 
official military parade on wenceslas square to commemorate oct 
28 1918 when the czechoslovak state came into existence 
the communists took power in 1948 and czechoslovakia remains 
one of the east blocs most rigidly controlled states 
about 1500 soldiers stood ramrod straight as defense minister 
gen milan vaclavik instructed them to swear allegiance to defend 
their homeland 
josef kempny head of the communistdominated czech national 
council stressed in a 15minute speech the importance of 
preserving communist power and reiterated that the government will 
not seek dialogue with independent prodemocracy groups 
there is no sense in debate with those who like to talk but 
who oppose february 1948 and are against socialism who care only 
for the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honest 
workers from their work and to create chaos kempny said 
his speech drew scant applause from an estimated 3000 
czechoslovaks who were given special passes to be allowed through 
police cordons and metal barriers for the ceremony 
three hours later a crowd stood on the same spot demanding 
freedom and a new government 
the crowd chanted the name of tomas garrique masaryk the 
philosopher who founded independent czechoslovakia and cheered at 
banners reading the truth will prevail and we will not let 
the republic be disrupted a popular communist slogan turned on 
its head by the demonstrators 
protesters also chanted support for the charter 77 human rights 
group and for dissident playwright vaclav havel the groups most 
prominent member who was detained last week 
after police began clearing the square about 2000 protesters 
marched to the hospital where havel suffering from a bronchial 
ailment was taken thursday after his detention 
another 2000 demonstrators made their way to old town square 
which like wenceslas is a historic rallying spot they sang the 
national anthem and chanted more slogans before riot police moved 
in 
a group of 3000 to 4000 young people moved to the red army 
square where hundreds of riot police again dispersed them 
last year about 5000 people rallied at wenceslas square on 
oct 28 and were dispersed by riot police using dogs water 
cannons tear gas and batons at least 87 people were arrested 
last week authorities arrested at least 11 dissidents to 
prevent them from attending saturdays rally but activists said 
others escaped the police dragnet to attend 
dissidents said before saturdays rally that recent 
demonstrations for more democracy in neighboring east germany had 
increased popular desire in czechoslovakia to show the ruling 
communists people want more freedom 
the government in czechoslovakia unlike its neighbors in 
poland hungary the soviet union and now in east germany has 
initiated only tentative reforms and refused dialogue with 
independent groups

crown mines south africa more than 70000 blacks gave a 
tumultuous welcome sunday to seven freed leaders of the outlawed 
african national congress at the largest opposition rally ever in 
south africa 
today the anc has captured center stage in south africa 
walter sisulu 77 former general secretary of the group told the 
crowd 
the anc lives it is amongst us shouted union leader cyril 
ramaphosa one of the rallys principal organizers 
virtually every phase of the rally violated laws that make it a 
crime to promote banned organizations but the government allowed 
the rally after approving the release of seven anc leaders from 
prison on oct 15 
all but one of the freed men had been jailed since at least 1964 
police and soldiers set up roadblocks nearby and searched 
vehicles but no police were visible at the stadium 
the crowd filled almost every seat in a soccer stadium recently 
opened between johannesburg and its main black township soweto 
cheers erupted when sisulu and his colleagues walked onto the 
playing field and circled the stadium behind an honor guard of 20 
young militants clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military 
style at the end of the parade was 80yearold militant oscar 
meptha being pushed in a wheelchair 
another roar came when prominent activist murphy morobe read a 
letter of greeting from exiled anc president oliver tambo who may 
not legally be quoted in south africa 
tambo said president fw de klerk who approved the prisoner 
releases in hopes of encouraging blackwhite negotiations on a new 
constitution may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our 
country if he seeks the path to a genuine political 
settlement 
but if he tries to perpetuate minority rule said tambo de 
klerk will disappear forever in the dim mists of history 
in addition to the seven anc leaders the rally also honored 
govan mbeki who was released from prison in november 1987 sisulu 
mbeki and four of the other men were sentenced to life imprisonment 
at a 1964 treason trial along with nelson mandela the ancs 
bestknown leader who remains jailed 
de klerk took power in midaugust and has offered to negotiate a 
new constitution within five years that would extend political 
rights to blacks but protect white interests

the communist partys top leaders gathered in a 
weekend ceremony to honor one of the partys founders and call for 
increase vigilance against the corrosive influence of the west 
the rally to commemorate the 100th birthday of li dazhao was 
reported in detail in the official press sunday with papers 
carrying the full text of a speech by party general secretary jiang 
zemin 
jiang said it is necessary to cherish lis memory at a time 
when external antagonistic forces are pursuing the strategy of 
peaceful evolution and some people at home are advocating 
bourgeois liberalization 
he added it is necessary to use marxism to battle the 
erroneous tendency of opposing the basic theory of marxism and 
blindly following bourgeois ideologies of western countries 
jiang said party leaders must develop a real mastery of 
marxism and work to cultivate a great number of young marxists 
the younger generation especially should learn from li dazhao 
his firm beliefs and noble morality it should inherit and carry 
forward the fine traditions of the party while resisting the 
corrosive influence of the decadent feudal and bourgeois 
ideologies 
the speech delivered before 1000 officials in beijing 
reflected the strongly antiwestern stance the government has taken 
since spring when chinese leaders ordered the military to smash the 
studentled prodemocracy movement 
jiang and other leaders stress that chinas opendoor policy is 
unchanged and that the country continues to urge western 
businessmen to invest in china but at the same time they accuse 
the west of trying to sabotage chinas socialist system by bringing 
about a peaceful evolution to capitalism and of contaminating 
china with pornography materialism and other social ills 
jiang praised li for picking up some good elements from western 
capitalist countries while exposing the unconquerable 
contradictions of capitalism 
others at the rally included premier li peng and president yang 
shangkun it was chaired by peng zhen an 87yearold conservative 
who formerly headed the national peoples congress 
li dazhao a librarian at what is today beijing university was 
converted to marxism after the bolshevik revolution in russia and 
took an active role in the 1919 may 4th movement chinas first 
student movement for democratic reform 
he was one of the cofounders of the chinese communist party in 
1921 and is thought to have influenced the thinking of his young 
assistant mao tsetung with his views that the peasant class 
should take the lead in the revolution 
he was executed by a nationalist warlord in 1927

former president richard nixon met sunday with 
education minister li tieying for what the chinese described as 
frank and sincere talks on chinas policy toward its students 
nixon on the second day of a private visit as a guest of the 
government was briefed on chinas practice of being kindhearted 
toward the students while setting strict demands on them the 
official xinhua news agency said 
the government has summarized its student policy in those words 
since it used the army on june 34 to crush a prodemocracy 
movement led by students 
li and other officials have said they will understand educate 
and unify most of the hundreds of thousands of students who took 
part in the protests nationwide while punishing only a small group 
of leaders 
in practice however all students have been required to report 
their activities during the protests and undergo intense political 
education hundreds have been arrested 
xinhua did not say how nixon responded to lis briefing but in 
diplomatic parlance the words frank and sincere often are used 
to describe talks where the sides disagree 
the threeparagraph report said li also discussed chinas 
educational exchanges with other countries but it gave no details 
an earlier twosentence xinhua report on the meeting said 
simply they had a friendly conversation 
nixon has not met with reporters or issued statements since 
arriving for his sixth visit to china details of the trip 
including how long it will last have been kept secret 
nixons 1972 visit began a rapproachement that ended decades of 
uschinese hostility 
nixons spokesman john taylor said the former president came 
not to make news but to have serious and extensive meetings with 
chinese leaders 
he would not specify which leaders nixon will meet but he is 
expected to see senior leader deng xiaoping 
taylor said nixon did not intend to try to mediate a solution to 
the standoff between washington and beijing over chinas violent 
crushing of dissent and over the united states decision to give 
shelter in its embassy to two prominent chinese dissidents fang 
lizhi and his wife 
us criticism of the june crackdown has been blasted as 
interference in chinas internal affairs and us and western 
culture are regularly condemned here as decadent 
but chinese officials have greeted nixon as an old friend 
at a banquet saturday night foreign minister qian qichen 
praised nixon for having shown the foresight and sagacity of an 
outstanding statesman in 1972 
at present when chineseus relations are at a difficult and 
critical moment he is paying his sixth visit to china once again 
showing his political foresight and courage qian said

president bush is finding out much as his two 
predecessors did that the problems of central america are far more 
resistant to solution than he had expected 
on no foreign policy issue has bush deviated as much from 
president reagans approach as he has on central america 
while reagan saw the emergence of the sandinista government in 
nicaragua as a major security threat bush barely mentioned the 
issue during the 1988 campaign 
and as secretary of state he chose a man james a baker iii 
who was perhaps more skeptical than any other in the top leadership 
of the reagan administration about the wisdom of providing military 
support to the nicaraguan contras 
by his actions bush has indicated he felt reagan mishandled 
central america policy just as reagan believed president carters 
policies toward that region invited disaster carter of course 
felt the seeds of conflict there were sown by long years of us 
inattention to human rights abuses 
the central american issue seemed well on its way to a solution 
with the end of us military aid to the contras 20 months ago and 
the promise at least of a free and fair election in nicaragua in 
february 1990 
but much of momentum toward an eventual settlement in nicaragua 
seemed to dissipate over the weekend when nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega announced with some qualifications that he was 
calling off a cease fire his government had reached with the rebels 
in march 1988 
his timing seemed odd coming as 17 heads of government 
including ortega and bush were assembling in san jose costa rica 
for a hemispheric summit meeting to celebrate democracy 
ortegas main grievance is that the contras despite a series of 
highly touted diplomatic breakthroughs dating back to august 1987 
seem not much closer to being dismantled now than they were then 
and as he stated forcefully in san jose the cease fire has 
never been observed by the contras ortegas asserts that 736 
sandinista soldiers a rate of more than one a day have been 
killed during the supposed cease fire a number viewed with extreme 
skepticism by both us and contra officials 
the bush administration on the other hand believes it has gone 
more than half way in addressing the concerns of democrats and 
others who opposed the reagan approach 
while reagan had made the ouster of the sandinista government a 
high priority the bush administration has tacitly conceded that it 
was willing to have a live and let live policy toward the 
sandinistas 
baker for example opposed any renewal of contra military aid 
and encouraged the rebels not to engage in military attacks against 
the sandinistas 
baker also distanced himself from the contra civilian 
leadership refusing even to answer their correspondence according 
to contra officials 
the bush approach bore almost no resemblance to what it was 
under reagan three years ago when the policy was being run by such 
procontra stalwarts as former national security aide oliver north 
the administration has made some concessions to the rebels the 
1985 trade embargo against nicaragua remains in place and the 
administration favors continued us humanitarian assistance to the 
rebels until after the feb 25 elections 
bakers reasoning was that if the contras stationed in camps 
along the hondurannicaraguan border are demobilized before then 
ortega would have no incentive to hold a fair election 
ortega meanwhile is giving the highest priority to ensuring 
through diplomatic pressure that the contras are indeed 
demobilized by dec 5 the target date set earlier this year by 
central american presidents 
the bush administration has noted that the demobilization of the 
rebels according to the agreement can only take place 
voluntarily and that the deadline therefore is essentially 
meaningless 
the next big test for the administration comes at the end of 
november when the 49 million aid package to the contras comes 
under congressional review 
the aid program will continue through february but only if all 
the congressional committees that deal with contra aid give their 
consent 
the hand of contra aid opponents probably was weakened by 
ortegas surprise announcement over the weekend particularly since 
it followed reports of continued largescale sandinista military 
support for leftist rebels in el salvador

unofficial soviet newspapers used to be 
smudgy carbon copies handtyped and delivered by furtive couriers 
today a frankly anticommunist weekly called atmoda with 
photographs and a color nameplate sells 165000 copies every week 
published by the 200000member peoples front of latvia atmoda 
advocates restoration of independence for the tiny baltic republic 
and an end to oneparty rule 
the truth is written there said rita poradnika 72 who 
lines up each week to buy a copy in the latvian capital of riga 
the russian official newspapers print a completely different 
story 
atmoda which in latvian means awakening is the largest of 
many alternative publications popping up across the soviet union 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness 
they are highvolume public operations a sharp contrast to the 
unofficial publications of the past underground news journals 
dealing with human rights issues including the often repressed 
chronicle of current events have existed for many years but 
largely clandestinely two years ago dissident sergei grigoryants 
typewritten newspaper glasnost became the first underground paper 
to be publicly announced but couriers who delivered it still 
risked imprisonment 
now a fourpage privately operated economics newspaper called 
delim is selling 20000 copies in the soviet far east an 
estonianlanguage joint venture with the swedish publisher bonniers 
sold out its first press run of 10000 in early october even more 
common are flimsy newsletters such as the eightpage byelorusskaya 
tribuna many now are peddled at political gatherings by their 
formerly underground publishers 
prosecution for publishing has virtually disappeared though 
local authorities sometimes seize editions and photocopying 
equipment 
atmoda published in separate latvian russian and recently 
english editions specializes in articles that once sent publishers 
to prison a recent edition featured a draft constitution for an 
independent latvia 
the paper regularly publishes stories designed to shatter the 
soviet version of latvias history 
one denied claims that the republics economy flourished under 
communism 
another appeared under a banner headline trumpeting aug 23 
1939 the beginning of the enslavement of the baltics there 
followed an article on the signing of the nazisoviet 
nonaggression pact which divided poland and the baltics between 
hitlers germany and stalins soviet union within a year the red 
army had moved into latvia which then was annexed to the soviet 
union 
atmoda has moved far deeper into onceforbidden territory than 
the most daring of the official press which were given a recent 
tonguelashing by gorbachev 
at an oct 13 meeting the president accused editors of major 
publications including two popular weeklies of setting political 
passions afire without helping solve the problems they have 
exposed according to one of the editors 
and theyre loyal compared to us alex grigoriev editor of 
atmodas russian edition said of the chiefs of the two weeklies 
given atmodas outspoken antiparty line its editors profess 
amazement that they have obtained access to tightly regulated 
printing presses 
the workers at the press and the more clever men in the 
communist party support us too said deputy editor janis 
krumins they can see we are working for real solutions 
atmoda is printed on a press run by the communist party of 
latvia but krumins said the newspaper has been asked to find a 
different publishing house 
its getting embarrassing for them since we are 
anticommunist he said 
latvias central planning department which once controlled all 
supplies provides no newsprint for atmoda the newspaper does some 
ingenious trading instead grigoriev said but he refused to reveal 
the source for fear it would dry up 
atmodas staff is seeking another way of increasing its paper 
supply 
were organizing recycling of old paper and contracting with a 
factory to process it krumins said 
the russian edition with a current circulation of 65000 
focuses on news of prodemocracy and independence movements 
krumins said atmoda could sell 1 million copies of its russian 
edition throughout the soviet union if the government would permit 
it to buy enough newsprint 
krumins claimed latvian legislators have spotted atmoda on 
gorbachevs desk 
the latvian edition is more locally oriented and more radical 
reflecting the tenor of its baltic audience one story reported 
results of a poll that said 37 percent of atmoda readers believe 
independence from the soviet union is fully realistic 
all this popularity has made atmoda rich in rubles krumins 
said because it sells for 40 kopecks a copy 10 times the price of 
pravda the communist party newspaper that has enabled atmoda to 
finance a reporting trip to hungary to cover that countrys 
transition from communist rule to a democracy 
foreign currency donations from latvian emigres have provided 
the cluttered atmoda office in an ancient garret in old riga with a 
fax machine and three apple computers 
atmoda is expanding its operation it has rented a riga movie 
theater to show its video magazine and is negotiating for radio 
time krumins said latvianedition editor elita veidemane said the 
organization also plans to start its own publishing house

guerrillas bombarded the capital and a 
missile base for a second day sunday killing at least four people 
and soldiers said the insurgents tightened their grip on roads 
leading to the capital 
the guerrillas claimed 19 people at a wedding party died when 
the government shelled a guerrillaheld area of western afghanistan 
a spokesman for the sovietbacked government accused the 
ussupported moslem guerrillas of cutting supply lines to 
impose starvation on the people 
in the late afternoon air force planes bombed guerrillaheld 
areas in the paghman mountains about 15 miles northwest of the 
city the guerrillas fire rockets from these mountains at a scud 
missile base 
the government acknowledged firing sovietmade scuds at the 
salang highway to drive out guerrillas the route is the main 
supply road from the soviet union to kabul 
at least 13 rockets hit kabul on sunday one hit the grain 
market in the old section of town injuring one man several other 
rockets crashed into residential areas killing four people the 
government said at least 13 other people were injured 
it was the second straight day of heavy bombardment more than 
22 rockets hit the city saturday 
in pakistan where the guerrillas are based the rebels midia 
news agency said the bride and groom survived the shelling at the 
wedding friday but that 19 people including six children were 
killed 
the agency said the attack occurred near the shindand air base 
in farah province 
soldiers and doctors at two hospitals said the scud base was hit 
numerous times but they had no reports of casualties rockets also 
hit the international airport forcing cancellation of one flight 
to new delhi 
on saturday the airport was closed because of heavy shelling 
government soldiers with knowledge of the salang fighting said 
guerrillas were still holding large stretches of the highway on the 
northern slope of the hindu kush mountains fighting has also 
broken out on the southern slope they said 
more than 2000 trucks carrying commodities such as flour and 
gas for kabul were said to be stuck on the highway north of the 
battles 
soldiers also said government troops had been forced to return 
to kabul from a southern road after a convoy of 200 trucks headed 
for the embattled southeastern city of khost was stopped just 
outside the capital 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
guerrilla forces captured military positions near khost 25 miles 
from the pakistani border the government was parachuting in 
supplies he said 
in kabul streets were nearly empty at times and the usually 
bustling bazaars had smaller crowds 
i told my family to stay in bed today said one man who went 
shopping because there was no food in his house the safest thing 
to do is sleep 
government spokesman mohammed nabi amani said the guerrillas 
policy to cut the citys food supplies was antihuman and 
terroristic 
the guerrillas have said they want to cut off all food and fuel 
supplies to kabul forcing the people to flee the city then they 
say they will increase their attacks 
moscow which sent in troops to back the marxist government in 
december 1979 finished pulling its troops out in february

the united states once the worlds most 
popular mediator is farming out the traditional role of peacemaker 
and problemsolver to proxies around the globe 
france has become the subcontractor for resolving the conflict 
between the usbacked opposition and the vietnaminstalled 
government of cambodia 
zaire has been tasked to mediate between the usbacked rebels 
and the sovietsupported government of angola 
egypt has been designated a gobetween for feuding israelis and 
palestinians 
in lebanon saudi arabia and the arab league have been charged 
with mediating the 15year christianmoslem strife 
and in eastern europe president bush got the ball rolling by 
proposing 119 million in aid for poland and 50 million for 
hungary last june but the us contribution is going into a pot 
organized by 24 countries and the initiative is being led by the 
12nation european economic community 
this new trend in us foreign policy has drawn praise and 
criticism 
the administration is acknowledging that it behooves us to act 
less unilaterally and more in concert with other countries said 
john steinbruner director of foreign policy studies at the 
brookings institution 
but the laudable instinct of respecting other countries views 
descends into the notsolaudable instinct of passing the buck 
he added 
bush himself has put his finger on one of the reasons for 
delegating authority to others when he grumbled upon his return 
from europe last june that everybody wants the united states to 
pick up the check for everything they all assume we are 
rolling in money and at the same time foreign leaders are asking 
the united states to balance its budget he lamented 
critics cite less charitable reasons lets face it this 
administration does not have much imagination when it comes to 
problem solving it also makes decisions pretty slowly said 
steinbruner 
us officials are still intimately involved in peacemaking but 
more like big brothers overseeing the process 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen has shuttled to africa 
numerous times in recent months in an attempt to reconcile the 
feuding rebels of jonas savimbi and the angolan government after 
zaires mediation ran into trouble 
secretary of state james a baker iii initially was inclined to 
sit out the latest efforts to get palestinians and israelis to 
discuss an election plan for the israelioccupied territories 
leaving it to egyptian president hosni mubarak to bring the sides 
together he got involved last month when it appeared mubaraks 
efforts were stalled 
but baker decided to sit out the closing session of an 
international conference on cambodia in paris last august because 
participants failed to make progress in formulating a peace plan 
he left it to france and indonesia who cochaired the conference 
to wind up the proceedings 
there are situations and maybe we now recognize it better 
that our involvement is unnecessary and even unhelpful said 
helmut sonnenfeldt who served at the state department and on the 
national security council in the nixon and ford administrations 
i view this not necessarily as a sign of decline but rather 
of maturity he said well continue to have our fingers in 
lots of pies even if its not our entire hand were too big to 
simply bow out 
the evolution of modern us involvement abroad can be traced to 
the postworld war ii period when the truman administration 
injected hundreds of millions of dollars to rehabilitate 
warravaged europe in the socalled marshall plan 
it reached its peak under president kennedy whose policies 
reflected a national impulse to do good around the world his 
presidency launched such lasting institutions as the peace corps 
which sent young americans abroad to help developing countries and 
the food for peace program to provide american agricultural 
surpluses to needy countries 
the generally broad support for the extension of us presence 
abroad began to fray in the late 1960s partly as a result of the 
bitterly contentious american involvement in vietnam 
in the 1980s public support for us foreign aid and 
involvement abroad has dwindled with the perception that the 
european and asian countries which rebuilt their economies with 
generous us support after world war ii should now help bear the 
burden of the worlds problems

soviet and us officials begin a new 
round of talks monday on reducing their vast arsenals of chemical 
weapons but the superpowers differ on whether to stop making the 
deadly gases 
the talks will be the first since president bush and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze unveiled competing proposals 
in september to scrap existing chemical weapons 
although both sides are calling for deep cuts in stockpiles the 
pentagon is opposed to moscows insistence that the superpowers 
also ban production 
continuing talks among 40 nations in geneva also appear headed 
toward a proposed treaty that calls for a ban on production 
max friedersdorf will lead the us delegation when the five 
days of superpower talks begin in new york sergei batsanov is the 
chief soviet negotiator 
in his sept 25 address to the un general assembly bush 
offered to cut us chemical weapons stockpiles by 80 percent 
immediately if the soviets reduced their arsenal to the same level 
moscow admits it has 50000 tons of poison gas us stockpiles 
are currently estimated at about 30000 tons of nerve gas the bush 
proposal would leave the united states and soviet union each with 
about 6000 tons 
a day later shevardnadze said the superpowers should go 
further and he challenged washington to agree to stop making all 
types of poison gas including binary weapons which are harmless 
until two chemicals are combined just prior to use of the gas shell 
congress has approved money to continue production of binary 
poison gas bombs and shells and bush administration officials have 
confirmed they intend to continue production of the safer shells 
even after signing a treaty phasing out the weapons 
the pentagon wants to phase out its singleelement gas shells 
which are extremely dangerous if they leak due to aging or are 
cracked accidentally they would be replaced with binary weapons 
the soviets question the logic of agreeing to make massive cuts 
in existing stockpiles while refusing to stop making the weapons 
in a news conference thursday batsanov said from a practical 
point of view it could be called nonsense if you start destroying 
your chemical weapons under an agreement and at the same time you 
start producing new chemical weapons 
the bush proposal calls for an immediate 80 percent cut in 
stockpiles a 98 percent cut within eight years and a 100 percent 
elimination of stockpiles within 10 years 
although implicit in reducing all stockpiles is a ban on 
production washington wants to reserve the right to resume 
manufacture of chemical weapons the soviets claim they already 
have stopped making the weapons and want the united states to do 
the same 
the us and soviet negotiators will be working on the basis of 
a memorandum of understanding signed by secretary of state james a 
baker iii and shevardnadze during their talks in jackson hole 
wyo in september 
the memorandum calls for a first phase in which both sides would 
exchange information on their capabilities and allow inspectors to 
visit designated military and civilian factories and storage sites 
the second phase would involve the exchange of more detailed 
knowledge and surprise visits to production and storage sites 
us spokeswoman caroline dulin said the talks would cover the 
mechanics of carrying out those commitments and would also take up 
the differences in the soviet and us approaches to scrapping 
chemical weapons

the first jet built 
in taiwan made an embarrassing public debut on sunday when the 
aircraft blew a tire as it prepared to take to the skies 
the sleek fighter was rolling down the runway when the tire 
exploded just 70 feet from a reviewing stand where president lee 
tenghui and other dignitaries watched 
the fighters nose and landing gear were slightly damaged but 
the pilot was unhurt another jet took its place and completed a 
fiveminute air show without problems 
that the accident was swiftly resolved proved our air force is 
welltrained and the fighter has a sturdy design president lee 
told a news conference at this air base in central taiwan 
the fighter accelerated to 143 mph at the time and any plane 
could turn over at such high speed the pilot col wu kangming 
said of the errant aircraft yet the fighters strong side wings 
helped slow it down 
gen hau peitsun taiwans top military chief said the 
accident was a chance to further improve the fighter 
when the prototype of the fighter was rolled out in december 
after six years of development president lee christened it the 
chingkuo in honor of his predecessor chiang chingkuo who 
died in january 1988 the planes official name is indigenous 
defensive fighter 
military officials say the fighter is similar to the american

used by taiwan 
it was designed the military has said to meet possible air 
threats from china and to ensure taiwans air superiority over the 
taiwan strait 
the nationalist government which fled to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to the communists is still technically at war 
with china 
officials said taiwan plans to build 250 such planes at a total 
cost of 42 billion 
they say the fighter was designed and produced at taiwans 
chungshan science institute in northern taiwan but news reports 
said it was built with technical assistance from several us 
companies including general dynamics corp and garrett turbine 
engine co 
the united states severed diplomatic ties with taiwan in 1979 to 
recognize china but continues to sell limited defensive hardware to 
taiwan

at least 20000 east berliners observed a minute 
of silence sunday for those killed while attempting to flee over 
the berlin wall the first such public mourning since communist 
authorities built the wall in 1961 
the observance came as the east berliners gathered in a downtown 
square for a rally called by mayor erhard krack to discuss reform 
similar meetings were organized in the southern cities of leipzig 
and karlmarxstadt as part of a government effort to stop 
activists from staging protests to voice their demands 
all three cities have been shaken by large prodemocracy 
protests in recent weeks protesters rallied in at least three 
cities saturday night 
in east berlin microphones were provided for speakers from the 
crowd one of whom called for the minute of silence 
we have to remember those who lost their lives in the 
minefields and along the barbed wire and in the waters of the spree 
river just because once in their lives they wanted to see another 
part of the world said the man who was unidentified 
if the present reform course really leads to a better 
socialism its at least necessary to remember those victims of a 
policy of the past that never corresponded to reality he said 
east german authorities built the berlin wall in 1961 to prevent 
the countrys citizens from fleeing west the walls construction 
was supervised by erich honecker the hardline leader who was 
replaced this month after 18 years as party leader he was replaced 
by egon krenz 
west german human rights groups say 191 people were killed 
trying to flee east germany from 1961 to 1988 
the east berlin dialogue session outside the old city hall was 
sponsored by the citys communist leadership it quickly became an 
emotional forum in which communist leaders were called to account 
for a host of misdeeds and blunders they were frequently greeted 
with boos and whistles 
the leaders were called to task on privileges accorded communist 
officials and were asked to respond to demands for election reforms 
and allegations of police brutality against peaceful prodemocracy 
protesters earlier this month 
one worker demanded the berlin wall be torn down its time we 
were allowed to go where we want he said 
an elderly man shouted to loud applause allow free elections 
now 
guenter schabowski east berlin communist party chief and a 
member of the countrys ruling politburo drew applause when he 
announced his support for approved and wellordered 
demonstrations in the city 
schabowski conceded that demonstrations will remain in east 
berlins political culture and said protesters and city officials 
must work together to prevent an escalation to violence 
east berlins police chief friedhelm rausch apologized to the 
crowd for the brutal way that earlier protests in east berlin were 
broken up 
communist officials in recent days have appealed to protesters 
to attend governmentorganized dialogue sessions rather than taking 
to the streets to demand change 
despite the appeals thousands continue to stage protests 
proreforms activists marched in at least three cities saturday 
night the official adn news agency reported 40000 protesters in 
plauen 10000 in rostock and 6000 in greiz 
east germanys rigid communist line began changing after krenz 
took power oct 18 since then officials have launched an 
unparalleled campaign of dialogue and openness aimed at winning the 
public trust after years of denying the nation had any problems to 
solve 
prodemocracy activists have been critical of the newfound 
willingness for dialogue saying the government is only interested 
in reforms that do not challenge its monopoly on power 
in an effort to address some of the most bitter complaints of 
many east germans the government has promised to draft a new law 
allowing greater freedom to travel west and has declared an amnesty 
for all those who left the country illegally or who were imprisoned 
after failed escape attempts 
about 60000 east germans have gone to west germany since july 
via czechoslovakia poland and hungary 
the new leadership has appealed to those who fled to come home 
and pledged that no one will be punished if they do 
despite the pledge east germans continue to flee 
austrian officials said sunday that more than 1400 east germans 
crossed into their country from hungary en route to west germany 
over the weekend 
the majority of the east germans going west have gone through 
hungary hungary opened its border to the west for the east germans 
on sept 10 the first country to do so

prime minister margaret thatcher said sunday she 
fully supported nigel lawson during his six years as britains 
treasury chief and tried to talk him out of quitting 
but a flurry of public opinion polls taken after lawsons sudden 
resignation as chancellor of the exchequer suggests voters now 
think less of mrs thatcher one poll showed a majority of voters 
want her to step down as conservative party leader before the next 
election 
to me the chancellors position was unassailable i always 
supported him mrs thatcher said in a combative television 
interview on london weekend television 
nigel had determined that he was going to put in his 
resignation i did everything possible to stop him but i was not 
successful 
lawson resigned his cabinet post thursday saying he could not 
continue to serve as long as mrs thatcher retained her parttime 
personal economic adviser sir alan walters the washingtonbased 
walters also resigned 
mrs thatcher said she told lawson she believed advisers were 
hired to advise and ministers to make decisions but she admitted 
sunday i dont know whether lawson would have stayed on if she 
had fired walters 
the two men disagreed over monetary policy and britains entry 
into the european monetary system a mechanism for stabilizing 
european exchange rates lawson supported membership but walters 
called the system halfbaked 
during some heated exchanges mrs thatcher accused interviewer 
brian walden a former labor party lawmaker of being 
domineering and trying to get her to accept blame for lawsons 
resignation 
it is not a question of blaming anyone she insisted 
nigel was a very successful brilliantly successful chancellor 
for six years of course i know that one day he would go i 
didnt expect it to happen this way or as soon 
mrs thatcher rejected waldens suggestions she was unyielding 
and authoritarian saying nonsense i am staying my own sweet 
reasonable self 
however a gallup poll published in the proconservative sunday 
telegraph found that 47 percent of voters polled and 24 percent of 
conservatives thought less of mrs thatcher following lawsons 
resignation 
eighttwo percent of all voters and 69 percent of conservatives 
believed lawsons departure had reinforced mrs thatchers 
reputation as sometimes being bossy and dictatorial the poll 
said 
thirtyeight percent of conservatives and 72 percent of all 
voters in the poll said mrs thatcher was beginning to lose 
control of the situation 
the observer a liberal newspaper said in an editorial that 
mrs thatchers style was beginning to resemble the upas tree a 
venomous javanese bush so powerful that it destroys everything it 
touches 
british broadcasting corp television surveyed 125 conservative 
lawmakers by telephone and said 39 percent believe mrs thatcher 
should change her leadership style while 52 percent do not 
a poll in the mail on sunday suggested 54 percent of voters 
think mrs thatcher should step down as tory leader and let someone 
else lead the party into the next election expected in 1991 the 
mail said that was mrs thatchers lowest personal rating since she 
was voted into power in 1979 
the sunday correspondents poll taken before lawsons 
resignation said the opposition labor party had the backing of 50 
percent of british voters a full 15 percent more than the 
conservatives 
others put the tories from six to 10 points behind labor and 
said their samplings gave the main opposition party 47 percent to 
48 percent of voter support 
the newspapers did not give the margins of error of their polls 
sampling sizes varied from gallups 505 voters to the mail on 
sundays 1043 
in a speech saturday night deputy prime minister sir geoffrey 
howe indirectly warned mrs thatcher that she could not ignore 
britains commitment to become a full member of the european 
monetary system 
mrs thatcher agreed in june that britain would join the system 
when the time is right and reiterated sunday she is waiting 
for other european countries to permit the freer movement of 
capital before signing on

christian leader gen michel aoun 
convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet on sunday to discuss 
the situation in lebanon after hints he may dissolve parliament to 
torpedo an arab peace plan 
aoun rejected the pact because it fails to include a timetable 
for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops in lebanon and he 
branded lebanese lawmakers traitors for approving it 
the cabinet in an extraordinary session under gen michel aoun 
discussed the political situation in lebanon and abroad a 
statement issued by aouns threeman military cabinet said 
the cabinet has made adequate arrangements it said without 
elaborating 
over the past week aoun repeatedly has hinted he may dissolve 
parliament to prevent it from formally ratifying the peace pact 
which was approved by lebanese lawmakers who met in saudi arabia 
last week 
the pact aimed at ending lebanons 14yearold civil war must 
be approved by a parliament session in lebanon to take effect 
aoun has the legal power to dissolve parliament because he heads 
the interim government formed by outgoing president amin gemayel in 
september 1988 
his cabinet vies for power with a rival body headed by prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem 
the arab league has called for parliament to convene by nov 7 
to ratify the agreement and elect a president 
but parliament cannot elect a new president without a quorum of 
deputies and most have not returned to lebanon from saudi arabia 
because they fear aoun will have them arrested 
the deputies especially the christians are obviously afraid 
to return lest the general hold them hostage to block a quorum in 
an election session said the alanwar newspaper in an editorial 
sunday 
unless the arab league finds a solution it seems there will 
be no election or peace accord it said 
in addition to clearing the way for a presidential election the 
accord would give the moslem majority in lebanon more power in 
government 
aoun rejected the accord because it did not meet his demands for 
a deadline for the withdrawal of syrian troops who were deployed 
in lebanon in 1976 to quell fighting in the civil war 
aoun says the syrians broke their agreement by siding with the 
moslems in the war and he has vowed to drive them out

l douglas wilder who created a political 
fund named for the underdog label he wore four years ago as a 
black politician in the south is campaigning like a frontrunner 
for virginias top office 
weve come a long ways said wilder the states 58yearold 
democratic lieutenant governor remembering his 1985 campaign that 
was all but written off by political pundits because of his race 
but wilders opponent for governor republican j marshall 
coleman seems equally confident of victory on nov 7 
the momentum is on our side coleman 47 said at a luncheon 
in the shenandoah valley a rural region where he grew up and 
represented in the general assembly before winning election as 
attorney general in 1977 coleman lost a 1981 bid for governor to 
democrat charles robb and is now a lawyer 
a virginia commonwealth university poll released thursday showed 
wilder leading coleman 44 percent to 38 percent the poll had a 5 
percent margin of error meaning the race is too close to call and 
it was taken before the last tv debate between the candidates on 
oct 19 
coleman appears to have gained momentum since the debate 
largely because his performance was better than in the first tv 
debate with wilder on oct 9 said larry sabato a university of 
virginia political analyst 
wilder speaking last week to a banquet hall crowd of 400 
supporters in the roanoke valley recalled that sabato predicted 
four years ago that his bid to become virginias first black to 
hold statewide office would doom the entire democratic ticket 
which went on to sweep the states top three offices 
now that analyst says the race is mine to lose said wilder 
who would become the first elected black governor of a us state 
if he wins 
coleman will bring president bush for a campaign visit here and 
in norfolk on friday a move that wilders aides described as the 
action of a desperate campaign 
but coleman countered by telling campaign volunteers at a rally 
thursday i challenge my opponent to bring his candidate for 
president to the state bush defeated democrat michael dukakis 
last year 60 percent to 40 percent in virginia 
coleman had public appearances last week with two members of 
bushs cabinet agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and treasury 
secretary nicholas brady as well as former president reagans 
defense secretary caspar weinberger 
on television the coleman campaign is going after wilder on 
character questions the ads cite the virginia supreme courts 1978 
reprimand of wilder who has a richmond law practice for 
mishandling a civil case 
also the gop candidate has a commercial about a vacant row 
house that wilder used to own the house drew attention in the 1985 
campaign after neighbors complained that its dilapidated condition 
diminished the value of their property and that wilder refused to 
repair the dwelling 
coleman also has taken up taxes as an issue citing the states 
biggest tax hike in 20 years under the present democratic 
administration of gov gerald l baliles who is barred by law from 
serving a second consecutive term 
if the states fiscal picture turns sour coleman said the 
democratic majority in the general assembly might raise taxes he 
has pledged to veto any tax increases that are not submitted to a 
public referendum 
what i want to do is hold the line on taxes coleman said in 
an oct 12 degate as a democrat he can be expected to raise 
taxes wilder responded that is record is clear for tax 
relief adding that he has fought for years to repeal the sales 
tax on food and nonprescription drugs 
wilder meanwhile has raised questions about colemans ties to 
prominent northern virginia real estate developer dwight schar 
schar the largest contributor to colemans campaign 
unsuccessfully sought rezoning in 1984 for a fairfax county office 
project on a site that was designated residential 
wilder said the episode showed that coleman who was schars 
attorney and had a financial stake in the office development was 
not concerned about the regions severe traffic congestion 
wilder also has continued a television advertising blitz 
directed at colemans opposition to abortion one ad shows a woman 
who says she is a republican who opposes coleman because of his 
abortion views 
the woman jean durfee of annandale voted in the june 13 gop 
primary but also voted in the states democratic presidential 
primary last year said mike salster communications director for 
the state republican party 
coleman has said he will not press for changes in the states 
abortion law but his supporters acknowledge he has been hurt by 
the issue especially in the populous washington dc suburbs

hundreds of thousands of romans began voting sunday 
in a twoday mayoral election seen as a barometer of the popularity 
of italys political parties 
about 23 million citizens were eligible to vote for the new 
80member city council which in turn elects a mayor several 
newspapers expressed concern about a possible low turnout due to 
dissatisfaction with city politicians 
since july rome has been run by a special commissioner named by 
the national government because christian democrat mayor pietro 
giubilo resigned in the wake of charges he steered city contracts 
to friends he denied he had done anything wrong 
voting booths were open from 7 am to 10 pm sunday and from 7 
am to 2 pm monday preliminary results were expected monday 
evening 
the campaign was dominated by debate over a call by a top 
vatican administrator to vote for italys only roman 
catholicaffiliated party the christian democrats 
despite the request by cardinal ugo poletti the papal vicar for 
rome the christian democrats were expected to drop from the 33 
percent of the vote they obtained in city elections in 1985 
the christian democrats have dominated italian national politics 
since world war ii and a poor showing in rome would be a setback 
for italian premier giulio andreotti a christian democrat whose 
close allies have headed the citys coalition governments in recent 
years 
reflecting the importance of the vote andreotti and other 
national party leaders stumped for mayoral candidates 
voters could choose from nearly 1500 candidates for city 
council divided into 23 parties ranging from socialists to a 
group called rock for growth they also voted for local government 
councils 
reflecting increased voter concern about the environment the 
greens party was expected to surge from the 27 percent of the vote 
it captured in the 1985 elections 
the communists italys secondbiggest party who governed rome 
for the first time from 1976 to 1985 were expected to get less 
than the 308 percent they had in the 1985 polls 
the socialists the secondbiggest party in the national 
coalition government hoped to improve from the 103 percent they 
clinched in 1985 
other issues prominent in the campaign were romes severe 
traffic problem pollution and social services 
in an apparent effort to catch the imagination of disgruntled 
voters political parties led their lists of candidates with 
figures of national standing including government ministers 
they also focused more on personality emphasizing the top 
candidates on the list the wouldbe mayors rather than simply 
plugging the partys general ideology as is the custom in italian 
politics 
about 88 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the last 
mayoral elections

president bush has little chance of winning a 
contemplated court battle if he exercises a lineitem veto without 
congressional authorization legal scholars say 
while the move may be politically appealing these experts say 
the constitution and legal precedent offer scant support for such 
use of presidential power 
its kind of a dead duck said georgetown university law 
professor charles abernathy im surprised anyone in the white 
house would float that 
bush as did president reagan before him supports a 
constitutional amendment permitting him to veto individual items in 
a bill while leaving the rest intact 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush may not 
wait may choose to veto an item in some bill to see if it 
works 
we are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test 
case but at this point we dont have one fitzwater said 
the proposal has never been popular with congress whose members 
prefer to bargain for favorite programs without the threat of 
presidential interference 
a lineitem veto is an idea that many of us would resist very 
diligently said rep don edwards dcalif chairman of house 
judiciary committees civil and constitutional rights subcommittee 
although the supreme court has never addressed the 
constitutional issue headon debate over the legitimacy of the 
lineitem veto is nothing new 
the first hint of the controversy may have arisen when president 
thomas jefferson nearly two centuries ago temporarily blocked a 
50000 appropriation by congress for 15 gunboats on the 
mississippi river 
president richard m nixon used a similar tactic when he 
impounded federal funds allocated to the states to fight water 
pollution but six months after nixon left office the supreme 
court in 1975 ruled unanimously that he had exceeded his authority 
the court said withholding the money congress had voted to spend 
was not authorized by law 
abernathy the georgetown professor said the 1975 decision has 
a bearing on the lineitem veto 
the court held there was no authorization by law for the 
president not to spend money congress had appropriated the 
lineitem veto is the same thing he said 
other scholars agree 
this is truly an easy question said duke university law 
professor walter dellinger the president has the authority to 
veto bills he does not have any authority to veto part of any 
bills the presidents power is to accept or reject whatever bills 
congress submits its not an authority to rewrite legislation 
adds american university law professor thomas sargentich who 
specializes in separation of powers issues there isnt a firm 
case on the lineitem veto because people have assumed it cant be 
done 
sargentich said the constitution gives the president an up or 
down vote on the entire bill just as the congress has to vote up or 
down on the bill theres no indication in history that would 
permit selective alteration by the president 
advocates argue that the lineitem veto is needed in time of 
runaway budget deficits to curb congressional excesses and 
porkbarrel legislation 
socalled christmas tree bills that hand out a wide range of 
unrelated goodies violate the intent of the constitutions framers 
to limit legislation to specific subjects they say 
dan popeo of the conservative washington legal foundation said a 
test case could be won if bush has the backbone to force the 
confrontation 
popeo was unable to cite any court ruling to support his 
prediction but said a legal showdown over the lineitem veto is 
a good bet for george bush 
the legislative branch puts itself at great risk by allowing 
the judiciary to review its powers popeo said 
the national academy of public administration a nonpartisan 
research group said in a study released last year that the 
lineitem veto if ever adopted could backfire 
it would increase political confrontations and send lawmakers 
searching for ways to neutralize it the academy said 
the item veto is not a simple politically neutral device for 
bringing about economy and efficiency in government it is first 
and foremost a political instrument the group said 
the constitutions of 43 states permit governors to use such 
vetoes but in many cases the provisions are coupled with a 
requirement for a balanced state budget 
most states have come up with various ways of softening the 
impact of the lineitem veto such as permitting the legislature to 
recall a bill for a compromise adjustment 
some critics of the bush administration think the president may 
be willing to exercise a lineitem veto despite doubts over its 
constitutional validity because any legal challenge might not reach 
the supreme court for years 
conservatives could have a field day said rep edwards 
they think they could get several years of lineitem vetoes

the quake that left at least 1000 
people homeless here deepened the longstanding fissures in the 
relations between authorities and the majority hispanic population 
community activists said 
hispanic leaders complain the city left them out of postquake 
planning sessions prompting them to file a complaint with the us 
attorney generals office last week 
weve had a long history of neglect and discrimination here in 
watsonville said cruz gomez a local activist and city council 
candidate we historically have been left out of the political 
process and are accustomed to lots of promises and no action 
cruz confirmed the complaint was filed and that department of 
justice mediators were meeting with watsonvilles hispanic leaders 
hispanic residents left homeless by the disaster charged the 
city was unresponsive to their postquake needs community 
activists said most of the 1000 to 3000 people left homeless in 
the agricultural city of some 28000 residents were lowincome 
hispanics 
the city initially failed to dispatch spanishspeaking rescue 
workers to help hispanics and didnt distribute literature in 
spanish explaining relief programs said bernardo arellano 
arellano was left homeless in the oct 17 quake and has lived in 
a tent since then i didnt even see anyone from the city until 
about a week later he said 
we keep hearing about how everyone has been helped in san 
francisco and how they are all right now id like to think that 
the reason were still outside isnt because of racial 
discrimination he said but i dont know what else to think 
arellano 23 said he and other lowincome hispanics who toil in 
the fields fear longterm housing needs will be ignored as well 
city officials adamantly denied charges of neglect and 
discrimination and said theyve been doing everything they can to 
help everyone affected by the quake people like arellano are still 
in tents because they have refused offers to live in enclosed 
shelters like the large auditorium at the santa cruz county 
fairgrounds they said 
any distrust in the hispanic community is being fermented by 
certain people and organizations id rather not name said city 
manager john radin there are always a few bigots but there has 
never been any real discrimination here in watsonville that ive 
seen 
state sen henry mello a democrat born and raised in 
watsonville maintained the city doesnt have any more racial 
prejudice than anywhere else 
despite official disclaimers complaints about institutional 
racism and postquake abandonment were expressed by diverse members 
of the hispanic community particularly by the new residents of 
callaghan park 
there in the park at the entrance to the city some 200 
lowincome hispanics have erected about 45 tents the tent dwellers 
shower at the local ymca or in the homes of friends they cook on 
barbeque grills or butane gas stoves 
the standoff at the tent city is the result of a legacy of 
neglect hispanic activists said 
there certainly has been a problem in the past on the part of 
the city in terms of responsiveness to the latino community said 
joaquin avila a fremont attorney who represented gomez and others 
in a federal lawsuit that charged the citys voting system 
discriminated against minority candidates and voters 
watsonvilles aggressive downtown redevelopment displaced a 
disproportionate number of hispanic business owners said avila 
the city has lagged behind in hiring workers and appointing board 
and commission members who reflect the citys majority hispanic 
population he said 
the 1980 us census showed 48 percent of the citys residents 
as hispanic state officials and local activists estimate that 
figure is now closer to 55 to 60 percent

venus and the crescent moon will make a 
brilliant pair in the evening sky thursday offering delightful 
viewing if the weather is clear 
the planet venus is the brightest star in the sky and will 
be visible in the southwest as night falls 
it will be shining close to the thin crescent moon making for a 
dramatic view reports sky amp telescope magazine 
millions of people went outdoors to watch a similar event in the 
spring of 1988 according to the popular astronomy magazine 
at sunset the planet will appear to the right of the crescent 
moon also visible should be saturn to the upper left though it 
will be much fainter 
with luck the magazine adds viewers may be able to observe the 
phenomenon of earthshine 
that is the reflected light from the earth brightening the 
normally dark portion of the moon so it becomes visible although 
not as bright as the crescent portion which is lighted by sunlight 
because the dark section of the moon glows dimly gray when this 
occurs it has been called the old moon in the new moons arms 
though venus and the moon look close together at this time they 
are really more than 65 million miles apart

were still going to need the 401st at crotone even if you 
get a cfe conventional forces in europe agreement between nato 
and the warsaw pact he said 
youre not going to alleviate the requirement to have 
significant air power in the southern flank of nato 
the italian government voted last year to accept the f16s over 
the protests of the communists italys secondbiggest party and 
the main opposition group 
cheney also said he was sure the united states would find money 
to pay the part of the moving costs that nato assigned washington 
on other subjects cheney said the defense department would like 
to add a 15th aircraft carrier to its forces but the possibility 
depended on the defense budget 
you cant go to 15 carrier groups at the same time that 
congress continues to cut several billion dollars a year out of the 
budget he said 
on monday cheney was scheduled to meet premier giulio 
andreotti president francesco cossiga and defense minister mino 
martinazzoli

supporters of rep barney franks fight to 
survive a sex scandal can now vote with their wallets for the 
veteran house democrat from massachusetts 
as the house ethics committee prepares to begin its 
investigation of frank possibly as soon as this week a legal 
defense fund to help frank defray costs is just up and running 
according to dick morningstar a longtime frank booster and fund 
raiser 
much of the money will go to highprofile washington attorney 
stephen sachs a former maryland attorney general 
its just getting off the ground morningstar said in a 
telephone interview from his cambridge mass office last week 
my sense is it will do well 
donors can give up to 1000 to the defense fund but if they 
donate the legal maximum they cannot also contribute to franks 
political campaign an individual giving to both funds can give no 
more than 1000 total 
morningstar said there will be no fundraisers for the legal 
defense fund it will be an attempt to get help from old 
friends he said 
frank has made no announcement about whether he plans to seek a 
sixth term in congress but he is giving every indication he plans 
to defend himself against what he calls vicious lies by stephen 
gobie 
gobie is the male prostitute that frank admits he hired for sex 
in 1985 but gobie has gone far beyond that admission and said 
frank was aware he was running a prostitution ring out of franks 
capitol hill apartment 
morningstar said that despite the ruckus frank has such a 
repository of good will up here hes one of the few people in 
public life who the average voter has recognized does an 
outstanding job 
sachs says his strategy will involve distinguishing between 
those facts that frank has admitted and the statements by gobie 
that frank flatly denies

iran said sunday it will mark the 10th 
anniversary of the storming of the us embassy in tehran by 
letting its citizens tour the captured compound and look at 
iranians who allegedly spied for the cia 
irans official islamic republic news agency urged iranians to 
take an active part in the celebrations on saturday the 
anniversary of the embassys seizure and the beginning of a 
traumatic hostage crisis 
tehran radio said nov 4 the date in 1979 when militants 
stormed the embassy has been officially named day of the 
struggle against global arrogance an iranian euphemism for the 
united states 
both news agencies were monitored in nicosia 
the date of the embassys seizure also marks another key 
anniversary irans revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini was sent into exile in turkey on nov 4 1963 by the 
late shah mohammed reza pahlavi for his campaign against the 
monarchy 
the iranian militants who took over the sprawling embassy 
compound in central tehran held 53 american diplomats and embassy 
personnel hostage 444 days washington severed relations with 
irans revolutionary government 
the union of islamic associations of university students called 
on students to march on the embassy saturday and renew 
allegiance to khomeini in what appeared to be designed as an 
antius protest 
until sunday the government of president hashemi rafsanjani 
leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists had apparently been 
seeking to keep commemoration of the embassy takeover lowkey 
rafsanjani has sought to improve irans relations with the west 
to end its political isolation 
although no early improvement in links with the united states 
was expected his moves have been opposed by antiwestern radicals 
they have demanded massive demonstrations saturday in an 
apparent effort to undermine rafsanjanis efforts 
radical parliament member ahmad rahbari last week declared that 
khomeini who died june 3 called the embassy takeover the second 
revolution and said the officials and people should 
demonstrate the greatness of this day to the people of the world 
tehran radio said authorities will open the gates of the former 
us compound now used as a school for the islamic revolutionary 
guards corps on saturday for the first time to the public and 
foreign journalists 
it said some of the alleged spies will be introduced at a 
televised news conference inside the former embassy 
the radio added that the confessions of the alleged spies 
arrested in april will be displayed at an exhibition in the embassy 
compound 
films showing direct cooperation between the central 
intelligence agency and savak the shahs notorious secret police 
will also be screened the radio reported 
some of the alleged spies made public confessions on staterun 
television several months ago 
they claimed they had been recruited at us embassies abroad 
while applying for visas and asked to provide the cia with 
military economic and political information

american organized labor and seafarers clergy 
claim life at sea is anything but a carnival for workers on cruise 
and cargo ships and the groups want congress to intervene 
mistreatment of sailors is older than the trireme and vaster 
than the oceans and the system of using panamanian and other 
flags of convenience perpetuates unfair practices they say 
paul k chapman chairman of the new yorkbased center for 
seafarers rights at the seamens church institute says the same 
conditions can be found today that were described 150 years ago in 
richard henry danas two years before the mast 
in hundreds of cases that have come across my desk there are 
far too many similarities to the primitive past chapman wrote in 
a yettobe published book trouble on board based on 10 years 
of case histories from port chaplains 
chapters were submitted last week during a house subcommittee 
hearing on legislation that would extend the coverage of us labor 
laws to americanowned ships flying under a foreign flag but 
regularly doing business in american ports 
opponents say such a law would violate international law and 
would drive cruise lines away from home ports in america to ports 
in the caribbean that are easily and cheaply accessible by air for 
most customers they add that us companies would have to give up 
their ownership and no new jobs would be created for us seafarers 
the opponents contend unions charitable organizations and 
seafarers themselves exaggerate the complaints 
chapman lists repeated instances of bribery extortion filthy 
working conditions on rickety rusting ships with jammed plumbing 
and brokendown heating systems and the blackballing or physical 
harassment even jailing of seafarers who complain 
among the worst offenders of wage and hour law and workers 
rights he said are the budget cruise ship lines that have bought 
up old passenger liners and converted them for one three and 
fourday caribbean cruises 
there is just no control of the number of hours a person 
works chapman said in an interview theres no kind of order 
no kind of redress he says an 80 to 100hour week is common 
and only a few categories supplement their earnings often 
averaging far less than a dollar an hour with tips 
workers on cargo and cruise ships are driven from asia the 
caribbean and central america by poverty and supporters of the 
shippers say conditions are better than those in the workers 
homelands 
cruise ships in particular are floating towers of babel in which 
as many as 40 nationalities may be represented which chapman says 
helps owners divide and conquer the labor force and prevent them 
from asserting their rights 
only when they make a claim for what they consider to be their 
rights do they realize that while at sea they have in effect 
sailed into a legal black hole chapman wrote describing both 
merchant and cruise ships 
labor contends the use of flags of convenience which american 
corporations began to take advantage of in the 1940s and 1950s has 
contributed to the decline of the american merchant fleet 
this became such a lucrative dodge that today there are less 
than 400 active oceangoing vessels under the us flag compared to 
approximately 1100 ships owned by american interests flying 
foreign flags said talmage e simpkins executive director of 
the aflcio maritime committee in testimony last week before the a 
subcommittee of the house education and labor committee 
he said that on june 1 this year there were 24000 seafarers in 
this country for 10000 billets compared with 150000 seafarers 
for 61000 billets 32 years earlier 
although this issue has been raised before supporters this year 
can raise the specter of panamas gen manuel antonio noriega 
what if this country in a national emergency tried to 
requisition usowned ships that operate under the flag of panama 
which has the largest number of ships registered simpkins asked 
the united states has signed international labor organization 
article 147 governing working conditions at sea but the us coast 
guard enforces it by forwarding complaints to the flag port 
critics say 
its like writing a letter to noriega chapman said he 
doesnt necessarily even read our mail 
shipowning interests say the law would violate the ageold 
principle that the law of the ships flag governs the internal 
organization and discipline on shipboard 
philip j loree chairman of the federation of american 
controlled shipping says organized labors bargaining excesses 
are to blame for the decline in american shipping 
the bill would simply speed up the transfer of control over 
such ships to foreign interests whose vessels would then be immune 
to the labor relations problems inherent in the bill he said 
he said shipboard living and working conditions have always 
produced and probably always will produce complaints from various 
parties some serious and many of the gardenhouse variety 
said john h reurs representing the international committee of 
passenger lines attempts by congress to export american labor 
and wage concepts to the foreignflag ships are bound to be no more 
successful than efforts to export concepts of american democracy to 
certain foreign countries of the world

defense minister yitzhak rabin told the cabinet 
on sunday that israel did not give south africa any military 
technology developed or funded by the united states 
the denial came a day after president bush said transfers of 
forbidden technology are taboo and that it would not enhance 
relations if israel defied the united states to help south africa 
develop a nuclearcapable intermediaterange missile 
nbc news reported last week that israel had provided pretoria 
with knowhow from israels canceled lavi jet plane program which 
was financed by the united states 
rabin was quoted by other cabinet ministers as saying israel did 
not sell any us technology or any technology developed with the 
help of american funds the cabinet also issued a separate 
statement of denial 
rabin prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister moshe 
arens met for an hour sunday to discuss reports on israelisouth 
african military links and troubled relations with washington 
israel radio said 
the defense establishment did not transfer from israel to any 
other country american technologies or systems that include 
american components without permission by the us authorities 
the cabinet statement said 
all allegations in the nbc report that the lavi technologies 
or american lavi technologies were transferred allegedly to south 
africa are baseless said the statement read to reporters by 
cabinet secretary elyakim rubinstein 
israel scrapped the lavi project in the summer of 1987 later 
that year south africa reportedly launched a campaign to attract 
hundreds of israeli engineers who worked on the lavi before losing 
their jobs some israelideveloped technology for the plane is 
officially for sale 
shamir said the allegations were baseless lies and said the 
israeli public was united in its opposition to south africas 
government which is led by the white minority and denies the black 
majority a voice in national affairs 
we have been the subject of such recriminations many times 
and we explained many times to the american congress and the 
american administration that these all are baseless lies he said 
on israel radio 
israeli officials viewed the reports that israel helped south 
africa build a longrange missile in exchange for supplies of 
uranium as an attempt to pressure shamir into accepting us 
proposals for negotiations with palestinians 
baker following a plan by president hosni mubarak of egypt has 
proposed a framework for getting representatives of israel and the 
palestinians to the table to discuss israelioffered elections in 
the occupied territories

us diplomats are hoping to visit 
seven american members of a missionary medical team who were taken 
captive by mozambican soldiers a us embassy spokeswoman said 
sunday 
cynthia efird the spokeswoman said the americans and two 
captured colleagues had been flown to maputo from a military 
compound in northern mozambique where they were taken into custody 
last week near the border with malawi 
ms efird said mozambican authorities promised to give us 
diplomats access to the captives after initial questioning was 
conducted 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp said the medical 
team apparently entered mozambique illegally but ms efird said 
she did not know if charges would be filed 
mozambique has been wracked by a guerrilla war since 1977 
hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled into malawi and the 
guerrillas of the mozambique national resistance have on occasion 
set up bases there 
the medical team was sent to the border area by the christian 
emergency relief team based in carlsbad calif 
kris courson the relief groups director of medical services 
identified six american members of the team dr ken daugherty of 
san diego dr fred leist and his wife lucille of bremerton 
wash dr john cannon a dentist from davenport iowa and 
paramedics carol roberts of syracuse ny and steve sherrill of 
stroudsburg penn 
ms efird said there was a seventh american in the group but 
she did not release a name 
also seized according to the relief agency was a south africa 
missionary george bezuidenhout and a man named peter hammond the 
relief agency said hammond was south african but ms efird said he 
held a british passport 
south africa formerly aided the guerrillas in their war against 
the leftist government but signed a treaty in 1984 pledging to halt 
this aid the us government supports the mozambican government 
although some rightwing groups in the united states oppose this 
policy and depict the rebels as freedom fighters 
hundreds of thousands of mozambicans have died and millions have 
been displaced because of the fighting and resultant food 
shortages the rebels have been widely accused of commiting 
massacres and attacking mostly nonmilitary targets

democrats are renewing the minimum wage fight 
to bolster their assault on the kinder gentler image president 
bush is trying to project even as he insists on cutting taxes for 
the wealthy and denying taxpayer financed abortions for poor women 
democratic leaders want to take advantage of a stalemate in the 
senate over bushs insistence upon cutting taxes on profits from 
the sale of stocks and businesses to win the first increase in the 
335anhour wage floor since 1981 
with women accounting for nearly twothirds of the nations 4 
million minimum wage earners democrats also believe the time to 
strike is now on the heels of bushs recent vetoes of two bills 
that would have expanded taxpaid abortions 
but they have given bush until tuesday to retract his first 
best and only offer vow last spring to veto any increase in the 
minimum wage of more then 90 cents that is not coupled with a new 
sixmonth subminimum scale for newly hired workers bush has also 
demanded that the wage floor not rise to 425 before january 1992 
democrats have scaled back their demands from the package that 
bush vetoed last june knocking off a thirdyear increase to 455 
once the new wage floor is established at 425 in 1991 but they 
still want a training wage that covers only a firsttime workers 
first 60 days of employment 
seeking to avoid another veto confrontation both sides have 
indicated a willingness to compromise further before a vote on the 
house floor wednesday 
the minimum wage is being added to a pot of disputes between 
congress and the white house already boiling from disagreements 
over federally funded abortions and bushs insistence on cutting 
capital gains taxes 
on tuesday senate democrats will try to keep legislation 
providing a threeyear aid program for poland and hungary from a 
gop move to couple it with a capital gains tax cut 
obviously capital gains has nothing to do with aid to poland 
and hungary senate democratic leader george mitchell said sunday 
on nbctvs meet the press i hope very much that well be 
able to proceed 
senate republican leader bob dole interviewed on the same 
program accused democrats of obstructing any effort to bring up 
capital gains 
just give us a vote thats our strategy dole said lets 
vote tuesday 
the house has approved both the capital gains tax cut and an aid 
package for poland and hungary totaling 840 million nearly twice 
what bush asked 
the senate also may consider this week a housepassed bill to 
raise the ceiling on the federal debt to 31 trillion however 
it too is likely to get stalled in the fight over capital gains 
along with several other bills 
the current 287 trillion ceiling expires at midnight tuesday 
but the treasury department plans to borrow an emergency 176 
billion monday to keep the government in money another week and 
cover november social security checks 
before turning to the minimum wage wednesday the house will 
consider bills tuesday appropriating 88 billion for the war on 
drugs and banning smoking on all airline flights 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash originally had set a 
deadline of last thursday for the administration to come up with a 
new minimum wage counteroffer 
however he extended the deadline until tuesday after getting a 
call from white house chief of staff john sununu who was being 
told throughout the week by republican lawmakers and conservative 
democrats who sustained bushs veto last summer that they would not 
walk that plank again 
the issue has been greatly simplified at least for a great 
many of us said sen pete v domenici rnm referring to the 
new democratic package its time to change the minimum wage 
425 over the next two years is agreeable to me 
i think its resolvable domenici said referring to a 
willingness by democrats and most republicans to compromise 
differences in the training wage proposals he said he would tell 
the white house over the weekend that we ought to get off the 
dime 
bushs aides are well aware that republican lawmakers up for 
reelection in a year are getting skittish about his intransigence 
on the minimum wage while insisting on a cut in capital gains taxes 
that would primarily benefit holders of wealth 
i dont think the president would enjoy vetoing a second 
minimum wage bill house republican leader bob michel told 
reporters after meeting with sununu last week the president will 
have to bend a little bit 
democratic leaders say they have picked up at least a dozen of 
the 37 votes they would need to make up from last summer to muster 
a twothirds vetoproof majority by wednesday 
sununu has discussed possible compromises with many of those 
defectors but not with democratic leaders 
they know that things are moving away from them said rep 
timothy j penny dminn one of 28 house democrats who supported 
bushs earlier veto everybody wants this to be the last time we 
have to vote on this bill

solidarity leader lech walesa told about 
1500 supporters sunday to stop complaining about the countrys new 
free market and it painful price increases and start rebuilding 
through work and enterprise 
everything depends on you more than at any time in the last 45 
years said the leader of the independent trade union movement 
referring to the solidarityled governments steps to loosen the 
governments grip on the economy 
the government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has been 
trying to quickly introduce a free enterprise system since it 
assumed power in august from the communist party 
you wanted to live in europe and you wanted to have what 
europe and the rest of the world have we have started building it 
now said walesa answering questions from supporters as he often 
does on sunday after mass at st brygidas church in his home city 
of gdansk 
but he said a lot of people still are waiting for someone else 
to do it for us 
walesa also touched on criticism coming from some quarters that 
the countrys wealth will be sold out to foreigners 
if someone comes here it will be in order to make a profit on 
us and this is why i would like you to open enterprises and banks 
and earn as much as possible yourselves he said but he added 
that foreign investment can provide technology poles lack 
there is a big harvest but the harvesters are lacking he 
said who is supposed to do it the communists lost the elections 
and stepped down poland will be like you make it yourselves or 
others will come and do it for you 
he noted growing disagreement among us with solidarity 
being criticized for leaving behind its program of 1980 when it 
fought for higher wages and lower prices 
but walesa told the crowd there was no going back we are 10 
years older and there are new facts he said 
as far as inflation shooting upward since august at an annual 
rate of about 600 percent walesa said the raging prices are 
normal things on the way to normalcy they are very painful but 
you wanted the market to decide prices and not the minister and 
that there would be no subsidies this government is doing it 
the effects can already by seen but we have to go through 
this period he said 
walesas remarks drew applause

one of the guests at norman and marilyn 
gotschalls bedandbreakfast inn apparently has been around since 
the turn of the century and they dont argue with him 
the inn served for decades as the big bay lighthouse until the 
gotschalls bought and restored it 2 years ago they say william 
pryor first of five keepers of the lighthouse on lake superiors 
big bay point is still around and is responsible for running the 
basement shower and other unexplained phenomena 
he makes the walls creak and the wind howl at night 
gotshcall said you can hear him wailing 
pryor vanished in 1901 gottshcall said hunters found his 
remains 17 months later hanging from a tree about 1 miles away an 
apparent suicide 
gotschall said the first sighting of pryor was reported shortly 
after the inn opened by two guests who saw the spirit walking 
around the lighthouse in his us life saving service uniform 
gotschall said his first close encounter of the supernatural 
kind took place his first night in the lighthouse he heard 
something banging in the wind and went to see what was loose 
but as soon as i got outside the wind stopped and so did the 
banging it did this several times i was up and down but i never 
found anything loose he said 
gotschall claims the ghost makes one annual demand on his time 
every morning in spring he wakes me up taps me lightly and 
bids me to go fishing he said i know that fishing was 
important to a lighthouse keeper so i have to fish every morning 
ive always tried to comply 
i dont want a mad ghost around

nightlife has suddenly appeared in this 
tiny farming community you can tell because for the first time 
there are cars parked on main street after dark 
voters decided to go wet and legalize the sale of alcoholic 
beverages last spring partly in hope of attracting business from 
surrounding towns to keep the community alive the opening of the 
pub in august ended 55 dry years 
still walter brown owner of the pub is keeping a low profile 
since he is aware that new windsor shut down its lone tavern in 
1934 with a local ordinance banning liquor just months after the 
repeal of prohibition allowed it to open 
when he opened he simply put out a bud light sign and 
placed a small advertisement in a weekly newspaper 
i just want to have a clean friendly place where singles and 
couples can come for a quiet drink and some conversation brown 
said 
im going to put up an awning in a few weeks to try to dress 
up the front of the place a little bit he said

municipal officials have entered a highstakes 
game asking voters in a nonbinding referendum if they want 
legalized casino gambling and saying they dont have any option 
for their financially beleaguered city 
if a majority of voters approve in saturdays election mayor 
thomas v barnes will use the results to fortify the citys request 
that the indiana legislature allow a new industry on the shore of 
lake michigan 
thousands of jobs disappeared when the steel industry declined 
in the early 1980s the industry recovered when technological 
advances made its products competitive again but the lost jobs 
never returned 
we dont have any option barnes said friday we have 
brought in some new businesses but the erosion is far 
outdistancing the improvements 
the states secondlargest city dropped to fourth as the 
population dwindled from 190000 to 135000 basic city services 
became erratic and the police and fire departments were cut from 
400 members each to 200 
faced with unemployment twice the state average and meager tax 
revenues barnes became the most visible leader of a procasino 
movement he is opposed by a coalition of influential church 
leaders 
casino opponents say profitable gaming tables would lure 
organized crime and bring increased street crime prostitution and 
drugs 
we are going to win said the rev william booth a gary 
minister who says casinos will drain the communitys lifeblood not 
be a transfusion 
when atlantic city nj brought in casino gambling in the late 
1970s it was also aimed at boosting the local economy but results 
have been mixed at best unemployment among city residents has 
remained high as many of the jobs created by the casinos have gone 
to outsiders 
garys battle to win the nov 4 vote began almost as soon as 
gov evan bayh signed legislation last spring approving the ballot 
the referendum had survived the general assembly as a compromise 
after legislators killed a measure to grant outright approval for 
casinos in gary 
a legislative study committee in indianapolis recommended friday 
that casinos be legalized if city residents endorse the idea 
state sen earline rogers a gary resident and casino supporter 
said a strong if not overwhelming vote saturday should be evidence 
enough for legislators i think 60 percent would be a very 
persuasive argument for approval of casino gaming in gary she 
said 
the states first foray into legalized gambling opened oct 13 
with the hoosier lottery less than a year after voters 
overwhelmingly repealed the constitutional ban on gaming people 
pumped 337 million into the lottery during its first two weeks of 
operation 
a defeat of casinos wont turn out the lights in gary says 
barnes 
were not bankrupt the mayor said were not even running 
a deficit operation here but the problems are critical and anyone 
who sees these conditions each day ought to be desperate to change 
them

congressional leaders on sunday joined 
president bushs denunciation of nicaraguan leader daniel ortega 
and vowed to stand by a promise to provide humanitarian aid to the 
contra rebels through next februarys elections 
at the same time despite the exchange of hostilities between 
bush and ortega in costa rica administration officials indicated 
it was unlikely they would seek a renewal of military aid for the 
usbacked rebels at this time 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said ortegas 
threat to call off a 19month ceasefire between his sandinista 
forces and the contras was a very unwise move particularly the 
timing of it 
mitchell interviewed on nbcs meet the press called 
ortegas declaration later softened somewhat an outgrowth of a 
rivalry between the nicaraguan leader and costa rican president 
oscar arias 
it is my hope the free an open election process will go 
forward and that the results will be accepted by the people of 
nicaragua mitchell said 
he said we intend to honor the agreement the democraticled 
congress struck with the administration last spring to provide 
humanitarian assistance through the feb 25 elections in nicaragua 
senate minority leader bob dole interviewed on the same 
program said he would present a resolution to the full senate on 
tuesday condemning ortega and he said he hoped for a unanimous 
vote 
there are 2 million people registered to vote in next 
februarys election in which ortega is a candidate said dole 
rkan i think ortega sees that as a danger to his dictatorship 
if its a fair election hes gone which would be good news for 
everyone 
despite the headlinegrabbing exchanges that marred costa ricas 
twoday hemispheric celebration of peace and democracy both sides 
appeared to be trying to leave some room for flexibility 
ortega who startled the conference by announcing he would 
suspend the cease fire later amended that to say he would make a 
final decision on tuesday 
the bush administration appeared to be in no mood to try to 
persuade congress to renew military aid to the contras despite the 
flap 
such a move would be sure to generate strong new opposition in 
congress the agreement reached last spring envisions a disbanding 
of the contras after the elections 
a plan advanced in august by the presidents of five central 
american countries calls for the disbanding of the contras by dec 
8 
on saturday bush said well let you know well let you 
know when asked at news conference whether he would seek more 
military aid to the contras in light of ortegas threat to end the 
ceasefire 
however a senior administration official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said bush was not trying to hint or signal 
that he might seek to renew military aid 
there is little sentiment in congress for rearming the 
antigovernment guerillas and winning the congressional committee 
approval needed to continue nonlethal aid through february will be 
difficult enough another official said 
the 49 million aid package agreed to between congress and the 
administration last spring is subject to review and a final 
goahead in late november by congressional committees that oversee 
contra aid 
i assume some of ortegas apologists in congress are going to 
give us a hard time dole said sunday 
he also accused ortega of trying to oneup panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega dictators dont go away 
easily dole said 
on saturday bush called ortegas threat to end a ceasefire with 
the usbacked contra rebels a shameful blow to democracy and 
belittled the nicaraguan president as a little man and an 
unwanted animal at the garden party 
bush said a renewal of allout fighting would be a very bad 
thing for ortega 
for his part ortega implied the united states had dishonored 
the accord with its continued support of the rebels whose 
objective he said was the destruction of the electoral process 
in nicaragua 
however ortega who has often seized upon alleged us 
transgressions in an effort to rally domestic support of his 
flagging government stopped short of threatening to suspend the 
elections 
the nicaraguan leader at one point suggested he would continue 
to observe the cease fire if the united states decided to take 
the money it gives to the counterrevolutionaries and gives it 
instead to the united nations so that it can be used to demobilize 
the rebels inside and outside of nicaragua 
in theory current us assistance to the contras is limited to 
that purpose already congress has long since cut off military aid 
a ceasefire has never been formally agreed between the 
sandinistas and the contras though ortega has informally extended 
it on a monthly basis since march 1988 
scattered fighting has continued all along so whether ortega 
intends any real escalation of his military operations against the 
dwindling contra force such as attacking rebel camps in honduras 
remains to be seen 
under current us policy the contras remaining diehards are 
more hindrance than help for advancing us goals in the region 
the focus now is on support of ortegas opposition violeta 
chamorro in the february elections as well as measures aimed at 
ensuring the voting is honest 
toward that end the united states is funneling 9 million 
through the national endowment for democracy a quasigovernmental 
agency that promotes democratic elections around the world 
an administration official said us policy is for neither side 
to violate the ceasefire in fact the official said the united 
states cut off assistance to a group of contras operating in the 
southern part of the country several months ago when us officials 
learned they were violating the cease fire

federal investigators will convene a hearing 
tuesday to determine whether a manufacturing flaw in an engine disk 
caused an explosion aboard a united airlines flight over iowa last 
july spokesmen said sunday 
the fact is that a preexisting crack was present how that 
relates to what happened is why we are being as thorough as we are 
in the investigation said alan pollock a spokesman for the 
national transportation safety board 
board officials are to open four days of hearings tuesday in 
sioux city iowa to make further determination of what caused the 
tail engine of united airlines flight 232 to explode in flight 
pollock said 
the explosion cut the hydraulic power system in the dc10 
sending the plane into a 42minute spiral that ended in a crash in 
sioux city killing 112 of the 296 people on board 
the washington post in its sunday editions quoted federal 
officials as saying the manufacturing flaw caused the crash 
the origin of the crack appears to be the thing that started 
the whole sequence of events the post quoted anthony j 
broderick as saying broderick acting executive director of the 
federal aviation administration for regulatory standards and 
compliance could not be reached sunday for comment 
the existence of the crack had been announced previously 
spokesmen for the faa and the ntsb said it was too early to 
determine conclusively what caused the crash and that it was up to 
the ntsb under federal law the ntsb investigates air crashes and 
the faa monitors the safety of civil aviation 
the faa is party to the investigation and has access to some 
of the information but they do not have access to the entire ntsb 
investigation of the accident said pollock the ntsb spokesman

residents paused from the sober task of 
rebuilding sunday to celebrate a world series championship as the 
homeless cheered in red cross shelters and fans danced in streets 
littered with earthquake rubble 
this city needs a celebration james meade said after the 
oakland athletics completed a fourgame sweep of the crossbay 
rival san francisco giants with a 96 victory saturday night a 
little happiness will help us bounce back 
people havent been normal since the quake theyve been 
antsy on edge said pat mackey now heres a good way to 
relieve tension 
the triumphant as marked their first world title since 1974 
without champagne because their community suffered some of the 
worst destruction in the oct 17 quake 
im sure well have champagne sometime in the future right 
now its not appropriate said as vice president sandy 
alderson its like a moment of silence 
the city planned a rally monday morning in jack london square 
with the ballplayers and coaches no parade was planned after a 
series marked by an 11day earthquake interruption the longest in 
baseball history 
oakland is home to the quakes greatest single point of 
destruction the milelong section of doubledecked interstate 880 
that collapsed killing 39 people 
about 1400 homes 200 commercial buildings and 12 cityowned 
structures including city hall were damaged in the quake 
damage was estimated at 13 billion city officials said 
were now looking at the long slow insidious damage said 
city emergency planner jim worlund its not dramatic but it 
requires people to move out of their homes 
the quake struck hard at those least able to afford it eight of 
the citys aging lowrent residential hotels were condemned 
forcing about 800 people out into the streets 
more than 400 homeless people sought refuge in oaklands five 
red cross shelters 
well be dealing with these folks for many months to come 
said american red cross spokesman joe mcgraw 
for a few hours saturday night however death and destruction 
was forgotten as hundreds of fans thronged the streets many waved 
brooms and chanted sweep sweep sweep 
a few blocks away bricks from quakedamaged buildings remained 
on sidewalks and streets less than two miles north the twisted 
remnants of the collapsed highway stood as a stark reminder of the 
quakes power 
in addition to releasing earthquakeinduced anxiety winning the 
baseball crown was a proud moment for a city struggling to shed its 
image as san franciscos shabby neighbor oakland has been on the 
rebound in recent years despite a thorny crime and drug problem 
it makes you feel good after the earthquake to see the city 
come back to life said ronnie ami of nearby fremont 
during the weekend a steady stream of sightseers congregated at 
the collapsed freeway watching as backhoes chewed big chunks of 
concrete into smaller chunks to be carted away 
in places the pancaked levels of the doubledecked highway 
rested on a makeshift framework of heavy wooden beams elsewhere 
crews had cleaned up some of the mess and the elevated highway 
ended abruptly hanging in midair like an unfinished sentence 
three of the bestknown survivors of the highway collapse 
dockworker buck helm who was pulled from the wreckage by stunned 
rescuers four days after the quake julio berumen 6 whose leg had 
to be amputated to get him out and his sister cathy 8 remained 
hospitalized sunday the children were listed in stable condition 
while helm remained in serious condition 
meanwhile transportation officials said that the expected 
reopening of the san franciscooakland bay bridge was pushed back 
two weeks a california department of transportation spokesman said 
the original nov 16 target date had been a rough estimate 
were talking about the end of november at this point said 
jim larson the original target was an early guess now we 
have a little better handle on it 
the collapsed portion of the bridge was originally built with 
fewer supports than the lower span that remained in place during 
the earthquake transportation officials said sunday 
a 50foot portion of the upper deck fell like a trap door during 
the earthquake crashing into the lower level one woman died when 
she drove her car into the gap 
the bridge normally carries 260000 vehicles per day as the main 
highway link between san francisco and oakland 
the new upper section will contain 10 steel stringer 
girders instead of the four girders of the original design of the 
53yearold bridge larson said the lower section was originally 
constructed with 10 girders they will all be replaced

israeli troops shot and wounded at least 15 
palestinians in clashes sunday arab reports said while 
palestinians staged a general strike throughout the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
elsewhere sunday the 30 residents of the west bank jewish 
settlement of beit haggi near hebron moved into permanent homes 
built with help from the ministry of housing after living in 
trailers for five years 
israel radio said the trailers would be used to house more 
settlers 
washington has repeatedly criticized israels policy of 
expanding jewish settlements in occupied territory saying it is an 
obstacle to the us formula of trading land for peace 
one beit haggi settler nurit hadad told the associated press 
by telephone that she believed settlements would grow despite the 
palestinian intefadeh or uprising against israeli occupation 
the intefadeh is part of our lives she said if we throw 
up our hands now we will have to throw up our hands for the rest 
of our lives 
more than 70000 israelis live in 133 jewish settlements among 
the 17 million palestinians of the west bank and gaza which were 
occupied by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
at least 606 arabs have been killed by israeli troops or 
civilians during the uprising that began in december 1987 forty 
israelis have died in the violence and 137 other palestinians have 
been killed by fellow arabs for allegedly collaborating with israel 
most of the shooting injuries sunday occurred in the gaza strip 
but two teenagers were also wounded in the west bank cities of 
nablus and tulkarem arab reports said the army said it was 
checking the reports 
sundays general strike was called by both the plobacked 
leadership of the uprising and the islamic fundamantalist movement 
hamas 
the plobacked leaders ordered the action to protest israels 
plan for elections in the occupied territories hamas urged the 
strike to mark the 33rd anniversary of the israeli armys slaying 
of 46 palestinians in the village of kfar qassem 
the mass slaying occurred when farmers not realizing a curfew 
had been declared were gunned down by soldiers as they returned 
home from the fields the curfew was in effect because of the start 
of the 1956 invasion of egypt by israeli british and french troops 
also sunday jerusalem police arrested a 12yearold palestinian 
boy in the arab neighborhood of beit safafa and accused him of 
possessing three firebombs two bottles of gasoline 13 masks and 
two outlawed palestinian flags 
the kid was guarding the stuff apparently there were more 
youths but they escaped said jerusalem police spokesman uzi 
sandori he said more arrests were expected in the case 
the boy whose name was not released was ordered by a judge to 
be held 48 hours for questioning sandori said 
beit safafa a village within jerusalem that was once divided by 
the israelijordanian border has been the scene of stoning and 
firebomb attacks on israeli motorists 
the greek orthodox patriarch of jerusalem diodorus i was 
allowed to enter beit sahour on sunday to say prayers for peace two 
days after he and two other church leaders were blocked by the army 
from entering the christian arab town 
beit sahour near bethlehem has been sealed off for more than a 
month by the army because many of its 10000 residents have refused 
to pay israeli taxes as part of the uprising 
in gazas jabaliya refugee camp soldiers arrested 12 suspected 
members of an outlawed popular committee an enforcing arm of 
the palestinian uprisings underground leadership military 
officials said 
they said the arrests were made saturday they said the 
activists belong to yasser arafats mainstream fatah branch of the 
plo 
the operation was carried out at the heart of jabalya refugee 
camp where people are very much exposed to the influence of masked 
activists the group is large and organized and the performance of 
the forces was very good without fire an officier identified 
only as col g said on israel television

now so does nikolais and louis dance 
the combined group with dancers and dances from both is having 
its first season here oct 17 through nov 5 at the joyce theater 
on sunday afternoon segue the first dance choreographed by 
alwin nikolais and murray louis together had its premiere its 
unusual but new works done separately by nikolais and louis on the 
same program were better 
ten legs choreographed by louis first seen in april in 
montreal is fun five dancers wear leotards of colorful geometric 
patterns over the torso with red legs dancers do new ways of 
lifting each other they form a circle put the weight on their 
shoulders and wave their legs in the air they stack themselves up 
like the pilobolus dance company its all light and amusing 
nikolais intrados had its premiere last week at the joyce 
edward akio taketa and christopher strauss are each inside a metal 
hoop each hoop resting on a sturdy stand 
they curve their spines to fit the hoop plant their feet and 
walk all the way around the hoop inside they stretch out of 
it hang upside down from it balance atop it attain more 
positions in and around it than one would think possible taketa 
looks the happier of the two in his hoop both have amazing muscle 
control its like watching a highwire act 
in segue subtitled thru memorys eyes a man scoots 
onto the stage on a low cart he has a book from which the dancers 
presumably will come 
a program insert shows that the order of scenes is much 
different from the printed program the two choreographers must 
have been working on segue almost to curtain time 
in time and remembrance dancers in leotards the color of 
their skin dance in mechanical fashion the eccentric aunt 
comes in looking like a roundfaced russian doll swirling her 
cape she suddenly dons a white animal mask scoots forward like an 
old person or maybe an animal it was interesting but hard to grasp 
the meaning 
four women in big round hats with wraparound net veils which 
covered their bodies danced with feminine slow gentle movements 
it looked like an avantgarde fashion show martial arts was 
danced by four men dressed like nutcrackers moving mechanically 
a clown making much of his large hands was followed by 
ancestral figures four in etlike masks who could have been 
emerging from the early earths mud finally the first figure 
returned opened the book of history or fairy tales and the 
dancers went to sleep 
lighting and electronic music for all three was done by nikolais 
next year both companies and the joint company will tour

said dagny lancy 21 of penngrove whose floral costume of a stem 
and two blossoms was literally painted on and contained the barest

the centerpiece of epcot centers 
newest pavilion is a specialeffects thrill ride through the 
human body but another film about the conception of a human embryo 
hints of controversy 
disneys 14minute film depicting the conception and birth of a 
baby could lead to complaints especially in view of the simmering 
debate over abortion says the pavilions show producer 
executives for disney and pavilion sponsor metropolitan life 
insurance co view the film called the making of me as 
forthright educational and humorous but they agree it is somewhat 
of a departure for a disney attraction 
i think it will elicit some controversy but our intent is not 
to walk into the teeth of that abortion issue said barry 
braverman who led the design team putting together the wonders of 
life pavilion at epcot center 
disney has no message to deliver other than the natural 
biological process of life said braverman before mondays 
opening we will just have to accept any controversy that goes 
with it if it happens 
the short film gives a witty narration of the basics of getting 
a sperm and egg together to create human life and suggests that 
life begins at conception its narratorprotagonist is martin short 
of saturday night live fame 
the film was written and produced by glenn gordon caron creator 
of the moonlighting television series and director of the 
feature film clean and sober 
it includes startling photographs of fetal development by 
swedish cinematographerphotographer lennart nilsson that have 
appeared in miracle of life on the public broadcasting systems 
nova series 
antiabortion groups used nilssons film in arguments that a 
fetus is a living person even in its earliest stages 
both disney chairman michael eisner and outgoing metropolitan 
life president john c creedon were instrumental in getting the 
birth film made company officials said 
everybody cringed at first but michael and creedon were both 
adamant said pavilion director jim mccaskill of metropolitan 
life 
michael was very strong in having this film braverman said 
explaining the disney departure from light noncontroversial 
subjects of all the elements in the pavilion he was most 
closely involved with this one we went through a lot of scripts 
mccaskill said he didnt think there would be any complaints 
of course anything you do somebodys going to object to it 
but this thing is so well done and so general that anybody that 
would object to it would object to anything 
the making of me is only one of the attractions celebrating 
life and health in the bright festive pavilion the ninth in the

nearly two weeks after an earthquake 
shattered parts of northern california residents of the marina 
district on sunday gingerly picked through the rubble of their 
lives and scavenged for mementos and papers from their past 
a warm sunny weekend next to san francisco bay normally would 
have brought out joggers and bicyclists but instead scores of 
people searched through remains of apartment buildings razed 
because they were no longer safe some people carried belongings 
from damaged structures scheduled for demolition 
dave angelesco 75 teetered atop a mountain of rubble that had 
been his home for five decades as he looked for important papers 
the retired coffee salesman lamented he would have to leave the 
neighborhood he called close to heaven because rent at a new 
spot in the district would be too high 
other marina residents moved out of undamaged structures because 
they will be without the natural gas used to heat their homes take 
hot showers and cook for months as crews lay a new system of pipes 
the city department of public works reported saturday that the 
marina district suffered more damage in the oct 17 earthquake than 
any other part of san francisco 
for the most part the only people who are living here now are 
like us the owners of a building the tenants have moved out 
steven grover a landlord said as he ate lunch with his wife next 
to a salvation army food van 
seventy structures are considered unsafe to enter in the 
affluent neighborhood of aging three and fourstory wood and 
stucco apartment buildings officials said 
displaced renters said they were finding refuge in the homes of 
friends relatives and even strangers some sought government 
disaster assistance 
utility trucks were parked nearly bumper to bumper along some 
streets as crews dug trenches for new natural gas lines workers 
said they are laboring from 7 am to midnight in hope of replacing 
by christmas the shattered system that once served 5700 customers 
though water and electricity services have been restored the 
gas outage means residents who remain must use electric appliances 
to cook use extra clothes or electric heaters to stay warm and 
electric blankets or sleeping bags at night many use portable 
public showers 
well stick it out said alexandra grover who with her 
husband steven coowns an apartment building after the next 
big quake aftershock though we may rethink 
residents have been asked by pacific gas amp electric co to limit 
use of electric appliances and to skip installing new powerusing 
devices because it would strain wiring in aging structures and the 
utilitys supply system 
the hardships have driven some away temporarily some 
permanently 
im staying with relatives but ill be back said daniel 
flanagan 80 whose apartment was undamaged right now ive got 
no hot water no gas 
psychologist lori rifkin is moving for good theres only one 
guy out of 16 people staying here she said as friends lugged 
boxes to her car 
her decision was influenced not only by the hardships but by 
fear pointing to buckled concrete and building cracks she said 
flatly im not staying here 
on the waterfront road in the neighborhood metal barricades 
continued to bar traffic from narrow streets uniformed guards 
allowed only people with proof of residence or official business to 
pass police cars cruised past frequently 
mayor art agnos has warned bus tour operators to stay out of the 
area people in this neighborhood have suffered tragedy they 
certainly should not be subjected to stares from curious onlookers 
or have their activities impeded by unnecessary bus traffic he 
said

a pedestrian suspension bridge 
crowded with young people who liked to make it swing back and forth 
collapsed so quickly that no one had a chance to cry for help 
a witness said 
thirty to 40 people twice as many as normal were standing on 
the 77yearold bridge saturday afternoon when the cables snapped 
and sent them tumbling into the little red river witnesses said 
three children and two adults were killed all members of a church 
group that had been meeting in a nearby town eighteen people were 
injured 
we used to swing the bridge ourselves when we were kids but 
we never swung it near as high as they were doing said jennifer 
johnson who lives near the bridge and saw the collapse 
authorities began work sunday trying to learn what caused the 
collapse of the historic 550foot singlelane bridge closed to 
vehicular traffic since 1972 
some area residents laid flowers at the foot of the bridge to 
commemorate the victims as crews used industrial cranes to remove 
cables and timbers from the river and to dismantle the bridges 
twisted iron supports 
residents said it was common for pedestrians to swing the 
bridge no signs warning against it or giving a load limit were 
posted 
bob burkeen owner of the swinging bridge resort a marina next 
to the bridge said there are usually no more than 10 to 15 people 
on the span at one time he said most of the crowd on the bridge 
saturday were young people 
an engineer had inspected the structure before it was dedicated 
as a national historic site in may 1986 and it had been inspected 
on three occasions since said cleburne county judge harvey adcock 
he said the inspections were conducted by county road employees 
not by professional engineers 
if we would have had any inkling that it wasnt safe we would 
have had it shut down adcock said 
cleburne county sheriff jerry holmes said state police had 
joined in the county in the investigation 
the water beneath the bridge varied from waistdeep at one end 
to 10 to 12 feet at the other heber springs police officer david 
smith who assisted in the rescue effort said the death toll could 
have been higher if the hydroelectric plant upstream at the greers 
ferry lake dam had been releasing water to generate electricity 
the water would have been much higher and the current much 
swifter we were lucky he said 
the wooddecked bridge supported by steel cables about 50 feet 
above the river was a popular tourist attraction and on the 
national register of historic places it sat in a popular rural 
recreational area near greers ferry lake 65 miles north of little 
rock 
weve been coming here for many years said john watkins of 
marble okla a member of a full holiness church group holding an 
annual meeting in nearby prim the bridge was the main highlight 
of our trip for the youth it wont be anymore 
the five people killed were attending the annual church meeting 
which attracted about 300 people from several states 
ms johnson said that as the bridge was swinging its upstream 
side appeared to buckle it just turned upside down and fell into 
the river 
she said people at each end of the bridge ran in an attempt to 
get off but they were just running in the air 
one girl said it felt like a dream until she hit the water 
said cindy watkins who came from oklahoma with her sister vicki 
for the church outing everybody was up there laughing and then 
all of a sudden it screeches and pops 
it just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry 
for help said daniel rafferty 19 of seymour mo 
i had just gotten here and they were rocking the bridge 
rafferty said we thought it was kind of fun and it scared some 
people we didnt realize how many people were on the bridge and 
that the capacity of the bridge was not enough 
when the bridge fell there were screams of terror arms 
were flailing people were panicking everyone was trying to save 
themselves said rafferty 
wayne milligan of the cleburne county sheriffs office said 
authorities were confident that no other victims would be found 
weve got everyone accounted for now we have all people that 
were here milligan said today were going to try to keep 
people away from the site its just mainly cleanup 
an estimated 100 to 150 people took part in the rescue effort 
after the collapse said county jailer travis moss 
the victims were identified as gayla carlton 34 of prim jason 
williams 16 of muldrow okla dana waltman 11 of vancleve 
miss david shane warren 13 of mayfield ky catrina cotrell

a computer virus has destroyed information at the 
university of tokyos seismological and ocean research institutes 
a university official and local reports said sunday 
an official of the universitys ocean research institute said 
the virus was detected earlier this month in four or five of the 
centers 100 computers but was believed to have first infected the 
computers in september 
the virus was found only in personal computers being used by 
researchers and not major computer systems the official said 
requesting anonymity he said the damage was not serious 
he declined to discuss further details but a report by the 
japan broadcasting corp said a virus also had been found in 
computers at the universitys earthquake research institute 
the report said the virus was the most sophisticated yet 
detected in japan where the problem is not widespread tokyo 
university is japans most prestigious university 
computer viruses created by unknown programmers are pieces of 
software that make copies of themselves and spread from one machine 
to another through infected floppy disks office networks or 
telephone access lines 
once activated the rogue program copies itself like a breeding 
germ eating away processing power and storage space or destroying 
information about 30 viruses are known to exist

parliament will discuss the date for 
presidential elections when it meets monday for the first time 
since hungary was formally declared a republic with democratic 
ideals 
at its last session which ended oct 20 the legislature 
adopted laws and constitutional amendments to create the framework 
for the first free multiparty elections in more than 40 years 
it also established the post of president to replace the 21man 
presidential council 
last monday the speaker of parliament matyas szueros became 
acting head of state when constitutional amendments went into 
effect until a president is elected he also formally declared the 
new republic in a symbolic rejection of four decades of communist 
dominance 
earlier this month the ruling communist party disbanded itself 
and established a socialist party that says it is committed to 
multiparty elections and democratic reforms 
hungary and poland the first country in the soviet bloc to 
have a government led by noncommunists are at the forefront of 
reform in eastern europe 
according to an agreement between the socialist party and most 
of the major opposition groups the president is to be elected in 
direct balloting before the end of the year the tentative election 
date is nov 26 
but the opposition league of free democrats and league of young 
democrats collected more than 200000 signatures on petitions 
calling for a referendum on whether the president should be elected 
before the parliamentary elections which are to be held next year 
they said a short campaign with balloting in november would give 
the socialist party candidate imre pozsgay an unfair advantage 
because he already is widely known they also said pozsgays 
election could give his party too much power before the 
parliamentary elections 
a minimum of 100000 signatures is needed to force a referendum 
under a recently adopted law parliament at its last session 
postponed discussion of the petition to allow the signatures to be 
verified 
andras kery head of the state office for population 
registration said 114470 signatures had been authenticated 
indicating the legislature should approve a referendum 
the league of free democrats ended a congress sunday and 
proposed that the opposition parties cooperate in campaigning 
against the socialists

two earthquakes about 15 minutes apart 
struck northern algeria sunday night killing at least 19 people 
and injuring about 100 the interior ministry reported 
most of the deaths were in the tipasa region 40 miles west of 
algiers and in the town of churchell on the mediterranean coast 60 
miles west of the capital the ministry said in a statement issued 
early monday 
it said prime minister mouloud hamrouche toured the hardesthit 
areas with his interior and health ministers 
the french government announced in paris that it was offering 
emergency aid to algeria a former french colony 
the national center of astronomy and geophysics said the 
earthquakes at 815 pm and 827 pm were estimated at 60 on 
the richter scale the first temblor lasted for 30 seconds and the 
second for about 15 seconds 
the center said the epicenters were about 35 miles south of 
algiers a city of 24 million people 
in algiers many people fled into the streets in panic when the 
temblors struck 
police said some buildings in the capitals crowded babeloued 
and casbah districts were damaged but there were no reports of 
casualties in the city 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 60 can cause severe damage in populated 
areas 
this region has a history of earthquakes including one on oct 
31 1988 which measured 54 on the richter scale and left 60 
people injured 
el asnam about 100 miles west of algiers was devastated by an 
earthquake on oct 10 1980 and an estimated 2500 were killed

a train carrying 60 protestants and 
catholics who were protesting the repeated ira bombing of the 
belfastdublin rail link arrived here 24 hours late sunday night 
because of a bomb scare 
the riders were among 1000 demonstrators who traveled 
northbound on peace trains from dublin to belfast on saturday 
similar peace trains ran south from belfast to dublin 
the peace mission was designed to bring attention to an irish 
republican army bombing and bomb hoax campaign that has halted the 
northsouth rail link more than 60 times this year the campaign 
has depressed business and is threatening the jobs of 500 railway 
workers 
a dublinbound peace train was delayed saturday night on its 
return journey when a male caller told the telephone exchange in 
dundalk near the border with northern ireland that a bomb had 
been placed on the track irish police said they could not 
investigate until daylight 
the 60 riders chose to spend the night in a train carriage at 
portadown 25 miles southwest of belfast and 87 miles north of 
dublin rather than return to the irish capital by bus they joined 
a regular train from belfast to complete the journey when irish 
police declared the track free of bombs sunday afternoon 
some 50 supporters including family and friends cheered and 
waved banners of welcome as the protesters stepped on to the 
platform at dublins connolly station 
we are delighted to stand here having completed our journey by 
rail despite the intimidation and disruption of ira bomb 
threats said john de courcy ireland chairman of the dublin 
protesters 
the success of the peace train in uniting so many people on 
both sides of the irish border has shown what can be achieved by 
setting aside our political religious and cultural differences 
he said 
we repeat our demand to the ira to stop the bombing so the 
line can be kept open he said 
the ira which is outlawed on both sides of the irish border is 
fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and unite the 
mainly protestant province with the overwhelmingly roman catholic 
irish republic 
the ira had promised to let saturdays peace trains pass 
peacefully but in a statement reported friday by press 
association britains domestic news agency the ira said it would 
resume occasional attacks when we see fit 
these attacks are not aimed at closing it down but to force 
british soldiers into painstaking and dangerous operations the 
ira statement said

cunningham 25 who was a high school freshman at the time of the 
accident our parents came and we made bus arrangements to get 
out 
residents of this susquehanna river town that sits astride the

melted contaminated coolant water escaped into a nearby building 
releasing radioactive gases 
thengov dick thornburgh advised women and young children 
within five miles of the plant to evacuate as many as 200000 
people within a 50mile radius may have fled 
the accident was contained but the questions it raised about the 
safety of nuclear energy effectively killed plans to build more 
plants in this country 
everyones life was turned upside down said gabe von 
dettre one of the shows producers 
he sat on the edge of a sink at the community center sipping 
coffee and looked across the gymnasium filled with red cross cots 
and tables covered with redchecked cloths 
nuclear energy youve got to live with it he said but 
of course its terribly terribly dangerous what we are trying to 
show is that its terribly dangerous but its needed to inform 
people about things they dont know anything about 
the accidents possible health effects continue to be debated 
with the operator general public utility corp contending that no 
serious harm resulted 
but sara smith said she lives in fear every day even though 
we never admit it 
mrs smith said she blames the deaths of her husband son and 
grandson on the accident her 8yearold grandson was diagnosed as 
having cancer in 1980 her husband in 1985 and her son in 1987 
there was no history of cancer in either of our families

halloween revelers outwitted and outmanned 
the authorities again this year with a maverick street party that 
jammed this college towns streets with about 8000 people and led 
to 154 arrests 
theres not much we can do said one police officer who 
refused to give his name its kind of hard for us to arrest 
8000 people 
the crowd jammed two or three downtown blocks saturday night for 
the 13th annual installment of a costume and rockmusic bash that 
city officials have been trying to squelch for years 
police made 154 arrests for violations including disorderly 
conduct driving while intoxicated underage consumption of liquor 
and underage possession of alcohol chief rick mayer said 
about five people remained in jail sunday police said 
the celebration began in 1977 as a party thrown for a few 
thousand students at ohio university and has ballooned over the 
years mayor sara hendricker said there is no official sponsor and 
partygoers bring their own refreshments or buy them from street 
vendors police said 
people began to invite friends friends began to invite 
friends and friends of friends began to invite friends she 
said the downtown area is too small to handle the huge crowds the 
party attracts she added 
officials have been trying for years to stop the party or cut it 
down to size particularly by dissuading outoftown guests from 
attending hendricker said 
this year the mayor placed advertisements in newspapers across 
the state warning that anyone parking illegally near the bash could 
have their cars ticketed or towed 
organizers got around that hurdle by offering free parking at 
the local county fairgrounds and running a shuttle bus to downtown 
said bruce mitchell editor and publisher of the athens news 
its a wonderful colorful creative time mitchell said

an opposition rally turned into a 
rockthrowing confrontation with sandinista supporters sunday and 
several people were injured 
it was the first time in the campaign for general elections set 
for feb 25 that such violence occurred 
its the same as in 1984 said opposition leader azucena 
ferrey referring to the other elections held while the leftist 
sandinistas have been in power 
about 1500 people gathered at a grasscovered field on high 
ground above this northern nicaraguan town near the border with 
honduras to hear a speech by violeta barrios de chamorro 
presidential candidate for the national opposition union 
uno as the 14party coalition is known in spanish is the main 
challenger to sandinista president daniel ortega 
as the crowd completed its march onto the field and mrs 
chamorro was starting to speak a group of four women and one man 
on the fringe of the gathering began waving a redandblack 
kerchief symbolic of the sandinista front 
the five began shouting in the faces of uno supporters one 
opposition sympathizer pulled out a machete but was persuaded by 
others to put it back in its sheath 
the sandinista supporters drew a group of about 20 uno backers 
away from the crowd and into a side street where more sandinista 
backers apparently were waiting after more shouting some 
sandinistas started throwing rocks and the uno supporters ran into 
the crowd on the field 
both sides then threw rocks at each other for about 10 minutes 
at least two election observers one of them from the 
organization of american states ran for cover when the rock 
throwing started the observers could be identified by tags they 
wore 
agence france press photographer peter northall was cut when 
struck on the neck by a rock several other people were hit by 
rocks and limped away 
police arrived 15 minutes after the melee started about six 
officers stood on the side of the field and watched 
the uno speakers started to descend from the wooden platform and 
on the other side of the field more rock throwing broke out 
a woman carrying a 2monthold boy was knocked to the ground in 
the fighting the baby was bruised and the woman who said she was 
his aunt was scratched and scraped her arms and legs were

leaders of christian and moslem factions in 
beirut both pledged to do what they can to win the freedom of 
western hostages rep mary rose oakar said sunday after returning 
from a trip to lebanon 
christian leader gen michel aoun whose forces control east 
beirut and acting prime minister salim hoss in moslem west beirut 
met separately with oakar dohio and rep nick rahall dwva on 
saturday 
oakar said she told both leaders that friday was the fifth 
birthday in captivity for americas longestheld hostage 
associated press chief middle east correspondent terry anderson 
i brought him up at both the meetings with the major leaders 
and they pledged to help she said 
hoss told the lawmakers the taking of 18 western hostages was 
a gross violation of human rights oakar said in an interview 
he said on a daily basis theyre trying to pave the way for their 
return 
one thing that they both said was that they feel terrible 
that people think hostagetaking is synonymous with the lebanese 
people they regret that the world opinion is such that people 
dont make a distinction she said 
oakar said her talks with the leaders convinced her there could 
be a way to win aouns support of an arab peace plan to end 
lebanons 14yearold civil war aoun has rejected the pact and 
convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet on sunday amid hints 
he may dissolve parliament to torpedo an arab peace plan 
but oakar said she believes a compromise could win aouns 
support it seems to me that in the finessing of compromise there 
could be some kind of gesture to aoun they could move the syrian 
troops largely out of the city and into the mountains for 
instance 
aoun rejected the plan because it fails to set a deadline for 
the pullout of 40000 syrian troops sent into the country in 1976 
oakar said the trip was intended to show the lebanese people 
they havent been forgotten by the united states which in 
september pulled its ambassador and 29 other diplomats out of the 
country 
the private diplomatic mission was not approved by the state 
department which blocked previous attempts by oakar and rahall to 
go to beirut 
oakar and rahall visited lebanon in 1982 at the height of the 
fighting between israeli syrian and lebanese troops to condemn the 
israeli invasion of lebanon oakar said she and rahall are the only 
two members of the house who are of lebanese descent

the socialist party claimed victory in 
sundays general elections saying it had retained its 
parliamentary majority by one seat 
with 100 percent of the vote counted government spokesman 
miguel gil said early monday the socialists had won 3955 percent 
of the vote for 176 seats in the 350seat cortes the lower house 
of parliament 
the results allotted the following percentage of votes and 
number of cortes seats for the other leading parties the 
conservative popular party 2583 percent 106 the catalan 
convergence and union 5 percent 18 the united left coalition 9 
percent 17 the democratic and social center 8 percent 14 the 
remaining 25 seats were divided among eight smaller parties 
prime minister felipe gonzalez told supporters in madrid the 
logical consequence of the outcome so far is that we will have to 
continue to assume the responsibility of governing 
his wife carmen was elected as a socialist deputy from the 
province of cadiz making her the first spouse of a european head 
of government to sit in parliament along with a spouse gonzalez 
was elected in madrid 
javier arzallus head of the conservative basque nationalist 
party said earlier his party would offer its votes to gonzalez to 
ensure his reelection as prime minister when parliament meets nov 
21 
despite their victory the socialists did suffer a setback they 
had won 184 seats in the lower house in 1986 elections down from 
their landslide of 202 seats in 1982 
the popular party gained one seat and the united left gained six 
initial projections had indicated the socialists would 
confortably win their third straight parliamentary majority but 
those were revised after the polls closed at 8 pm 2 pm est 
the private radio newsork ser said polls of voters who cast 
ballots in the final two hours indicated an increase in votes for 
centrist and rightist parties 
gil said about 70 percent of spains 295 million registered 
voters cast ballots with a heavy turnout in the final hours 
analysts attributed the drop in socialist support to discontent 
in the partys left wing with what is viewed as the probusiness 
position of gonzalezs government 
four parties and political coalitions ran candidates nationwide 
to elect 350 members to the cortes and 208 senators while a half 
dozen regional parties entered some races 
in the 208seat senate the socialists won 109 seats the 
popular party 74 the convergence and union 10 the united left 1 
and the democratic and social center 3 the remaining 11 seats went 
to the smaller parties 
no single issue dominated this years campaign 
gonzalez defended his governments seven years in power as a 
period of stability and economic progress but opposition forces 
blasted him for the countrys 16 percent unemployment rate 
europes highest and deteriorating public services 
the popular party under its new leader and prime ministerial 
candidate jose maria aznar remained the leading opposition party 
aznar took over the party two months before gonzalez called 
early elections sept 1 
the united left coalition which includes the communist party 
was expected to be the major recipient of votes from unions and 
workers who claim the government has failed to distribute equitably 
the new wealth created by a fouryear economic boom 
for the last three years spain has boasted a 45 percent annual 
growth rate europes highest 
gonzalez argued a socialist majority is necessary to assure a 
government strong enough to meet the challenges spain faces as the 
12nation european economic communisty advances toward the 1993 
integrated market 
the single market will increase competition by eliminating 
barriers among eec nations on the movement of capital labor goods 
and services

the florida horse industry sprinted from 
the gate at the beginning of the decade and was running along like 
a champion 
then the 7 billionayear enterprise stumbled on the 
backstretch and is now heading for the end of the 1980s trailing 
longreigning kentucky and with some newcomer states closing fast 
beyond the extravagant preparations in this miamiarea town for 
the nov 4 breeders cup races and its 10 million purse florida 
horse breeders and others are pondering whether the state can ever 
fulfill its goal of becoming the worlds thoroughbred center 
we have all the factors here to dominate everyone even 
kentucky said richard hancock executive vice president of the 
florida thoroughbred breeders association but we have to pull 
everyone together from the legislators to the track owners its 
been such a crazy decade were just about settling down now 
what happened in florida and in other horsebreeding states is 
a familiar refrain for the 1980s boom then bust 
the horse game had everything a highroller could want in the 
early 1980s a convenient tax shelter and entry into the glamour of 
the sport of kings demand for top horses nearly doubled 
auction prices to 50000 or more 
no doubt we were on a roll said hancock but you know 
what they say about all good things 
it came to an end in the mid1980s with new federal tax laws and 
the slump in the oil industry a principal source of the cash 
pumped into the horse industry 
the abrupt exodus of investors caused horse prices to drop 
lowered the purses at many tracks and sent the sport into a 
tailspin as the costs of maintaining and racing a thoroughbred 
exceeded 20000 a year 
were about now at a point where the prices of breeding a 
horse can be justified by the purses earned said douglas donn 
president of gulfstream park in hallandale host of the sixth 
annual breeders cup were entering a period of stabilization i 
believe 
but others fear the 35yearold florida horse industry may be 
heading for further problems 
dave goldman a horse industry analyst for the ocala breeders 
sales co said investors now appear to be looking for instant 
winners and losing interest in the longer and costly process of 
breeding which could lead to lowerquality horses in coming 
generations 
its just like building a baseball team said stanley 
ersoff a miami attorney and horse breeder you can have a great 
farm system and bring up quality players each year or you can go 
out and buy talent 
no matter now the industry fares the stakes are high 
the state breeders association reports nearly 29000 people are 
employed in the florida horse industry and the state has more than 
300000 race horses valued at 630 million in florida the horse 
industry trails only tourism and citrus crops in revenue invested 
said hancock 
and the group boasts that 20 percent of all us stakes races 
are won by floridabred horses although the state produces only 
91 percent of the thoroughbred foals 
kentucky however is still a long way from losing its 
reputation as the thoroughbred capital 
nearly a fifth of all the nations thoroughbred horses are bred 
in kentucky and the famous blue grass is still sought out by 
top trainers 
meanwhile other states are galloping ahead with incentive 
programs to lure thoroughbred breeding and related businesses 
between 1976 and 1986 the number of new yorkbred foals 
increased 321 percent and the crop in louisiana and illinois jumped 
more than 175 percent each according to the jockey club the 
national register of thoroughbreds 
other states really protect and cultivate their horse industry 
from the statehouse on down said harry mangurian jr former 
owner of the boston celtics basketball team and a top horse breeder 
in the ocala area in florida by and large we do not get the 
attention needed i wonder if the state recognizes how important 
this industry is 
the money is still in kentucky the top five or so horses are 
there said hank steinbrenner who runs an ocala horse farm along 
with his father new york yankees owner george steinbrenner iii 
with the breeders cup drawing national attention to florida an 
ongoing debate about offtrack betting in the state has 
intensified proponents say it would increase public interest in 
racing and raise the purses at the states five horse tracks 
but lawmakers have been slow to push the issue a strong 
antigambling bloc fought hard against the states 20monthold 
lottery also the owners of the states 18 dog tracks and 12 jai 
alai frontons have lobbied heavily against otb

the minnesota timberwolves are certain to be 
losers in their first nba season but that hasnt stopped team 
owners marv wolfenson and harvey ratner from forecasting champion 
profits 
not only has their franchise already doubled in value from the 
365 million they paid for it but the pairs entry into 
professional basketball coincides with negotiations for a new 
network television contract and a growing national appeal for the 
national basketball association 
timberwolves ticket and souvenir sales have been heavy the 
teams downtown arena is expected to open in time for the 199091 
season which could add 34 million a year to the clubs bottom 
line 
i think the franchise is going to be in the black the first 
year ratner said if it isnt ill be disappointed 
profits from the team arena and a health club inside the arena 
will total 378 million over 40 years beginning in 1995 according 
to projections filed at city hall the city relied on the forecast 
when it agreed to acquire a downtown site for the arena through 
condemnation proceedings a 15 million favor for the team 
the wolves in turn agreed to pay as taxes 9 percent of yearly 
aftertax profits from the team arena and arena health club for 40 
years starting in the clubs sixth year of operation 
the arenas estimated tax payments and the citys share of the 
profits are expected to cover the citys expenses in acquiring the 
land and providing municipal services 
more importantly for minneapolis the new arena is seen as 
helping revive a blighted downtown section by encouraging other 
real estate development and boosting foot traffic at nearby hotels 
shops and bars 
a study commissioned by the metropolitan council estimated the 
economic impact of the new franchise at 10 million a year in 
spending by outoftown visitors timberwolves fans and players 
who decide to relocate in the twin cities 
ratner and wolfenson business partners since 1952 have a 
combined net worth estimated at more than 100 million they rarely 
sell their holdings and the nba will be their only foray outside of 
apartment buildings and fitness centers 
i think this may be our best deal yet ratner said 
ratner and wolfenson paid 325 million for the franchise two 
years ago based on the 65 million just paid for the denver 
nuggets the club would be worth double that now 
the soaring value is tied to television cbs will pay 47 
million to broadcast this seasons games but the network is 
expected to part with up to 150 million a year to retain the 
contract its exclusive negotiating period ends oct 31 
at 150 million a year the timberwolves share would be about 
55 million local radio and television deals will add to the 
total 
the dollars reflect the nbas growing popularity attendance at 
nba games has jumped 415 percent over the past five years from an 
average of 10620 per game in the 198384 season to 15088 last 
season 
and with an abundance of marquee players on opposing teams the 
timberwolves hope fans will put up with home team mediocrity and 
fill the stands in the early years 
at the clubs home exhibition opener against the los angeles 
lakers for example the wolves drew a preseason nba record of 
35156 fans the team has sold 14600 season tickets for the 
18000seat arena that will open next season 
also brightening the financial picture for wolfenson and ratner 
is the leagues firstyear salary cap of 65 million for expansion 
teams 
but other sports executives in minnesota arent excited about 
having to share the sports entertainment dollars of the areas 2 
million residents with the new team with the timberwolves the 
area is one of only six us markets to simultaneously support 
major league football baseball basketball and hockey 
lawrence greenberg an accountant who has been a consultant to 
the timberwolves said ratner and wolfenson face considerable 
longterm risk in their nba venture 
since the minneapolis lakers moved to los angeles in 1960 two 
other professional basketball teams have failed in minnesota if 
the timberwolves are lousy when the novelty of a local nba team 
wears off greenberg said there could be nights when they muster 
only 3000 fans 
not only could the team lose money but the arena could become a 
huge liability if it doesnt attract enough concerts and other 
events greenberg said 
wolfenson and ratner have been stung already they invested 15 
million in midwest federal savings and loan at about the same time 
they borrowed 49 million to build the arena when the thrift was 
declared insolvent late last year the 15 million was lost and 
wolfenson and ratner have been unsuccessful in a lawsuit to recover 
it

northwest airlines has reached tentative 
settlements in nearly all of the lawsuits filed against it in the 
wake of the aug 16 1987 crash of flight 255 a newspaper 
reported sunday 
opening arguments in the combined trial of negligence lawsuits 
against northwest and mcdonnell douglas corp manufacturer of the 
md80 jet that crashed on takeoff from detroit metropolitan 
airport still are scheduled to begin tuesday in us district 
court in detroit 
but the arizona republic in phoenix citing a statement issued 
saturday by us district judge julian cook jr said northwest has 
settled or reached tentative settlements in most of the 157 suits 
originally filed against the airline 
northwest based in eagan minn reached settlements prior to 
saturday with families of more than 50 crash victims the newspaper 
said cooks statement did not disclose details of approximately 
100 other suits in which settlements also were reached 
cook said the few remaining claims against northwest either have 
been deferred or removed from the upcoming trial the republic 
said the trial instead will focus on lawsuits against mcdonnell 
douglas and on crossclaims and complaints between northwest and 
mcdonnell douglas the newspaper said 
flight 255 was bound for phoenix when it crashed 14 seconds 
after takeoff from metropolitan airport killing 154 of 155 people 
aboard the plane and two on the ground 
mary rowland a law clerk in cooks office said sunday that she 
did not know about the judges statement cited by the republic 
cook did not immediately return telephone messages left by the 
associated press 
parties to the case said sunday they could not comment on the 
report because of a gag order cook issued several weeks ago 
the national transportation safety board ruled in june 1988 that 
flight 255s pilots failed to properly set the planes wing flaps 
and slats for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight 
checks that would have detected the error 
also contributing to the crash was the failure of a cockpit 
warning system to alert the pilots that the flaps and slats were 
not set for takeoff the ntsb said 
the person aboard flight 255 to survive was cecelia cichan then 
4 of tempe ariz she now lives with relatives in a suburb of 
birmingham ala

california billionaire marvin davis is wooing 
united airlines labor unions as he considers another takeover bid 
for ual corp uniteds parent company according to a newspaper 
report 
davis adviser david batchelder has discussed an offer with 
representatives of uniteds pilots machinists and flight 
attendants the los angeles times reported saturday 
if employees are receptive to a new offer davis is expected to 
have a proposal ready by late this week the times reported 
batchelder declined to comment on the report 
davis unsuccessfully bid 240 a share for the chicagobased 
airline in august since then ual has been the object of takeover 
fever 
in the most recent offer an employeemanagement group led by 
ual chairman stephen m wolf unsuccessfully bid 300 per share or 
675 billion but that bid fell apart when the group failed to 
obtain financing since then the price of ual stock has dropped 
sharply closing at 171 friday 
citing unidentified sources the times reported that davis will 
not bid again without the support of the unions opposition from 
the machinists union helped influence banks not to finance the 
employeemanagement bid 
davis has indicated he is willing to offer employees a small 
ownership stake in ual but he faces difficulty with the 
machinists who oppose a debtfinanced takeover saying such a 
transaction would put uals financial health at risk 
an agreement with the company bars davis from bidding less than 
300 per share or attempting to remove members of uals board but 
the los angeles businessman is not expected to bid that high 
because of the drop in uals share price
