financially strapped farm aid returned 
saturday with its first concert in 2 years performers sounded a 
message of concern not only for the family farmer but also for the 
land they till 
the concert crammed with more than 60 acts lasted nearly 14 
hours finishing after midnight it concluded with an allstar 
chorus singing this land is your land led by arlo guthrie son 
of the songs composer woody guthrie 
farm aid president willie nelson topped the list of performers 
who said they were forging a coalition with family farmers 
environmentalists and consumers to work toward reducing the amount 
of chemicals used in food production 
somewhere between a lot of chemicals and no chemicals theres 
a happy medium nelson said at a news conference before 
performing the first song of the 12hour show in the hoosier dome 
as experts the farmers will have to tell you how much do they 
need and how much are they forced to use nelson said i 
think thats the difference if they can get enough money for a 
bushel of corn they dont have to drain that acre for every ounce 
thats in it 
inside the arena early arrivals among the sellout crowd of 
45000 settled in with blankets and pillows for the marathon event 
many of the more popular performers including neil young bonnie 
raitt and don henley didnt perform until the final two hours 
elton john made an unexpected appearance late in the program and 
performed three songs the british rock singerpianist had been in 
indianapolis to visit critically ill teenage aids victim ryan 
white a close friend 
this ones for ryan john said before beginning candle in 
the wind a song he wrote about the tragic life of marilyn 
monroe afterward the crowd delivered its biggest ovation of the 
show 
johns set provided a somber note during a day of activism on 
behalf of family farmers and the environment 
the rev jesse jackson said the family farm crisis is expanding 
since 1980 weve lost about 75000 farms largely because farmers 
couldnt earn enough from their crops to pay their bills he said 
jackson criticized reports from secretary of agriculture clayton 
yeutter citing farm income at record levels a point some farm aid 
critics have raised as evidence this concert was unnecessary 
what yeutter doesnt say is that when the numbers are 
adjusted for inflation farm income in the last decade was at its 
lowest since 1910 he said 
singer henry lee summer from brazil ind used the stage to 
speak out against outofstate trash being dumped in indiana 
ive got a message to all those big businesses that want to 
dump all their trash and toxic waste here we dont deserve it 
summer said drawing a big cheer 
concertgoers said they were there not only to enjoy the music 
but also to support the family farmer the cause that inspired the 
formation of farm aid five years ago the organization through its 
first three shows in 198587 raised 12 million and has 
distributed some 9 million to churches and service agencies 
hotlines and farm organizations 
carolyn mugar executive director of farm aid said late in the 
evening that the show had generated well over 1 million in 
revenues and donations she and nelson have left open the 
possibility of more concerts as the need for money arises 
mugar said farm aid iv was arranged because the organization has 
run out of money it was staged two weeks before the nation 
observes the 20th anniversary of earth day in part as a way of 
stressing that the farm and environmental causes are intertwined 
when we restore the honor and sanctity of the family farmer 
in conjunction with earth day which is not just lip service and 
not just one event we restore the sanctity and honor of mother 
earth herself raitt said 
environmental activists including chris desser executive 
director of earth day 1990 and john oconnor executive director 
of the national toxics campaign also spoke out against brute 
chemical farming 
oconnor said a third of the nations farm crop is still lost to 
insects and other pests just as it was before world war ii 
despite a tenfold increase in chemical use 
the lineup at the hoosier dome also included dwight yoakum kt 
oslin lou reed guns n roses richard marx jackson browne john 
denver and a soviet rock band gorky park 
huge black and white cutouts of farm workers with cows and farm 
implements were the stage backdrop hanging on the left and right 
sides of the stage were huge flags with the farm aid logo of a 
tractor with an american flag 
farm aids first concert in september 1985 was in champaign 
ill subsequent concerts were held in 1986 in austin texas and in 
1987 in lincoln neb

hungarians voted sunday in a runoff 
election for the nations first freely elected multiparty 
legislature since 1947 and former communists were widely expected 
to serve only in the opposition 
no party was thought likely to win an outright majority in the 
polling which began at 6 am in most areas preliminary results 
were not expected before midnight six hours after the polls closed 
the first round of balloting almost two weeks ago left 261 of 
the 394 seats undecided in the national assembly 
but it gave two anticommunist parties a firm lead and relegated 
reform communists now running as the socialist party to fourth 
place with 10 percent of the vote 
the two frontrunners the conservative hungarian democratic 
forum and the liberalleftist league of free democrats have said 
they will not accept the socialists as coalition partners many 
still associate the socialist party with the hardline communists 
who ruled hungary for 43 years 
the two leading parties have been reluctant to comment publicly 
on the prospects of a coalition but the free democrats have said 
they would not rule out a joint government with the democratic 
forum 
a broad coalition is considered by many as the only government 
stable enough to make the hard decisions necessary to correct a 
stagnant economy while reining in a 20 billion national debt 
but a coalition with a consensus on economic policy could be 
difficult to forge since the leading parties have different views 
on the pacing and scope of economic reforms 
twentynine parties fielded candidates in the first round but 
only six reached the 4 percent minimum required for a seat in 
parliament 
candidates in the march 25 elections disputed 176 seats in 
direct balloting in electoral districts 
a clear winner emerged in only five of those districts they 
included socialist premier miklos nemeth a reformer who enjoys 
considerable popularity in the country 
an additional 210 seats were contested on the basis of the 
proportion of the vote parties received in the voting another 
eight seats are reserved for national minorities 
after the first round 120 seats were assigned on the basis of 
proportional voting the remaining 90 seats will be assigned on a 
proportional basis following sundays voting

greeks cast ballots in their third 
parliamentary election in ten months sunday amid projections that 
no party would win the outright majority needed to govern 
in athens long queues formed outside many polling stations when 
they opened at 701 am polls were scheduled to close at sunset 
or 754 pm 
more than 8 million voters chose among candidates from 27 
parties two coalitions and 16 independent groupings that stretched 
across the political spectrum voting is mandatory for greeks 
between 18 and 70 years of age 
only three parties were considered likely to attract significant 
numbers of voters the conservative new democracy the panhellenic 
socialist movement pasok and the communistled coalition of the 
left and progress 
but sundays election like those last june and november could 
end without a clear winner and again leave greece with a weak 
coalition unable to cope with a foundering economy and a resurgence 
of terrorism 
the outcome may also have bearing on the countrys four us 
military bases which could close in november unless a new 
agreement is reached with washington 
election officials said first results would be in hand two hours 
after the polls closed and definitive results by early tuesday 
in the two previous elections new democracy defeated pasok led 
by former premier andreas papandreou but fell short of winning an 
absolute majority in the 300member single house parliament 
opinion polls indicated new democracy led by 71yearold 
constantine mitsotakis was also the frontrunner in sundays voting 
but could again fail to achieve the necessary majority to govern 
alone 
such a result could lead to difficult negotiations between the 
three top parties over a ruling coalition and possibly another 
round of elections 
papandreou 71 has said he will attempt a progressive 
alliance with the communistled coalition to govern for the next 
four years 
last june new democracy teamed with the coalition its 
ideological opponents to govern from july to october the 
government was formed under the limited mandate of investigating 
corruption charges against papandreou and five of his ministers 
the parliament indicted papandreou on charges of ordering 
telephone tapping of political opponents and involvement in a 210 
million bank of crete embezzlement scandal the corruption charges 
helped bring down papandreous government but the charismatic 
leader continues to be a political force 
papandreou has denied the charges no date has been set for his 
trial 
in the november elections new democracy won 4619 percent of 
the vote for 148 seats pasok 4067 percent for 128 places and the 
coalition 1097 percent for 21 seats

members of the new multiparty parliament

close 12 hours later preliminary results are expected early monday 
and official results are due tuesday 
electoral laws require a runoff on april 22 between the top two 
votegetters if no presidential candidate receives more than 50 
percent

party which recently renamed itself the party for democratic 
renewal was ahead in the oppinion polls for the presidency 
his toughest opponent for the top post was former dissident joze

parties 
preelections polls gave little chance to the other two 
presidential candidates 
pucnik a professor of philosophy spent seven years in 
slovenian prisons during the 1950s for his opposition to communism 
he was forced to emigrate to west germany from where he returned 
only last year after spending more than 20 years in exile 
slovenians are increasingly showing a desire to secede from 
yugoslavia because they are unhappy with the slow pace of 
democratic and other reforms in the rest of the country 
slovenias reformminded communists have moved quickly over the 
past three years to create a pluralistic system in the republic 
the reforms in slovenia have been implemented despite harsh 
criticism from serbia the largest yugoslav republic where 
communist leaders demand continued communist party dominance 
croatia the second largest republic is also scheduled to stage 
free parliamentary elections later in april 
despite allowing the formation of oposition parties communists 
in other four republics including serbia have not yet announced 
free elections

the drop in working people continued a yearlong slump in the 
labor market caused by government austerity measures that have 
curbed inflation but brought economic growth to a standstill

million from the end of 1989

businessman 
he is back in lithuania arranging for experts to help reform 
the economy and working with premier kazimieras prunskiene to set 
up a system that would entice western investment 
the kremlin which has used troops to take over lithuanias 
prosecutors office and has waged a war of nerves to keep the 
republic in its fold is standing in the way of some reform and 
could stifle other moves to revamp the republics economy 
mrs prunskiene has said soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov and 
his cabinet refused to transfer most authority from moscow to 
vilnius 
for example prunskiene suggested that the majority of the 
200plus factories now run by ministries in moscow be turned over 
to lithuanian control ryzhkov and his ministers are willing to 
hand over only a few dozen 
lithuanian officials aim for their nation of 38 million people 
about the size and population of ireland to develop a thriving 
economy based on selling meat milk and consumer goods to the 
soviet union and shipping its imports and exports 
but moscow built many of lithuanias factories according to no 
economic logic far from raw materials and customers they 
manufacture goods so outmoded that only desperate soviet consumers 
would buy them 
there has been no change in economic ties since the baltic 
republic voted to secede relations with the soviet union are 
critical for lithuania which gets all its oil and gas from siberia 
at low rates moscow needs lithuania whose factories produce parts 
for soviet plants 
a lithuanian parliamentary commission on independence said the 
republic has plenty of electric power including a nuclear plant at 
ignalina that can provide virtually all its needs 
but supplies of oil gas important raw materials repair parts 
fertilizer and communications could be cut off the commission said 
the hands are on the faucets but they havent been turned 
said lawrence summers a harvard university economics professor and 
one of the experts kazickas has helped to bring over as an adviser 
on economic reform 
lithuania and its sister baltic states latvia and estonia have 
drawn up complete economic reform plans their people generally 
appear willing to accept higher prices and unemployment as part of 
the parcel 
all three baltic republics were part of the russian empire from 
the late 18th century until after world war i they were 
independent between the wars but forcibly annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 after moscow took control of the republics under 
terms of the secret hitlerstalin pact 
independence in lithuania latvia and estonia coincided with 
some of the soviet unions most ruinous years in the 1920s and 
1930s 
the baltic republics roads buildings and communications 
generally are in far better repair than those of the soviet union 
evidence of greater efficiency and their period of independence 
there are three freeways in lithuania in other soviet republics 
many villages have no road at all 
but virtually all communications go through soviet territory so 
the lithuanians have begun negotiations with poland for a new 
direct connection to the west 
among proposed economic reforms summers has recommended 
allowing prices to rise on nonessential items to encourage 
manufacture of goods in extremely short supply and soak up excess 
soviet rubles 
he said lithuania should introduce its own currency in 1991 
freely convertible at a low exchange rate 
summers said low currency exchange rates could make labor costs 
in the new lithuania attractive to nearby highwage scandanavia 
but for now lithuania remains inefficient 
many soviets scoff at the aspirations for independence in the 
baltics contending the tiny republics could not survive on their 
own balts invite skeptics to look at finland 
fifty years ago finland and the baltics had similar economies 
and incomes finlands climate is harsher and it has few natural 
resources yet it fought a war to remain independent of the soviets 
and has developed a thriving economy 
today finlands per capita income is more than quadruple that 
of the soviet union 
lithuanian economist valdas terleckas said his country had a 10 
percent annual growth rate in its 22 years as an independent 
capitalist nation that is higher than most countries in the world 
today 
in response to such statistics the soviet press has cited 
diplomatic dispatches from the baltic republics during independence 
that spoke of economic decay and widespread unemployment 
the republics new government has moved to stop strangling 
business by cutting the number of ministries from an 
alreadyreduced 40 to 18 the soviet bureaucracy blamed for 
stalling gorbachevs reforms still has 48 ministries and 28 
commissions 
independence will force the vilnius electrical measuring device 
factory to redesign its product line primarily household electric 
meters so it can produce goods efficiently and compete outside the 
soviet union cuba and africa said plant director vincas babilius 
he is thrilled with the prospect because i want to be a free 
man i want to deal with whomever i want to set my own prices and 
decide what to do with my own profits 
violinist rimas cekuolis expressed what most lithuanians seemed 
to feel its not important whether our life is better or worse 
freedom is what is important

house and senate budget committees are moving 
toward adoption of fiscal 1991 deficitreduction plans that ignore 
eyecatching proposals by two of congresss most influential 
members 
the democratic chairmen of the two panels which are well behind 
schedule hope to produce separate 12trillion spending 
blueprints for next year by late this month but neither will 
reflect sen daniel patrick moynihans plan to cut the social 
security payroll tax or rep dan rostenkowskis call for a 
combination of widespread spending cuts and tax hikes 
instead house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
and his senate counterpart james sasser dtenn are prodding 
their democratdominated committees to compose similar packages 
that rely on more traditional formulas 
plans considered likely to emerge from each budget panel would 
shrink the deficit by 37 billion relying on roughly equal amounts 
of defense cuts and new taxes and lesser savings from cuts in 
medicare payments to farmers and other domestic programs 
ill be able to get a budget resolution out of committee 
panetta said last week after two weeks of closeddoor meetings with 
panel members it will take a lot of work on the house floor 
but we will pass it there too 
the decisions to snub moynihan dny and rostenkowski 
dill reflect different judgments 
congressional leaders believe rostenkowskis proposal to save 
55 billion next year by freezing social security and other 
domestic programs and by raising income taxes and other levies is 
medicine that is simply too harsh for most lawmakers 
there are no votes there panetta said of the plan advanced 
by the chairman of the taxwriting ways and means committee 
rostenkowski would have much greater impact if there were votes 
there to support it 
moynihans proposal is aimed at driving down the social security 
surplus which the senator considered congresss expert on the 
retirement system complains makes the overall budget deficit look 
smaller 
but his proposal to slash the payroll tax would shrink federal 
revenues by 55 billion a cut that members of moynihans own party 
complain would make next years anticipated 101 billion federal 
shortfall even larger the grammrudman act sets a deficit target 
of 64 billion for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
were going to have enough difficulty meeting the budget 
targets without coming up at this juncture with a revenue loser 
sasser said 
for their parts moynihan and rostenkowski insist that their 
proposals are still alive moynihan said last week that he expects 
a senate vote on his plan in may and that he expects to win 
rostenkowski said he believes his proposal stands as good a chance 
as anything panetta can piece together 
panettas and sassers committees will begin writing their 
budget plans in earnest when congress returns from its easter 
recess next week 
so far panetta is considering a plan that would hold defense 
spending to about 295 billion 115 billion below the amount 
needed to keep up with inflation and 8 billion less than 
president bush wants he would raise 14 billion in new minor 
taxes the same amount as bush he also would cut medicare and 
other federal benefit programs by 35 billion while boosting 
housing childrens and other social programs by about 6 billion 
sasser wants his committee to compress military spending to 
about 292 billion he also would collect 14 billion in new taxes 
while seeking savings in some domestic programs 
republicans from both panels say they will oppose the democratic 
packages senate gop budgetwriters say they may offer their own 
proposals while house republicans say they will support the budget 
bush proposed in january 
hes our big brother and hes going to do the fistfighting 
for us rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the 
house budget panel said of bush 
by law congress is supposed to finish the budget by april 15 a 
deadline that is routinely ignored the compromise housesenate 
plan that congress finally adopts sets guidelines that must be 
followed by separate tax and spending bills which will be written 
later in the year

as one editorial summed it up the conservatives 
blamed the labor party which blamed the militant left which 
blamed the anarchists who accepted the charge with pride 
the comment in the leftwing weekly new statesman and society 
was one of many attempting to explain rioting that tore through the 
heart of london a week ago the violence came the day before local 
property taxes were replaced with a percapita community charge 
a community charge means running full pelt down a street 
with a brick in your hand and a pig in your sights said the 
newspaper class war published by an anarchist group with the same 
name 
was it organized or spontaneous should police share the blame 
did it expose an underclass that has grown up feeling left out of 
the propertyowning democracy prime minister margaret thatcher 
dreams of creating 
the occasion was a march 31 march by 40000 people protesting 
the new tax police say about 3000 attacked officers smashed shop 
windows looted and started fires they said 374 officers and 86 
civilians were injured and 339 arrests were made 
trouble apparently started when mounted police moved a small 
group of unruly demonstrators away from downing street where mrs 
thatcher lives into trafalgar square peaceful protesters in the 
square thought police were attacking the crowd witnesses said 
peter taaffe general secretary of militant tendency a radical 
leftwing movement said the police action infuriated the crowd 
including some militant supporters who oppose violence it ignited 
an explosion 
many of these young people are very angry they are 
unemployed harassed and have an accumulated hatred of the 
police he said 
all that fury came to the fore and they began attacking any 
symbol of society that included the police and the obscene 
display of wealth in the west end which is cheek by jowl with 
desolate poverty 
dr jock young a sociologist at middlesex polytechnic said 
animosity must have been widespread for the anarchist groups to 
have had an effect 
the young people are living in a very affluent society he 
said it is the relative deprivation which creates the 
disaffected and starts to create cultures of violence particularly 
among young men 
football is one expression of this it provides a vehicle for 
young machismo blokes to get together in large numbers and let off 
a lot of steam phil kelly editor of the leftwing weekly 
tribune said anarchism attracts the alienated 
their whole contact with authority is unpleasant kelly 
said they are living in illegal squats or derelict buildings 
the only contact they have with the police is when they get stopped 
because of the way they look 
rioters faced the wrath of the entire political establishment 
the labor party condemned them as vociferously as mrs thatchers 
conservatives 
labor was to blame the tories said because a minority of its 
members of parliament advocates breaking the law by refusing to pay 
the socalled poll tax 
many of those brought before magistrates were age 17 to 30 and 
gave their addresses as squatter apartments or buildings others 
were what are still known in britain as hippies living nomadic 
lives in the backs of vans 
violence breaks out in all sorts of contexts in britain 
anarchists make periodic charges through the city londons 
financial district smashing bank windows and other symbols of 
capitalism 
droves of hippies converge on stonehenge in june to celebrate 
the summer solstice and battle police who try to keep them from 
the protected national monument 
animal rights campaigners disrupt foxhunts 
englands soccer hooligans who caused 39 deaths in a rampage at 
a brussels stadium in 1985 are feared continentwide 
every generation has had its disruptive element and our 
disruptive element is probably the anarchists said sociologist 
norman jones the glorious days when there was no violence is a 
misconceived idea 
dr db oleary at the london school of economics said it is 
wrong to assume britain was on the verge of rampant anarchism 
you have to look at the interaction of a very hot day 
incompetent policing and the fact that many people wanted a scrap 
if the occasion was offered to them and it was he said 
young of middlesex polytechnic considers britain still a 
relatively nonviolent country not much different from other parts 
of europe and with onetenth the us murder rate 
but some language heard and read since the riot has been violent 
new statesman and society carried an article by a 25yearold 
londoner identified only as tony who said he threw rocks at police 
during the riot 
tony wrote the police wont come to terms with the fact that 
theyre distrusted and hated it wasnt even about the poll tax 
that was just the occasion for it it was a young peoples riot a 
spontaneous outburst by people from all over the country thats 
what made it so great i did what i did because i could 
the police were attacked and quite rightly so said andy 
murphy a 28yearold anarchist who works for the london borough of 
hackney

ten americans returned to a vietnamese 
beach where us forces landed 25 years ago and laid the 
foundation for a peace village to assist victims of the vietnam 
war a participant said sunday 
gordon smith a vietnam war veteran said he and nine other 
americans laid the cornerstones for the village on china beach 
plans call for a rehabilitation center orphanage a medical center 
and trade school 
the groundbreaking ceremony also attended by vietnamese red 
cross officials took place march 26 
on march 8 1965 more than 3500 marines stormed onto the beach 
near the central vietnam city of danang in a major escalation of 
the war 
the project is led by le ly hayslip who initially collaborated 
with the communist viet cong as a teenager after a series of 
harrowing wartime experiences she married an american and came to 
the united states 
her autobiography when heaven and earth changed places was 
published in the united states last year 
ms hayslips east meets west foundation has in recent years 
provided medical assistance to vietnam through private funding 
including contributions from oliver stone the vietnam veteran who 
has directed two major films on vietnam platoon and born on 
the fourth of july 
ms hayslip who lives in escondido calif was born in a small 
village near danang 
smith of monterey calif said additional fund raising in the 
united states would be necessary before construction of the village 
could begin 
the center would help the handicapped who fought on both sides 
in the war victims of land mines that continue to take their toll 
on civilians and people suffering from ailments unrelated to the 
war he said 
the china beach project is one of a growing number of private 
american efforts to heal the wounds of the vietnam war these have 
frequently been initiated by war veterans 
the united states does not recognize the hanoi government and 
forbids commerce with vietnam american aid organizations must 
obtain permits from washington and operate under certain financial 
restrictions in vietnam 
smith was involved in the building of a medical clinic by war 
veterans in the southern seaside town of vung tau the clinic 
opened march 30 1989 and receives medical supplies obtained by 
veterans in the united states 
smith who is involved in hayslips group and a number of 
veterans organizations said he hoped to start a program to send 
american nurses who served in the war to the clinic and vung tau 
hospital

americans often are blamed for having lost the 
old yankee love of thrift but the international monetary fund has 
found that people in some other developed countries are saving even 
less 
it predicted the trend will continue as the worlds population 
ages older people have less to save for 
the negative trend in national saving rates experienced by all 
the major industrial countries since the early to mid1970s has 
raised serious concerns about the prospects for strong and 
sustainable growth in the world economy said the latest issue of 
the semiweekly imf survey 
the scolding is based on a report by a team under bijan b 
aghelvi senior advisor in the funds research department at its 
headquarters in washington 
when people put money into their bank accounts the banks lend 
it out to industry for building the factories that will produce 
more goods and jobs in the future if savings are too small 
industry has to borrow from other countries 
governments also save or more often dissave by going 
further into debt when a government spends more than it collects 
in taxes it has to borrow from the savings of its citizens or from 
other countries its taxpayers then have to pay interest on the 
debt 
the united states is a prime example on both counts americans 
of the future will have to pay interest to other countries on the 
billions being borrowed by americans today 
according to the most recent figures from the organization for 
economic cooperation and development oecd in paris the average 
american household in 1988 saved only 440 out of every 100 of 
aftertax income 
but americans were far from being the biggest spendthrifts the 
average swedish household did not save at all it drew on past 
savings or went into debt at the rate of 360 dollars for every 
100 dollars earned 
the average norwegian family had dissavings of 120 per 
100 of income and families in finland spent an average 10140 for 
every 100 earned 
of the major industrial countries the japanese were the top 
savers 1520 dollars out of 100 of income but even the thrifty 
japanese have loosened up in 1976 they saved 2320 of every 
100 earned 
the average west german family in 1988 saved 1260 of every 
100 earned down from 1510 in 1975 dutch families in 1988 saved 
only 2 of every 100 of income 
another imfsponsored study warns that a countrys capital will 
be consumed unless money is set aside to replace it and more must 
be put aside as the population grows 
high rates of saving in the federal republic of germany and 
japan in particular have contributed to rapid rises in the 
standard of living wrote roger s smith who teaches economics 
at the university of alberta in canada 
south korea singapore and taiwan are clear current 
examples that high saving rates go hand in hand with rapid economic 
growth 
smith wrote that government deficits have reduced savings in a 
number of countries 
belgium canada italy and the united states may be the most 
obvious examples but australia the netherlands sweden and the 
united kingdom also have had significant public sector deficits 
during the 1980s he said

after months of delay the united states has 
decided in principle to sell a supercomputer to india sources say 
despite warnings that it could be used to make nuclear weapons or 
ballistic missiles 
but granting an export license for the sophisticated cray 
computer depends on indias willingness to adopt measures 
restricting its use to peaceful research and preventing the 
transfer of its data to unauthorized parties said one source 
the sources discussing the prospective deal on condition of 
anonymity said indian was balking at the conditions noting that a 
supercomputer bought in 1987 was being used only to forecast 
monsoons 
indian officials also are pointing out that the country signed a 
1984 agreement promising not to transfer hightech equipment to 
other nations the sources added 
the decision to approve the sale in principle reflects the us 
governments ambivalence about exporting stateoftheart computers 
to countries with nuclear capabilities 
decisions about the sale of similar computers to israel and 
brazil have been stalled for as long as two years with the 
department of energy and the arms control and disarmament agency 
lobbying against the deals said one source 
the cray computer is destined for the institute of science of 
bangalore india which conducts biotechnological and other 
research said indian officials gary milhollin director of the 
wisconsin project on nuclear arms control said the institute also 
studies stress on rocket bodies 
milhollin whose organization tracks the spread of nuclear 
weapons to developing countries said india could apply the 
supercomputer data to missile development 
the commerce department which takes the lead in granting or 
denying export licenses refused to comment but last week the 
department announced it had fined a west german company 800000 
for exporting nuclear material to india and several other countries 
in general the bush administration is easing controls over the 
export of supercomputers partly because of growing pressure from 
manufacturers stung by government budget cuts and partly because of 
a relaxation in technology exports to formerly communist 
governments 
the commerce department is pruning and streamlining the lists of 
hightech items banned for export to eastern europe and nato has 
been pressing the united states to speed up the process 
in addition the commerce department is redefining which 
supercomputers must receive special export licenses requiring a 
safeguard plan under the proposed definition countries buying 
supercomputers with a capability of up to 150 megaflops a measure 
of computing speed would not be required to adopt a safeguards 
plan the previous limit was 100 megaflops 
proponents of the sales argue that countries determined to 
produce nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles can do so without 
supercomputers especially since the new generation of desktop 
computers are so powerful they can compute as fast they note that 
supercomputers are put to many beneficial uses including weather 
predictions seismic analysis and medical and scientific research 
opponents argue that the fastcomputing machines make it much 
easier to design weapons especially because of their ability to 
simulate and analyze the effects of nuclear explosions and missile 
flights 
they also note that brazil india and israel have not signed the 
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty although all have 
nuclear capabilities or are near having them that means their 
nuclear facilities are not inspected by outsiders 
pressure from the industry is fierce especially in the face of 
sharp competition from japan the only other country that makes 
such machines us exports of supercomputers were valued at 400 
million in 1989 and are projected to double this year japans 1990 
exports are expected to reach 2 billion

more than 100 countries begin an antidrug 
conference monday that focuses on education and other measures 
aimed at cutting demand especially for cocaine which has begun to 
hit europe hard officials say 
we know in the end as long as demand is there there will 
always be somebody to get the supply through said home office 
minister david mellor one of britains top law enforcement 
officials 
prime minister margaret thatcher president virgilio barco 
vargas of colombia and un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar will address the opening of the world ministerial drugs 
summit at the queen elizabeth ii conference center opposite 
westminster abbey 
mellor called barco as a courageous representative of a drug 
nation struggling against drug traffickers who have killed more 
than 200 people in their 7monthold war with the colombian 
government 
britain has invited all members of the united nations and all 
nonmember observer states to the threeday conference lynda 
chalker minister of overseas development said her government is 
paying the expenses of delegations from some developing countries 
the conference organized by the british government in 
association with the united nations follows up the international 
conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking held in vienna in 
june 1987 
that conference agreed for the first time on an overall approach 
focusing on prevention treatment rehabilitation and reducing 
supplies 
this weeks summit will consider education programs to prevent 
drug use identification of drug misusers and early intervention to 
prevent misuse and emerging issues in the development of demand 
reduction policies including aids 
organizers decided to single out cocaine mellor said because 
cocaine has suddenly come from nowhere to be the principle drug 
of misuse not only here but elsewhere in the world 
the american experience shows that we underestimate cocaine at 
our peril especially when mixed with smoking as crack he said 
while cocaine has been confined mainly to the western 
hemisphere organizers said they decided to include it in the 
conference because there was strong evidence that the cocaine 
cartels are looking for new markets in europe and other regions 
in the past three years the amount of cocaine seized in the 12 
european economic community states has tripled to more than five 
tons last year 
in 1988 british authorities for the first time seized more 
cocaine than heroin 
the conference will examine the entire cycle from cultivation of 
the coca bush to the disposal of the proceeds of street sales of 
cocaine and crack 
mellor said britains concern was that there should be a

as the hubble space telescope awaits a ride 
into space scientists remain jittery about the many things that 
could go wrong with nasas costliest satellite from a fogged 
mirror to space junk 
its hitting us in our guts said ed weiler hubble program 
scientist at the agencys washington headquarters were all 
having dreams about this thing were reliving meetings on what 
could go wrong and were wondering did we make a mistake 
somewhere 
getting the 15 billion telescope ready to be placed in orbit 
by the shuttle discovery this week after seven years of delay 
has been one big pain in the rear but its going to be worth 
every minute every one of us spent on it he said 
because the unmanned telescope will peer farther into space than 
any other observatory we know we are going to discover things 
that are totally unexpected that our human imaginations cant even 
envision 
potential woes facing hubble include equipment failures 
contamination of its sensitive mirror and light detectors 
dependence for repairs on an overburdened shuttle fleet and 
sunspot activity that might drag the telescope from its proper 
orbit 
we have plenty of concerns and plenty of areas we know need 
improvement but we have no showstoppers said david r skillman 
a chief telescope engineer at goddard space flight center in 
maryland i fully expect this thing will be operating for 20 or 
30 years well beyond the planned 15year mission 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans to put 
hubble in orbit 380 miles above the earth higher than any shuttle 
has flown discovery is scheduled for launch tuesday 
but if one of discoverys three engines doesnt produce full 
power or fails completely after launch as happened to challenger 
in july 1985 the shuttle wouldnt reach an adequate altitude the 
astronauts would either bring the telescope back or put it in a 
lower orbit until a shuttle could tow it higher 
as long as hubble is deployed at least 326 miles above earth it 
can make some useful observations for a year before it needs a 
boost flight director william reeves said 
shuttle maintenance flights every three years will tow the 
telescope back up to 380 miles if its orbit decays because of 
sunspots the current solar cycle is the second most intense on 
record spewing solar wind that heats and inflates earths 
atmosphere increasing friction that can make satellites fall from 
orbit more quickly 
if the shuttle fleet were grounded for years by another tragedy 
like the challenger explosion the telescope could burn up in the 
atmosphere 
astronautastronomer steve hawley said vibration during 
discoverys ascent is unlikely to damage the telescopes mirror 
but if it sat on the pad for a long time you might worry about 
possible contamination 
thats because the shuttles cargo bay is not as clean as either 
the vacuum of space or the clean room where the telescope was 
readied for flight said mark johnston of the baltimorebased space 
telescope science institute which schedules use of telescope time 
installation of the hubble into the shuttles cargo bay was delayed 
briefly last month after insects invaded the clean room 
nasa officials believe they can deal with all conceivable 
troubles except the possibility the hubble might be obliterated by 
a speeding meteoroid or a hunk of junk from some previous space 
flight 
a study of air force space junk statistics concluded that there 
is a 1 percent chance that that a fragment large enough to destroy 
the telescope 4 inches wide would hit it during its 15year 
mission johnston said 
the telescope is aimed with internal gyroscopes but lacks 
thrusters to maneuver it away from an impending collision 
weiler disputed the 1 percent estimate as exaggerated so im 
not going to lose sleep over it 
because the launch has been delayed so long much of the 
telescopes equipment is aging and some might fail including 
electrical connections and moving parts such as camera shutters and 
filter wheels johnston said 
hubble is designed so that as parts fail other parts can be 
turned on to replace them skillman said 
if a malfunction seriously threatens the telescope nasa is 
committed to launching a shuttle within a year instead of waiting 
for a regular maintenance mission 
but if i were a hubble space telescope project guy i would 
always carry with me a lingering concern that when i need the 
support is it going to be available to me hawley said 
when shuttles approach on servicing missions thrust exhaust 
might fog hubbles mirror but skillman said that can be prevented 
with careful maneuvering 
while hubbles orbit makes it accessible for repairs it also 
leaves the telescope able to make observations only 35 percent of 
each day johnston said 
earth will block desired targets 40 percent of the time the 
telescope needs 10 percent of its time to locate and lock onto 
guide stars so it remains steady it is unusable 15 percent of 
the time when it passes east of brazil where orbiting radiation 
belts dip low enough to interfere with the telescopes electronics

police recovered a 1200yearold mosaic in 
a raid near the capital and arrested three mosaic dealers accused 
of ripping the artwork out of the floor of an ancient desert castle 
a week ago authorities said sunday 
police on saturday arrested a man and his two sons and found the 
artwork at their home in the ancient roman city of jerash 22 miles 
north of amman a police spokesman said 
the 15by18foot mosaic was the most intact early islamic 
mosaic in jordan before it was stolen but obviously the gang 
dropped it somewhere while they were hurrying to leave the 
castle said ghazi bisheh antiquities director of the tourism 
ministry 
the mosaic with a tree of life design was taken from 
hallabat castle a roman and moslem fortress 30 miles northeast of 
amman the theft prompted demands for better protection of the 
fort which was guarded by a nearby bedouin villager 
minister of tourism abdulkarim kabariti said last week the 
thieves apparently took advantage of the islamic holy month of 
ramadan to enter the site at dusk when the guard like most 
moslems was breaking his dawntodusk fast with a meal 
the police official said saleh issa suleiman 51 and his two 
sons 32yearold mohammed and 28yearold ahmad were charged with 
stealing antiquities 
the official who cannot be identified under police regulations 
said conviction could bring one to three years in prison and a 
minimum fine of 500 he said harsher measures are expected against 
the gang for ruining such a precious antiquity 
the design was also almost ruined due to the rough way it was 
lifted off the floor bisheh said the thieves applied strong 
glue to the surface of the mosaic covered it with a large jute 
cloth and carelessly lifted the entire picture off the floor at one 
time 
we will be able to fix it since we have all the necessary 
documents and picture of the design bisheh said but we will 
now put it in a safer place the jerash museum 
bisheh said the multicolor design depicting a large tree 
surrounded by lions bulls goats and birds was created in the 
eighth century when the fortress was used as a hunting outpost by 
early islamic rulers 
the castle was one of several in the jordanian and syrian 
deserts used as roman outposts in the second and third centuries 
archaeologists say it was used as a monastery in the seventh 
century before it was taken over the the ummayed moslems in the 
years after the islamic conquest

dieter kloss grinned as yet another group of 
western businessmen with bulging briefcases crammed the lobby of 
the modest but busy offices of the east german chamber of foreign 
trade 
im having a great time at work these days only six months 
ago such coming and going would have been unthinkable said 
kloss an economist 
the chamber is advising growing numbers of american west 
european and asian businesses trying to get a foot in east germany 
before the market is saturated 
before the dramatic opening of the countrys borders and the 
collapse of communist rule last fall most of the chambers 
visitors came from the east bloc trading alliance comecon 
western firms began coming from day one of the changes and 
were encouraging them partly because were feeling a bit overrun 
by west germany kloss said 
signs of the arrival of foreign firms are spreading across east 
berlin 
almost daily workmen at the international trade center climb up 
a high ladder in the lobby to letter the names of new companies 
that have leased office space in the downtown skyscraper 
levi strauss recently mounted its red logo on the door of a 15th 
floor suite from which the company will run future operations in 
east germany where western jeans are already a hit 
coca cola began selling soda in east germany two months ago and 
its west german subsidiary is now seeking an east german partner to 
start a production plant 
both levi strauss and coca cola were sold previously in east 
germany but only in hardcurrency intershops for foreigners 
price waterhouse inc the us financial services firm is 
setting up in east berlin as is the prestigious investment bank 
salomon brothers inc 
if you want to be part of east german developments you have to 
have a presence there said peter coym managing director of 
salomon brothers operations in west germany 
the bank plans to open its office in the sumptuous grand hotel 
in east berlin in midapril with a focus on investment banking and 
consulting connected to the privatization of state companies 
the computer giant ibm plans a joint venture with the east 
german firm robotron while general motorsopel beat out west 
german giants daimlerbenz and bmw to hook up with the wartburg car 
plant 
caterpillar has started marketing tractors backloaders and 
other agricultural and building machines through its west german 
subsidiary zeppelin 
there is great demand in east germany their machines are old 
and outmoded everybody is interested in getting a foot in east 
germany said hans knausel a spokesman for zeppelin 
it didnt used to be that way for four decades the communist 
governments and complicated centralized economies discouraged 
western businessmen from trying to trade with east germany 
trade with the united states in 1989 amounted to about 200 
million turnover with france was under 2 billion and there was 
almost no business at all with south korea 
western organizations that encouraged business in west berlin 
an outpost of democracy during the cold war must now start 
thinking of berlin as a whole 
the american chamber of commerce is considering a move from west 
to east berlin where its offices were located before world war ii 
the berlin economic development corporation founded in 1978 with 
the task of attracting outside investment to west berlin is also 
now looking eastward 
recently we expanded our activities in the eastern direction 
companies who come to us for advice are more interested in east 
berlin said helmut wolf who advises englishspeaking companies 
other west european and asian countries have joined the united 
states in the race to penetrate the east german market swamped by 
west german firms seeking partners 
the italian carmaker fiat has announced plans to produce cars in 
east germany the french and british want to develop hotels but 
have been less aggressive than the americans or the italians 
kloss said east germany had just signed an agreement on economic 
cooperation with south korea that could offer expertise in the 
steel and shipbuilding sectors 
despite the changes there are still barriers to developing 
trade in east germany 
western companies still cannot convert profits into hard 
currency and send them home and some companies are unwilling to 
invest until the german currencies are merged probably this summer 
but other companies say now is the time to enter the market and 
earn name recognition even though east german marks are almost 
worthless

pope john paul ii on sunday invited youths 
from around the world to join him at polands most famous roman 
catholic shrine in august 1991 to mark world youth day 
the popes statement at the conclusion of a palm sunday mass 
was his first confirmation of a 1991 trip to poland polish church 
officials have said they expected a visit the fourth by john paul 
to his homeland since he became pope in 1978 
the popes announcement came as the vatican is intensifying its 
activities in the newly democratic countries of eastern europe 
after decades of oppression from communist governments 
the vatican on sunday offered to mediate in the dispute over 
independence between lithuania and the soviet union 
the youth rally will likely bring tens of thousands of youths 
from around the world to czestochowa whose icon has symbolized 
polish nationalism and religious faith during centuries of foreign 
occupation and partition 
the pope said the madonna of czestochowa honored at the shrine 
in southern poland has constituted the heart of the history of 
the polish people for more than 600 years 
john paul said the theme of the youth day would be the gospel 
phrase you have received the spirit of children 
in the era in which we are living marked by profound social 
upheavals this spirit of children of god constitutes the true 
propulsive element of the history of peoples and the life of 
individuals the pontiff said in italian to more than 20000 
people in front of st peters basilica 
the pope has previously marked the churchs world youth day with 
international rallies in buenos aires argentina in 1987 and in 
santiago de compostela spain in august 
according to legend the black madonna of czestochowa was 
painted by st luke on a plank of wood from christs table john 
paul is particularly devoted to the shrine which he has visited on 
his previous papal trips to poland in 1979 1983 and 1987 
the popes trip will be his first to poland since the communist 
regime gave way to a government dominated by the labor movement 
solidarity which john paul has strongly supported 
the italian news agency ansa without citing sources said the 
pontiffs trip might be divided in two parts a visit in june to 
warsaw and other cities and a trip to czestochowa in august 
the church established its world youth day in 1986 and 
celebrates it in alternate years in rome sundays mass marked the 
1990 world youth day as well as palm sunday 
john paul wearing red robes blessed palms symbolizing the holy 
day during the openair mass which commemorated jesus christs 
triumphant entry into jerusalem at the end of the ceremony he 
offered greetings to youths in several languages

two supreme court justices the most junior 
and the most senior give low grades to the lawyers who have 
appeared before them this year too many lawyers misunderstand the 
purpose of the high courts argument sessions both say 
im really surprised justice anthony m kennedy said in a 
recent interview they dont understand that a good oral argument 
is really like a discussion of the doctoral thesis not a debate 
its relaxed in a sense its a quiet inquiry not a pyrotechnic 
performance 
kennedy who joined the court in 1988 says the quality of 
advocacy during oral arguments has not been as good this year as 
last 
justice william j brennan who has been listening to high court 
arguments since 1956 agrees 
when asked if many lawyers misconstrue what is expected of them 
at the arguments brennan said im very sure thats true and i 
dont know whose fault that is 
of the some 5000 cases that reach the court each year the 
justices grant review to about 150 cases in those lawyers for 
each side appear before the nine justices for an hourlong argument 
session the only work the court performs in public before a 
decision is reached 
brennan recalled during a recent interview that as a state 
appellate judge in new jersey he thought the level of advocacy 
was appalling 
when appointed to this court i thought my gosh when i get 
to the supreme court of the united states immediately theres 
going to be a marked increase in quality well i havent found 
that all these years he said 
brennan said he believes the general demise in quality this year 
even has infected the justice department lawyers who represent the 
federal government before the high court 
after noting that the solicitor generals small staff usually 
offers the government firstrate representation brennan said 
and yet im not so sure thats true this year i dont know why 
they still have very very bright young people perhaps they just 
havent been at it long enough 
some courts streamlining due to heavy caseloads have 
eliminated argument sessions and make their decisions based on 
written briefs alone brennan hopes the supreme court never takes 
that course 
oral argument is one of the most important of our procedures 
i often get different ideas during oral arguments resulting in 
changes of how he views a case he said 
but brennan the courts leading liberal rarely asks any 
questions during the sessions unlike kennedy and the other 
relatively young conservative justices 
in past years i guess i asked as many questions as those of 
my colleagues today who ask most questions brennan said i 
have discovered that i get the most out of oral arguments if i let 
the lawyers present their cases uninterrupted by me 
he added that seems to have worked i get everything i 
want out of the oral arguments 
kennedy takes another approach i ask questions for a couple 
of reasons he said to let counsel know my concerns and to 
let my colleagues know my concerns 
kennedy was surprised when told that many visitors to the 
courtroom sessions have mentioned his stern judicial scowl it 
may be that i value oral argument so highly that im very anxious 
for the attorney to perform at his best he said

the silver spoon and caused a young servant girl to be sentenced to 
death but the opera company of philadelphia revised the role for a

the vatican might mediate in the dispute over 
lithuanias independence if it was asked to do so the holy sees 
envoy to the soviet union said in an interview published sunday 
the roman catholic newspaper avvenire quoted archbishop 
francesco colasuonno as saying that the conflict between moscow and 
lithuania over the republics declaration of independence was a 
political question that could be dealt with by appropriate 
organs such as the un 
if however as a hypothesis the holy see was asked to carry 
out a task of persuasion or mediation it is possible that it would 
do its best to reach a peaceful solution of the conflict 
colasuonno was quoted as saying 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has sent troops on patrol 
through lithuania as part of a campaign of pressure since the 
republic declared independence on march 11 
colasuonno is due to travel to moscow later this month as he 
begins his job as papal nuncio to the soviet union he was named to 
the post last month when the soviet union and vatican forged 
diplomatic ties for the first time since the formation of the 
communist state 
he noted that pope john paul ii has called for dialogue to 
resolve the dispute over lithuania which is overwhelmingly 
catholic 
colasuonno said he had reasons for optimism about 
gorbachevs policy of perestroika or economic restructuring 
because of the developments in the soviet union in the past few 
years 
colasuonno who has been a roving vatican envoy to eastern 
europe also said he expected diplomatic ties between the holy see 
and czechoslovakia to be restored before the pope visits the former 
communist country april 2122

a soviet official said sunday that moscow is 
engaged in a political dialogue with lithuania but a 
lithuanian called the assertion a lie 
vitaly churkin an advisor to the soviet foreign ministry also 
said lithuania should withdraw its declaration of independence so 
negotiations about the baltic states future can proceed 
churkin said soviet president mikhail gorbachevs government 
wants to resolve the lithuanian situation though political 
dialogue and obviously this is what is going on now we are 
thinking about it in those terms 
algimantis cekuolis a lithuanian official called that 
statement a lie both men appeared on abctvs this week with 
david brinkley 
they would be very happy to do anything to overthrow that 
lithuanian government like using a military force from inside 
and economical blockade from outside cekuolis said 
that lie number three that was told that political dialogue 
going on there is no political dialogue if you dont mean this 
kalashnikov gun he said 
lithuanians have tried to talk with the soviets but have only 
managed to get three hours of time from one of gorbachevs 
deputies he said 
please understand they are not talking with us but they are 
shouting all around the world that they are talking he said 
but churkin said if you want a divorce you talk to your 
spouse and its either divorce after you settle all the issues 
which are involved or maybe a reconciliation 
we certainly would like to see a reconciliation but who knows 
what the outcome is going to be 
churkin said the lithuanians who have demanded independence 
from moscow acted precipitiously in trying to secede before 
working out details of their future relationship with the soviet 
union on economic and other matters 
their declaration of independence we feel should be 
rescinded because it amounts to an ultimatum he said and 
before you declare your independence you have to clear out some of 
the things which need to be resolved

one of only 25 survivors rescued from a 
ferry that sank with about 240 people aboard said the boat went 
down minutes after being hit by galeforce winds an official 
newspaper reported sunday 
at least 30 people drowned and as many as 180 others were 
missing and feared dead after the doubledecker ferry sein san pya 
overturned friday afternoon in the southern gyaing river official 
radio reports said 
the latest radio report said 25 people had been rescued 
the governmentowned working peoples daily quoted survivor aung 
mya tint a police inspector as saying the vessel went down 
minutes after being struck by strong wind 
the newspaper said the accident was due to natural forces rather 
than overloading there are frequent ferry boat accidents in burma 
due to overloading of passengers and cargo 
the newspaper said the vessel could carry 280 passengers and up 
to 40 tons of cargo noting the ferry that sank carried about 240 
passengers and 19 tons of cargo 
the ferry was making a regular run on the gyaing river from the 
town of moulmein eastward to the town of kyondo in the southern 
province of tenasserim radio rangoon said moulmein is 100 miles 
southeast of rangoon 
the newspaper said doctors red cross workers and local 
officials were providing medical treatment and other assistance to 
the survivors 
ferry accidents in southern burma have claimed large numbers of 
lives in recent years 
in may 1987 a old vessel with 400 people aboard overturned and 
sank in the rangoon river reports at the time said 283 passengers 
were rescued but no official death toll was given 
in october last year 60 people were reported missing when a 
ferry with 170 people aboard sank in a storm near rangoon

a tax increase will be needed at some point to 
pay for escalating losses among a third of the nations savings and 
loan institutions comptroller general charles a bowsher said 
sunday 
bowsher this past week raised the estimated pricetag for the 
governments sampl bailout from 257 billion to 325 billion with a 
warning that it could rise to 500 billion 
this is one of the great financial disasters that weve ever 
had in this country and its going to have to be added onto all the 
other problems we have in the federal budget he said on nbctvs 
meet the press 
when you get done making the cuts that you hope you can make 
in defense and some of the other areas youre still going to 
have to look at the revenue side of the budget the head of the 
congressional general accounting office said 
bowsher blamed the bush administrations desire to meet deficit 
reduction targets without a tax increase for underestimating the 
size of the sampl problem 
last year they had unrealistic interests rates in their 
forecast he said they insisted on using a deposit assumption 
that gave you a 7 percent deposit growth where we knew that 
deposits were leaving we told them at the time wed probably be 
back and thats where we are today 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp and the resolution trust corp responsible for handling the 
bailout said the government simply didnt know in what bad 
condition these sampls were 
we found that there were more of them and in worse shape than 
we thought seidman said on the same show one of the things

there may be more varieties of matzoh now than 
when the israelites fled from egypt but the essential elements of 
the passover seder havent changed for thousands of years making 
it one of the oldest ritual sitdown dinners 
perhaps the reason the feast commemorating the exodus has 
survived so long is that its whole purpose is to pass on to 
generations of jews the story of their ancestors escape from 
slavery on monday at sundown jews all over the world will observe 
the tradition again 
one professor of jewish studies believes the gastronomic nature 
of the tradition may also have something to do with its longevity 
if you can hit them in the stomach it lasts said jon 
levenson a professor of jewish studies at harvard university 
elements of the family seder as it is practiced today date back 
some 1900 years to the time of the destruction of the second 
temple in jerusalem levenson said some parts of the tradition may 
date back roughly 3000 years 
some scholars believe jesus christs last supper was a seder 
thats unclear it certainly took place around passover time 
levenson said 
there are eastern religious meals that probably predate the 
jewish seder but documentation to trace when they began is 
sketchy according to religious scholars 
the meaning of the hebrew word for passover is debatable 
levenson said the popular explanation for the english word is that 
it describes the angel of death passing over the homes of jews 
who marked their doors with lambs blood according to exodus the 
angel of death was sent to slay the egyptians firstborn 
the modern explanation may be close to the original meaning of 
the word levenson believes the hebrew word pesach comes from a 
ritual dance 
the verb itself i think means jump leap levenson said 
it may very well indicate that the destroyer in exodus jumps 
over jewish homes 
the style of a modern seder varies with each family some allow 
for long discussions some are filled with song others adopt 
modern themes but the essential story and many of the props that 
go with it remain the same 
matzoh the flat bread that now comes in whole wheat egg and 
unsalted varieties symbolizes that the israelites fled so quickly 
from pharaoh they didnt have time to let their bread rise 
bitter herbs like horseradish recall the bitter taste of 
slavery and a sweet paste often made of apples raisins and nuts 
represents the mortar the jewish slaves used to build egyptian 
pyramids 
the seder story is built around questions from children usually 
posed by the youngest child at the table the responses are framed 
so that even the child who doesnt know how to ask a question can 
learn the exodus story 
the haggada is a book used to guide the meal traditional 
haggadot contain prayers blessings and appropriate readings some 
narratives are illustrated with pictures others are specially made 
for children and a feminist haggada even appeared several years 
ago references to the holocaust and to those lost in the nazi 
death camps are now common at many seder tables 
some families use the haggada as a starting point to lead into 
discussions of modernday problems 
marvin kalb a former television correspondent who now directs a 
center on media studies at harvard universitys kennedy school of 
government said talk at his familys seder table often turns to 
newsworthy topics 
were very political and we do talk about modern themes 
although we do go through the passover readings in a very 
traditional way kalb said 
kalb said he still recalls cleaning the house and changing the 
dishes in his boyhood home to prepare for passover he said the 
passover tradition has survived because it is built on an 
inherently interesting tale 
its a great story its a story of freedom kalb said 
author elie wiesel who has written extensively about his 
experiences as a holocaust survivor said his family sticks closely 
to the traditional haggada 
it is linked to the first holiday to the very beginning of 
history said wiesel who teaches at boston university we are 
always fascinated with beginnings after all i think its the 
first liberation story in history

vietnamese officials privately suggested 
allowing the us military to return to cam ranh bay if relations 
between the countries continue to warm says a congressman who 
recently met with them 
rep thomas ridge rpa said the extraordinary possibility was 
raised informally at a foundationsponsored forum in bali 
indonesia attended by several congressmen and a group of 
topranking officials of vietnams communist government 
a congressional delegation headed by the chairwoman of the house 
subcommittee responsible for overseeing us military bases hopes 
to visit cam ranh bay this week as part of a 10day trip to 
vietnam guam singapore and indonesia 
the missions purpose is to explore alternatives to us 
military bases in the philippines leases on six us installations 
in the philippines expire in 1991 and american officials anticipate 
difficult negotiations for continued base rights there 
the soviet union moved into the usbuilt base at cam ranh bay 
at the conclusion of the vietnam war in 1975 but pentagon 
officials said in january that the soviets had withdrawn some 
fighter planes and bombers 
the possibility of the soviets withdrawing completely from the 
base and americans returning to it was one of the subjects at the 
indonesia forum sponsored by the henry r luce foundation ridge 
said 
that possibility was discussed and under the right set of 
circumstances i think the vietnamese would welcome it said 
ridge who saw vietnam war combat as an enlisted man 
one of the ranking vietnamese officials said i can see the 
day when american ships are docked in cam ranh bay ridge said 
adding that the official later specified that he meant warships 
we said do you mean just for refueling and they said no 
for repairs ridge said 
ridge said conditions of the forum prevented him from 
identifying the vietnamese official 
rep chester atkins dmass who also was at the meeting said 
returning to cam ranh bay would require some major changes in the 
relationship between the united states and vietnam 
but atkins who declined to discuss specifics of the meeting 
also said i think the vietnamese are desperate their economy is 
in a state of continued deterioration i think theyre willing to 
look at or think about anything that doesnt endanger their 
national security that would allow them to rejoin the economic 
community and modernize 
the united states and vietnam have no diplomatic or trade 
relations the state department says it will consider relations 
only after verification of vietnamese troop withdrawals from 
cambodia and after a process of internationally supervised 
elections in cambodia is established 
seven members of congress hope to visit cam ranh bay this week 
to determine the extent of the soviet reductions there said 
delegation leader pat schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the house 
armed services subcommittee on military installations and 
facilities 
such a visit will require both vietnamese and soviet approval 
so i dont know if well get there or not schroeder said 
friday 
while the delegation is interested in the status of cam ranh 
bay schroeder emphasized that the purpose of the trip was 
obtaining a broader view of us security responsibilities in the 
region 
we in the us congress cannot negotiate with either the 
soviets or the vietnamese on cam ranh bay but it is a very 
important facility and it is in a country that appears to be in a 
positive transition more towards our side schroeder said 
regardless of what happens with cam ranh bay she said she 
wanted to uncover base alternatives because some in the 
philippines are demanding that we pay 2 billion a year in rent 
to keep us installations there 
in 1988 the soviets offered to abandon cam ranh bay if the 
united states did the same with its philippines bases the united 
states rejected the offer saying it needed the pacific bases to 
support its worldwide operations 
the state department has received no offer from the vietnamese 
about cam ranh bay according to a department official who spoke 
last week on condition of anonymity 
john leboutillier a former republican congressman from new 
york said in a recently published book that vietnamese officials 
told him they would be receptive to talking about cam ranh bay if 
relations normalized 
leboutillier said in an interview that he told the bush 
administration about the conversations but that he had no evidence 
that any action was taken

the demonstrations as disruptive and called for a law to regulate 
them

crowds of up to 10000 people

soviets helped a small mongol revolutionary army win independence 
from china in 1921

at the state capitol education has lost 
its head commerce is shorthanded half of agriculture has 
disappeared entirely 
but its not because of budget cuts or governmental neglect 
its the damage caused by more than a century of wear and tear on 
12 allegorical statues in the state capitol 
in one of the final stages of a 38 million renovation of the 
capitol building the plaster of paris statues of greek women are 
being restored 
the six pairs of greekstyle statues on two stairway landings 
leading to the house balcony symbolize six pillars of connecticut 
culture education commerce force agriculture science and 
music 
on days when the general assembly is not in session sculptor 
john d leslie carefully shapes clay molds to recreate the hands 
heads and toes that have been chipped away by a centurys worth of 
passing tourists and lobbyists 
its a fascinating project he said theres no 
deterioration in the material itself its just that the statues 
have been banged and chipped over the years 
sculpted in 1876 by john quincy adams ward of new york the 
statues are actually the scale models that adams used to sculpt 12 
identical but larger marble statues that ring the outside of the 
capitol dome 
each statue depicts a greek woman holding an object showing her 
role agriculture holds an apple and a sheaf of wheat music strums 
on a lyre 
on the west landing commerce is missing a hand and a prankster 
once painted some of her toenails red she is nicknamed the 
goddess of basketball because she holds a small globe in one hand 
the head is gone on one of the two educations an agriculture 
was inadvertently knocked over by workers one day and taken by 
stretcher to the capitol basement for repair on both landings the 
barebreasted amazon who depicts force is missing her spear 
the restorer uses clay molds to make an exact match of the 
originals then casts a plaster of paris replacement directly onto 
the statue most of leslies work is done in hartford but he 
worked in his studio in guilford on a replacement head for 
education 
ive had to crawl inside mr wards head leslie said 
ive got to think like he did as best i can i dont want to 
improve his work thats not my job 
in most cases leslie can refer to the twin statue on the 
opposite landing to find the exact dimensions of the missing piece 
when both statues are missing the same part he uses binoculars to 
study the intact version of the statues on the outside of the 
capitol 
he will complete his 48000 contract by painting the statues a 
shade of tan identical to their original coat of paint 
leslie worked in a family foundry until he began restoring 
statues and ornamental work in historic buildings seven years ago 
his past projects include the statues of four dolphins in the 
courtyard of yales sterling library and work at the shubert 
theater in new haven 
his latest reconstruction which should keep him busy until 
june has given him a greater appreciation for wards work he said 
theres nothing by chance up there he said everyones 
dressed a certain way for a certain reason 
a contemporary of augustus saintgaudens ward is perhaps best 
known for his oftenphotographed statue of george washington on 
wall street in new york

a woman who allegedly claims she is the mother 
of jack the ripper goes on trial monday accused of plotting to kill 
a man with an hatchet in a ritual she believed would resurrect the 
british serial killer 
the 26yearold man who has not been identified by court 
officials said in a complaint that he was lured to an apartment 
and attacked by an axwielding woman hiding in the shower he said 
he needed 50 stitches for a forehead wound 
jury selection begins monday in the trial of deborah kazuck 26 
who is accused of plotting the may 29 attack with two other 
milwaukee women catherine lipsham 23 and ramona barry 27 
pleaded guilty friday to the same charge of attempted firstdegree 
murder and agreed to testify against ms kazuck 
the victim who also is expected to testify said he was lured 
to an apartment on milwaukees south side by ms barry he had met 
the women in a park a few weeks before the attack and said they 
appeared perfectly normal 
he said he went to the bathroom heard something move in the 
shower and pushed the curtain aside to reveal ms kazuck holding a 
hatchet with a twohanded grip 
she raised the hatchet above her head began chanting 
redrum or murder spelled backward and struck him on the 
forehead just above the left eye before he managed to escape the 
man told police 
police said ms kazuck planned to dismember the victims body 
drain his blood and eat his kidneys in a ritual she believed would 
bring jack the ripper back to life 
at least five prostitutes fell prey to the rippers knife in the 
seamy east end of london in the autumn of 1888 most were 
disemboweled and mutilated the crimes were never solved 
ms kazuck will have a twophase trial because she has pleaded 
both innocent and innocent by reason of mental disease or defect 
in the first phase the jury must decide whether she committed the 
crime in the second they will decide if she was insane at the 
time 
pretrial publicity prompted the judge to order jury selection in 
madison 90 miles away but the trial will be held in milwaukee 
county circuit court 
ms barry said friday she and ms lipsham had been out 
kacking on several other occasions with ms kazuck she said 
kacking a combination of killing and jack was their 
code word for killing 
she said she wasnt certain a murder would be attempted on may 
29 
i was not sure because we had gone out kacking before and did 
nothing she said i was not too sure if there would be a 
finished product when it was going on in the bathroom and i could 
hear the struggle i felt well its going on for real this 
time 
police found correspondence about the slaying plot and a picture 
of a man with an ax in the middle of his forehead at the apartment 
they described the attack as a satanic ritual 
all three women told police they had participated in satanism 
under the plea agreement prosecutors said they would seek no 
more than eight years in prison for both ms lipmsham and ms 
barry sentencing for the two is set for may 25

despite warnings from president 
fernando collor de mello lawmakers sunday seemed poised to 
drastically alter the new leaders antiinflation shock therapy 
that has thrown people out of work 
congress was scheduled to meet late sunday and all day monday to 
vote on collors 3weekold plan to fight hyperinflation that 
reached 4850 percent last year 
one of 10 items on the agenda is measure 168 considered the 
heart of the plan which froze for 18 months assets of over 1200 
in bank savings accounts and over 600 in shortterm money market 
deposits 
the move took about 115 billion 80 percent af all bank 
deposits out of circulation overnight and while officials say 
inflation is coming down the plan has also put the economy on the 
brink of a major recession 
on saturday rep osmundo reboucas of the brazilian democratic 
movement party charged with reviewing measure 168 filed his 
report and suggested major changes 
reboucas proposal which will be submitted to the full congress 
in place of collors original measure would allow savings account 
withdrawals in installments of 4800 every third month beginning 
in july 
this plan is a bomb any mistake will throw us into an 
inflationary explosion or a terrible recession reboucas said 
reboucas centerleft democratic movement party is the largest 
in congress with 179 of 570 seats brazils communist party and the 
leftist workers party also have condemned the package 
five centrist parties holding a solid majority in the congress 
have demanded substantial changes to the plan by collor a member 
of the centerright national reconstruction party which holds just 
24 congressional seats 
collor who announced the package on march 16 one day after 
taking office as brazils first freely elected president in 29 
years warned saturday that the bank freeze was nonnegotiable and 
crucial to defeating inflation 
we have already liquidated inflation now i wish to be 
partners in the success of the plan because i wont be a partner in 
tragedy if the plan is altered he said during a visit to his 
home state of alagoas on brazils northeastern atlantic coast 
collor said the ceiling of 1200 on bank withdrawals was not 
picked out of the air but selected by economists after detailed 
studies 
there is no return from the plan our ships have been burned 
and now we either win or we win he said 
collor instituted the plan which also included a 30day price 
freeze and a new national currency with a series of 26 
provisional measures the measures become law immediately but 
can be voted down by congress within 30 days 
legislators who thus far have passed four measures intact and 
eight with minor modifications are expected to vote on the entire 
package by midweek as the 30day deadline is nearing and friday 
is a national holiday for easter 
if reboucas proposal is passed collor can veto it but 
congress can overturn the veto with a simple majority 
most congressmen are up for reelection this fall and many are 
worried that if they support collors plan they will lose their 
jobs in the event of a recession which now seems imminent 
half of sao paulo states 370000 auto workers are on enforced 
collective holiday union groups say some 200000 workers have been 
fired nationwide with huge lines forming at unemploment offices 
in major cities all last week and major companies forced to 
borrow from banks to pay salaries 
if the government doesnt inject money into the economy we 
wont have a recession but a disaster said luiz antonio de 
medeiros president of the sao paulo metalworkers union and 
considered a moderate 
others fear an economic disaster whatever congress does 
we will see a brutal recession if congress doesnt lift the 
ceiling on bank withdrawals but i fear a run on the banks that 
will provoke a hyperinflation if they do said alexandre barros 
a consultant to local and multinational businessmen 
if the plan doesnt work we are fried if it does work we are 
broiled he added

an upbeat mood settled over this 
launch center sunday when crews finished installing the 15 
billion hubble space telescope in the space shuttle discovery and 
said they were on track for a tuesday morning liftoff 
this is a very important day for us said william taylor 
the telescopes chief engineer some of us who have been on the 
project for a while wondered if we would ever see this day or the 
days to follow 
closing of the cargo bay which holds the 43footlong 
telescope was a milestone in the countdown for a launch at 847 
am edt tuesday the telescope is the most expensive and 
complicated payload to be carried aboard the shuttle in 35 flights 
it is being launched seven years later than originally planned 
the weather predictions were good 
there was only one hitch in the countdown a short in a heater 
cable in a strut that connects the shuttle to its huge fuel tank 
the heater prevents ice from forming on the strut when the tank is 
filled with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen 
technicians are checking to make sure that the short has not 
influenced any other systems shuttle program director robert l 
crippen said the heater is not involved for launch and is not a 
constraint to launch 
discoverys commander loren shriver and pilot charles f bolden 
jr practiced emergency landings on the kennedy space center 
runway sunday while mission specialists bruce mccandless steven 
a hawley and kathryn d sullivan went through final equipment fit 
tests 
all studied lastminute changes in their thick flight plans 
then had the afternoon off to spend in the hazy sun 
clearly the star of the show was the shiny telescope named 
after famed astronomer edwin hubble which is expected to look 
backward in time to nearly the formation of the universe some 15 
billion years ago 
this instrument has been built to the limits of what 
technology can provide said charles pellerin director of nasas 
astrophysics division this is a voyage very much perhaps like 
the voyages of columbus and magellan except that its a voyage of 
mans intellect into the universe 
asked if perhaps scientists were overselling the expected 
contributions of the telescope pellerin replied no that it was 
the biggest single advance in the history since galileo 
he likened it to giving astronomers 2020 vision of the universe 
after centuries of viewing it through 20200 eyes 
the hubble will be released 380 miles above earth after an 
extensive checkout at the end of the shuttles robot arm 
astronauts mccandless and sullivan will be ready to make a space 
walk should there be problems such as a failure of the telescopes 
electricityproducing solar panels to extend the telescope can 
remain on its internal battery power for only five hours 
the telescopes release is scheduled for 29 hours after liftoff 
and will be seen by television beamed to the ground discovery will 
fly escort at a distance of 46 miles for nearly two days until a 
10footdiameter cover is successfully opened to expose the 
telescopes instruments to space 
the telescope is expected to be in operation for at least 15 
years with periodic servicing by visiting astronauts some 50 
parts are designed to be swapped out during periodic maintenance in 
orbit

television in a special broadcast at 11 pm it was preceded by 
several hours of talks between opposition leaders and the harvard 
universityeducated monarch 
according to the announcement the king removed the word 
partyless from the preamble of the constitution and scrapped an 
act that banned political parties 
foreign minister pashupati rana said elections for the national 
assembly would be held soon but he gave no date in an apparent 
deal the opposition said it would end its 50dayold protest 
movement 
several residents celebrated by climbing onto rooftops shouting 
victory victory others switched on all the lights in their 
houses 
open street demonstrations were limited due to a 24hour curfew 
which rana said would remain in effect until monday 
while an announcer read the proclamation from the royal palace 
the television showed scenes of the king meeting leaders of the 
nepali congress party outlawed for the last 29 years the party 
was a leader of the recent protests 
we talked with the king for an hour at the royal palace and 
the talks were very very cordial said kirshna prasad bhattrai 
a nepali congress leader prodemocracy leaders had expressed 
pessimism earlier in the day 
this will be the advent of human rights and freedom of speech 
in nepal said sahana pradhan a member of the congress and the 
only woman opposition leader to meet the king 
the most important person in the country has made a most 
important decision rana told the associated press this is not 
a concession it is a natural process of answering the will of the 
people 
still many questions remained despite the promise of 
elections no mention was made of reforming the national assembly 
or rashtriya panchayat a largely rubber stamp body the king still 
has almost absolute power several hundred political prisoners 
remain in jail 
the opposition victory came two days after security forces 
unleashed the bloodiest attack in more than a century witnesses 
said as many as 200 people were killed when police opened fire on a 
crowd of 200000 prodemocracy demonstrators but the government 
said only 10 people died and 107 were wounded the government then 
imposed a curfew friday night 
shoes slippers glass and rocks still littered the streets 
sunday 
the protest occurred during a general strike called by the the 
nepali congress and a coalition of leftist parties who launched 
the campaign for multiparty democracy seven weeks ago 
not since 1846 when feuding members of the royal household 
battled had this peaceful kingdom in the mountains and valleys of 
the majestic himalayas seen such bloodshed 
before the kings announcement the us embassy issued a 
warning to american tourists in katmandu advising them to leave 
the country the statement noted that a british citizen was among 
the dead friday 
the kings decision came after talks between the new prime 
minister lokendra bahadur chand a relative moderate and 
opposition leaders on saturday and sunday chand was given his job 
last week after hardline prime minister marich man shrestha 
resigned 
the process had been continuing since last evening there was 
an agreement on how to go about it today said yog prasad 
upadhyaya a senior nepali congress leader earlier he had said 
the talks were stalemated 
a number of members of the national assembly made impassioned 
appeals for a multiparty system then sunday night opposition 
leaders began to claim victory 
the kingdoms only experiment with westernstyle democracy 
lasted less than two years and was halted in 1961 when birendras 
father king mahendra dismissed the nepali congress government 
accusing it of corruption and inefficiency 
since then political parties have been banned and the king has 
ruled in conjunction with a legislature called the rashtriya 
panchayat or national assmbly 
birendra 44 is the heir of the shaha dynasty that has held the 
throne since the middle of the 18th century many nepalis 
especially illiterate farmers who comprise the bulk of this 
countrys 17 million people view him as the reincarnation of the 
hindu god shiva 
there have been demonstrations for greater democracy in the 
past but the support has come mainly from university students and 
limited circles of activists the current campaign broadened to 
strikes by doctors airline pilots and even employees of government 
banks and some ministries 
the government lifted the curfew in a few northern districts for 
two hours sunday morning but the rest of the city and the two 
suburbs of patan and bhaktapur remained under strict curfew 
soldiers with rifles and machine guns were posted at all 
intersections including the narrow streets that wind through 
residential areas an occasional armored car was seen and army 
trucks loaded with troops sped up and down the streets 
sunday is a normal working day in nepal and saturday is the 
weekly holiday

many residents of the sleepy 
neighborhoods near the walt disney co are grumpy over the towering 
additions to the companys new headquarters building 
its all very well for 6foottall teenage mutant ninja turtles 
to run wild in the comics and movies they say 
its something else when the seven dwarfs mutate into 19foot 
giants draped across the companys corporate headquarters in 
burbank where movie studios proliferate next to rows of neat 
bungalows on treelined avenues 
in 1937 the curtain parted for disneys animated classic 
snow white and the seven dwarfs in which happy grumpy 
sleepy sneezy dopey bashful and doc starred with snow white 
next week a huge veil comes down at the headquarters to reveal 
them again standing at the thirdstory level appearing to hold up 
the fifthstory roof 
obviously disney always does things their own way with a 
flair for the dramatic said burbank planning board member jeff 
vander borght who lives nearby but im afraid its totally out 
of scale for the neighborhood 
alan epstein vice president of disney development corp and 
burbanks city planner rick pruetz said the building conforms 
strictly to city codes so no public hearings were held on the 
design 
thats a pity said vander borght 
it gives a whole new meaning to the word dwarf he said 
stretch dwarfs were going to be known as the city of the huge 
dwarfs 
founder walt disney allowed no identification of the company on 
the studio property only after his death in 1966 did his mickey 
mouse creation sprout atop the studio lots water tower 
walt didnt want tourists popping in to interfere with 
production said a longtime employee who spoke on condition of 
anonymity and he didnt want people mistakenly believing that 
disneyland was in burbank

christian democrat leader lothar de maiziere 
failed sunday to form east germanys first democratic government 
after a grueling round of talks with other parties 
the breakdown in talks came after christian democrat leaders 
said de maiziere already had drawn up a proposed cabinet that would 
have brought together the nations leading political factions 
despite widespread optimism that an agreement was near 
christian democrats and the rival social democrats ended five hours 
of discussions with no accord 
de maiziere leads a threeparty conservative alliance that holds 
the most seats in the 400member parliament but was trying to build 
a coalition broad enough to control the legislature 
a twothirds majority is needed to enact constitutional changes 
that would clear the way to unification with west germany the main 
issue in the east germanys first free elections on march 18 
an alliance with the social democrats would give de maiziere 
control but if negotiations with that party fail his alliance has 
enough seats to build coalitions with other parties and still 
secure control of parliament 
richard schroeder a leading social democrat lawmaker said 
after talks broke off that his party still hoped to join de 
maizieres government 
the christian democrats and the social democrats differ on the 
pace of reunification and the role and makeup of an east german 
government which faces dire economic problems but which also is 
likely to be a shortlived transitional government 
the leftleaning social democrats who finished second in the 
elections were demanding that the christian democrats use their 
close connections with west german chancellor helmut kohl to obtain 
a copy of west germanys proposed blueprint for reunification 
the treaty being discussed in bonn would set out the laws that 
would be applied in a unified germany in effect outlining the 
terms for combining their social and economic structures 
de maiziere is a close ally of kohls but many east german 
leaders fear that the country will not have enough say in the terms 
of the nations eventual merger 
the two major parties and a smaller alliance of liberal 
lawmakers began meeting sunday after a long set of talks the night 
before 
christian democrat leaders indicated that a new government would 
be formed soon but before the talks began social democrat leader 
markus meckel stressed that issues were unresolved and that talks 
on forming a new government were not likely to end on sunday 
christian democrat lawmaker martin kirchner said late saturday 
that a proposed list of cabinet members already had been compiled 
with de maiziere as premier or prime minister 
the christian democrats would have 11 posts the social 
democrats would have six a liberal alliance and the 
ultraconservative german social union would have three each and 
the democratic awakening would have one ministry 
the christian democrats democratic awakening and the german 
social union all form the conservative alliance led by de maiziere 
the social democrats have protested the german social unions 
policies and have opposed its presence in a new government 
the social democrats also favor a more gradual form of 
reunification than the swift pace proposed by the christian 
democrats 
the new parliament which met for the first time last week is 
expected to grapple with allegations that some members had ties to 
the former secret police of the ousted communist regime of former 
leader erich honecker 
a report in the west german newspaper bild on sunday alleged 
that a former east german activist who was deported by the old 
communist government two years ago was actually a secret police 
informant 
ralph hirsch now an aviser to west berlin mayor walter momper 
denied the allegations as slander momper defended hirsch and 
criticized the report based on the allegations of an unidentified 
former secret police agent 
two prominent east german leaders including former social 
democrat leader ibrahim boehme have resigned in recent months amid 
similar allegations which they denied de maiziere also has denied 
allegations he had ties to the secret police known as the stasi

midnight to go home when he discovered that his personal vehicle 
had been vandalized george gravley a company spokesman said from

clinton md resident held the unloaded weapon at port arms or 
diagonally across his chest 
keith bullock 31 said he had just arrived at the bus terminal 
to begin picketing when the confrontation began 
an offduty district police officer who also works as a security 
guard at the bus terminal heard the commotion and came to 
investigate bullock said 
the police officer identified himself and ordered him king 
to drop the weapon bullock said the officer repeated the 
command two more times the guy looked like he was going to use the 
butt of the weapon and hit me when the officer said it again and he 
king handed it over the name of the officer was not 
immediately available 
no shots were fired and no one was injured gravley said 
the windows of kings truck were broken out and the tires 
flattened bullock said he had every right to be upset but he 
had no right to pick out one person bullock said 
there have been reports of sporadic violence and shootings since 
greyhound drivers went on strike the company blames the union and 
says there will be no contract talks until a week goes by with no 
violence

about 4000 volunteers dressed as union 
and confederate soldiers sunday marked the 125th anniversary of the 
end of the civil war by recreating gen robert e lees solemn 
surrender to gen ulysses s grant 
nearly 8000 spectators some wearing bonnets and hoopskirts 
from 1865 stood behind wooden fences along the old stage road 
through appomattox court house national historic park 
there was scattered applause and a few rebel yells as a man 
playing confederate gen john gordon rode a stocky chestnut horse 
in front of a column of rebel soldiers marching four abreast 
between union troops with shouldered arms 
after appomattox more than a month went by before the remaining 
confederate armies surrendered and a few isolated forces west of 
the mississippi river laid down their arms but historians agree 
that lees surrender ended the war between the states for all 
intents and purposes 
the reenactment took place in the isolated reconstructed 
central virginia village where the war ended after four devastating 
years most of the volunteers playing rebel and yankee men in 
uniform were grim 
its a solemn occasion said joe pitts of winstonsalem 
nc we dont particularly care for it and the troops back then 
didnt care for it 
one young confederate wept as he stacked his rifle in one of the 
teepeestyle piles along the dirt road winding through the regions 
rolling hills 
you get into what the soldiers felt back then said lake day 
of jacksonville fla to subject yourself to surrender is tough 
the volunteers said they were saddened this was the last major 
reenactment of the anniversary battles they have recreated during 
the past four years a few said they planned to quit the expensive 
hobby after this 
the reenactors ranged in age from preteens to septuagenarians 
and came from across the united states canada and europe 
pitts said they tried to depict the surrender at appomattox 
exactly as the ragged starving soldiers went through it 
it cant be totally correct we cant be emaciated like they 
were he said 
the reenactment also was a few days off and the sky was blue 
rather than gray 
the stacking of arms came on april 12 1865 exactly four years 
after the war started at fort sumter sc and three days after 
lee surrendered to gen grant at a private home on the edge of the 
village 
terry daley of baltimore who played union gen joshua 
chamberlain said his order for his men to present arms as 27800 
confederate soldiers surrendered helped heal our wounds 
at the sound of a bugle chamberlain paid the highest tribute 
you can to an adversary it was to show we are brothers and 
americans daley said

voters choosing hungarys first freely 
elected government in 43 years gave an overwhelming victory sunday 
to hungarys main conservative party 
i am completely certain that we won the elections 
democratic forum president jozsef antall told jubilant supporters 
crowding party headquarters six hours after polls closed 
but it is not we but the hungarian people who have won these 
elections he said 
final results for the 261 parliamentary seats at stake in runoff 
elections sunday were not expected before tuesday but state 
television showed the conservative hungarian democratic forum 
winning 418 percent of the vote or 116 seats with more than 90 
percent of the votes counted 
their closest rivals the liberal alliance of free democrats 
won 21 percent of the vote or 58 seats 
the agrarianbased smallholders party won 29 districts with 115 
percent of the vote while reform communists grouped in the 
socialist party had won 18 with 8 percent 
eight seats were still not determined 
it was the second conservative sweep in eastern europe in as 
many free elections east germans gave conservatives a clear 
victory in elections on march 18 relegating the communists to an 
opposition role 
in hungary 171 of the 261 seats were voted on directly sunday 
ninety seats will be determined on the voting percentage each party 
receives 
with 43 seats won by democratic forum candidates in the first 
round march 25 the party had a total of 159 seats after both 
rounds according to the preliminary calculations based on 90 
percent returns 
the free democrats had 92 seats while the smallholders had 44 
and the socialists 32 others seats were shared by two smaller 
parties 
there are 394 seats in parliament including eight seats to be 
allocated to national minorities 
democratic forum president antall turned 58 sunday and a rare 
smile creased his face as he was presented with a gigantic boquet 
of flowers 
the early conservative advantage forced a concession from free 
democrat leader miklos haraszti 
it is clear that the hdf will gain the most seats he said 
elections two weeks ago left 261 of the national assemblys 394 
seats undecided that balloting gave no party an outright majority 
but relegated the former communists to fourth place 
no party was considered strong enough to win a majority in 
sundays polling and a coalition government was expected more than 
75 million people were eligible to vote 
both frontrunning parties the democratic forum and the free 
democrats have refused to consider forming a government with the 
former communists 
most polls closed at 6 pm after 12 hours of voting state 
television began its 24hour election program two hours later with 
preliminary estimates of a more than 40 percent turnout nationwide 
indicating that more than 325 million people voted 
many hungarians seemed weary after the second round of balloting 
in two weeks 
its clear that people have become tired interim president 
matyas szueros told reporters before casting his ballot its 
time to end the election process 
the voting was generally uneventful with few irregularities 
reported 
in debrecen about 90 miles west of the capital of budapest 
several polling stations did not open on time because supervisory 
officials were late state radio reported 
one station first opened at 9 am three hours past schedule 
the radio said the delay was caused by the chief supervisor who 
called in to say he would be late because he was tired 
voters at a polling station in budapest shook out umbrellas 
after walking in from the rain and many clutched pussy willows 
symbolic in hungary of easter 
many said they were enthusiastic about voting in the national 
elections but others appeared skeptical that a new government 
would be able to solve hungarys severe economic problems that 
include a declining living standard doubledigit inflation 
growing unemployment and a 20 billion foreign debt 
im here im voting but i dont have any confidence in it 
said ernoe horvath a 61year old retiree even now we dont have 
people running that we can trust 
the first round of elections on march 25 put the hungarian 
democratic forum and the liberal alliance of free democrats in the 
lead but neither party polled a majority forcing sundays second 
round 
democratic forum captured 2473 percent in the earlier election 
the free democrats 2139 percent the agrarianoriented 
smallholders party 1173 percent and the socialists 1089 percent 
the rest of the vote was scattered among 25 other parties 
the socialists were unique among ruling soviet bloc parties in 
leading their country to democracy without massive popular 
pressure but most people associate the party with the excesses of 
43 years of communist rule 
the free democrats who want to quickly scrap hungarys command 
economy in favor of a market economy have warmed in recent weeks 
to the possibility of a coalition with the democratic forum 
but the forum which emphasizes traditional christian values and 
cautious economic change has said it will only join forces with 
the free democrats in a national emergency 
antall refused to comment when asked sunday about the 
possibility of a coalition government with the free democrats 
but free democrat leader janos kis said that a grand coalition 
is a distinct possibility which we dont refuse because we are 
for having a government with wide popular support

unrest broke out in eight prisons in england and 
wales on sunday and one government official said the incidents 
were inspired by the 8dayold rebellion at strangeways prison one 
inmate was found dead in his cell 
the government said it was too dangerous to forcibly end the 
siege at strangeways in the northcentral city of manchester 
because of the condition of the largely demolished prison buildings 
only 22 of the hundreds of strangeways inmates who rioted on 
april 1 remain on the loose authorities said the overcrowded 
prison was heavily damaged when inmates set fires and hurled roof 
tiles at guards and firefighters 
in dartmoor prison in southwest england inmates hurled chunks of 
roofing into the prison courtyard and set fires in their cells 
prison governor john may said 
almost 100 prisoners barricades themselves into one wing of the 
prison but all but one had given up by sunday night 
after the rioting was contained the body of a prisoner was 
found in a firedamaged cell may said 
he refused to give any other details and said it was unknown 
when the fire occurred 
home office minister david mellor said the dead prisoner was 
severely burned and pledged that inmates responsible for the wave 
of unrest would be prosecuted for any criminal offenses 
may said the prisoners at dartmoor were protesting prison food 
and their isolation from their families guards blamed prison 
conditions for the unrest at the prisons 
but mellor described the dartmoor disturbances as a copycat 
incident in the wake of the strangeways riot 
he said the unrest was quickly contained because prison guards 
had advanced warning that their could be trouble in the prison 
the prison was opened in 1809 to house french prisoners from the 
napoleonic wars and is perched on the remote and rugged moorland of 
devonshire 160 miles southwest of london cold and damp despite 
its central heating the prison is almost always cloaked in mist 
at horfield prison in bristol western england 150 to 200 
prisoners appeared to have taken control of the a wing a prison 
spokesman said two officers were injured he said and we sent 
in a cordon of officers to secure the perimeter 
at the stoke heath young offenders institution in central 
england 15 to 20 youths climbed onto the roof and 12 more refused 
to come out of the gymnasium police said the home office said 
firefighters extinguished bedding fires at the center which houses 
360 offenders under age 21 
at cardiff jail in wales about 130 of the prisons 205 inmates 
rioted smashing furniture breaking windows and setting bedding on 
fire a spokesman said 
at leeds jail in northern england prisoners staged a sitdown 
protest in their exercise yard sunday morning 
a handful of prisoners staged a similar protest at brixton jail 
in south london and three prison officers were treated in a 
hospital for cuts and bruises after they forced prisoners to return 
to their cells 
at a prison in hull in the northeast of england 110 prisoners 
tried to rush the compound gates after exercises guards restrained 
the inmates 
in an apparently minor incident at londons pentonville prison 
300 prisoners were evacuated when an inmate pulled a gas pipe from 
the wall 
i think the system has reached the point where it could well 
prove to collapse unless the problems that are endemic within the 
system are attended to very quickly said david evans general 
secretary of the prison officers association 
he said british penal institutions suffered from overcrowding 
staff shortages and poor conditions 
but mellor disagreed and said the unrest did not reflect 
deficiencies in the system but that something is fundamentally 
wrong with a number of prisoners 
a prison system will always been an unstable place because 
people are not sent to prison for behaving responsibly mellor 
said 
theyre sent to prison for behaving irresponsibly and some 
people alas will always continue to behave irresponsibly

excommunist milan kucan and 
conservative joze pucnik emerged sunday as the top candidates for 
slovenias presidency in the yugoslavian republics first free 
multiparty elections since 1945 
according to unofficial partial results kucan a candidate of 
the democratic renewal formerly the communists received 402 
percent of vote while pucnik of the centerright demos coalition 
won 268 percent 
election law requires a runoff on april 22 between the top two 
candidates when no one receives more than 50 percent 
im confident that i will win the runoff election pucnick 
said many slovenians link kucan to communism and that is a 
disadvatge for him 
independent candidate ivan kramberger and marko demsar of the 
liberal party received 215 and 105 percent respectively of the 
100000 votes counted 
kucan told reporters he hoped those who voted for kramberger and 
demsar will give their votes to him in the runoff 
about 75 percent of the 15 million registered voters 18 years 
and over also voted for 240 seats in the new multiparty parliament 
official results from the republics 4130 polls were not 
expected until tuesday 
turnout was heavy with voters lining up in front of the polling 
stations despite heavy rain 
louis sell a us embassy spokesman who is monitoring the 
elections along with four members of congress said the voting 
seems to be extremely fair 
high school teacher janez toncic said he was excited as he cast 
his ballot in ljubljana i never thought i would live to see the 
day when we bury singleparty monopoly in slovenia he said 
slovenia is the first of yugoslavias six republics to hold free 
elections 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces it is ruled by an eightman collective 
presidency 
communist leaders have allowed the formation of opposition 
parties in all of the republics but only croatia the 
secondlargest republic has also scheduled multiparty elections 
those elections are planned for april 
communist leaders in serbia the largest republic have demanded 
communist party dominance and have harshly criticized the reforms 
in slovenia 
yugoslavian president janez drnovsek a slovene said after 
voting in ljubljana that he hoped the country will have the first 
free elections for the federal parliament by the end of this year 
he said elections in slovenia represent a sign of the 
democracy drive that cannot be stopped in yugoslavia 
the main issue in the presidential campaign were slovenias 
future within the troubled yugoslav federation and high inflation 
kucan said the voting showed that slovenia was becoming a 
western european democracy 
it is a pleasure to see people vote freely after so many 
years kucan said slovenia is finally joining west european 
democracy 
kucans closest rival was pucnik a former dissident and leader 
of the demos a coalition of five prosecession centerright 
parties 
the main task of the demos is to oust communists from power in 
slovenia and make parliamentary democracy work in the republic 
pucnik told reporters while voting in his native slovenska bistrica 
pucnik a professor of philosophy spent seven years in 
slovenian prisons during the 1950s for his opposition to communism 
he was forced into exile after his release from prison and first 
returned to yugoslavia in 1989 
the makeup of the new slovenian parliament could decide whether 
the republic remains within yugoslavia 
most of the 17 parties taking part in the parliamentary 
elections urged yugoslavia to become a loose confederation but 
some rightist parties want quick secession 
slovenians are increasingly pushing to secede from yugoslavia 
because they are unhappy with the slow pace of democratic and 
economic reforms in the rest of the country 
slovenian reformminded communists have moved quickly over the 
past three years to create a pluralistic system in the republic and 
have shown considerable popularity in the electorate

the resignation of the land reform 
secretary raises doubts about president corazon aquinos commitment 
to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government 
criticized for lack of vision 
the controversy climaxed thursday with the resignation of 
secretarydesignate florencio abad 35 whose nomination was 
opposed by the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party 
handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies 
for which mrs aquino has been criticized lack of clear 
priorities tactical blundering and the strong influence of her 
relatives over national policy 
it also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her 
rhetoric mrs aquino does not share the deep commitment to social 
change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 people 
power uprising against the late ferdinand marcos 
the sincerity of corazon aquino is being seriously 
questioned wrote columnist ninez cachoolivares in the 
philippine daily inquirer land reform the centerpiece program 
of her administration is dead 
abads troubles began in february when he tried unsuccessfully 
to block the lease of government land in cavite province to japans 
marubeni corp for an industrial park 
although the deal was approved by the national development 
corp abad a former congressman said the land should be 
distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program 
the department of trade and industry said the marubeni deal was 
crucial to attracting muchneeded foreign investment for the 
governments industrialization program 
but the department of agrarian reform said if the cavite land 
was exempted hundreds of landlords would try to have their 
property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing 
title 
the presidential staff finally worked out a compromise under 
which farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement 
abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated orders from 
mrs aquino 
abads firm stand however alarmed landowners in congress who 
floated rumors in the press that the agrarian reform department was 
riddled with communists 
lawmakers on the commission on appointments who belong to the 
proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party blocked abads 
confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned 
despite the partys victory poltical damage to it and mrs 
aquino was considerable the manila press transformed abad into a 
folk hero depicting him as the champion of the farmer against 
political barons of the struggle of the democratic filipino party 
dubbed landlorddominated party 
worry not about abads destiny mrs president wrote 
columnist carol arguillas in the manila chronicle worry about 
yours and how you blew the last chance for liberal support 
mrs aquino pledged publicly to work for abads confirmation 
but her lobbying appeared ineffectual abads strongest opponents 
included politicians who consistently support mrs aquino leading 
to speculation she was not disappointed when he departed 
abads opponents included her younger brother rep jose 
peping cojuangco who wields considerable influence in 
government 
there is no way cory aquino will challenge peping said one 
western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
mrs aquino comes from a landlord family she and her brothers 
and sisters are partners in a 14500acre sugar plantation in 
tarlac province rather than break up the estate they used a legal 
option and created a profitsharing plan for the tenants 
the abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to the 
agrarian reform program once touted as the centerpiece of the 
administration 
last year agrarian reform secretary philip juico resigned after 
disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for 
marginal land 
his successor miriam defensor santiago was repeatedly rejected 
by the commission on appointments only to be reappointed until 
mrs aquino replaced her with abad on dec 31 
no reason for the change was given but mrs santiago claims she 
did not display sufficient public loyalty to mrs aquino during a 
coup attempt in early december 
agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking the 
power of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millions 
of peasants the program was advertised as essential in curbing the 
21yearold ruralbased marxist insurgency 
mrs aquino proclaimed a land reform program in 1987 but left 
details to congress the final bill contained so many prolandlord 
loopholes that several of its original sponsors including abad 
voted against it

democratic gubernatorial candidate jim mattox 
accused rival ann richards in an interview broadcast sunday of 
being treated for cocaine addiction 10 years ago the latest in a 
series of druguse accusations 
im saying that she used cocaine at the age of 46 and 
marijuana and she used other drugs mattox said in the interview 
broadcast on cbstvs face the nation the attorney general 
said he obtained the information from mutual friends he declined to 
identify 
ms richards phoned the program to deny shed ever sought 
treatment for cocaine use but declined to appear on the show 
a poll published sunday showed ms richards the state 
treasurer and mattox virtually deadlocked as they headed into 
tuesdays democratic runoff the winner will take on republican 
candidate clayton williams in the general election 
in appearances at innercity churches in houston and dallas the 
two candidates focused on their humble upbringings instead of the 
drug charges and countercharges that have dominated the campaign 
the appearance on face the nation marked the first time that 
mattox has accused ms richards of requiring treatment for drug 
use in 1980 she was treated at a minnesota clinic for alcoholism 
ms richards dismissed mattoxs charge saturday when word of 
the pretaped interview reached her 
jimmys just going nuts she said in henderson 
last week three people claimed they saw mattox smoke marijuana 
on separate occasions in the 1970s mattox denied the accusations 
ms richards has answered questions about illegal drug use by 
saying she has not used a moodaltering drug in 10 years 
she said sunday she was sorry the campaign had become so 
acrimonious but mattox said the campaigns bitterness would not 
carry past tuesday 
we will be together in november because we have a common enemy 
at that time and that will be clayton williams mattox said 
williams also appeared on face the nation and said he 
wasnt sure whether he would dwell on drug allegations against the 
democratic candidates 
theyve really worked it over with each other i dont see a 
place for me to pick on them he said im going to be talking 
about the real issues 
the poll published by the houston chronicle and the dallas 
morning news showed ms richards and mattox running virtually 
neckandneck 
of 759 democrats who said theyd vote in the runoff 44 percent 
backed ms richards and 38 percent mattox and 16 percent said they 
were undecided according to the poll the telephone survey by the 
university of houston had a margin of error of 4 percentage points 
meaning a shift in the results could put mattox ahead of ms 
richards 
in houston mattox told baptist congregations he had considered 
becoming a baptist preacher while attending baylor university 
but i guess the worldly things got the best of me said 
mattox who became a lawyer before becoming involved in politics 
he asked for help during the campaigns final days we must do 
more than just pray we must get out and do the work get out and 
vote mattox said 
at a predominantly black church in dallas ms richards said her 
election as governor would certainly be an announcement that 
times have changed in texas and when they open the door to me 
they open it to all of you as well 
im not here to tell you that i know what it is like to be 
denied opportunity because of my color she said but i am here 
to tell you i know what it is like to be denied opportunity and 
access to power and to the back room where decisions are made 
because i was born female

about 4000 volunteers dressed as union 
and confederate soldiers sunday marked the 125th anniversary of the 
end of the civil war by recreating the solemn surrender of gen 
robert e lees troops 
nearly 8000 spectators some wearing bonnets and hoopskirts 
from 1865 stood behind wooden fences along the old stage road 
through appomattox court house national historic park 
there was scattered applause and a few rebel yells as a man 
playing confederate gen john gordon rode a stocky chestnut horse 
in front of a column of rebel soldiers marching four abreast 
between union troops with shouldered arms 
after appomattox more than a month went by before the remaining 
confederate armies surrendered and a few isolated forces west of 
the mississippi river laid down their arms but historians agree 
that lees surrender to gen ulysses s grant ended the war between 
the states for all intents and purposes 
the reenactment took place in the isolated reconstructed 
central virginia village where the war ended after four devastating 
years most of the volunteers playing rebel and union men in 
uniform were grim 
its a solemn occasion said joe pitts of winstonsalem 
nc we dont particularly care for it and the troops back then 
didnt care for it 
one young confederate wept as he stacked his rifle in one of the 
teepeestyle piles along the dirt road winding through the regions 
rolling hills 
you get into what the soldiers felt back then said lake day 
of jacksonville fla to subject yourself to surrender is tough 
the volunteers said they were saddened this was the last major 
reenactment of the anniversary battles they have recreated during 
the past four years a few said they planned to quit the expensive 
hobby after this 
the reenactors ranged in age from preteens to septuagenarians 
and came from across the united states canada and europe 
pitts said they tried to depict the surrender at appomattox 
exactly as the ragged starving soldiers went through it 
it cant be totally correct we cant be emaciated like they 
were he said 
the reenactment also was a few days off and the sky was blue 
rather than gray 
the stacking of arms came on april 12 1865 exactly four years 
after the war started at fort sumter sc and three days after 
lee surrendered to gen grant at a private home on the edge of the 
village lees surrender was not reenacted 
terry daley of baltimore who played union gen joshua 
chamberlain said his order for his men to present arms as 27800 
confederate soldiers surrendered helped heal our wounds 
at the sound of a bugle chamberlain paid the highest tribute 
you can to an adversary it was to show we are brothers and 
americans daley said

exhausted firefighters braved 
metalmelting heat and poisonous smoke from a twodayold fire 
sunday to begin removing bodies of about 150 victims from the 
scandinavian star ferry 
firemen struggled to reach cabins where victims burned to death 
or suffocated in the suspicious blaze it began before dawn 
saturday while the ship was in the north sea carrying about 500 
tourists and crewmembers on an overnight trip from norway to demark 
the heat was so intense sunday that it melted aluminum aboard 
the bridge of the danishowned ship firefighters in masks and 
breathing equipment fought through one corridor until their gear 
started to burn said fire consultant olle wennstrom one 
firefighter was slightly injured he said 
firemen were seen leaving the ship in tears during the night 
each firefighting team underwent psychological care after being 
relieved officials said 
the fire spread early sunday from the gutted middle section to 
the captains bridge a few hours after the blackened ship was towed 
into port the blaze which finally was extinguished late sunday 
sent plumes of smoke over lysekil on swedens southwest coast 250 
miles southwest of stockholm the capital on the east coast 
tugboats doused the ship with water holes were blasted into the 
side of the 10500ton ship to allow the water to drain out for 
fear that the badly listing ship would topple onto the concrete 
dock 
officials with vrdano line the company in copenhagen that owns 
and operates the bahamianflagged ship say the blaze was caused by 
arson citing two fires that broke out at a short interval on two 
different decks 
district police chief roar onso revising earlier figures said 
345 people survived the fire which broke out about midway on the 
ships 10hour voyage from oslo to frederikshavn ferry captain 
hugo larsen told police of 395 passengers and 97 crewmen if his 
figure is correct 147 people died osno said 
in oslo police said six americans of a sevenmember 
entertainment troupe performing on the scandanavian star were were 
among the rescued a seventh member ruth rome 27 of east 
lansing mich was missing and presumed dead said rick qualls 
another member of the group from his oslo hotel room 
onso said a burned passenger list was found in the debris but 
did not tally with the captains account and its accuracy was 
unclear 
fortythree bodies were removed from the the ferry before 
operations were suspended for the night after a brief ceremony on 
the wharf the victims were placed in a refrigerated truck and 
driven to oslo for identification 
tickets were sold to car passengers according to the size of the 
car not the number of people each was carrying children traveling 
free would not appear on any passenger list 
firemen found corpses in the corridors and cabins a few drivers 
were found in their trucks on the car deck most victims were 
asphyxiated but some were charred beyond recognition 
it will be very difficult to identify the victims it will 
take a long time onso said 
onso confirmed reports that two fires broke out aboard the 
scandinavian star but he refused to speculate on how that fitted 
with claims that the fire was deliberately set 
one blaze started in a pile of sheets outside a cabin on a the 
car deck but was smothered by passengers he said a second fire 
started minutes later in a cabin one deck above the car deck and 
it was apparently this blaze that turned the ship into a floating 
deathtrap 
onso said it would take several days to begin an onsite 
investigation of possible arson a commission of inquiry would be 
set up to work parallel to a police probe 
the first bodies emerged from the ship in metal containers a 
memorial service was planned in oslos main cathedral on tuesday 
for the norwegians who comprised most of the casualties 
fiftytwo survivors who were picked up by a soviet freighter 
from lifeboats were kept in isolation under the care of 
psychiatrists in lysekil 45 miles north of goteborg 
relatives of the casualties began reaching the town of 8000 
people and also were assisted by teams of psychiatrists and nurses 
passengers accused the crew of being untrained and ill prepared 
for an emergency 
the danish seamens union issued a harsh condemnation of the 
behavior of the danish captain and crewmen who were mostly 
filipinos and portuguese it accused crewmen of abandoning ship 
before evacuating passengers 
danish seamen would not leave a burning ship as long as there 
were passengers on board said union chairman preben moller 
hansen 
passengers spoke of chaos as the fire spread through the ship 
and little help from the crew who could not communicate with them 
lifeboats were left dangling on the ship and life jackets were 
unavailable they said 
in another ferry disaster in burma one of only 25 survivors 
rescued from a ferry that sank with about 240 people aboard said 
the craft went down just minutes after a storm hit the 
governmentowned working peoples daily reported sunday 
the ferry capsized and sank in galeforce winds friday while 
carrying passengers on a southern burmese river between the towns 
of moulmein and kyondo official burmese radio reports say at least 
30 people drowned and 180 others are missing and feared dead 
the newspaper said the accident on the gyaing river was not due 
to overloading frequent ferry boat accidents in burma have been 
due to overloading of passengers and cargo

as ann richards and jim mattox near the 
finish in the democratic runoff for governor the issues have 
disappeared under a cloud of personal attacks focusing on 
accusations of illegal drug use by both candidates 
the only ones seeming to enjoy it were republicans who 
nominated oilmanrancher clayton williams last month in a landslide 
the democratic vegomatic primary is what i call it slice 
and dice said karl rove a consultant on the scale of more 
vicious campaigns this ranks near the top 
mattox who made an issue of ms richards refusal to answer 
questions about drug use more than a decade ago fended off 
allegations again saturday that he smoked marijuana in the 1970s 
jim mattox has never used any kind of dangerous drug ever 
he said in houston 
ms richards was virtually deadlocked with her rival before 
tuesdays runoff according to a poll in sundays editions of the 
dallas morning news and the houston chronicle the winner will face 
williams in the november election to succeed retiring gov bill 
clements the only republican governor in texas in the past 100 
years 
the poll showed ms richards backed by 44 percent of voters who 
said they plan to vote in tuesdays runoff with mattox drawing 38 
percent 16 percent undecided and 3 percent not supporting either 
candidate the poll of 759 voters by the center for public policy 
at the university of houston has a margin of error of plus or minus 
4 percentage pointsl 
as election day neared both candidates complained about the 
campaigns direction 
i feel badly for the electorate really that this campaign 
has taken this tone said ms richards 
we havent talked nearly enough about the issues in this 
campaign said mattox who described the race as a fullcontact 
sport 
a sampling 
mattox claimed to have witnesses who saw ms richards a 
recovering alcoholic use drugs but he wouldnt release their 
names or any proof ms richards said i dont know what hes 
talking about 
two newspapers reported allegations by a houston lawyer and 
former dallas policeman that they had seen mattox smoke marijuana 
on separate occasions in the 1970s mattox said get those two 
folks sit them right here with me ill tell them they are liars 
to their faces 
ms richards aired a television commercial showing a cartoon 
mattox figure hurling mud patties at a photo of her holding her 
granddaughter an announcer says hes at it again the same old 
politics mudslinging and negative campaigning 
mattox aired a commercial that asked without offering 
evidence did she use marijuana or something worse like cocaine 
not as a college kid but as a 47yearold elected official sworn to 
uphold the law 
ms richards said mattox had profited from public service and 
wanted to cover up a 200000 payment from a dallas developer 
indicted for racketeering she also ripped mattoxs refusal to 
disclose his income tax returns 
mattox charged that the richards campaign was peddling their 
smut and their dirt because she didnt want to discuss issues and 
wouldnt face him in a debate before the election 
former gov mark white defeated in the march 13 primary said 
hed never vote for ms richards because of behavior that would 
make nazi war criminal heinrich himmler blush but he withheld 
his endorsement from mattox 
rove said the democrats had opened doors for williams 
theyve raised issues in the primary that may or may not have 
been raised in the general election said rove but now they 
can be raised without the shrillness and viciousness that might 
have been there otherwise 
in her campaign ms richards 56 the state treasurer offered 
a vision of what she called the new texas 
she said her priorities as governor would be education the 
economy ethics in government and protection of the environment 
she pointed to her record as a moneymaking treasurer 
mattox 46 pointed to his record of public service as a dallas 
county prosecutor congressman and twoterm attorney general 
he also offered what he said was the only hope for improved 
education and law enforcement without a tax increase a state 
lottery 
many of the candidates comments dwelled on each others tactics 
mattox on his rival i said i was concerned about the 
political cannibalism that was taking place we made a good effort 
try to get ann richards to step back away from that approach to 
politics 
ms richards on hers i really thought when mattox began all 
this drug stuff for the provocation of it the sort of witch 
hunt that he was on i just thought the whole thing was sick i 
still do regardless of who theyre talking about

but it remained uncertain if the party would win the outright 
majority that would enable it to break the countrys political 
deadlock without help from outside its ranks 
returns showed new democracy which barely missed majorities in 
the inconclusive elections last june and november had won at least 
150 of the 300 seats in parliament 
party leader constantine mitsotakis said his party was assured 
of only 150 seats but he declared victory anyway and said he 
believed he would form a government wednesday 
in todays elections the greek people decided they gave the 
victory to new democracy he said i feel great responsibility 
and we celebrate our victory 
mitsotakis said he didnt yet know if his party had won 150 or 
151 seats but was sure that he would be given the mandate to form a 
government 
caretaker interior minister theodore katrivanos told reporters 
early monday that new democracy was close to an outright majority 
in the 300member singlehouse parliament 
new democracy has 150 seats with the possibility of gaining 
more and only a slight possibility of getting less said 
katrivanos who based his comments on official returns 
two major independent athens television stations declared new 
democracy the winner saying their projections showed the 
conservatives would win 151 to 152 seats the declarations sparked 
early morning horn honking fireworks and wild street celebrations 
in the capital by flagwaving party loyalists 
returns from 15870 of 16584 polling stations showed new 
democracy with 471 percent of the vote compared to 386 for 
former premier andreas papandreous panhellenic socialist movement 
pasok 1007 percent for the communistled alliance of leftist 
parties and 42 percent for small parties and independents 
new democracy which got 4619 percent of the vote and 148 seats 
in novembers election needed only about a 1 percent increase its 
vote to win a majority sunday 
pasok and the communistled alliance which were not considered 
strong enough to win outright worked together to try to prevent a 
conservative victory and to forge their own coalition government 
papandreou criticized mitsotakis in his only comments early 
monday but did not concede defeat saying the distribution of seats 
in crucial areas was hard to judge 
id like to stress that mr mitsotakis has led the country to 
three consecutive elections in pursuit of selfsufficiency trying 
to set the dilemma before the people of government or no 
government instead of posing the question of which government with 
which policy he said these elections were the last thing 
needed by our country 
pasok will wage its battle both inside and outside of 
parliament defending the peoples national and economic issues 
papandreou said early monday 
miltiades evert a top new democracy official and former athens 
mayor said projections that showed the conservatives had won at 
least 150 seats meant new democracy was in control and could 
prevent any coalition by other parties 
it is certain that new democracy has 150 seats and new 
democracy now controls political developments without new 
democracy nothing can be done he told greek television 
the political deadlock has been hard to break in greece where 
party loyalty often translates into jobs and loans both pasok and 
the conservatives have governed greece since the military 
dictatorship ended in 1974 but big changes in party totals are 
difficult to achieve 
the deadlock itself has become an issue because the weak 
coalitions formed after the june and november elections were unable 
to cope with a foundering economy and a resurgence of political 
terrorism 
i believe the greek people have realized that the crisis the 
country is going through is a fundamental and dangerous one said 
constantine karamanlis the sixterm former conservative premier 
and oneterm president who led greece back to democracy after 
military rule 
greece faces severe economic problems the budget deficit has 
soared to 156 billion and the inflation rate the highest in the 
common market hit 178 percent last month 
in june voters rejected the scandaltainted pasok government of 
papandreou but denied a majority to 71yearold conservative leader 
constantine mitsotakis 
a conservativecommunist coalition formed after the june 
election and it indicted papandreou and some of his ministers on 
corruption charges 
no trial date has been set however and the charismatic former 
premier remains a political force despite the indictment health 
problems and an open affair with dimitri liani a former airline 
hostess half his age whom he married after divorcing his american 
wife of 38 years 
the weak coalition governments that ruled following the june and 
november elections also postponed decisions on a us extradition 
request for a palestinian wanted for the bombing of an airliner in 
1982 over hawaii and on a new military bases agreement with the 
united states 
the four us military bases in greece could close in november 
unless a new agreement is reached with washington two of the four 
bases already have been slated for closure by the pentagon in 
costcutting measures

voters choosing hungarys first freely 
elected government in 43 years gave an overwhelming victory sunday 
to hungarys main conservative party according to final unofficial 
results 
it was the second conservative sweep in eastern europe in as 
many free elections east germans gave conservatives a clear 
victory in elections on march 18 relegating the communists to an 
opposition role 
in hungary democratic forum president jozsef antall declared 
i am completely certain that we won the elections 
but it is not we but the hungarian people who have won these 
elections he said to jubilant supporters crowding party 
headquarters six hours after polls closed 
he turned 58 sunday and a rare smile creased his face as he was 
presented with a gigantic boquet of flowers 
final official results for the 261 parliamentary seats at stake 
in runoff elections sunday were not expected before tuesday the 
results were combined with elections held march 25 for a total of 
386 seats in the 394member parliament eights seats will be 
allocated based on minority representation 
the national vote counting center reporting unofficial results 
show the conservative hungarian democratic forum winning 427 
percent of the vote that gave the party 165 seats after both 
rounds 
their closest rivals the liberal alliance of free democrats 
won 238 percent of the vote or a total of 92 seats 
the free democrats want to quickly scrap hungarys command 
economy in favor of a market economy the forum emphasizes 
traditional christian values and cautious economic change 
the agrarianbased smallholders party won 43 districts with 111 
percent of the vote while reform communists grouped in the 
socialist party had won 33 with 855 percent 
the federation of young democrats and the christian democrats 
won 21 seats with 54 percent of the vote each 
the other 11 seats were divided among six independents four 
candidates supported by several parties and a candidate of the 
splinter agrarian federation 
direct voting sunday determined 171 of the 261 seats at stake 
ninety seats will be determined on the voting percentage each party 
receives 
the early conservative advantage forced a concession from free 
democrat leader miklos haraszti 
it is clear that the hdf will gain the most seats he said 
elections two weeks ago left 261 of the national assemblys 394 
seats undecided that balloting gave no party an outright majority 
but relegated the former communists to fourth place 
no party was considered strong enough to win a majority in 
sundays polling and a coalition government was expected more than 
75 million people were eligible to vote 
both frontrunning parties the democratic forum and the free 
democrats have refused to consider forming a government with the 
former communists 
most polls closed at 6 pm after 12 hours of voting state 
television began its 24hour election program two hours later with 
preliminary estimates of a more than 40 percent turnout nationwide 
indicating that more than 325 million people voted 
many hungarians seemed weary after the second round of balloting 
in two weeks 
its clear that people have become tired interim president 
matyas szueros told reporters before casting his ballot its 
time to end the election process 
the voting was generally uneventful with few irregularities 
reported 
in debrecen about 90 miles west of the capital of budapest 
several polling stations did not open on time because supervisory 
officials were late state radio reported 
one station first opened at 9 am three hours past schedule 
the radio said the delay was caused by the chief supervisor who 
called in to say he would be late because he was tired 
voters at a polling station in budapest shook out umbrellas 
after walking in from the rain and many clutched pussy willows 
symbolic in hungary of easter 
many said they were enthusiastic about voting in the national 
elections but others appeared skeptical that a new government 
would be able to solve hungarys severe economic problems that 
include a declining living standard doubledigit inflation 
growing unemployment and a 20 billion foreign debt 
im here im voting but i dont have any confidence in it 
said ernoe horvath a 61year old retiree even now we dont have 
people running that we can trust 
the first round of elections on march 25 put the hungarian 
democratic forum and the liberal alliance of free democrats in the 
lead but neither party polled a majority forcing sundays second 
round 
the socialists were unique among ruling soviet bloc parties in 
leading their country to democracy without massive popular 
pressure but most people associate the party with the excesses of 
43 years of communist rule 
the free democrats have warmed in recent weeks to the 
possibility of a coalition with the democratic forum 
but the forum has said it will only join forces with the free 
democrats in a national emergency 
antall refused to comment when asked sunday about the 
possibility of a coalition government with the free democrats 
but free democrat leader janos kis said that a grand coalition 
is a distinct possibility which we dont refuse because we are 
for having a government with wide popular support

celebrated novelist mario vargas llosa won the 
first round of presidential elections sunday but he fell far short 
of the majority needed to avoid a runoff according to unofficial 
projections 
rebels trying to sabotage the elections attacked some polling 
stations in lima with dynamite sunday but no one was reported 
injured weekend guerrilla violence in peru killed at leaast 28 
people and wounded 44 authorities said 
the maoist shining path has assassinated six congressional 
candidates and killed or wounded dozens of other people in recent 
weeks aiming to disrupt the election 
vargas llosa 54 of the centerright democratic front 
coalition has run on a freemarket ticket he said the results 
showed voters had rejected leftist policies and the governing 
leftofcenter aprista party for its catastrophic five years in 
government 
the countrys political panorama has changed profoundly with 
this election he said 
the novelist captured 368 percent of the vote based on results 
from an exit poll by apoyo a market research firm 
apoyo said alberto fujimori the son of japanese immigrants was 
in second place in its projections with 267 percent fujimori is a 
political independent who was virtually unknown to peruvian voters 
as recently as a month ago 
peruvian public opinion projected 331 percent as vargas llosas 
final tally and 262 percent for fujimori 
apoyo one of perus most respected polling firms said its 
results were based on the initial 54 percent of its total 
interviews done nationwide it said that was a big enough sample to 
project a final vote 
the market research firm also said aprista party candidate luis 
alva castro had 132 percent of the votes in its projections it 
said henry pease candidate of the united left had 7 percent while 
alfonso barrantes candidate of the socialist left 4 percent 
the rest of the votes were spread among four minor party 
candidates and blank or nullified votes according to apoyo 
officials returns are not expected for weeks 
the peruvian public opinion poll had similar figures for the 
other candidates 
at a news conference vargas llosa proposed that he and fujimori 
meet to discuss ways to avoid a second election saving peru from 
the turmoil of two more months of campaigning 
fujimori arrived minutes later at the news conference and 
congratulated vargas llosa but at a later news conference he 
rejected any possibility of stepping aside to avoid a runoff 
i believe a second round is necessary to debate our 
proposals he said the verdict should be the publics 
during the campaign vargas llosa has sharply attacked the 
aprista party and the two leftist alliances he is unlikely to have 
their support in the runoff 
in contrast fujimori has run a conciliatory campaign without 
attacks he is believed to have support within the aprista party 
the left is not going to support the democratic front because 
of the polarization that has been generated in the country 
fujimori said in a news conference after polls closed at 5 pm 
the campaign has brought a surge in popularity for fujimori 
last week fujimori 51 rose into second place in voter surveys 
displacing alva castro 48 
the peruvian public opionion projections of the final vote also 
indicated the democratic front would win only 23 seats in the 
60seat senate and 63 seats in the 180seat chamber of deputies 
that would make it very difficult for vargas llosa 54 to 
impose the severe austerity measures he has pledged if he wins he 
says radical economic reforms are needed to revive perus moribund 
economy and turn peru into a modern nation free of the 
socialist policies he says have stiffled growth for two decades 
inflation is running at more than 2000 percent annually 
voters are choosing a president to replace populist alan garcia 
whose fiveyear term ends july 28 he is legally ineligible to 
serve a consecutive term 
during sundays voting soldiers armed with automatic weapons 
protected polling stations against terrorist attacks 
leftist guerrillas exploded sticks of dynamite near two polling 
stations early sunday in downtown lima and an outlying shantytown 
police said the explosions caused no damage and no one was injured 
the government said nearly 80000 policemen were on alert 
throughout the country more than 200000 army troops were 
providing security in the countrys mountainous emergency zones 
where guerrillas are most active

municipal buildings and sacked stores killing 17 peasants and 
wounding 13 in the mountain village of santo thomas de pata about 
18 miles northwest of ayacucho

blast in the town of huasquis about 100 miles east of lima 
in lima where onethird of perus voters live police patrolled 
the streets in armored vehicles and diverted traffic around the 
capitals 15837 polling stations 
people entering voting stations were searched for weapons the 
government asked voters to go to the polls emptyhanded to 
facilitate searches 
fear of rebel attacks paralyzed bus traffic between towns in 
mountainous insurgency zones but election officials said voter 
turnout was heavy despite threats by the shining path guerrilla 
group to kill voters and candidates 
television stations showed lines of voters up to five blocks 
long in huancayo in the andes 120 miles east of lima huancayo a 
major trading center is a shining path stronghold 
in some areas of the country election officials suspended the 
requirement that voters dip their index fingers into indelible ink 
after casting ballots the guerrillas have killed highland peasants 
and cut off their hands as a warning not to vote 
voters leaving polling stations sunday morning in the 
workingclass neighborhood of la victoria expressed support mainly 
for fujimori and vargas llosa who put aside his writing two years 
ago to campaign for the presidency 
mariana pino de grecia a housewife said she voted for vargas 
llosa 
the country needs someone known internationally to attract 
aid fujimori is not known he doesnt have a plan of government 
and hes too new she said 
but taxi driver angel torres said he voted for fujimori 
lets see what fujimori can do he said the others are 
old politicians hes more honorable harderworking

gasoline prices rose an average of 235 cents 
a gallon over the past two weeks as spring vacationers took to the 
road a survey released has concluded 
the lundberg survey of 13000 gas stations nationwide completed 
on friday and released sunday put the national average price for a 
gallon of gas at 11331 cents the average covers all grades of 
gas types of service and all taxes 
price rises were especially high in the midwest survey chief

distribution costs to the midwest may have contributed to the price 
increases

lagged behind gains in wholesale prices lundberg said the average 
wholesale posting for a gallon of gas not including rebates and 
other price breaks was 7535 cents a gallon for the same twoweek 
period a 35 cent increase over the last survey she said 
here are the lundberg survey average prices 
selfservice stations regular unleaded 10153 cents a 
gallon premium unleaded 11877 cents regular leaded 10058 cents 
fullservice stations regular unleaded 12947 cents a

sales are at selfservice stations
