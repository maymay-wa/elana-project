about 50 members of a roman catholic parish held 
a mass outside their shuttered church while cars and trucks whizzed 
by but a spokesman for their archdiocese said their ceremony was 
just a stunt 
they locked us out said sandy simun a member of mother of 
our saviour church in northwest detroit for 14 years we need our 
church 
mother of our saviour was one of 30 detroit parishes with 
dwindling congregations that were ordered closed by cardinal edmund 
szoka to save money the move sparked hot criticism from some 
catholics who argued that it was discriminatory to close 
innercity churches the churches were told to close by june 30 and 
some have already done so 
mother of our saviour had 57 member families 
some members of mother of our saviour gathered sunday to protest 
the action with a service led by the rev arthur lovely from sts 
peter and paul church 
there should not have been a mass there said jay berman a 
spokesman for the 15millionmember archdiocese of detroit that 
parish has a pastor and administrator who determined that there 
would be no further sacramental activity 
its regrettable that another priest decided to come and say 
mass there 
berman declined to say if any action would be taken against 
lovely he called the service a stunt to gain media attention for 
protesters of szokas decision earlier this year to close the 
parishes 
among those attending the service was sister beth rindler who 
was fired as a pastoral associate at the church last week for 
refusing to turn over to the archdiocese 7000 contributed by 
church members she said the money belongs to the parish and not 
the archdiocese 
we do not have a situation as sister has made out where the 
money belongs to the people berman said it goes into the 
custody of the pastor and to a much smaller part the bishop to 
use in the works of the church the whole church 
simun 59 said he was willing to fight 
theyve raped us of our church and now theyre trying to rob 
us of our money simun said i have a right to revolt it hurts 
so deep 
were going to have church out here till they jail us 
since the closings plan was announced szokas residence has 
been picketed by protesters 
church officials said the closings were needed because the 
citys roman catholic population has fallen from 100000 to fewer 
than 50000 
an additional 25 churches have been given until next year to 
prove their viability

gator gawkers have been gathering at two dallas 
suburbs to see the creatures known more for their swamp escapades 
than for carousing through texas 
big reptiles spotted in irving and plano have created quite a 
stir in recent weeks the latest rage are tshirts and special 
drinks such as the gatorade served at an area bar 
but texas alligators which trek the 250 miles up the trinity 
river from the gulf of mexico are certainly not new to the area 
and are more abundant in dallas county than most think said an 
official of the dallas museum of natural history 
richard fullington deputy director of the museum said recent 
discoveries of gators in irving and plano reminded him of an 
incident in 1987 when residents of southeast dallas believed that 
some kind of greenskinned swamp creatures inhabited a gravel pit 
we got calls from people out there they were in a panic 
fullington recalled one statement was that there was a 
threetoed martian out there eating dogs 
well how about alligators instead 
lately a 5footlong alligator has been lurking in the murky 
depths of lake carolyne in the las colinas development at suburban 
irving 
and on wednesday animalcontrol workers in plano caught an 
alligatorlike reptile in a pond

the right to a job and decent housing should be 
as basic as the right to free speech officials within one of the 
nations largest mainline protestant denominations have declared in 
a proposed economic bill of rights to the us constitution 
picking up where the national conference of catholic bishops 
left off three agencies within the 17 millionmember united 
church of christ are asking the church to work for a constitutional 
amendment to guarantee every american a minimum income meaningful 
employment and affordable housing 
the proposed pronouncements to be voted on by several hundred 
clergy and lay delegates to the 17th general synod in fort worth 
texas represent the unfinished work of the american 
experiment according to audrey chapman of the uccs office for 
church and society 
the synod runs from june 29 to july 4 
others within the nations fifthlargest mainline protestant 
denomination characterize the economic proposals as unrealistic an 
example of a church bureaucracy out of touch with its predominantly 
uppermiddleclass constituency 
support for such proposals can be found primarily in the left 
wing of the democratic party or the socialist party said w 
widick schroeder a professor of religion and society at the 
chicago theological seminary 
this is not the first time the denomination has tackled 
capitalism 
in 1934 in the midst of the depression the general council of 
the congregational christian churches one of the forerunners of 
the church of christ condemned capitalism and voted 13017 to 
work toward the abolition of the economic system the general 
council disclaimed the resolution in 1952 five years before the 
denomination merged with the evangelical and reformed church to 
form the ucc 
the national conference of catholic bishops has been the most 
recent dramatic entrant into the discussion over religion and the 
economy drawing fire from individuals such as former treasury 
secretary william simon with its proposal that every person should 
have the right to a job 
the united church of christ proposal would take the catholic 
idea a step further by calling for a constitutional amendment 
in its proposed pronouncement on christian faith and economic 
life the office for church and society of the ucc is proposing 
that the church work for such an amendment to guarantee such 
rights as a national health program a national minimum income 
and a right to employment consistent with each persons 
potential including a role for the government as employer of last 
resort 
the proposal was judged too conservative by some groups too 
radical by others 
a separate pronouncement recommended by the commission for 
racial justice and the council for racial and ethnic ministries 
seeks the same constitutional guarantees but adds a call for a 
transformation of the capitalist economic system 
in an effort to present a united front representatives of the 
three sponsoring groups recently developed a proposed compromise 
pronouncement that adds some data showing how minorities bear an 
unequal burden of poverty and unemployment but drops the 
anticapitalist language of the original pronouncement submitted by 
the groups representing minorities in the church the 
denominations pension boards which oversee 800 million in church 
investments share a different perspective 
schroeder who worked on a report to synod delegates by the 
pension boards called the proposed economic bill of rights 
utopian and unworkable he argued that greater government 
intervention will promote inefficiency leading to fewer resources 
and greater strife over the distribution of wealth 
but rebecca blank one of the creators of the bill of rights 
proposal said the united states unlike some developing nations 
has the means to provide for all its citizens 
i think its almost entirely an issue of political will in 
this country said ms blank a professor of economics and public 
affairs at princeton university

boy of the year high school honors 
graduate athletic standout harvard scholar jose luis razo was a 
barrio youth who made good 
now hes standing trial for a string of armed robberies that 
coincided with his college breaks or vacations and blaming drugs 
delusion and a boyhood friend for the holdups and the case against 
him 
jurors must decide if razo is a guiltwracked victim of his 
success or as the prosecutor charges a cocky liar who has 
been taking people for a ride for a long time 
razo 22 is on trial in orange county on 10 counts of robbery 
and one of escape the case is expected to go to the jury by next 
week 
hes also set to go on trial soon in los angeles county where 
he is charged with three counts of robbery and six of assault with 
a deadly weapon 
razo moved to california with his family in the late 1960s as a 
youngster he was an altar boy police describe him as a former 
gang member but family and friends remember him as a boys club 
boy of the year 
he went from a struggling background to the epitome of success 
for a young man said richard guthrie director of the la habra 
boys club 
at servite high school a roman catholic school in anaheim razo 
was an a student and standout football player wooed by over 60 
colleges around the country when he graduated 
he chose a scholarship to harvard university where hispanics 
represent only 47 percent of the student body 
as a freshman in 1985 he set out to study psychology and talked 
of becoming a lawyer 
he always said look how good im doing im mexican im 
trying to make it in a white world his sister martha said in 
july 1987 hes out to prove to people that hes as smart as 
anyone 
in december 1985 a masked man started robbing fastfood 
restaurants grocery stores and dairies in southern california the 
holdups netted the gunman more than 27000 and coincided with 
trips razo made to california 
when razo called police in june 1987 to say he had information 
on an unrelated crime he was questioned about the robberies 
when pressed he confessed 
it wasnt razos first runin with police at 17 he was 
convicted of petty theft a few months later he was charged with 
assault although that case was dismissed 
his videotaped confession became the cornerstone of the robbery 
prosecution motions to get the confession thrown out failed 
in a jailhouse interview after his arrest razo said i wasnt 
taking money from anybody that really really needed it i did the 
crime ill do the time 
about his life at harvard he said i didnt fit i was 
confused 
later free on 100000 bail razo claimed he used the stolen 
money to help his poor family and needy friends they said they 
never saw it in fact his sister said my mom always sent him 
money she wouldnt pay bills to send him money 
in court razo pleaded innocent and said he had confessed in a 
druginduced stupor during which he accepted blame for the crimes 
because he felt guilty about being successful while his family and 
friends were not 
he testified that the holdups were committed by a childhood 
friend and drug dealer richard longoria he said longoria had 
described the robberies to him in detail 
in hindsight i now see that i was feeling very guilty about 
my harvard experience my comfortable lifestyle razo testified 
wednesday i was feeling alienated from my family at home and 
mexicans in general 
i wanted to be accepted in a normal everyday type of way in 
terms of the neighborhood and friends i had known i was wanting to 
truly identify with richard longoria 
deputy district attorney ravi mehta and razos attorney john 
barnett have been trying to locate longoria but barnett said he 
wasnt sure if longorias testimony could help the defense mehta 
said it wouldnt make any difference

diana simek loves her children but she 
doesnt want louisianas forced heirship laws to determine who 
inherits her property so she and her husband moved across the 
border to texas 
our children will inherit everything after were both gone 
mrs simek said but if i go first i would want my husband to 
have full control over what we built together 
forced heirship is a oneofakind louisiana law that decrees 
that children must inherit a portion of their parents estate in 
the 49 other states people who have the proper will drawn up can 
leave their legacies to anyone or anything 
louisiana is the only state that bases its statutes on the 
napoleonic code which originated in france under its laws an 
only child is entitled to onefourth of the deceased parents 
estate no matter what either parent wants two or more children 
divide half of the estate equally 
such laws were conceived in contrast to primogeniture the 
tradition of giving everything to the eldest son and helped break 
up large land holdings 
state sen sydney nelson has tried for 10 years to repeal forced 
heirship 
it deprives louisiana residents of the freedoms enjoyed by 
citizens of all other states to dispose of their property as they 
choose nelson said other states do have laws protecting 
spouses but ours is the only state that gives the children a right 
to demand a certain percentage of their estate 
but cynthia samuel a tulane university law professor said 
louisiana needs forced heirship more today than it did 30 years ago 
because of divorce and remarriage 
i think our present law tells a very admirable story about us 
it says we respect the moral bond between parent and children that 
lasts a lifetime samuel said its the last act by which the 
parent expresses regard for the people he brought into the world 
mrs simek 50 and her husband leonard 54 lived in 
shreveport for nine years before seeking refuge in harrison county 
texas a 30minute drive from shreveport where they still work 
under texas law if i die he gets everything mrs simek 
said 
their three children ages 29 30 and 31 all live in louisiana 
our taxes are much higher in texas mrs simek said if 
they ever change the law well move back 
nelson said lots of people in the shreveportbossier city area 
in northwestern louisiana have left because of the law especially 
outofstaters who end up there because of barksdale air force base 
many people come to this area to retire after being at 
barksdale nelson said but if youve once enjoyed the freedom 
to leave everything to your wife and children and you find out 
your children can demand a fourth or half of your property people 
are incensed 
people who believe children dont deserve an inheritance did get 
a little more room to maneuver four years ago when the state 
expanded the reasons for which a parent can disinherit a child 
until that time it was reported that only two children had been 
disinherited in 170 years 
now there are 12 sins of the children including failing to 
pay ransom for kidnapped parents refusing to bail them out of 
jail striking or attempting to murder a parent or failing to 
contact the parent for two years 
nelson and others have managed to chip away at the law in other 
ways too 
spouses of the deceased are permitted to have use of community 
property until he or she dies or remarries however a portion of 
separate property continues to be passed along to direct 
descendants immediately if there is no will

police elsewhere said the number of looting incidents had 
diminished 
political uncertainty has fueled the economic crisis and

here is the text of president bushs 
remarks upon arrival sunday evening at brussels international 
airport for the nato summit 
it is really a pleasure to be back once again in brussels and 
im especially pleased that my first visit as president of the 
united states comes as the nations of nato celebrate 40 years of 
alliance and the longest period of peace and freedom that europe 
has known in the modern age 
americans and belgians share the memories of war and hardwon 
peace in this century 
flanders the battle of ardennes bastogne those names are 
part of our history as well as your own part of our shared 
heritage of freedom and the sacrifices it requires 
belgium no stranger to conquest and division recognized from 
the first the importance of alliance in the postwar world and 
today as permanent home to nato and the european community 
brussels stands at the center of a europe free at peace and 
prosperous as never before a europe that is steadily moving 
towards a single market and unprecedented political and economic 
opportunities 
in brussels the signs of this european renaissance are 
everywhere belgium has been a good friend and a valued ally one 
that has always acted with alliance interests in mind early in 
this decade belgium was one of five nato nations that made the 
difficult decision to base inf systems on its own soil and those 
deployments gave us the leverage that we needed to negotiate the 
first ever nuclear arms reduction treaty indeed one that banned an 
entire generation of nuclear weapons 
thats the kind of courageous and realistic approach that 
explains natos success nato is at once ready to ensure the common 
defense and to reduce arms and seek to diminish tensions with the 
east 
as ive said a number of times we seek to move to a policy 
beyond containment we want to see an end to the division of europe 
and we want to see it ended on the basis of western values we will 
join western european nations in encouraging the process of change 
in the soviet union pointing to the day when the soviet union will 
be welcomed as a constructive participant in the community of free 
nations 
im looking forward to important discussions with the king of 
the belgians king baudouin and the nato heads of government i 
look forward as well to my meeting with prime minister martens 
my friend my discussions also with mr delors of the european 
community and secretary general woerner at nato 
the future of nato depends on the alliances ability to deal 
with our enduring security concerns and our evolving economic 
relationship we look to belgium to continue to play its important 
role in our close and cooperative transatlantic partnership i am 
delighted to be back and thank you mr prime minister for this 
warm welcome

us officials on the eve of the nato summit 
reiterated the administrations belief that an agreement on 
conventional forces should take precedence over reducing the number 
the number of shortrange nuclear weapons in west germany and the 
warsaw pact 
but the officials defense secretary dick cheney and secretary 
of state james a baker iii also said they believed the alliance 
could have a successful summit without a resolution of the nuclear 
weapons issue 
shortrange nuclear forces are an essential part of the 
deterrent cheney said on cbstvs face the nation a sunday 
news program they ought to stay there while we focus on 
conventional armaments after weve dealt with the conventional 
problem then we can come back and talk about shortrange forces 
i dont think theres any magic about having to resolve it at 
the end of may of 1989 
chancellor helmut kohl has been warning against a delay in talks 
between the superpowers over the nuclear weapons with ranges of 300 
miles or less 
baker appearing on nbctvs meet the press said president 
bush is willing to negotiate with the soviet union on reducing the 
number of nuclear weapons but he does not feel any pressure to 
resolve the problem during this weeks 16nation meeting 
the president has already acknowledged at least the principle 
of negotiations although he feels very very strongly that before 
you can talk about that or get into that you need to see a 
conventional forces agreement baker said 
the united states has pushed for modernization of the lance 
missiles while west germany has urged superpower negotiations to 
reduce the weapons located on german soil 
us officials now say they are amenable to talks with the 
soviets at an unspecified date but the united states and britain 
still say those negotiations should not take place while the warsaw 
pact nations remain superior in conventional forces the dispute 
has created a rift within the nato alliance 
kohl on saturday said ussoviet negotiations on the 
shortrange weapons cannot be postponed into the distant future 
we are the frontline country in nato it is clear that we should 
be speaking up for our interests 
national security adviser brent scowcroft interviewed on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley said elimination of the 
shortrange weapons would undermine nato strategy because the 
weapons are there in part to make up for the conventional 
imbalance that has existed since the foundation of nato 
while the western alliancess shortrange missile launchers are 
based primarily on west german soil the warsaw pact has 
shortrange weapons in east germany poland czechoslovakia and 
hungary 
according to western estimates the soviet union has 1450 
shortrange nuclear missile launchers while nato has 88 the 
soviets are said to have some 3000 missiles of various types that 
could be used on their launchers while nato has 700 lance 
singlewarhead missiles 
overall according to nato figures the soviets have 6260 
nuclear artillery systems compared to 2700 for the alliance

atampt and its unions are touting a contract 
agreement that boosts wages and pension payments while providing 
such family related benefits as six months of leave to care for 
either newborn children or sick parents and a 5 million fund for 
child care 
we realized our people have to balance work and family life if 
they are really going to make a contribution atampt senior vice 
president harold burlingame said sunday after the company and 
unions reached agreement on threeyear contracts covering 160000 
workers 
morton bahr president of the communications workers of america 
said the agreement features an unprecedented breakthrough in 
labormanagement relations with respect to family care 
bahr was also speaking on behalf of the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers the second union covered by the 
agreement 
both sides agreed to extend the talks beyond the midnight 
saturday deadline the contract must now be ratified by the unions 
rank and file 
among concessions were an agreement by the unions to amend 
several job classifications in atampts favor and to forgo 
costofliving adjustments the company agreed to limits on the use 
of temporary workers 
highlights of the agreement include 
six months parental leave after the birth of a child with 
employment and seniority guaranteed and all medical insurance paid 
by the company those same leave and benefit provisions would cover 
workers who take time off to care for a sick parent 
a 5 million childcare fund jointly administered by the 
company and unions to support new and existing child care centers 
in regions of the country where union members report difficulty 
obtaining services 
up to 2000 from atampt to workers to help cover the costs of 
adoption 
the contracts also contain a 12 percent benefits increase for 
new pensioners a 5 percent increase in payments for existing 
pensions effective jan 1 1991 and a new system to assist workers 
seeking transfers or looking for work elsewhere in the company when 
existing jobs are eliminated 
union workers also for the first time will share in atampts 
annual profits receiving 25 percent a year the unions said that 
amount would average 700 per person a year based on atampts 1988 
performance 
also atampt joined with the unions in forming a committee that 
will lobby for legislative and policy changes designed to curb 
soaring health care costs 
the health plan premiums remain fully paid by the company and 
the plan retains 100 percent coverage for most services 
however the agreement does make it more likely that more 
workers will reach the existing 150 annual deductible by exempting 
more medical services from socalled first dollar coverage 
and the agreement provides that workers will have to pay higher 
deductibles and fees if they choose a physician who charges more 
than those on a list of preferred providers who agree to a fee 
structure negotiated with the company 
the contracts are the result of the largest singleemployer 
collective bargaining this year they likely will have a 
significant impact on contract talks this summer with the socalled 
baby bells formed after the 1984 atampt breakup and other 
regional phone companies in all 500000 union workers are 
affected by those contracts 
the national agreement provides operations employees primarily 
operators technicians clerical and administrative staff an 
immediate 4 percent pay increase an additional 25 percent in the 
second year of the contract and 225 percent in the final year 
manufacturing workers would receive an 8 percent lump sum 
payment after ratification and those in skilled trades would get an 
additional 50centsanhour all manufacturing workers would 
receive base wage increases of 35 percent in the second year of 
the contract and 3 percent in the third 
members of the cwa who make up more than 75 percent of the atampt 
workers from the two unions currently receive a weekly base pay 
ranging from 230 to 589 
it was the first time cwa and ibew negotiated jointly an 
agreement reached two years after a bitter dispute between the 
unions sparked by ibews decision not to honor a 26day cwa strike 
in 1986

with house speaker jim wright and one of his 
top lieutenants on the way out democrats face a week of scrambling 
to reshuffle their leadership and to reimpose a sense of mission on 
a floundering chamber 
when lawmakers return from their memorial day recess they will 
face one certain resignation that of majority whip tony coelho 
dcalif and another that is near certain that of texas democrat 
wright 
it is unprecedented for such a turnover propelled by concerns 
about ethics to take place in the middle of a legislative session 
the turmoil only adds to congress woes over what has so far been a 
lackluster year 
it will be up to rep tom foley dwash the majority leader 
and heirapparent to wright to turn the disarray into order and to 
refocus attention on the institutions primary tasks dealing with 
the budget deficit and with legislation ranging from the 
environment to social issues 
wright himself spent the weekend in seclusion believed to be 
drafting a message defending himself before stepping down as 
speaker further pressure on wright was created by the surprise 
resignation announced saturday of rep tony coelho dcalif the 
partys no 3 leadership official 
the democratic party is not in a crisis foley said already 
trying to stem the disruption we are going to address the 
legislative issues that face the country 
rep steny hoyer dmd said coelhos decision to resign as 
democratic whip effective june 15 was a step in that direction 
removing his ethics problems from the agenda said loudly we need 
to get about the business of addressing issues like the deficit 
the environment and social concerns 
in the very short term the party has clearly been hurt 
hoyer said but he added we have a very deep bench and will be 
able to quickly replace the lost leadership 
soon after wrights expected resignation announcement which 
could come as early as wednesday house democrats will caucus to 
elect successors 
rep richard gephardt dmo is the favorite to replace foley 
although he may face a challenge from rep ed jenkins dga 
coelhos spot would likely be filled by one of three contenders 
reps david bonior dmich beryl anthony dark or bill gray 
dpa 
it will be up to foley not only to deal with the ethics cloud 
that has enveloped his party but also to look beyond internal 
concerns to a list of legislation that has been overshadowed if 
not neglected 
many expect foley to provide the calming influence the chamber 
needs his personal style is far different from those of both 
wright and coelho who are forceful dealcutting risk takers 
foley is seen as more of a consensus politician more intellectual 
and conciliatory 
but republicans who largely have taken a handsoff approach 
since the ethics committee formally charged wright with 69 
violations of house rules now are poised to attack 
there are going to be a number of democrats in trouble said 
rep newt gingrich rga the gop whip and wrights chief accuser 
he contends that in their more than three decades in power in the 
house democrats have developed a habit of sloppiness when it 
comes to ethics 
republicans will put forward an ethics and election reform 
package and challenge foley on the issues gingrich said in a 
weekend telephone interview 
how can you lose two of your top three people and not admit 
you have a problem he asked they have to make a decision 
whether they go for reform or decide to protect the machine 
however another senior gop strategist conceded that it is 
difficult to gain partisan advantage from the ethics issue because 
americans tend to see congress as a single institution and ethics 
charges tend to taint all incumbents regardless of party 
moreover gingrich faces his own ethics investigation over a 
book promotion deal and rep donald lukens rohio was convicted 
last week on a charge related to his sexual relationship with a 
16yearold girl 
the question is whether they the democrats feel vulnerable 
on the issue said the source who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity its obviously churning 
anthony hinted that as soon as a new leadership team is in 
place democrats will seek to turn the tables at that point you 
would say welcome lets see if you can take it like youve been 
dishing it out and well now give you an opportunity to see how it 
feels 
a pall fell over the capitol last week as candidates in the 
democratic succession race tried to line up support without seeming 
to trample over the body of their fallen leader wright 
sources close to the texas democrat said he was determined to 
leave office on his own terms but among considerations in his 
decision when to resign was an ethics committee meeting scheduled 
for thursday 
the panel is to take up a motion filed by wrights lawyers to 
dismiss the most serious charges against him that he evaded limits 
on outside income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and that 
he accepted 145000 in gifts from a fort worth friend with a 
direct interest in legislation 
the committee appeared unlikely to drop the charges and allies 
of the speaker said he would like to forestall any adverse legal 
action that has added weight to the belief that wright will 
announce his decision on wednesday when the house returns

how to solve the third worlds 12 trillion 
debt problem 
in the jargon of the international monetary fund a prescription 
might go something like this 
the enhanced structural adjustment facility will maximize 
rescheduling potential for the least developed areas while 
setasides from debtor purchases of the funds ordinary resources 
in terms of special drawing rights can be devoted to operations on 
the secondary market and a percentage of quotas will be available 
for interest support 
what 
the experts tackling the issues of third world debt really talk 
that way sometimes it may be because they are so wrapped up in 
their specialty that the terminology seems natural 
in other cases someone may be trying to hide something 
robert j schaetzel president of a private group known as the 
council for us international trade policy says even he often has 
trouble understanding what the experts are talking about 
banks have made unwise loans and dont want to admit it he 
said they try to offload the responsibility either on the 
borrowers or on creditor governments its a combination theres 
pride in using words few people understand and you dont bring so 
much criticism down on your head 
us rep jim leach riowa a former diplomat couldnt resist 
putting it this way 
the hocuspocus of econometrics is analogous to doctorpatient 
linguistics giving the upper hand to the verbosity of verbal 
syllablization 
pressed he acknowledged that syllablization was his own 
invention 
the imfs particularly arcane language is intended perhaps to 
create the mystique that surrounds an enigmatic oracle said 
richard feinberg vicepresident of the overseas development 
council 
but rodney eldridge professor of international finance at 
george washington university offered a defense of some of the 
jargon he said new words have to be invented all the time to keep 
pace with financial developments he cited securitization 
meaning the issuance of a new form of bond instead of making a loan 
five years ago that would not have been a word he said 
it is now 
some speculate the international monetary funds language has 
something to do with the dignity of european bankers which often 
exceeds that of american bankers 
since the fund was set up after world war ii it has always been 
headed by a banker from europe its sister organization the world 
bank has always had an american president while it too uses 
jargon the bank tends to go in for simpler language and rarely 
uses its official title the international bank for reconstruction 
and development 
now about how the enhanced structural adjustment facility 
will maximize rescheduling potential for the least developed areas 
while setasides from debtor purchases of the funds ordinary 
resources in terms of special drawing rights can be devoted to 
operations on the secondary market and a percentage of quotas will 
be available for interest support 
in something of a translation that means the fund will have 
about 105 billion to lend to the poorest countries at almost no 
interest it will ask the rich countries to stop nagging them to 
pay old debts provided the debtors promise to put in new austerity 
programs 
it means further that big debtors like mexico and brazil can 
also borrow from the fund and use some of the money to buy back 
part of their debt at bargain prices now that almost nobody 
expects it to be repaid in full some of the borrowed money can be 
used to guarantee commercial banks that theyll get the interest 
owed to them at least for a while on the debt that remains 
as the imf jargon factory churns on another congressman rep 
alfred a mccandless rcalif has his own formula for us 
domestic legislation perhaps only wishful linguistic thinking 
that he also applies to third world debt 
there would be no problem if every proposal for spending 
started with the words we wont spend more than we take in

house democratic whip tony coelho who plans 
to resign from congress rather than face an ethics investigation 
says its up to president bush to stop partisan and petty 
politics being practiced by some republicans 
coelho spoke in an interview with cbs television on sunday one 
day after announcing he will leave congress on june 15 
bush is playing good cop in talking about cooperation and 
bipartisanship while republican campaign officials are playing 
bad cops the california democrat said 
if he wants to do away with the partisan and petty politics 
that he talks about then mr president stand up and say so 
coelho said adding the president should stand up and fire those 
people who are unwilling to do what you want to have done 
coelho said republicans wanted him to stay in office to face 
ethical questions about his 100000 junk bond deal in 1986 
the biggest disappointment they have is that they wanted me to 
stay in for the next two years so that they could use me as a 
vehicle to destroy my party and my causes from going forward the 
california democrat said according to a transcript of a portion of 
the interview that was not broadcast i took that away from them 
i know what im doing 
do we make mistakes yes we do did i make a mistake yes i 
did im willing to pay for it coelho said during the broadcast 
interview 
coelho has steadfastly insisted he did nothing wrong aside 
from some reporting errors in the junk bond transaction which 
was financed without him having to put up any of his own money 
before saturday coelho was planning to run for house majority 
leader to replace rep tom foley who is expected to become speaker 
upon the expected resignation of speaker jim wright of texas who 
also faces ethical questions 
coelho told cbs that he believes house gop whip newt gingrich of 
georgia is trying to create a political agenda to try to get 
control of the united states house of representatives 
newt has said the only way for republicans to get control is 
to destroy the institution tear it down and then to rebuild it 
coelho said i dont think the american public wants that

a womans face appears on the television 
screen with a car a stereo and a house disappearing up her nose 
like a stream of cocaine a tear eventually streams down her cheek 
in another public service announcement comedian and talk show 
host arsenio hall interviews drug addicts one as young as 13 
about how their lives went off track 
one of the most familiar antidrug ads depicts a fried egg 
sizzling and burning as an ominous voice intones this is your 
brain on drugs 
tv networks have provided millions of dollars worth of free air 
time to broadcast these announcements produced freeofcharge by 
advertisers 
but do they do any good 
the advertising agencies think they do according to the 
mediaadvertising partnership for a drugfree america and its 
sister organization the advertising council which organize many 
of the ad efforts 
william j bennett the director of the office of national drug 
control policy also believes they help and the producer of a 
survey on high school drug abuse credits the ads with reducing that 
abuse 
but others say the ads are ineffective and a waste of money 
don des jarlais an epidemiologist who works with heroin and 
cocaine addicts in new york city said addicts speak derisively 
of the ads when they refer to them at all 
the preliminary data ive seen indicate they do change some 
attitudes but in terms of actually changing drug use that remains 
to be seen he said 
donald streater a 17year heroin addict who quit 13 years ago 
earned a law degree and now works for the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control said i would like to see some of 
that money going into treatment programs instead 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
contended the ads are conscience money for a society that is not 
taking care of that part of the population thats most likely to 
get involved in drugs 
it makes the ad industry feel its ok to advertise the 
products of their clients in programs that glamorize crime in the 
streets violence against women and the culture that gives rise to 
drug dealing she said 
theresa venet grant of the partnership for a drugfree america 
rejected that contention saying programs such as 21 jump 
street growing pains and family ties are making a 
conscious effort to deglamorize drug use 
but an academic who has studied the ratio of prodrug to 
antidrug messages on television said tv is delivering too many 
mixed messages for the antidrug ads to have an impact 
the ratio is 8 to 1 in favor of prodrug messages including 
programs and advertisements showing people smoking drinking or 
taking medicines said john condry a cornell university professor 
who has spent the past year at the center for research on the 
influences of television on children at the university of kansas at 
lawrence 
even legitimate ads for overthecounter pain medications send 
the wrong message he contended 
while its not illegal what they are saying is if you dont 
like the state youre in if you have a headache you take a drug 
take some sort of substance to change how you feel condry 
said 
charles atkin a michigan state university professor who has 
analyzed the impact of public service announcements including 
antialcohol ads said probably the main effect of the 
antidrug ads is to assure the nondrug users that something is 
being done 
on the other hand lloyd d johnston program director for the 
institute for social research at the university of michigan at ann 
arbor singled out the advertising campaigns for praise 
young people report a very high level of recalled exposure to 
the antidrug advertising a high degree of credibility in the 
content and most important a high judged impact on their own 
drugusing behaviors and attitudes johnston wrote to the 
partnership for a drugfree america

the armed forces deeply 
divided over who should direct the war against leftist rebels 
narrowly avoided an internal clash last week before agreeing on a 
compromise defense minister according to wellinformed sources 
the discord has been only cosmetically overcome and the rivalry 
will again come to a head within months after a new government 
takes office thursday the sources said this weekend 
most of the military diplomatic and political sources consulted 
in the matter spoke on condition of anonymity but outgoing 
president jose napoleon duarte and an army colonel acknowledged 
publicly that an atmosphere of crisis prevailed last week during 
the high commands deliberations 
the air force whose commander was one of two top candidates to 
head the defense ministry halted ground support operations at 
midweek and limited itself to evacuating wounded sources said 
they said some air force officers had expected armorbacked army 
troops to move on ilopango air base the air force headquarters 
last thursday 
maneuvering for the defense ministry post reportedly included 
harsh mutual recriminations between air force chief gen rafael 
bustillo and the other top candidate col rene emilio ponce head 
of the joint chiefs of staff 
in a reported shouting match they accused each other of 
fostering or ignoring corruption in their respective ranks 
the high command finally agreed that gen humberto larios 
currently viceminister of defense should take over as minister 
after presidentelect alfredo cristiani is sworn in thursday 
cristiani heads the rightist republican nationalist alliance or 
arena 
larios will replace gen eugenio vides casanova who reportedly 
will go to west germany as military attache 
cristiani who preferred bustillo for the post but ceded at the 
prospect of internal battle has accepted larios at least 
temporarily the sources said 
according to the constitution the president names his cabinet 
but civilian authority in el salvador remains conditioned on 
military approval and tutelage especially in defense matters 
the confrontation is not a simple showdown between the air force 
and army if it were the army with its superior force would have 
succeeded in imposing ponce 
several key army colonels with command of troops back bustillo 
the sources said those who back the airman contend he is more of a 
natural leader more of a nationalist and has greater resolve than 
ponce to do what is necessary to win the 9yearold civil war 
bustillo is considered a virulently anticommunist hardliner 
relatively unconcerned about international criticism for human 
rights abuses 
ponce is seen as an exponent of continuing the same or slightly 
modified low intensity warfare strategy pursued to date 
despite more than 800 million in us military aid this decade 
the 56000strong armed forces has been unable to defeat an 
insurgent force estimated to number 7000 combatants and 14000 
militia members 
the war has claimed the lives of an estimated 70000 people 
most of them civilians 
the sources said the us embassy which wields considerable 
leverage in el salvador staunchly backed ponce then proposed 
larios as a compromise 
in all institutions there is an element of institutional 
crisis when the government changes duarte told reporters 
saturday of rumors of the military turmoil everyone tries to 
ensure his post this means that at the distinct levels of the

a slowmoving freight carrying california 
fruit to chicago rammed 30 parked railroad cars killing the 
brakeman and conductor and injuring two other workers 
the accident before dawn sunday flung one of the parked cars 
into a coal train traveling in the opposite direction no one 
aboard the 110car coal train was injured said wayne beighle of 
the state department of public safety 
he said it was remarkable anyone had survived in the eastbound 
train 
it looked like the front threequarters of that engine were 
cut in half beighle said 
i see the devastating damage at 20 mph i can only imagine 
what it would have been like at higher speeds he said 
beighle said investigators determined the 35car train that 
slammed into the parked cars was traveling at 20 mph and the brakes 
had been applied when the accident occurred as the train entered 
amarillo city limits 
evidently they thought the track was clear beighle said 
thats still under investigation 
both trains involved were operated by santa fe railway the 
engines damaged in the accident were owned by burlington northern 
dps investigators and santa fe officials interviewed witnesses 
sunday the national transportation safety board also will 
investigate the rail accident because deaths were involved 
santa fe officials said the railroad had not had an accident in 
the amarillo area in recent years 
most of the parked railroad cars contained what santa fe 
officials said was a common nonhazardous agricultural chemical 
which they did not identify several of the cars were empty 
the two railroad employees killed were identified as brakeman 
steve r favreau 29 and conductor robert n dawson 44 
the trains engineer rh coleman 57 was listed in critical 
condition with multiple injuries sunday evening after several hours 
of surgery ah zermeno 41 was listed in satisfactory condition 
said a hospital nursing supervisor

tujan khalid says he feels more 
comfortable in the mountains where for nearly a decade he and 800 
moslem guerrillas battled the sovietbacked government 
but now the rebel commander is plying his own brand of politics 
in afghanistan where shifting military fortunes sent the 
oncemarxist government seeking support among groups it once 
considered enemies 
khalid joined the resistance at age 24 following firebrand 
rebel leader gulbuddin hekmatyar 
when the soviet red army left afghanistan khalid switched his 
allegiance and pledged to intercede with other guerrilla commanders 
to help try to stop the jihad or holy war 
he says it is no longer justified since the government once 
hostile to moslem tenets is now an active backer of the faith 
this cannot be called jihad this is not according to islam 
to continue war and bloodshed says the bearded khalid dressed 
in a turban and robe we are all brothers we belong to 
afghanistan 
with the afghan armed forces left to fight alone the government 
of president najib has come under intensive military pressure with 
guerrillas encircling the eastern city of jalalabad and fighting 
around the southern towns of kandahar and khost 
thousands of reservists have been called for military duty and 
shipments of soviet arms and ammunition stepped up the united 
states pakistan saudi arabia and china are arming and training 
the guerrillas 
political and military analysts say they believe the government 
forces will be able to hold the cities against the divided 
illprepared guerrillas however they add there is little 
prospect for the government winning the war 
najib is trying to create a new political image aimed at 
strengthening his governments support at home that policy took on 
a new urgency with the final departure of the soviet troops on feb 
15 
on may 21 najib launched a new drive to try to end the 
11yearold war offering deals to a dozen guerrilla commanders 
including three of the best known and most organized commanders 
ahmed shah masood ismail khan and abdul haq 
the 43yearold president offered them full military rank within 
the afghan army said they could keep their weapons and promised 
autonomy in the regions they control but his offer was rejected 
within 24 hours 
they made a big mistake said khalid who had come to kabul 
to attend a meeting of the loya jirgah the centuriesold tribal 
council in afghanistan where najib made the offer i hope they 
will reconsider i do not want to see our country being cut into 
pieces 
diplomats and government officials say the government has had 
some success in opening secret talks with the guerrillas since the 
soviet departure at least one commander is known to have made 
contact with the government and one pakistanbased guerrilla leader 
is reported to have been talking with the government for several 
months 
but most commanders while holding back on launching a major 
offensive appear to be content to wait and see if an outright 
military victory by either side is possible they say 
although the government has had some scattered success many 
afghans seem unwilling to forgive it for the hardships and 
suffering brought by a war that has claimed at least 13 million 
lives and forced more than 5 million others to seek refuge in iran 
and pakistan 
the groups whose backing are now being sought were among the 
first casualities when civil war broke out after marxists seized 
power in an april 1978 coup 
the government is now undertaking a major effort to do away with 
some of the policies that once trampled on moslem tenets 
for some afghans the changes have been cosmetic because the real 
power still remains with the politburo and the promise of new 
freedom has been tempered by the continued activites of the khad 
the sovietstyle secret police 
but the guerrillas and their supporters say they are unwilling 
to seek reconciliation as long as najib and his peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan cling to office 
all sides need to openly ask questions about what they are 
doing and why said khalid but they dont seem to know what to 
do there are too many arms and too much money and there will be a 
lot more bloodshed and the end result could be a disaster

this years memorial day weekend 
celebration of the internal combustion engine was disrupted by the 
hum of tiny cars of the future 
it took ed passerinis solarpowered car four days to cover the 
distance that emerson fittipaldi the indianapolis 500 winner 
zipped over about once an hour sunday but passerini who finished 
first in sundays american tour de sol scoffed off the comparison 
the indy 500 is a relic of the past said the professor of 
environmental studies and humanities at the university of alabama 
in tuscaloosa in the year 2000 and beyond this is the sort of 
thing were going to be driving 
sponsors of the fourday road race said it was intended to test 
a technology that its pioneers expect will become commonplace 
what this race is really about is developing the solar 
commuter car said nancy hazard of the northeast solar energy 
association a 15yearold nonprofit organization in brattleboro 
vt 
the 208mile tour de sol began thursday in montpelier vt and 
wended its way for a couple of hours each morning through new 
hampshire and massachusetts taking small highways all the way 
the race was modeled on the swiss tour de sol an annual 
international event first held in 1985 that aims to establish the 
use of solar power for commuter cars that can travel about 50 miles 
a day hazard said 
the six entrants in the american tour de sol were teams from 
alabama mit new hampshire technical institute in concord 
dartmouth college in hanover nh and worcester polytechnic 
institute 
two cars were in the commuter class and resembled truncated 
sedans the others were racers low to the ground their bodies 
narrow like a cocoon and topped with flat solarpanel roofs 
all were equipped with panels of photovoltaic cells that convert 
sunlight into electricity to run electric motors and charge their 
batteries 
there were breakdowns and false starts one car only competed 
sunday another was on the road each of the four days but was 
dragged part of the way on a trailer because it lacked enough 
electric storage another needed charging by conventional 
electricity overnight 
but it didnt really matter because the purpose was to 
demonstrate efficiency and reliability organizers said 
about 50 onlookers watched as passerinis vehicle rolled across 
the finish line at the massachusetts institute of technology at 
1050 am 
weighing aout 800 pounds his threewheeled plastic car was 
cobbled together from a trailer hitch a twoseat yellow paddle 
boat fitted with a steering wheel brake pedals and topped with a 
navy blue molded fibreglas cabin complete with windows solar 
panels covered the rear of the vehicle and four conventional car 
batteries soaked up the electricity 
passerini said his car cost 2800 and took three weeks to 
build it clocked up to 45 mph on the straightaways 13 mph on the 
hills and could travel 30 miles per day 
fittipaldi the indy 500 winner averaged 167581 mph 
this demonstrates that when the oil runs out the photovoltaic 
cell is going to come in for things like transportation 
passerini said 
by contrast there was the sleeker 350pound race car driven by 
mit mechanical engineering student james worden and financed with 
20000 from a corporate sponsor 
when worden sailed in at about 1120 am first to arrive in 
the race car division the crowd cheered but helmeted and under a 
bubble cockpit the 22yearold driver apparently forgot to cross 
the finish line as he began to climb out of the vehicle he looked 
puzzled as the crowd urged him to make it official when he could 
make out what they were saying he drove ahead a few more feet to 
complete his feat to more applause and cheers

the us confrontation with gen 
manuel antonio noriega may leave the panama canal without an 
administrator next year when treaties call for a panamanian 
citizen to take over 
the canal is run by the panama canal commission a us 
government agency and now has a us administrator 
according to the gradual transfer of responsibilities specified 
in the 1977 treaties a panamanian proposed by the panamanian 
government and appointed by the us president must take over on 
jan 1 1990 
but most likely if the situation continues we will see the 
us deputy administrator running the canal said fernando 
manfredo who is generally acknowledged as the panamanian best 
qualified to take over 
manfredo helped negotiate the panama canal treaties and since 
1979 has been deputy administrator which becomes a us citizens 
post next year 
the idea of a panamanian appointed by noriega taking over the 
canal has aroused opposition in the united states 
rep newt gingrich rga has called it inconceivable that 
the american people directly or through a marionette would allow 
noriega to appoint an administrator for the canal 
although the treaty does not say so a us law passed in 1979 
also requires that the new panamanian administrator be approved by 
the us senate 
the united states does not recognize the noriegacontrolled 
government and has imposed economic sanctions on panama that 
include the withholding of canal income the united states has 
demanded noriegas ouster and indicted him on drug charges last 
year 
noriega has also been criticized by the organization of american 
states after the government nullified the may 7 presidential 
election and noriega supporters beat the top three opposition 
candidates 
international observers say the opposition won the election 
under the canal treaties the united states is charged with 
protection and defense of the waterway it recently sent in 
additional military units 
manfredo and administrator dennis mcauliffe end their terms on 
dec 31 if noriega is still firmly entrenched it is unlikely 
washington would approve a new adminstrator 
that would be interpreted by panama as a treaty violation since 
the treaties do not say that the us president has any choice in 
approving the new administrator and do not mention senate approval 
manfredo might be the one person who could get us approval 
but he says he is not available 
id rather be surfing in hawaii manfredo said in a recent 
interview with the associated press 
former president jimmy carter during his visit earlier this 
month as an election observer asked manfredo to stay on as 
administrator according to sources close the canal commission 
he is the only panamanian now who because of his experience 
and honesty would get immediate us approval said a panamanian 
source 
carters word carries particular weight here because he signed 
the treaties that cede the canal to panama at the end of 1999 
but being the first panamanian canal administrator in charge of 
a 450 million budget and 8825 employees including 1100 us 
citizens would be a tough one even under normal conditions 
the administrator answers to a canal commission board of 
directors made up of four panamanians and five us citizens but 
the board has little power to fight washington or congressional 
decisions 
as a panamanian the new administrator also would be facing 
pressures from his own government 
there would the distrust of the gringos on the one hand and 
the pressure for favors from panamanians on the other they would 
feel the canal was already a national operation even though it 
would still be run as a us agency a source said

forecasters preparing for thursdays 
opening of the atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict 
the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to 
evergrowing coastal populations 
the air force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights 
for two more years but has made it clear it plans to phase out the 
missions and only one satellite is available for tracking 
hurricanes 
we just have nothing right now to lean on says ken 
mckinnon a spokesman for us rep tom lewis of north palm beach 
fla who has introduced a bill in congress to keep hurricane 
hunters flying at least another five years weve got one 
satellite and theyre telling us itll do the job if it blinks 
how do you track weather 
the air force doesnt want to be involved we have in the last 
few years examined our need for manned weather reconnaissance and 
feel theres no real compelling military reason said spokesman 
lt col darrell hayes 
were not disputing that the hurricane center and the weather 
service need the data were just saying there may be more 
appropriate agencies to provide the information he said adding 
that the service had approached the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration about taking over the flights 
besides the flights forecasters depend on radar and satellite 
data 
the single working weather satellite wasnt intended to be 
alone a second satellite failed and a replacement for the failed 
craft was blown up in a mishap on the launch pad forcing 
forecasters to make do 
there are new satellites on the horizon says bob sheets 
director of the national hurricane center but theyve been due for 
a long time and arent expected before late 1990 
it is a major concern for us sheets said 
forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of 
hurricane activity in recent years since 1985 sheets said there 
seem to be more hurricanes and theyre more likely to hit the 
united states 
we may be in an upswing he said possibly back to the 
pattern of the 40s 50s and 60s when we had a tremendous number 
of landfall hurricanes 
max mayfield hurricane specialist at the national weather 
service in miami said experts dont known enough yet about 
hurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity or a return 
to the 50s and 60s 
now we can see past the antilles out into the atlantic and 
over toward hawaii on the west said forecaster hal gerrish 
wed like to be able to see all the way to africa which is 
where atlantic hurricanes develop he said 
the need for improved tracking systems is important because more 
and more people are moving to coastal locations likely to be 
affected by storms 
i spoke to about 5000 people on the west coast of florida 
sheets said ninetyplus percent of them were from the midwest or 
northeast and had just come to florida they really have very 
little concept of what a hurricane is 
during the average atlantic hurricane season which stretches 
from june through the end of november six tropical storms will 
grow into hurricanes with heavy rains and winds of 74 mph 
donna in 1960 struck the florida keys at marathon then raked 
across naples and fort myers before weakening inland 
last season 505 people died in atlantic hurricanes including 
gilbert and joan 
gilbert killed more than 300 people and did heavy damage in 
mexico jamaica haiti and the dominican republic as it blasted 
across the the western caribbean and part of the gulf of mexico 
including the florida keys the florida straits and cuba 
joan hovered off the coast of central america for days before 
howling in with top winds of 135 mph the storm caused mudslides 
floods and other damage in nicaragua costa rica colombia and 
panama

while a cuban exile awaited a court appearance in 
the attempted hijack of an american airlines jet authorities tried 
to figure out how he smuggled a starter gun and two knives on the 
plane 
pedro rene comasbenos an escaped mental patient wearing green 
military fatigues and a bomberstyle jacket was able to elude 
xray machines and other security saturday at los angeles 
international airport considered one of the nations most secure 
he boarded flight 30 in los angeles and thats where we should 
have caught him ed martelle american airlines spokesman said 
saturday from the companys headquarters in dallas 
were very concerned about it because up to this point los 
angeles has been our best security section martelle said so 
as a starting point we have to look at if it was possible for him 
to get by our screeners without them noticing 
comasbanos 37 flew the first leg of his journey to dallas 
then transferred to a miamibound flight that he allegedly tried to 
hijack 
after the flight left the ground on its way to miami he 
produced a demand note and said he wanted to be taken to havana 
said fbi agent william gavin 
the boeing 727 with 157 people aboard attempted to head toward 
cuba but came back to miami after the pilot told comasbanos the 
jet was running out of fuel 
speaking spanish comasbanos told the flight crew he was 
carrying a bomb in a duffel bag that actually contained the gun 
used to start track races two small knives and a pair of scissors 
ninety minutes after flight 1098 parked in a remote corner of 
miami international airport comasbanos allowed children to leave 
the jet and then collapsed in front of authorities 
comasbanos was charged with air piracy and was jailed at the 
federal metropolitan correctional center south of miami pending a 
magistrates hearing tuesday he faces a maximum penalty of life in 
prison if convicted gavin said 
security at los angeles international was tightened in december 
1987 after david burke a recently fired usair employee boarded a 
pacific southwest airlines jet and opened fire in the cabin and 
cockpit 
the jet bound for san francisco from los angeles plummeted to 
earth killing all 43 people aboard 
among new measures taken since that tragedy employees with 
airline badges including pilots were ordered to pass through 
metal detectors and have their luggage xrayed like everyone else 
martelle said it wasnt immediately known how comas bypassed 
security 
although a starters pistol would not be allowed in carryon 
luggage under any circumstances pocket knives and scissors would 
not automatically be considered weapons he said 
comasbanos had come to los angeles where he lived on the 
streets after escaping from st elizabeths hospital in washington 
dc where john hinckley who attempted to assassinate president 
reagan in 1981 is held comasbanos was there from 1980 to 1982 
comasbanos reportedly has a son in cuba and had wanted to 
return to his homeland

turkish prime minister turgut ozal 
asked today about rejecting a us request to inspect a soviet jet 
fighter flown by a defector said the aircraft was a very old 
plane 
pentagon officials in washington had complained that turkey 
returned the mig29 without permitting us inspection of the 
plane which they said carried advanced radar and had other 
equipment the soviets did not include in export models 
according to us officials the rebuff caused a lot of 
resentment at the pentagon and the state department because the 
inspection would have shed light on the jets capabilities 
this was a russian frontline mig29 not the export version 
of this plane explained one administration source in 
washingtonweve examined export versions but the soviets dont 
share their top technology on the stuff they export this was a 
chance to really get a look at the engines lookdown radar and 
other systems that are loaded only on the soviet air force planes 
ozal was asked about the incident while posing for pictures with 
president bush before a meeting today in the belgian guest house 
bush is using on a twoday visit for the 16nation north atlantic 
treaty organization turkey is a nato member 
its a very old plane its quite old ozal said when 
questioned why the us request was rejected on sunday the white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the incident might come up 
during the presidents discussion with the turkish leader 
sources in washington said turkey never offered an adequate 
explanation for its refusal to allow american experts to study the 
plane but us officials assume the turks were trying to avoid 
antagonizing the neighboring soviets 
in ankara turkish foreign ministry spokesman inal batu 
reiterated sunday what he had said at a news conference last 
wednesday this is an affair completely between turkey and the 
soviet union he said 
batu added that i have no knowledge of any us request for 
permission to inspect the soviet plane he did not elaborate 
according to the administration sources the us government was 
not informed of the defection even though the pilot has asked for 
asylum in the united states until after the turks had already 
assured the russians they could have their plane back 
capt alexander zuyev fled the soviet union on may 20 flying to 
the turkish town of trabzon on the black sea with a bleeding arm 
wound 
pravda the newspaper of the soviet communist party later 
reported that zuyev was working as a duty dispatcher at the 
tskhakaya airfield north of batumi and therefore was armed on the 
day of his flight it said he shot and wounded a sentry who fired 
back and wounded zuyev 
the mig29 which carries the nato codename of fulcrum is 
considered the most modern and capable jet fighter currently in the 
soviet inventory 
the plane can fly at 23 times the speed of sound and according 
to us intelligence agencies carries a true 
lookdownshootdown radar enabling it to engage lowflying 
aircraft or cruise missiles 
turkey allowed zuyevs plane to be flown back to the soviet 
union on may 21 it was stripped of rockets and weapons which were 
returned on a separate plane

the suppression of liberal forces in china has 
further unnerved hong kong over its future under chinese rule 
triggering massive demonstrations and uncharacteristic political 
activism 
in largest protest march in this british colonys history what 
police estimated to be estimated 500000 people rallied sunday in 
support of chinas prodemocracy protesters 
police said the crowd exceeded the estimated 400000 who 
demonstrated on may 21 protest chinese premier li pengs 
declaration of martial law in beijing organizers said 15 million 
people attended sundays rally 
hong kong reverts to chinese sovereignty in 1997 and its 
residents have become increasingly nervous over the prospect of 
communist chinese rule 
a poll conducted by the conservative south china morning post 
newspaper reported that onethird of the territorys 57 million 
people hope to emigrate before the takeover 
china has promised to preserve the territorys freewheeling 
socioeconomic lifestyle for 50 years under a one country two 
systems concept that would allow capitalism to exist under 
communism in a government run by hong kong people without chinese 
interference 
hong kong residents have long been skeptical about the chinese 
promises and lis decision to slap martial law on beijing has 
deepened their anxiety 
i believe that to call out the troops to handle a peaceful 
demonstration by students does seem to be heavyhanded said dame 
lydia dunn senior member of the executive council which functions 
as a government cabinet 
eric hotung a fourthgeneration hong kong business magnate 
said britain and china have repeatedly said hong kongs future 
autonomy was assured in a sinobritish agreement signed in 1984 
but the people of hong kong have also seen and seen with 
the greatest clarity how indifferent the leaders in beijing are 
capable of being towards the legitimate aspirations of their own 
people said hotung whose grandfather sir robert hotung was 
among the first chinese knighted by britain 
community leaders and newspapers say a basic law document under 
which china will govern hong kong should be strengthened to 
safeguard the territorys autonomy 
the document drafted by a committee of hong kong and chinese 
delegates appointed by china is to be presented to chinas 
congress for enactment next year 
demonstrations to support the prodemocracy movement in china 
have been held daily for more than a week sundays march lasted 
eight hours and the protesters included parents with babies 
students elderly citizens and merchants 
chanting long live democracy and support beijing 
students the crowd began their march in a downtown business 
district before ending their rally in a park 
banners of support were hung from a number of buildings 
including the probeijing ta kung pao newspaper 
china and hong kong have the same fate proclaimed one 
banner we need democracy for a better tomorrow 
hong kongs population is 98 percent chinese about twothirds 
are refugees from china or their descendants 
in taiwan the nationalists who claim to be the legitimate 
rulers of all china have condemned the chinese attempts to 
suppress the prodemocracy movement and president lee tenghui has 
instructed government officials to recommend effective measures 
that could be taken to help the students 
but critics say this would take time and newspapers scholars 
and citizens say the government should have moved faster 
chang chunhung secretary general of the opposition democratic 
progressive party said the nationalists failed to respond 
effectively because they neither have the capability nor the 
desire to return to the mainland 
wu yenhuan 79 a legislator from the governing nationalist 
party said that if president chiang kaishek who led the defeated 
nationalists to taiwan in 1949 was still alive he would have sent 
troops across the taiwan strait to help students on the mainland 
who are championing democracy chiang died in 1975 
times are different now he lamented

the main iranian opposition group today 
claimed that ayatollah ruhollah khomeini suffered a heart attack 
four days after undergoing surgery for intestinal bleeding 
the claim could not be independently verified 
the heart attack occurred saturday in a tehran hospital the

the city is accusing the operators 
of a pipeline that exploded of pushing to restore the flow of 
gasoline without enough thought for the safety of local residents 
two people were killed and 15 homes were burned when the 14inch 
line blew up thursday in the same area where a runaway freight 
train jumped the tracks and demolished a row of houses may 12 
speculation is the train damaged the line 
the parent company of the locally based calnev pipe line co 
announced sunday the damaged pipeline will be rebuilt under tougher 
standards the company had obtained a court order saturday barring 
the city from ordering that the line be rerouted 
charles p diamond an attorney for calnev complained that san 
bernardino a city of about 120000 is a little town trying to 
take on interstate commerce 
the city in turn accused calnev of insensitivity 
their entire attitude ever since the disaster occurred on 
thursday has been one of callousness toward the people of san 
bernardino and theyve been very obvious that their one concern is 
to get their petroleum products flowing again city attorney 
james penman said 
penman said the city had asked to have the line move west of the 
railroad track under a dry river bed but company officials 
refused because of the cost 
while the city cannot get calnev to change the route of the 
line penman said us district judge david williams rewrote a 
proposed restraining order to remove language that would have 
barred the city from interfering with reopening the line an option 
the city is considering 
the pipeline carries gasoline diesel and jet fuel from a tank 
farm in nearby colton several miles from the blast site to 
southern nevada supplying the las vegas valley with 90 percent of 
its fuel 
gsoline is being trucked to the desert resort while the line is 
repaired 
we believe that the best possible way to repair this pipeline 
is to not only replace but also to bury it 100 percent deeper 
than required by regulation to a depth of six feet said robert 
claypoole president of chicagobased gatx terminals corp which 
owns calnev 
to make any major changes in the routing of the line 
additionally would cause a six to eightweek interruption of 
service he said 
claypoole said the pipe will be tested by forcing water through 
it at pressure 125 percent greater than normal operating pressure 
the hydrostatic test wasnt performed when the pipe was declared 
safe following the derailment 
william pugh of the national transportation safety board said 
federal investigators plan to examine an additional 800 to 1000 
feet of the pipeline and conduct metallurgical tests on train parts 
embedded in the earth near the line 
about 270 people remain displaced from 70 homes damaged in the 
fire according to police cpl john waterhouse

evangelical christians are getting exit visas from 
the soviet union by pretending to be jews wanting to go to israel 
according to a report that says many end up settling in western 
massachusetts 
between 300 and 400 soviet pentecostals have settled in the 
area the boston globe reported today 
the slavic pentecostal church in west springfield had seven 
members 18 months ago today it is has 250 and three families are 
living in the church basement 
the rev pawel lubanski pastor of the church said he and his 
wife try to find jobs food housing and transportation for the 
immigrants most of whom do not speak english when they arrive 
it is virtually impossible for soviet christians to immigrate to 
the united states so evangelicals pretend to be jews wishing to go 
to israel officials said 
soviet officials are said to look the other way because they 
want to get rid of the pentecostals while claiming only jews seek 
exit visas 
because of the way they get out we never know when or how 
many will show up lubanski said once a community has been 
established in the united states such as the one in west 
springfield word spreads among those in the soviet union 
its an open secret that christians are emigrating with jewish 
visas said serge duss soviet refugee coordinator for world 
relief an arm of the 15 millionmember national association of 
evangelicals 
its convenient to everyone the real problems start once the 
refugees jew and christian alike reach vienna 
the case of each soviet union emigrant hoping to come to the 
united states is evaluated individually before refugee status is 
granted emigrants wait an average of 84 days in vienna or rome 
duss said 10000 to 12000 jews and 2200 pentecostals are 
awaiting processing in those cities more than 5000 soviet jews 
and christians are awaiting appeals after being denied refugee 
status by the united states 
the 47 russianspeaking students in west springfield public 
schools have bilingual teachers for most subjects said john 
rosenberg assistant to the superintendent for curriculum and 
programs 
theyve mixed right in and have been accepted 100 percent by 
the other kids they have formed very strong fireendships they 
learn english very quickly in about a year they are conversant

cardinal john oconnor of new york today 
made yet another appeal to the captors of nine american hostages to 
permit me to come and see you but hopes for a positive 
response were rapidly dwindling 
the roman catholic archbishops visit was nearing its end 
if your captors will permit me to come to see you wherever you 
are if its physically possible for me i will come oconnor 
said in an interview with the associated press 
he recalled that during a previous visit to lebanon three years 
ago he was given different locations about where the hostages were 
being held 
somebody would say they were in the bekaa valley somebody 
would say theyre down south theyre in syria theyre in iran 
oconnor said 
but i learned about one year later that at one particular 
point they were only two blocks away from where i was and they did 
see and they did hear me and it gave them some hope the cardinal 
said he declined to elaborate 
oconnor was last in lebanon in june 1986 a month later the 
rev lawrence jenco an american roman catholic priest was 
released after 18 months of captivity 
at present at least 15 western hostages are being held in 
lebanon most of them by proiranian extremist factions the nine 
americans include the longestheld terry anderson associated 
press chief middle east correspondent was kidnapped march 16 1985 
oconnor spoke at the hilltop bkirki monastery where he has 
been staying as the guest of patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual 
head of lebanons dominant maronite catholic community 
he declared outright support for christian army commander gen 
michel aouns demand that the syrian army withdraw from lebanon 
i think every person ive met has said that nothing can happen 
until the forces of syria leave lebanon so im not creating this 
this is what i hear wherever i go oconnor said 
aouns 20000 mainly christian units have been locked in 11 
weeks of fierce fighting with an alliance of syrian and druse 
forces that has left 359 people killed and 1396 wounded since 
march 8 
at a summit conference in morocco last week arab heads of 
states called on all warring factions in lebanon to strictly 
adhere to a ceasefire proclaimed by the arab league on may 11 
but syrian artillery positions in moslem west beirut kept on 
blasting the christian coast north of beirut maintaining a 
blockade against the 1 million christians in the beleaguered 
enclave 
people in the united states do not know that when the 
ceasefire came that the syrians did not stop firing so i think 
this is very important that gen aouns position be made much 
clearer to the people of the united states oconnor said 
oconnor said there was no personal friction between him and 
us ambassador john mccarthy after the cardinals controversial 
decision sunday to cancel a trip to west beirut for talks with 
moslem leaders 
theres no friction over west beirut the ambassador told me 
that he had received a call from washington that they were afraid 
to concentrate that many people in one place for security 
reasons the cardinal said 
he avoided answering a question on why a reception planned for 
him at the embassy by mccarthy was canceled sunday afternoon 
oconnors failure to cross beiruts dividing green line had 
angered acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a mostly moslem 
cabinet contesting power with a christian cabinet under aoun 
hoss charged that security conditions in west beirut were 
portrayed in an exaggerated manner to make oconnor call off 
the visit 
oconnor told reporters at bkirki today that he had a 25minute 
talk by telephone with hoss in a bid to dispel moslem anger but 
did not say whether it was successful 
hoss later left for damascus for talks with syrian government 
leaders on arab efforts to end the lebanese crisis his departure 
seemed to remove the last chance for oconnor to come to west 
beirut 
oconnor who arrived in lebanon saturday was due to leave at 
dawn tuesday sources at bkirki said they requested anonymity 
the cardinal has won the hearts of christians through his 
antisyrian statements and pledge that bishops in the united 
states will not turn their backs on you not as long as i am 
alive 
a group of 40 christian university students said today that 
out of respect for oconnors visit they had called off a 
39day picket of the us embassy protesting what they called 
americas negative policy in lebanon

student prodemocracy protesters split today on 
whether to press on with their threeweek occupation of central 
tiananmen square grappling over how to face the anticipated 
conservative backlash 
hardliners who have seized the upper hand in the government have 
moved relentlessly in recent days toward snuffing out the 
6weekold movement 
workers were reportedly being fined for taking part in 
demonstrations few were seen in a march sunday by about 80000 
people mostly students and troops called under martial law were 
said to have occupied beijings biggest steel plant 
the staterun press which only a week ago was filled with heady 
reports of the democratic protests was churning out propaganda 
material 
leading moderates were reportedly in retreat 
sources said provincial officials have received documents 
chronicling the serious errors of reformist communist party 
general secretary zhao ziyang reportedly stripped of his post for 
seeking reconciliation with the students 
others who similarly advocated political reform or supported 
compromise with the students are expected to be punished or purged 
we cannot leave the square student loudspeakers blared 
today if the peoples liberation army suppresses us we will 
become an exemplary model for all future movements to come 
the announcement said by the loudspeaker to be from a 
leadership group added to the confusion of who was in control of 
the movement and whether the students had veered toward a more 
confrontational stand 
beijing student leaders had earlier proposed staging a massive 
victory rally on tuesday then leaving but students from outside 
the capital many of them recent arrivals have resisted 
the beijing leaders have cited the unsanitary conditions on the 
square occupied by students since may 13 and the need to shift 
the course of the 6weekold movement 
students they contend should begin going out among the 
populace to explain their goals the protesters seek more 
democracy including a free press and an end to official corruption 
wang dan one of the beijing leaders said late sunday that he 
was determined to leave on tuesday and expects the beijing students 
to go with him about 10000 students today occupied the grimy 
foulsmelling squatters camp in the square down from a peak of 
200000 about half are from outside beijing and many traveled for 
days on crowded trains to take part 
it is the nonbeijing groups that are adamantly opposed to 
giving up the square 
we will not leave said yao gangfu a student from coastal 
jiangsu province we havent achieved our goals 
the loudspeaker announcement called on students to stay until 
june 20 when the national peoples congress chinas legislature 
is scheduled to hold a special session to discuss the prodemocracy 
protests 
on sunday students from most of chinas 31 provinces paraded 
through the capitals streets repeating their prodemocracy 
slogans and demanding the resignation of premier li peng who 
imposed martial law in beijing on may 20 and ordered troops into 
the capital region 
another 30000 students marched against li in shanghai with one 
banner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap 
in hong kong police said 500000 people marched to show support 
for the students thousands of chinese also rallied in taiwan 
australia chicago and new york in solidarity 
unlike past demonstrations in which up to 1 million chinese took 
to the streets there were few nonstudents in the beijing march on 
sunday an indication that the government hardline stance against 
the protests has begun to have effect 
workers reportedly are being fined or face pay deductions for 
participating in marches and people in academic institutes and 
news organizations are being ordered to write reports on their 
activities during the demonstrations 
such reports could presumably be used against them 
the staterun media its journalists now in jeopardy for their 
active participation in the street marches have returned to being 
propaganda organs for the government 
the official communist party newspaper the peoples daily gave 
passing mention to sundays demonstration 
but todays front page was filled with articles of courts 
supporting the government decision on martial law citizens writing 
letters calling on students to leave tiananmen square and 
government leaders expressing thanks for popular support for the 
military 
several workers from the capital steel works said troops have 
occupied several parts of the mill which employs 220000 people 
they said workers were being prohibited from returning home for 
fear they would take part in the marches 
diplomatic and government sources said sunday that the 
government has set up a new censorship group to stop publication of 
any articles harmful to the conservative faction that has gained 
control in chinas power struggle 
one liberal shanghai weekly the world economic herald has not 
published in recent weeks after defying orders not to print stories 
critical of the government

a recording industry group is campaigning to 
restrict the use of home studios for musical production a 
development that some producers and musicians like frank zappa find 
ominous 
efforts to shut down music producer chas sanfords home studio 
where the likes of chicago rod stewart and stevie nicks have 
recorded could affect thousands of hollywood creative people who 
work out of their homes 
the crackdown is in response to complaints about violations of 
city zoning ordinances that prohibit commercial use of residential 
property 
if you look at the way theyre applying this zoning concept 
that no one can do anything commercial in their house youd shut 
hollywood down said zappa who has recorded his indiosyncratic 
material for years at a studio in his laurel canyon home 
strictly speaking other than a situation where they 
homebased workers are immediately adjoining a commercial zone 
its not a permitted use said frank eberhard the citys chief 
zoning administrator but unless theres a complaint theres not 
a real heavy enforcement of those rulings 
sanford alleged that a fledgling trade group the hollywood 
association of recording professionals is responsible for the 
investigation into his studio not his neighbors 
they think everyone should be forced to go to their studios to 
work i dont think i should be told where i have to go and be 
creative sanford said its a misuse of the law when a rival 
studio 20 miles from my house not my next door neighbor can go 
to the zoning commission and evoke the law to put someone out of 
business 
sanford contended that if artists are prohibited from working 
out of their homes it could have a negative impact on the recording 
industry 
if these guys force everyone not to be able to work out of 
their homes there would only be 500000 recording budgets he 
said none of the new bands would be able to legally do stuff out 
of their houses which is where they all start 
but buddy brundo owner of conway recording studios said the 
commercial studios only want to target people who rent out home 
studios not musicians who work in their own homes 
were not talking about artist studios were talking about 
people who build studios in their houses for hire brundo said 
this guy sanford built a studio for hire period 
sanford denied he runs a studioforhire business he said that 
in the 2 years since he moved into the house he has rented it out 
for a total of four sessions lasting 15 days and those artists 
were his friends 
many top recording artists have built studios in their homes 
tom petty recorded his southern accents album in the basement 
studio of his encino home van halen recorded two albums at the 
home studio of guitarist eddie van halen and dave stewart of the 
eurythmics has done extensive recording at his home 
studio owners complained that stateoftheart studios such as 
sanfords give them an unfair advantage of not having to comply 
with zoning regulations 
were playing by the rules and theyre not said allen 
sides owner of ocean way recording which operates studios in 
hollywood and sherman oaks if they want to compete on the same 
basis i dont think any of us have any complaints 
but if theyre going to operate and not pay 15 percent of 
their gross in business tax not pay proper state board of 
equalization taxes not pay proper overtime for their employees and 
have health insurance plans and have handicapped bathrooms and all 
the things that we have to do its a different story

president raul alfonsin has 
announced an emergency package aimed at easing an economic crisis 
that has led to the looting of supermarket and grocery stores in 
major cities 
alfonsin in a nationally televised speech promised sunday 
night that his lameduck government will make sure consumer 
products get to the people in what he called an extremely 
dangerous and cruelly damaging economic crisis 
as he spoke officials in rosario the countrys third largest 
city reported about 20 new cases of looting sunday night that 
involved groups of from 20 to 40 people 
the official news agency telam said about 20 people had been 
arrested and that streets were being patrolled by police and 
firefighters rosario is 150 miles north of buenos aires 
the incidents were similar to dozens of others that began 
tuesday in cordoba the second largest city and quickly spread to 
other cities including workingclass suburbs of the capital 
some looters have eaten food in the stores 
in his speech alfonsin called on argentines to roll up your 
sleeves and go to work to ensure that emergency steps work 
the government will dictate clear and tough rules to put an 
end to the risk of hyperinflation will surgically put state 
finances in order and will severely punish speculative maneuvers 
alfonsin said 
he also offered to modify some of our criteria to fit plans 
of the presidentelect carlos menem and the peronist party who 
defeated the governing radical civic union in may 14 elections 
alfonsins measures some of which require congressional 
approval include a return to monetary exchange controls with an

a hemophiliac priest with aids spoke at a service in rural 
kentucky and thousands marched in san francisco as communities 
throughout the nation took part in a worldwide project to remember 
aids victims 
candlelight marches rallies and religious ceremonies were 
planned in 180 cities worldwide through today including 97 cities 
in the united states 
the international aids candlelight memorials involves hundreds 
of communitybased aids organizations and will be the largest 
aids action ever undertaken according to drew siegel a 
spokesman for mobilization against aids in san francisco 
activities surrounding the memorials vary widely across the 
world including an interfaith service at st martininthefields 
in london a ceremony in a buddhist temple in bangkok and a rally 
in newark nj to remember children who have died of aids 
in san francisco about 20000 people turned out sunday night 
for the aids candlelight memorial gathering participants held 
candles aloft as they walked quietly from the citys predominantly 
homosexual castro district to city hall 
its a way of remembering our friends said jim wyatt 38 
ive lost about 60 
in western kentucky a roman catholic priest with hemophilia 
infected with aids told about 15 people at a candlelight service 
in owensboro that they must not forget those who died of the 
disease 
the rev danny gough led the 45minute nondenominational 
christian service accompanied by organ music while the audience 
held lighted candles according to bob johnson an activist who 
attended the service 
johnson said the service showed that tiny farming communities 
are no longer shutting their eyes to aids 
i was very impressed in a common rural community like 
owensboro people have taken a long time to see that aids is a 
problem everywhere johnson said this is a community that 
felt as long as we dont talk about it its not happening my 
feeling was relief that as many turned out as did 
in los angeles more than 2500 people each carrying a lighted 
candle somberly marched sunday to remember the victims of aids and 
to demonstrate for better and faster treatment of the disease 
elsewhere several hundred people held lighted candles aloft and 
formed a chain of flames around a park sunday in a ceremony in 
kansas city in dallas about 200 people gathered to light candles 
and remember friends and loved ones who have died of aids 
in oakland a weekend aids benefit concert and dance party drew 
tens of thousands of people and reportedly raised about 500000 
in the biggest show of a weeklong series of musical 
fundraisers tracy chapman john fogerty and the grateful dead 
entertained some 30000 people at the oakland coliseum on saturday 
promoter bill graham said his best guess was that the 
coliseum benefit would raise 500000 for some 35 medical and 
relief organizations in the san francisco bay area but he was 
disappointed in the turnout 
there are many people in the community who didnt come today 
out of fear he said the reason its onethird empty is 
that many people still have not been properly informed 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
fatal disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections in the united 
states as of may 12 there have been 94280 cases of aids reported 
since june of 1981 of which 54402 have been fatal according to 
the centers for disease control in atlanta

a little bill from a south carolina 
congressman was all it took to rename the artificial lake that 
straddles the georgia border to lake thurmond 
but it wont be that easy say locals many of them georgians 
who have raised 80000 signatures to change the name of the 
70000acre body of water back to clarks hill lake 
i dont care how long it takes well get the name restored 
said roy giles leader of the group that calls itself keep our 
lake clarks hill with the georgia legislature stepping in this 
spring to support the name restoration its become the war 
between the states he said 
its still clarks hill to me say tshirts and caps for sale 
at stores in both states 
clarks hill lake itself is a relatively new phenomenon the 
result of a 1946 army corps of engineers dam on the savannah river 
but residents on both sides of the lake had no problem with the 
name until dec 3 1987 
on that date rep butler derrick dsc introduced a bill in 
congress changing the name from clarks hill to thurmond lake in 
honor of us sen strom thurmond rsc who turned 85 years old 
two days later 
the senate approved the measure the next day and thenpresident 
reagan signed it into law a few weeks later 
no public hearings were held much to the dismay of local 
residents 
some of them cited a deep emotional attachment to the old name 
and others said they had built a business reputation on it 
bringing national fishing tournaments and speedboat races and 
investing in souvenirs 
in march 1988 some lake clarks hill presented thurmond in 
washington with 42000 signatures from people in both states asking 
that he recommend a compromise that the name of the lake be 
restored to clarks hill while the dam and road retain his name 
thurmond responded that he liked it just fine having a lake in 
his name 
the group kept up its campaign buying radio television and 
newspaper ads and collecting more than 80000 signatures 
when the signatures reached 72000 georgia state rep bill 
jackson said probably my driveway is the only thing named after 
me but if 72000 people asked me to change it i would 
thurmond did ask that the words at clarks hill be added to 
the new sign on the dam so it now reads j strom thurmond dam amp 
lake at clarks hill that change was made not in an effort to 
quiet complaints but to help clear up any confusion that might 
exist for people who knew the lake by its old name said thurmond 
spokesman christopher simpson 
giles said he would like to see the sign read j strom 
thurmond dam at clarks hill lake all they have to do is take 
off the ampersand and move the word lake down he said it 
wouldnt cost any money ill come out here and help them do it 
giles noted that historians worked 10 years before getting the 
name of cape canaveral fla restored after it was changed to cape 
kennnedy 
in the meantime all the signs in georgia still say clarks hill 
as do some of the signs in south carolina the south carolina signs 
will be changed to thurmond as they wear out 
at the south carolina welcome center on interstate 20 a 
receptionist said she didnt have any brochures on thurmond lake 
but she did have some on clarks hill

a navy tomahawk cruise missile 
launched from the gulf of mexico successfully completed a 450mile 
test flight over florida and alabama a department of defense 
spokesman said 
the landattack missile was launched at about 915 am edt 
sunday from a submarine under way in the gulf and was recovered 
after making a parachute landing in eglins test range said bob 
holsapple of the cruise missile project 
tomahawks are known as the mostaccurate missiles in the 
world today and with a conventional landattack configuration 
you can launch one from off the coast of washington dc and put 
it inside atlanta stadium through either goal post holsapple 
said by phone from fort walton beach 
cruise missiles can be launched from sea or air and can carry 
nuclear or conventional warheads the missile used in sundays test 
was unarmed said holsapple 
because the jetpowered weapon was recovered by parachute 
rather than crash landing into its target as a live weapon would 
it can be refurbished probably at a cost of 100000 to 300000 
a new missile would cost about 13 million he said 
cruise missiles can fly up to 1500 miles depending on the 
warhead

the discovery of more than 1000 documents 
and books that shed new light on early jewish communities in the 
united states might call for a revision of the history of american 
jews 
the new documents show that jews were not concentrated in the 
larger cities of the northeast they settled extensively in the 
deep south much earlier than originally thought and apparently 
viewed the united states as a permanent home not just a refuge 
historians say 
among the other findings are evidence that jews formed 
closeknit settlements throughout the country including the deep 
south as early as the 1820s 
history is only human not divine said nathan m kaganoff 
a jewish scholar who helped uncover the material we now have a 
lot of facts that will lead a lot to be rewritten 
the discoveries come from a private collection of dusty 
prayerbooks playbills rabbinic writings and cookbooks held for 
decades in a wall street safe until purchased for the american 
jewish historical society 
kaganoff learned of the collection earlier this year when he was 
told the items would be auctioned and brought the collection to 
the attention of society benefactors 
benefactors eleanor and morris soble paid an estimated 500000 
for the collection which they bought from art and antiques dealer 
bruce gimelson and donated to the society about a month ago 
kaganoff said the documents show the early jewishamerican 
experience to be a positive one he said the booklets published by 
the many organizations and clubs formed by jews in small towns 
reveal that they embraced their new country 
it looks as if they felt so much at home that they wanted to 
establish their own communities kaganoff said they didnt 
want to return from where they came we thought they were just 
looking for a haven in big cities now we see they went to little 
towns and created institutions that meant they wanted to stay 
in british colonial america the principal jewish communities 
were all in seaports new york philadelphia savannah ga 
charleston sc and newport ri in contemporary america the 
most numerous jewish concentrations are still mostly in seaports 
with the top five in population being new york los angeles 
philadelphia chicago and miami 
the material is being catalogued for display at the society a 
national organization headquartered on the campus of brandeis 
university and home to the worlds largest collection of original 
documents relating to the history of jews in america 
according to kaganoff much has always been known about the more 
recent and greatest influx of jews into the united states the 25 
million eastern european jews who came here between 1881 and 1914 
but the new collection provides a key to the earliest 
jewishamerican history dating from the time the first 23 jews 
arrived in the united states by boat from amsterdam in 1654 and 
extending to 1850 when the number of jews had grown to 50000 
among the most important findings in the collection 
philadelphia not new york was probably the first american city to 
develop a major jewish community though the topic has been debated 
by scholars for generations evidence from the collection points to 
philadelphia kaganoff said 
one such piece of evidence is a rabbinic prayer book ethics 
of the fathers published in 1858 in philadelphia until now a 
rabbinic prayer book published in 1860 in new york was believed to 
be the oldest in the united states 
new york was more like a marketplace said kaganoff there 
were a lot of people but not as much of an organized community 
philadelphia emerged as an organized community and a cultural place 
earlier

returned to utah for burial 
cardboardcovered coffins containing the bodies of todd ray

jetliner at salt lake international airport sunday as members of

the caskets were transported by hearse to two funeral homes the 
slain missionaries will be buried tuesday

we express our deepest love and concern and sympathy to the 
families of the victims ballard said 
wilson and ball were shot down last wednesday as they returned 
to their apartment in la paz one of the missionaries died 
immediately the other en route to a hospital 
a statement distributed to la paz newspapers claimed 
responsibility for the attack on behalf of the zarate willka armed 
liberation front a group named for a 19th century indian 
revolutionary in bolivia 
ballard said church officials understood that the fbi was 
working with bolivian authorities to find out who did this and 
why and why two mormon missionaries would be the target 
until more answers are forthcoming church officials have 
confined nearly 400 missionaries in bolivia to their apartments and 
have advised mission presidents around the world to be careful

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone resigned 
today from the governing liberal democratic party to take 
responsibility for an influencepeddling scandal that brought down 
his successor 
foreign minister sousuke uno is now expected to replace prime 
minister noboru takeshita who will resign soon because of the 
recruit co scandal 
also today prosecutors charged four aides to senior politicians 
with illegal handling of money in the recruit scandal the 
prosecutors said their charges marked the end of the investigation 
into political donations and stock dealings of the information 
services conglomerate at the heart of the scandal 
nakasone who headed the liberal democratic faction to which uno 
belongs resigned from the party but refused opposition demands to 
step down from his seat in parliament because of the scandal 
i made the decision to leave the party the day before 
yesterday which was my birthday nakasone told reporters today 
the decision came after nakasone acknowledged before parliament 
on thursday that he had accepted 322000 in political donations 
from the recruit co 
but he denied any wrongdoing in the scandal which occurred 
mainly during his 198287 term as prime minister 
nakasone met takeshita today and conveyed his decision to resign 
from the party to take responsibility for his link to the recruit 
scandal 
those charged today were tsuneo hattori an aide to former 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa fumio shimizu a aide to liberal 
democratic secretary general shintaro abe and kikuo katayama and 
masayoshi sakamaki aides to former agriculture minister mutsuki 
kato 
the four allegedly violated the political fund restrictions law 
by failing to report recruit donations in excess of 10500 each 
of the four could face a fine up to 1400 
prosecutors have charged 17 people including two politicians 
and four political aides with bribery and violations of laws on 
securities and political funds 
the charges marked the end of the inquiry into the recruit 
scandal said yusuke yoshinaga head of the tokyo district public 
prosecutors office 
this will cap our probe which stretched some 260 days long 
yoshinaga said in the recruit scandal top politicians escaped 
without charges though many careers were ruined and a close aide 
to prime minister noboru takeshita committed suicide the day after 
takeshita decided to resign 
takeshita today met with party elders to push uno as his 
successor he told reporters saturday that he hopes to appoint a 
new prime minister by friday and hinted that he and his cabinet 
will resign on thursday 
uno 66 a veteran legislator who was first elected to the house 
of representatives in 1960 has been minister of international 
trade and industry and directorgeneral of the defense agency 
he is particularly favored by party leaders because he is 
believed untainted by the recruit scandal and has experience in 
foreign affairs 
some party members point out that uno lacks experience in 
dealing with party affairs which is viewed as indispensable to 
carry out painstaking reforms needed to salvage the partys 
plunging popularity 
however unos main liability has been membership in the 
nakasone faction 
for more than a month the governing party has beem unable to 
find a candidate to replace takeshita because most senior leaders 
have been implicated in the scandal 
the recruit co is accused of trying to influence government 
policy by doling out millions of dollars in political donations and 
selling underpriced unlisted stock shares to business and 
political leaders in 1986 
the stock quickly rose in price when placed on the market and 
those who received the unlisted shares reaped tens of thousands of 
dollars in profits

here are details of the conventional arms 
control proposal president bush announced at the nato summit 
conference monday 
1 limits on tanks armored troop carriers and artillery pieces 
by the nato allies and the soviet bloc ceilings already proposed 
by the west bush said his plan would seek to lock in eastern 
acceptance of the western limits of 20000 tanks 28000 armored 
troop carriers and 16500 to 24000 artillery pieces the precise 
number depending on how those weapons are defined 
once the weapons are cut they would be destroyed the white 
house said that would oblige the east to destroy tens of 
thousands of weapons systems in order to eliminate its wide 
margin in those arms 
according to nato the west has 16424 main battle tanks and the 
warsaw pact has 51500 heavy tanks with announced cuts to reduce 
that number to 39500 
2 reductions by each side in landbased combat airplanes and 
helicopters to levels 15 percent below the current nato level 
those limits would apply from the atlantic to the ural mountains 
including those weapons would expand the conventional arms talks 
something the soviet union has sought 
according to nato the western alliance now has about 2400 
combat helicopters in active units while the warsaw pact nations 
have 3700 there are nearly 4000 combat aircraft in nato and 
about 8250 in the eastern bloc alliance which has announced plans 
to cut that number to 7320 
under the bush plan the affected aircraft would be destroyed 
3 the united states would make a 20 percent cut in its combat 
manpower in europe to about 275000 and that would become the 
ceiling for soviet forces stationed in other eastern european 
nations that manpower ceiling would require the soviets to reduce 
their forces in eastern europe by about 325000 the withdrawn 
troops would be demobilized 
4 both sides would accelerate the timetable for reaching an 
agreement on conventional forces in europe and for implementing the 
resultant cuts bush said there should be agreement within six 
months to a year with the reductions to be effective by 1992 or 
1993 the soviet union has set a 1997 target date for agreement

unrest and friction with communist north korea officials said 
today 
the prime minister the head of the nations main intelligence 
agency and the home labor and construction ministers were among 
those who may be replaced the officials said all major seoul 
newspapers carried reports of the expected shakeup 
the reports surfaced as a hunger strike by 300 radical students 
entered a fourth full day today the protesters are calling for 
rohs resignation 
many of the hunger strikers at the roman catholic myongdong 
cathedral appeared weak and exhausted riot police ringed the 
cathedral but made no move to intervene 
in the southern provincial capital of kwangju violent protests 
broke out today when riot police blocked a march by 5000 radical 
students calling for roh to step down the south korean news agency

the radical students lack public support because of their 
extremist views

in the next weeks to give rohs administration a new look senior 
ministers and prime minister kang younghoon were to take the blame 
for recent violent unrest the officials said on condition of 
anonymity 
cabinet members to be replaced have not been decided but it 
is highly possible that the shuffle will affect many posts one 
official said 
roh who won presidential elections in 1987 is unhappy that 
ministers have failed to win public confidence officials said the 
president believes the administration appears ineffective and needs 
a new stronger image they said 
in south korea periodic cabinet shuffles spare the president 
from taking responsibility for government failures but cabinet 
ministers have little authority and the presidency exacts full 
control over the government

prosecutors today indicted a 
42yearold man on charges that he shot and killed prime minister 
olof palme on a dark street in 1986 as the popular leader left a 
movie with his wife 
the 3000page indictment against carl gustav christer 
pettersson also charged him with attempting to murder palmes 
widow lisbet who was slightly wounded 
i am convinced that this is enough to win a conviction said 
stockholm presecutor jorgen almbland this is a step toward a 
sentence 
palme a dynamic fourterm prime minister was gunned down feb 
28 1986 by a man who fled down a darkened lane and disappeared 
the indictment ended a bumbling threeyear investigation during 
which investigators were branded incompetent by several official 
inquiries three police chiefs and a justice minister resigned in 
connection with the case 
pettersson who has a previous manslaughter conviction on a 
record sheet of more than 60 crimes was routinely questioned 
during the initial weeks of the investigation but he was let go 
the early stages of the investigation focused on the theory that 
palme was the victim of an international conspiracy stockholm 
police chief hans holmer was fired after a 12month effort as head 
of the investigation when he refused to give up his discredited 
theory that kurdish terrorists assassinated palme 
late last year the investigation shifted after an anonymous tip 
about discrepancies in petterssons alibi he was arrested in 
december 
pettersson has denied killing palme the trial was set to open 
june 5 
no motive was given its not up to us to prove that he had a 
motive or what the motive was said anders helin the prosecutor 
in charge of the case 
the indictment listed 33 prosecution witnesses who claimed to 
have seen pettersson near the grand cinema or watched him follow 
the palmes after they left the movies and were walking home 
a summary of the prosecutions case said pettersson willfully 
killed prime minister olof palme by shooting him in the back 
pettersson at the same time attempted to kill lisbet palme 
by firing again toward her it said alternatively he 
endangered her life through gross negligence by firing the gun 
mrs palme was listed as a witness but the indictment gave no 
indication of whether she would testify that she saw pettersson 
fire the gun 
the evidence was largely circumstantial and prosecutors 
acknowledged they lacked the murder weapon and other forensic 
evidence linking pettersson to the shooting 
its a very strong case but of course it would have been 
better if we would have technical evidence said helin 
helin arrived at the courtroom carrying the indictment and the 
evidence in a carton which he presented to the court clerk 
the prosecution is expected to present four witnesses who said 
they saw pettersson outside the theater at the time the movie began 
and when it finished two hours later 
another two witnesses are expected to testify they saw 
pettersson follow the palmes after the film eleven will testify 
about petterssons possible motives his opportunity to obtain a 
weapon and his lack of a solid alibi

an israeli soldier apologized today for using 
pages from the koran the islamic holy book as toilet paper while 
troops occupied a school during a curfew in the west bank an army 
spokesman said 
in the occupied lands three palestinians were wounded one 
seriously in clashes between soldiers and stonethrowing youths 
according to arab reports 
in israel armed forces chief of staff lt gen dan shomron 
said that persistent attacks on palestinians by jewish settlers in 
the territories is contributing to an escalation of violence in the 
area

jewish settlers and the 17 million palestinians in the 
territories israeli newspapers said today 
referring to settler attacks on palestinian homes and vehicles 
shomron was quoted as saying the army doesnt need to be spurred 
on by the settlers who are taking independent action against 
arabs

here is a transcript of president 
bushs meeting with reporters monday at which he announced a 
fourpoint us armscontrol initiative 
ill have a brief statement before taking some questions this 
morning i met with the other nato leaders and shared with them my 
views on the role of the north atlantic alliance in a changing 
europe nato we all agree is one of the great success stories 
and its guaranteed the peace in europe provided a shield for 40 
years of freedom and prosperity 
and now our alliance faces new challenges at a time of 
historic transition as we seek to overcome the division of europe 
i call it beyond containment 
and today i am proposing a major initiative to help move us 
toward that momentous objective if it were accepted it would be a 
revolutionary conventional arms control agreement 
i believe the alliance should act decisively now to take 
advantage of this extraordinary opportunity and i urge that nato 
adopt a fourpoint proposal to bring the vienna negotiations to a 
speedy conclusion 
first lock in eastern acceptance of the proposed western 
ceilings on each sides holdings of tanks and armored troop 
carriers additionally we would seek agreement on a similar 
ceiling for artillery provided there are some definitional 
questions that have to be resolved there but all of the equipment 
reduced would be destroyed 
we would then no 2 expand our current nato proposal so that 
each side would reduce to 15 percent below current nato levels in 
two additional categories attack and assault or transport 
helicopters and all landbased combat aircraft all of the 
equipment reduced would be destroyed 
and third propose a 20 percent cut in combat manpower in united 
statesstationed forces and a resulting ceiling in us and soviet 
ground and air forces stationed outside of national territory in 
the atlantic to the ural zone at approximately 275000 each this 
manpower ceiling will require the soviets to reduce their forces in 
eastern europe by about 325000 people withdrawn soldiers and 
airmen on both sides would be demobilized 
and then fourthly accelerate the timetable for reaching a cfe 
conventional forces in europe agreement along these lines and 
implementing the required reductions i believe it should be 
possible to reach such agreement in six months or maybe a year and 
to accomplish the reductions by 1992 or 1993 
now if the soviet union accepts this fair offer the results 
would dramatically increase stability on the continent and 
transform the military map of europe 
we can and must begin now to set out a new vision for europe at 
the end of this century 
this is a noble mission that i believe the alliance should be 
ready to undertake and i have no doubt that we are up to the task 
and incidentally in addition to these arms control proposals i 
mentioned in there that we are prepared to change our noexceptions 
policy on trade and i called again for a ban on chemical weapons 
and i would reiterate my support for our openskies proposal and in 
the meeting it was discussed by the president the prime minister 
of canada 
helen 
q mr president does this plan signal this revolutionary 
plan signal the end of the cold war 
a well i dont know what it signals except it signals a 
willingness on our part to really put mr gorbachev to the test 
now and so i dont like to dwell in antiquated history but i do 
like to get the idea that we are out front as an alliance because 
this has broad alliance support in challenging mr gorbachev to 
move forward now more quickly on the most destabilizing part of the 
military balance and that is on conventional forces 
q well were you pressure by him and the allies 
a no i think i said when i first came in we are going to take 
our time and we are going to study and we are going to think it 
out and we did exactly that and you know and i know that some 
voices were raised in congress that we are going too slow but we 
knew exactly what we were doing all along and we have now said this 
is what we suggest and this is the way we plan to lead lead the 
alliance and lead the free world 
q mr president why is it possible make such drastic cuts in 
conventional weapons and not move on nuclear groundbased 
shortrange missiles which seems to disturb the germans and really 
a majority of the alliance 
a because the conventional forces the existing imbalance is so 
great that that is the most urgent problem and the most 
destabilizing 
q following up on that question if the soviets accept this 
proposal would that enable us to talk about reducing or 
eliminating shortrange forces 
a after agreement was reached and after there was some 
implementation yes we are not unwilling to negotiate on snf 
strategic nuclear forces 
q what was the reaction of the nato leaders this morning when 
you told them did you consult with all the allies before you put 
it on the table 
a we had widespread and i would think every one was 
consulted i know we had widespread consultation and 
secretary of state james a baker iii the answer is yes 
bush the answer is yes to all nato members it has been done 
over the last few days 
q what did you tell them about it why did they find it 
appealing 
bush ill leave it to them to wax euphoric but ill tell you i 
was very very pleased with the response in the meeting just 
concluded 
q mr president can you ever see a time when you might not 
have nuclear forces in europe 
a no 
q never 
a because the we need the concept of flexible response and i 
cant in the foreseeable future see us getting away from that 
q is there any indication that this disagreement with the west 
germans over the snf issue will be resolved here at the nato summit 
a well im not really at liberty to go into too much on that 
because right now theyve put together we put together a working 
group to try to work out some resolution but you see this 
proposal bold proposal in terms of conventional forces should 
give those who have had difficulty with our position on snf a 
chance to regroup and rethink and give them a little leeway that 
they havent had heretofore 
q do you expect early negotiation by the secretary of state 
with mr shevardnadze or mr gorbachev on this proposal mr 
president 
a the sooner the better

<TEXT>
q theres been some criticism in congress as you mentioned that 
you have been too cautious in approaching the soviet union was 
that sentiment expressed today by anyone and how did they was 
there any mention of how the west should respond to gorbachev 
a no it wasnt mentioned by anyone in there generally when it 
was your question about how to respond to gorbachev without 
putting words into their mouths of various participants there was 
enthusiastic endorsement i cant speak for everybody but for 
those who have intervened so far 
q mr bush have you costed out this proposal and did the 
budget constraints play any part in your decision to try to 
a no the budgetary constraints didnt and i havent seen a 
full cost analysis some of this would be quite expensive for us 
short run the pulling people out but we did check militarily i 
did not want to propose something that was militarily unsound our 
top military people are for this our saceur supreme allied 
commander europe commander who wears many hats and represents 
many countries obviously is for this so we checked it in that 
sense 
q mr president in some of your early speeches you expressed 
deep skepticism about what was going on in the soviet union you 
said this new relationship cannot be bestowed it must be earned 
your secretary of defense said he felt gorbachev would fail what 
prompted change in your thinking to make a proposal like this 
a this is to put it to the test this is to say here we go 
were out there now with a proposal that the united states puts 
forward and that has widespread alliance support now test it how 
serious are you are you really want to reduce the imbalances 
that exist in all these categories or do we want rhetoric 
and so what were saying were not changing im not changing 
my mind ive said i want to see perestroika succeed ive said i 
want to see us move forward in arms reduction indeed weve set a 
date for the resumption of the start talks but eyes wide open and 
here we go now on the offense with a proposal that is bold and 
tests whether the soviet union will move toward balance or whether 
they insist on retaining an unacceptable conventional force 
imbalance 
q on the question of mr gorbachev do you believe he will fail 
a i want to see him succeed and ive said that and ill repeat 
it here im not making predictions as to whats going to happen 
inside the soviet union those are hard tea leaves to read but i 
would like to see him succeed he seems stronger now than he has 
been earlier on but he faces enormous problems and i hope he looks 
at this proposal as a way to help solve some of those enormous 
problems it gets to the question of finance to maintain this 
number of troops outside of his country 
q mr president does this fourpoint proposal represent your 
conditions before that the soviets must accept before you will 
open talks on the shortrange missiles 
a as i said earlier weve got to have a reduction in 
conventional forces and then some implementation of that proposal 
q mr president you described this as a proposal to the other 
allies do you expect its going to be adopted as a formal alliance 
position at the end of this meeting and then will you put it on the 
table at cfe very soon 
a i cant answer that procedurally id like to see it adopted 
but i dont know that people have had enough time to really do 
you know whats planned on that al 
alton g keel jr us representative to nato i think 
clearly the alliance will adopt it mr president in terms of the 
concept but then will assign it to the proper mechanism here at 
nato to finish the details on it 
q why actually destroy the equipment and demobilize the troops 
a well because then we get verified we hope verified 
reductions that last you cant just juggle around the players on 
the chessboard 
q mr president theres been a lot of talk at the white 
house lately about public relations gambits do you believe that 
this initiative by the united states puts mr gorbachev on the 
defensive and does it in any way put the united states back on top 
of any public relations war that might be going on 
a well one were eschewed getting involved in a public 
relations battle this is too serious a business alliance security 
is too serious the safety and security of american forces for 
which i have direct responsibility as commander in chief is too 
serious to be jeopardized by feeling we always have to be out front 
on some public relations gambit and i think we all know that in 
certain quarters in the united states my administration has taken a 
little bit of a hammering for not engaging in the public relations 
battle 
but what weve been doing is formulating what i think is a very 
prudent plan and now that plan is out there on the table so i 
really cant comment on the public relations aspect what im 
interested in the security aspect and the strength of the alliance 
and then the future the ability of the alliance to move beyond 
containment 
q a longterm benefit of this proposal would obviously be a 
decrease in defense spending now how much of this proposal was 
driven by budget considerations 
a well i thought i answered that but let me try again to be 
clearer none what drove the proposal was the military and 
alliance considerations and i would agree that if this proposal is 
fully implemented longer run as you put it it would have 
budgetary would result in less spending particularly if the 
troops are and the weapons are demobilized as we say 
q mr president just to be clear on one point what youre 
proposing is an agreement with the warsaw pact not anything that 
you will do unilaterally that you wont take any of these steps 
yourselves outside an overall agreement with the greater than 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP890529-0065 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
a this is a nato proposal and it would be negotiated with the 
pact but it means that obviously when youre dealing with the 
pact that the soviet union is going to have to be the key player 
and the proposal this part of the proposal as it relates to us 
troops clearly is one where theres both the soviet general 
secretary and i have to have agreement 
but i want to keep the negotiations and the initiatives inside 
of the alliance we came over here to say the alliance has worked 
its kept the peace for 40 years and we want to continue to keep 
it strong and thats one reason i am very pleased with the 
alliance response to our proposal they dont see it as soloing off 
there or taking care of us interests they see it as in the 
interests of the alliance 
and again i believe i speak i believe well i know most of the 
people there feel that way and i hope all of them 
this is the last one and then im going in peace 
q a ticktock question when you make the final decision to 
accept this idea how did it evolve 
a twelve days ago 
q one last one sir do you have any interest in discussing 
this with mr gorbachev at a summit meeting do you have any 
interest or intention of discussing this proposal or other arms 
proposals with mr gorbachev at a summit meeting 
a when i have a summit meeting with mr gorbachev i expect 
well associate a wide discuss a wide array of subjects 
q do you anticipate that this year 
a when that happens i will have wide farflung discussions 
and no date has been set for that 
q is it likely to be speeded up though mr president because 
of this proposal 
a hadnt thought of it in this connection but i would not 
rule that out but well see how its digested there in moscow i 
hope favorably 
q isnt it time for a summit now sir now that youve laid 
this out 
a bakers got some more work to do

president raul alfonsin has 
announced an emergency package aimed at easing an economic crisis 
that caused looting of supermarkets and food stores in major cities 
alfonsin in a nationally televised speech promised sunday 
night that his lameduck government will make sure food gets to the 
people in an extremely dangerous and cruelly damaging economic 
crisis 
as he spoke in rosario the nations thirdlargest city looters 
raided about 50 food stores in groups of 20 to 40 people according 
to a local public safety director edgardo zotto 
the official news agency telam said 20 people were arrested in 
the city 150 miles north of the capital police a specialized 
military unit and firefighters were patrolling the city the agency 
said residents of the poorest neighborhoods took part in the 
lootings zotto said 
the incidents were similar to dozens of others that began 
tuesday in cordoba the second largest city and quickly spread to 
other cities including workingclass suburbs of the capital 
some looters have eaten food in the stores 
the looting was the first of its kind in argentina although it 
has been common in other south american countries such as brazil 
the general labor confederation was to meet in the capital today 
to decide whether to stage a general strike the 14th against the 
government since alfonsin took office in december 1983 
in his speech alfonsin called on argentines to roll up your 
sleeves and go to work to ensure that emergency steps work 
the government will dictate clear and tough rules to put an 
end to the risk of hyperinflation will surgically put state 
finances in order and will severely punish speculative maneuvers 
alfonsin said 
he also offered to modify some of our criteria to fit plans 
of the presidentelect carlos menem and the peronist party who 
defeated the governing radical civic union in may 14 elections 
menem replaces alfonsin on dec 10 
alfonsins measures some of which require congressional 
approval include a return to monetary exchange controls with an 
official exchange rate for the austral argentinas currency which 
has lost 90 percent of its value over the last four months 
alfonsin did not say what the official value of the austral 
would be the central bank announced sunday that an exchange 
holiday ordered on may 22 would remain in effect today 
the austral had been allowed to float since early february when 
17 bought a dollar the currency closed at 170 to the dollar on the 
last day exchange markets were open 
exchange operations will be closely watched and violations of 
controls will be considered crimes alfonsin said 
the exchange markets and the banking system will be 
progressively regularized alfonsin said banks which fear a 
run on deposits were closed may 22 and 23 and were allowed to open 
may 24 with withdrawals limited to 20000 australs about 100 
every two days 
consumer price policies will remain unchanged alfonsin said 
although the government has not set price ceilings for consumer 
goods prices may not be increased without specific official 
approval 
retailers have ignored the regulations marking up prices almost 
daily and the cost of living increase for may is expected to top 60 
percent 
excesses will not be tolerated especially those that have 
been observed in recent days alfonsin said 
he also warned that pricing of goods in any currency other than 
the austral will be punishable by law numerous retailers recently 
have begun pricing goods in dollars 
government spending also will be cut and a scheduled 
presidential trip to france will be canceled alfonsin said 
the emergency plan must become everyones program or it is 
condemned to failure he said i ask each and every argentine 
to occupy his battle station

prosecutors on monday ended their investigation 
into a bribery scandal that brought down prime minister noboru 
takeshita and shook public confidence in the government 
the prosecutors closed the eightmonth inquiry by bringing 
misdemeanor charges against four aides to senior politicians 
another 13 businessmen bureaucrats and legislators have been 
charged with bribery in the scandal 
the prosecutors have done everything that they should have 
said justice minister masami takatsuji 
much of the ruling party elite has been implicated in the 
scandal that sent public approval ratings of the government to 
alltime lows a close aide to takeshita committed suicide april 
26 the day after the prime minister said he would resign 
but only two lawmakers face prosecution in the scandal and the 
announcement of the investigations end drew immediate charges that 
others who might be involved in the scandal had gotten away 
this will not satisfy the citizens of japan tsuruo 
yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the opposition japan socialist 
party said 
yamaguchi called for further questioning in parliament of former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who monday resigned from the 
governing liberal democratic party last week nakasone testified 
before a parliamentary committee about his links to recruit co 
and acknowledged receiving 320000 from the publishing giant 
but nakasone insisted he was innocent of any wrongdoing and 
refused demands from opposition parties to resign from parliament 
to take responsibility for the scandal which occurred during his 
198287 term as prime minister 
takeshita who said he would step down after he acknowledged 
receiving 1 million from recruit urged party elders to accept 
foreign minister sousuke uno as his successor takeshita hinted 
that he and his cabinet will resign thursday 
the resignations will be followed by a party convention to elect 
a new party president and on friday parliament is expected to 
elect a new prime minister because the liberal democrats hold a 
large majority in both houses the party choice will automatically 
be voted prime minister 
uno 66 who was first elected to the house of representatives 
in 1960 has been minister of international trade and industry and 
head of the defense agency he is not linked to the recruit scandal 
and has experience in foreign affairs 
but some party members have said uno lacks the experience in 
party affairs that is indispensable to carry out needed reforms and 
salvage the partys plunging popularity 
recruit is accused of trying to influence the government by 
handing out millions of dollars in political donations and selling 
underpriced unlisted stock shares to business and political 
leaders in 1986 the stock quickly rose in price when placed on the 
market and those who received the unlisted shares reaped tens of 
thousands of dollars in profits 
charged monday were tsuneo hattori an aide to former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa fumio shimizu a aide to liberal 
democratic party secretary general shintaro abe and kikuo 
katayama and masayoshi sakamaki aides to former agriculture 
minister mutsuki kato 
the four allegedly failed to report donations from recruit if 
found guilty of the misdemeanor charges they face fines of up to 
1400

anatoly i lukyanov was virtually unknown to the 
country when he was confirmed monday as vice president to his old 
law school classmate mikhail s gorbachev 
the televised questioning of lukyanov by deputies in the soviet 
parliament gave millions their first glimpse of the trim 
bespectacled legal specialist who has worked his whole life in the 
state and communist party apparatus 
lukyanov 59 emerged from the process as a man adept at the 
ageold political skill of evading piercing questions and as could 
be expected a loyal supporter of gorbachev who was once his 
deputy 
historian roy a medvedev disclosed during the questioning that 
in the early 1950s lukyanov was chairman of a party youth 
committee at moscow state university when gorbachev was its vice 
chairman both were studying law at the university 
lukyanov fielded dozens of questions from members of the 
congress of peoples deputies ranging from his attitude toward the 
rising crime rate to the 1939 sovietgerman pact that led to the 
forced incorporation of the baltic republics into the soviet union 
tamaz v gamkrelidze of the southern republic of georgia 
demanded to know lukyanovs exact role in events that led antiriot 
forces to move against proindependence demonstrators in tbilisi on 
april 9 resulting in at least 20 deaths 
as with most other questions lukyanov carefully sidestepped a 
direct answer pointing to ongoing investigations of the events 
medvedev questioned whether lukyanov will pursue gorbachevs 
policies faithfully when gorbachev is abroad or on vacation 
policy sometimes changes 50 60 or even 180 degrees medvedev 
said 
lukyanov replied with general statements of support for 
gorbachevs efforts to democratize the soviet union and remove the 
stalinist abuses of the past 
western analysts assume the old ties and similarities between 
the two prompted gorbachev last fall to pluck lukyanov from the 
obscurity of the bureaucracy to make him a candidate member of the 
partys ruling politburo and vice president of the supreme soviet 
the old parliament 
on monday under the restructured political system that permits 
gorbachev to pick his own vice president subject to confirmation 
by the congress he won overwhelming backing as first deputy of the 
chairman of the supreme soviet or more simply vicepresident 
according to constitutional reforms approved last year the 
first deputy and a yettobedetermined number of deputies to 
gorbachev can fulfill certain of the presidents functions if 
gorbachev authorizes them to do so 
they also are entitled to replace gorbachev in the case of his 
absence or if he is incapable of performing his duties the 
constitution does not specifically make lukyanov gorbachevs 
successor in such event 
little is known about lukyanovs early career he was born may 
7 1930 in smolensk and began work at 13 in a world war ii 
munitions factory in the saratov region on the volga river in 
southern russia 
joining the communist party in 1955 lukyanov went to work as a 
government legal consultant after completing his legal studies in 
1956 
in that capacity he helped reach agreements on soviet 
assistance to poland and hungary in 1956 when both countries saw 
uprisings against stalinist rule 
in 1985 when gorbachev became party chief lukyanov was named 
to head the party central committees general department which 
handles domestic affairs in 1987 he rose to become central 
committee secretary for politburo staff work and supervision of the 
military security intelligence and legal institutions 
lukyanov is known to have visited denmark in 1986 and yugoslavia 
in 1987 but his answer to a question on his role in czechoslovakia 
after the sovietled warsaw pact invasion of 1968 suggested he was 
among the many of us who went out to help czechoslovakias 
communist party and youth organizations after the invasion 
it is not known whether lukyanov an ethnic russian is married 
or has children

parliamentarians regard raising their 
constituents standard of living as the governments most important 
task but they doubt that they can do much about it according to a 
poll released monday 
the communist party academy that conducted the poll said it 
found roughly half the members of the new congress of peoples 
deputies hold relatively moderate views whereas there appear to be 
more reformers than conservatives in the body 
the poll results distributed at the congress reported 74 
percent of the members questioned said progess toward a higher 
standard of living was the most important goal 
in answer to another question 55 percent said they thought 
their sessions could have a positive but not significant effect 
on living standards and 27 percent said they could do nothing to 
improve economic conditions 
the poll of 1347 of the 2250 deputies was conducted saturday 
by the communist party central committees academy of social 
sciences that was the same day the congress broke into an angry 
debate over the selection of members of the 542 members of the 
supreme soviet standing legislature 
an outnumbered group of reformers complained that regional 
officials had stacked the lists of candidates with legislators who 
would preserve the status quo 
the pollsters said the balance of power in the session was held 
by a moderate group of about 40 percent to 55 percent of the 
deputies 
their report also identified a group with more radical 
expectations and lesser satisfaction consisting of about 25 
percent to 30 percent of those polled and on the other side a 
group with more cautious approaches exhibiting a greater degree 
of satisfaction consisting of about 15 percent to 20 percent of 
the members 
the deputies said they could have the greatest effect in making 
soviet society more open and democratic sixty percent responded 
they could significantly improve openness and freedom of speech 
and another 29 percent said they were capable of making a less 
noticeable improvement 
the report said 74 percent did not regard the opening of soviet 
society as irreversible or considered the changes so far as only 
halfmeasures 
the proceedings of the body ranging from longwinded discussion 
of parliamentary procedure to angry debate and pointed 
interrogation of the kremlin leadership have been televised live 
the figures also indicated that 55 percent found their 
expectations of the congress more or less fulfilled by its first 
days but an almost equal number 54 percent were dissatisfied 
with the handling of procedural questions twentyseven percent 
were most upset about the behavior of other deputies and 26 
percent were most upset by a lack of organization 
a poll of 1832 citizens by the soviet academy of sciences in 
six cities on friday indicated a vast majority of those polled were 
following the congress carefully in broadcasts from moscow and 
generally approved of what they saw that poll was published monday 
by the government newspaper izvestia

president bush today proposed a 20 
percent cut in us combat troops in europe and challenged soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to order comparable troop 
withdrawals to transform the military map by 1993 
here we go now on the offense with a proposal that will test 
the soviet union said bush clearly seeking to seize the 
initiative in eastwest relations at the opening of the twoday 
nato summit 
finessing a divisive quarrel among western leaders over the 
issue of modernizing shortrange nuclear missiles bush countered 
gorbachevs recent disarmament proposals with a major plan to 
achieve balance between the conventional forces of nato and 
eastbloc warsaw pact armies 
challenging gorbachev at a televised news conference after he 
outlined his proposals for 15 other nato leaders bush asked how 
serious are you do you really want to reduce the imbalance or 
do you just want rhetoric 
bushs plan includes a ceiling of 275000 troops each for the 
american and soviet sides in europe which would require a 20 
percent reduction in us troop strength and a withdrawal of 
325000 soviet troops to achieve the same level 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney said nato leaders 
unanimously endorsed the proposal which is to be offered at 
conventional forces talks with the soviets 
us troop levels in western europe now range between 305000 
and 325000 while some western estimates put soviet troop strength 
in central and eastern europe at more than 600000 
the 20 percent reduction applies to the 150000 us combat 
troops stationed in nato countries once an additional 150000 
support personnel are taken into account bushs cutback would 
affect about 10 percent of the us military force in europe 
after first briefing the western allies privately bush sent 
gorbachev a letter on sunday outlining the us proposals 
today bush won an enthusiastic response from western leaders 
who had been pressing washington to regain the offensive from 
gorbachev 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said bushs proposals 
had transformed the summit and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl a key figure in the missile dispute hailed the presidents 
great initiative for rapidly reducing conventional arms 
bush thus succeeded in taking the summit spotlight away from 
west germanys demands for early eastwest negotiations to reduce 
and perhaps eliminate shortrange nuclear missiles in europe 
bush ruled out any such negotiations soon at least until a 
comprehensive conventional arms agreement is implemented and said 
he would never accept the idea of a nuclearfree europe 
the president said a nato working group had been established to 
seek a compromise on the missile dispute 
in another major move bush said he was recommending that the 
west drpop its nineyear automatic ban on transfers of computers 
and other high technology to the soviet union this economic 
sanction was imposed after the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
in december 1979 
if the nato allies give their expected approval such transfers 
would be considered on a casebycase basis to determine if they 
posed a threat to western security 
facing criticism that he has moved too cautiously in responding 
to soviet arms proposals bush said here we go now on the 
offense with the plan to reduce conventional forces in europe 
his plan also included nato willingness for the first time to 
negotiate limits on combat helicopters and aircraft throughout 
europe as part of a convention arms agreement 
bush also proposed locking in soviet acceptance of proposed 
western ceilings on each sides arsenals of tanks and armored troop 
carriers and said a similar ceiling on artillery would be sought 
bush urged his nato partners to endorse his plan and send it to 
allied negotiators in conventional force talks with the sovietled 
warsaw pact which began in vienna austria last march 
he said an agreement could be reached in six months or maybe a 
year if all went well and could be implemented by 1992 or 1993 
the president said secretary of states james a baker iii was 
available to meet with gorbachev or soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze the sooner the better 
if it were accepted it would be a revolutionary conventional 
arms control agreement bush said 
if the soviet union accepts this fair offer the results would 
dramatically increase stabililty on the continent and transform the 
military map of europe he said we can and must begin now to 
set out a new vision for europe at the end of this century 
early this month gorbachev offered to accept ceilings on soviet 
forces in all warsaw pact countries as well as a ceiling on overall 
soviet forces 
bush called his proposals a fair offer that signals a 
willingness on our part to really put mr gorbachev to the test 
kohl congratulated bush for this farsighted step with which 
he has once more impressively affirmed the united states 
leadership 
although mrs thatcher was similarly complimentary she warned 
that the interim period will be a time of vulnerability and 
risk that required maintaining a sufficiency of shortrange 
nuclear missiles on the continent 
a small band of protesters prayed beat drums and distributed 
leaflets as bush entered nato headquarters this morning with 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
the two days of talks in the barrackslike alliance headquarters 
opened with an address by nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
who warned against letting the missile dispute jeopardize natos 
unity in dealing with the soviets 
only if we remain united will we determine events woerner 
said divided even with all our successes and dynamism we will 
be the victims of events determined by others all of us without 
exception 
the nato chief said gorbachevs reforms were evidence that the 
east is turning to the west and that communism has manifestly 
failed 
but woerner warned summit leaders against putting their trust in 
gorbachevs good intentions 
for years he said the west will face a formidable and 
unpredictable military power as our neighbor and while we do 
not need permanently to suspect his intentions he said we 
cannot build our security on the assumption of his permanent good 
will 
outside the main entrance to nato headquarters a dozen japanese 
buddhist monks beat drums and prayed next to a sign in french which 
read nato bloc 40 years is enough 
other demonstrators handed out leaflets boasting of the 
imminent separation of the usa from europe because of the dispute 
over shortrange nuclear missiles and gorbachevs arms reduction 
offers 
bush arriving sunday evening from a twoday visit to italy 
declared that nato is at once ready to ensure the common defense 
and to reduce arms and seek to diminish tensions with the east 
although the summit had been billed as a celebration of natos 
40th anniversary the talks were clouded by discord largely between 
the united states and britain on one side and west germany on the 
other 
responding to disarmament sentiment in west germany bonn has 
called for early eastwest negotiations on shortrange missiles 
most of which are based in west germany and would be used against 
forces on german soil 
the united states says the weapons are needed to offset superior 
conventional forces in the sovietled warsaw pact 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher insisted 
sunday at a german political rally that disarmament cannot 
exclude any kind of weapon 
a spokesman for mrs thatcher said it was possible no deal on 
the missile issue would be reached at the summit we arent in 
the business of a bad agreement we are in the business of 
retaining flexible defense said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity

the troop cuts proposed monday by 
president bush pull together the ranks of nato for its own 
disarmament offensive and shelve disunity in the alliance over 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
the split between the united states and britain on the one 
side and west germany and many others of the 16 alliance members 
over the shortrange missiles had stalled a coordinated nato 
response to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs arms 
initiatives 
but for the sake of a united western effort to seize momentum 
from the kremlin west germany appears now to have put aside its 
nuclear grievance 
the european allies of the united states hailed bushs call for 
equal ceilings on nato and warsaw pact troop levels in europe 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said bushs proposal 
had transformed the summit spanish foreign minister franciso 
fernandez ordonez said bush had given a new impetus to conventional 
arms talks in vienna 
even west german chancellor helmut kohl hailed the proposal as a 
great initiative and said his first priority was that the 
summit be a success 
bushs move does little to resolve the contentious dispute over 
when and whether the superpowers should take gorbachev up on his 
request to negotiate on shortrange nuclear missiles deployed in 
europe 
but mondays proposal does offer a facesaving alternative for 
the bonn leadership and could set the superpowers on the track 
toward substantial cuts in the number of soldiers deployed in 
europe by both military blocs 
gorbachev has pushed for reducing the military presence of both 
east and west to minimum levels and earlier this month said he 
would be willing to go along with ceilings on troop strength 
if accepted by both alliances bushs proposal would remove at 
least 325000 soviet soldiers from europe and at least 30000 
american troops or in all about 40 percent of the superpowers 
combined european forces 
it would also set ceilings on tanks armored personnel carriers 
and artillery pieces and open negotiations to limit combat 
aircraft and helicopters across europe 
pressured by a populace eager to take the soviet leader at his 
word west german leaders had until monday insisted that the united 
states agree to the soviet call for shortrange missile 
negotiations 
most of natos shortrange nuclear weapons arsenal is based in 
west germany where antinuclear sentiments have been gaining 
ground since the 1987 superpower treaty calling for the destruction 
of all intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
as the mediumrange rockets have been removed nato has shifted 
to west germany the burden of retaining a nuclear response option 
to repel a possible attack by the warsaw pacts superior 
conventional forces 
nato leaders announced soon after beginning their twoday 
meeting that the shortrange missile issue was being shunted into a 
special working group an apparent effort to focus attention on 
bushs troop cut initiative on which the allies all agree 
west german government spokesman hans klein told reporters the 
committee had been established to keep the shortrange issue from 
dominating the summit 
in his opening address at the summit kohl praised bushs 
proposal but reiterated his governments push for talks on the 
shortrange nuclear weapons systems 
president bush has today paved the way for further success of 
our alliance kohl declared i congratulate him on this 
farsighted step 
then invoking the words of john f kennedy kohl added 
let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to 
negotiate 
asked at a news conference whether shortrange weapons talks 
could be expected in the future bush replied after agreement 
was reached and after some implementation of conventional force 
reductions yes 
it was not immediately clear how long kohls coalition partners 
especially liberal foreign minister hansdietrich genscher would 
be willing to put off resolution of the nuclear issue 
genscher and kohl are known to be divided on how far west 
germany should push the shortrange issue they arrived separately 
for the summit and their delegations are even in different hotels 
bushs troop cut proposal is unlikely to suppress the growing 
west german popular movement for reductions in the shortrange 
missiles stockpiles 
but it may ease west germans concerns about the more than 
400000 foreign troops in their country whose maneuvers and 
lowflying training exercises have stirred widespread protest

first lady barbara bush accompanied by 
belgiums queen fabiola on monday comforted a young woman who was 
overcome with emotion during a presentation to the presidents wife 
at a special village for mentally handicapped adults 
mrs bush in brussels with her husband for the nato summit 
toured the village while the president outlined dramatic new arms 
control proposals to the western leaders 
the 20yearold woman identified only by her first name 
beatrice was overcome as she gave the presidents wife a 
puppetlike witch on a broomstick that she had made herself 
mrs bush took the present and then realizing that the young 
woman was crying stepped over and patted her comfortingly on the 
shoulder 
the incident came at the end of the visit by mrs bush and the 
queen to the village 20 miles south of brussels 
the village financed mainly with government funds is home to 
175 mentally handicapped adults it was founded in 1963 by parents 
wanting to provide a longterm home for their children once family 
members are dead or can no longer care for them 
its an absolutely wonderful project said mrs bush adding 
that she felt honored to be here 
the converted brick farmhouse and outlying houses lie in the 
shade of trees in quiet gardens filled with flowers its a very 
peaceful place said mrs bush 
beatrice still looking a bit shaken said afterward that 
meeting mrs bush had made her very emotional 
at one point the first lady asked jean wauters the president 
of the village about the residency program and whether the 
residents were separated from their families 
the residents live in duplex homes in groups of 12 with a 
married couple who look after them but the residents do their own 
housework choose their menus and as mrs bush noted decorate 
their bedrooms to their taste 
during the day residents work in a shop counting supermarket 
discount coupons the only such operation in belgium or package 
supermarket goods 
for their 7hour working day the residents are paid between 
108 and 210 belgian francs an hour 250 to 5 which is the 
going rate for belgian manual laborers said catherine mottet a 
psychologist at the village 
mrs bush was welcomed by two 20yearold resident robert and 
judith at the start of the morning tour they gave the first lady 
and the queen bouquets of red white and blue flowers judith 
needed a little encouragement from the educator who accompanied 
them to part with her flowers 
mrs bush and fabiola kissed the two 
the first lady said that more such residences were needed in the 
united states 
mrs bush regretted that she spoke no french i just wish i 
could say in french what i really feel but she did manage 
merci beaucoup thank you very much 
mrs bush donated to the village a machine for ear nose and 
throat examinations

many jewish settlers in the 
occupied lands believe the army is complacent about stonings and 
firebomb attacks and they are making their own response with raids 
on palestinian communities 
they beat and shoot palestinians burn cars and smash the 
windows of houses 
in a rampage monday west bank settlers attacked kifl harith 
village near the ariel settlement setting crops olive trees and a 
house ablaze villagers threw stones and the settlers opened fire 
killing a 16yearold girl and wounding two other palestinians 
according to army and arab reports 
her death brought to 18 the number of arabs killed by israeli 
settlers in nearly 18 months of palestinian rebellion in all 500 
palestinians have been slain most by soldiers and 22 israelis 
have died 
israeli commentators said the level of violence between the 
70000 settlers and 17 million palestinians is unprecedented since 
the uprising began in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
columnist alex fishman wrote in the independent newspaper 
hadashot if it isnt stopped now there will be mutual massacres 
between jews and arabs 
the focus of tension in the west bank is hebron a town of 
80000 palestinians adjoined by kiryat arba an outpost of 5000 
militant jews who want the west bank annexed to israel 
in a twohour period on a recent weekday morning a reporter saw 
three motor patrols of settlers armed with uzi submachine guns and 
pistols drive through the center of town 
soldiers also make frequent patrols four young palestinians 
darted from a narrow alley and pelted two army jeeps with empty 
bottles and rocks but the troopers fired into the air and the 
youths vanished 
maj gen amram mitzna army commander in the west bank was 
quoted in the jerusalem post as telling a parliament committee an 
explosive situation has developed because of settler attitudes 
and actions 
he appealed to the lawmakers to help stop settlers from 
assaulting soldiers who try to prevent vigilante raids 
settlers contend prime minister yitzhak shamirs government and 
the army command are too lenient with the palestinians 
noam arnon spokesman for the gush emunin settler movement said 
this week the army doesnt do anything against the arabs 
on the day mitzna addressed the committee settlers stopped 
palestinian motorists and beat three of them after a boobytrapped 
israeli flag with a swastika painted on it blew the hand off an 
israeli who picked it up 
arab reports said settlers also entered burin village near 
nablus and beat two men in their homes 
last thursdy night after two firebombs narrowly missed a 
settler outside kiryat arba scores of settlers attacked an arab 
neighborhood of hebron 
jawdat jabari 24 said about 100 jews armed with rifles 
pistols and stones attacked his house shouting death to the 
arabs he said stones shattered the porch windows and a burst of 
gunfire hit the wall near the front door 
his 21yearold brother judeh said the raiders knew the 
jabaris well because several members of the family worked at kiryat 
arba 
most of those who stoned us used to come to this house and 
drink coffee and tea without even knocking on the door judeh 
said and added angrily there is no way that the jews and the 
arabs can live together ever we will hate them wherever they go 
fakri attiyah dana a 50yearold vegetable merchant told of a 
raid april 27 by about 50 settlers who burned 1500 crates stored 
on his roof then shot holes in his water tank he showed a 
reporter 20 bullet holes in the walls 
as he spoke four teenaged israeli settlers stood on a nearby 
hilltop with slingshots launching stones at passing arab 
motorists soldiers arrived 15 minutes later and chased them away 
dana claimed five army jeeps accompanied the settlers april 27 
but an army spokesman denied that and other palestinian claims of 
soldiers joining settlers or doing nothing to stop them 
he said some of the reports might be explained by settlers 
wearing reserve army uniforms a violation of regulations 
arnon said the raids were a warning to militant young 
palestinians to tell them boys take it easy we can also do 
something 
i dont hate anyone said the gush emunin spokesman who 
directs the kiryat arba religious studies center i want to live 
with them in peace but whosoever attacks me and wants to kill me 
ill kill them it is written in the bible

communist maverick boris n yeltsin who was 
denied a seat on the supreme soviet over the weekend won a 
position on the new standing legislature today when a siberian 
professor resigned in his favor 
in a surprise move the congress of peoples deputies allowed 
alexei kazannik to step down and give his seat to yeltsin who 
received the largest popular vote of any candidate when he won a 
seat on the congress in march on saturday the congress chose from 
among its members to form the supreme soviet 
through a quirk in the election procedure yeltsin the former 
moscow party boss and populist candidate finished last on a list 
of 12 candidates for 11 russian federation seats in one of the two 
chambers of the supreme soviet 
he was therefore defeated despite his having received more than 
50 percent of the votes cast by his fellow deputies 
after yeltsin and other prominent reformminded deputies were 
defeated in their bids for seats in supreme soviet tens of 
thousands of people rallied in moscow to protest the protesters 
charged that the vote by members of the congress was undemocratic 
and television news said a poll found half the people surveyed to 
be dissatisfied with how it was held 
after kazannik withdrew today president mikhail gorbachev said 
inasmuch as comrade yeltsin received a majority of the vote the 
open place can be filled by him naturally it does not require a 
repeat vote 
only a few deputies opposed a proposal by estonian delegate 
victor palm to allow yelstin to take the seat gorbachev told 
kazannik the congress welcomed his initiative 
earlier today gorbachev pushed his littleknown choice for vice 
president through the conress of peoples deputies after preventing 
competitors from being nominated gorbachev made clear from the 
outset today that he intended to have the congress confirm his 
choice of schoolmate anatoly i lukyanov without allowing competing 
nominations from the floor 
but the soviet president permitted almost four hours of blunt 
and cutting debate before putting the question to a vote 
of the 2250 deputies only 179 voted against lukyanov in a show 
of hands there were 137 abstentions 
yeltsin celebrated his victory today with an impromptu march 
from the kremlin up moscows gorky street he was greeted by 
wellwishers at the kremlins troitsky gate and the crowd moved 
with him across a huge square and set off up gorky street one of 
downtown moscows major avenues 
yeltsin picked up a crowd of 200 followers on his way up the 
sidewalk supporters handed him pink roses and red carnations and 
shouted hurrah as he passed we knew he was an honest 
person said anna sabalova we knew he was elected by millions 
but just a few in the congress held him back 
yeltsin was dismissed as moscow communist party chief in 1987 
after saying that gorbachevs reforms were not proceeding fast 
enough he was given a position in the construction ministry when 
he won a seat in the congress he achieved one of the most stunning 
political comebacks on soviet history 
there was no direct vote on selecting yeltsin to fill the seat 
on the supreme soviet today but the hall broke into applause after 
the controversial exmember of the ruling polituburo was given a 
legislative seat 
yeltsin walked out of the congress hall with kazannik smiling 
and met a horde of reporters he said the decision showed the 
congress had fallen into line with the will of the people 
communist party politburo member yegor k ligachev whose 
resignation yeltsin has demanded after accusing him of impeding 
reforms told reporters the decision was democratic and 
normal 
during the questioning of gorbachevs choice for vice president 
historian roy medvedev told applauding deputies they needed to know 
more about lukyanov before they could make him the countrys no 2 
government official because policies change whenever the president 
leaves the kremlin 
when gorbachev goes on vacation or goes abroad the whole 
state policy changes 50 60 or 180 percent said medvedev 
whose studies of stalinism were banned for many years 
telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov a pair of anticorruption 
crusaders who have run afoul of kremlin authorities quizzed 
lukyanov who already serves as vice president on the sharp rise 
in crime and his attitude toward a highlevel investigation of the 
two outspoken prosecutors 
lukyanov a 59yearold lawyer originally was elected vice 
president in october by the old supreme soviet which was a rubber 
stamp for the kremlin leadership he has been involved in 
government efforts to rewrite the legal code but is not widely 
known 
he told the deputies that much of the rapid increase in crime 
was due to the soviet unions poor economic condition and said 
legal reforms would make great changes 
the constitution gives gorbachev the right to appoint his own 
vice president subject to confirmation by the congress and 
several deputies complained that they did not have a choice 
in the united states of america they dont vote for the vice 
president gorbachev told the deputies as he pressed for a 
confirmation vote

mikhail gorbachevs reforms in the soviet 
union have rekindled the hopes of three aging diplomats whose 
embassies have survived in obscurity for nearly 50 years nurtured 
by symbols and the benevolence of the united states 
lithuania latvia and estonia the baltic states swallowed up 
by josef stalin in 1940 and which comprise three of the 15 soviet 
republics do not exist at the united nations they do not exist 
at major international organizations their names sound like a 
footnote of historical trivia 
but in downtown washington and midtown manhattan three baltic 
legations hoist their flags daily issue baltic passports and meet 
with us officials 
at the state department a baltic affairs officer conducts 
business as though the soviets had never laid claim to the three 
strategically located states which declared their independence in 
1918 
the us government does not recognize the forced annexation and 
has always treated the three envoys who hold the rank of charge 
daffaires like any other diplomat listing them in the official 
state department diplomatic list and inviting them to all 
receptions for ambassadors 
in recent months however the baltic diplomatic corps has more 
to do than just attend receptions along with us officials they 
have been meeting with a growing stream of nationalists allowed to 
travel to the united states gathering information about the 
unprecedented grassroots swell of demands for greater independence 
in what amounts to a virtual call for secession baltic 
nationalists issued a call earlier this month for economic 
independence from moscow and adopted a platform asserting their 
right to set policies and veto directives from the kremlin 
the baltic representatives in the united states agree these are 
the most exciting times they have known in nearly 50 years but 
they worry about soviet reprisals 
ernst jaakson has represented estonia in the united states since 
coming to san francisco as a young consul in 1929 in 1937 he was 
transferred to new york 
now in his 80s jaakson appears overwhelmed by the recent surge 
of estonians who openly visit the threeroom legation office 
once they were afraid of the kgb now they come very freely its 
very encouraging he said 
in washington nestled between the ghanaian and polish 
embassies a yellowgreenandred flag flutters over a stone 
mansion that has housed the lithuanian legation since the 1920s it 
is getting a 200000 face lift in response to a revived interest 
in the legation both by soviet and american visitors 
nowadays lithuanian visitors from the soviet union pose for 
photos against the backdrop of the flag and some even ask to be 
issued a lithuanian passport said stasys lozoraitis the charge 
daffaires 
lozoraitis and his staff of four rattle around the fivestory 
mansion which also serves as his home when he is not in rome 
representing lithuania at the vatican 
lozoraitis rejected a suggestion that the baltic legations have 
been kept alive by cia funds the three states pooled investments 
they had made abroad prior to the soviet occupation and live off 
the interest lozoraitis and the other diplomats said 
lozoraitis a courtly softspoken man has diplomacy in his 
blood his father was posted as lithuanias ambassador to the 
vatican just days before the soviets occupied his homeland the 
family never went back 
his fathers predecessor in rome was deported by the soviets to 
siberia as were hundreds of thousands of baltic citizens who 
opposed the takeover lozoraitis said 
attracted by the ferment in the baltic states some 800 american 
students have come in groups to the legation this year and 
lozoraitis happily lectures them about his country and its 
prospects for independence 
i tell them its ridiculous for the soviets to keep us under 
oppression when instead we could be friendly neighbors prosperous 
trade partners a sort of bridge to western europe he said 
the baltic states are generally more prosperous than other parts 
of the soviet union we could be for moscow what hong kong is for 
beijing he said 
the nearly 5 million lithuanians have made great strides toward 
that goal in the past year lozoraitis said our 100 steps 
forward cant be undone they can push us back 10 steps but not 
all the way 
the latvians too are proud but also cautious we cant afford 
to forget the lessons of history said john lusis first 
secretary at the threemember latvian legation the head of the 
legation anatol dinbergs is getting on in years and lusis speaks 
for him 
lusis is of a newer generation of baltic diplomats who have 
never set foot in their homelands he was born in germany to 
latvian parents and lived in canada before coming here 
in the mid1970s the state department recognized that 
replacements would be needed for the veteran baltic diplomats it 
agreed to grant the same diplomatic immunity and privileges to 
younger representatives as long as they were of baltic descent and 
not us citizens 
lozoraitis lusis and the others carry baltic diplomatic 
passports and say the travel documents are recognized by many 
countries including china baltic missions also exist in canada 
and england 
but the soviet bloc is still off limits 
lozoraitis hopes he can use his passport to go home one day 
but right now i still cannot accept going to the russian embassy 
and asking them for a visa instead they should be asking me for a 
visa to visit my own home

a parliament race between a veteran 
dissident and a prominent lawyer who once defended him has turned 
into a struggle for the soul of the solidarityled opposition 
movement 
jacek kuron a founder of the polish opposition movement has 
been endorsed by solidarity leader lech walesa in sundays 
elections the first competitive balloting in poland under 
communist rule 
but kuron is being challenged in his northern warsaw district of 
zoliborz by lawyer wladyslaw silanowicki who defended kuron 
during the political trials in the 1970s 
kuron is among the bestknown of solidaritys intellectual 
advisers some of whom began as communists in the 1950s and 1960s 
but broke with the party long ago those advisers have provided the 
movement with theoretical ammunition in its struggle to wrest 
freedoms from the government 
silanowickis roots are in the preworld war ii christian 
democrats a party that had strong ties to the roman catholic 
church and which is now reorganizing with the tacit approval from 
some bishops and priests 
as part of accords reached with communist authorities april 5 
the opposition agreed to support partially free elections to the 
sejm and a newly created senate in return for legalizing solidarity 
after a sevenyear ban 
the opposition is allotted only 161 seats in the 460seat sejm 
with the rest reserved for the communists the 100 seats in the 
newly created senate are open to all groups making it the first 
democratically elected legislative body in the east bloc 
with his 30year record of opposition activity that includes 
eight years in prison kuron was a natural choice for solidarity to 
endorse for the sejm 
a former communist who was sent to prison for an open letter 
urging the party to reform he helped found the workers defense 
committee after authorities brutally suppressed strikes in 1976 
silanowicki 75 also has a long record serving the opposition 
a soldier in the underground that which resisted nazi and later 
soviet occupation silanowicki notes he was condemned to death 
four times and imprisoned from shortly after the end of world war 
ii until 1956 
in the 1970s he was one of the few lawyers willing to defend 
activists who were continually being arrested 
silanowicki also stresses his links to solidarity in campaign 
literature on some posters his name has been painted to resemble 
the familiar redandwhite solidarity logo 
he notes that he served as an adviser in gdansk in 1980 when 
walesa signed the agreements that legalized the soviet blocs first 
free trade union it was outlawed 18 months later after the martial 
law crackdown 
solidarity candidates posed for photos with walesa as a mark of 
authenticity silanowicki responded with photos showing him with 
polishborn pope john paul ii 
but his campaign literature fails to mention that in 1986 he was 
the only wellknown independent figure who joined an advisory 
council set up by polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski as proof 
that national reconciliation was proceeding others refused saying 
solidarity first should be legalized 
voters unused to being able to choose anyone but officially 
approved candidates are confused 
is he on lechs list one woman asked a silanowicki worker 
at a table outside the st stanislaw kostka church a solidarity 
stronghold when she was told no she said then hes not 
solidarity 
silanowicki is not from zoliborz candidates can run where they 
like and silanowicki said he came to zoliborz specifically to 
challenge kuron 
we are presenting different visions of todays solidarity 
silanowicki told his first election meeting may 14 
silanowicki accused solidarity of not backing enough christian 
democratic candidates and of choosing candidates without consulting 
the rank and file 
seven christian democratic candidates are running nationwide 
but only one is endorsed by solidarity they support free markets 
and the churchs social teachings such as opposition to abortion 
there is a leftist direction in solidarity we would like to 
see a christian path said maciej mazuriewicz a 24yearold 
student supporter of silanowicki 
when the two men debated on may 20 the 700 seats of the wisla 
theater were filled and hundreds more listened outside 
silanowicki received polite applause but the crowd roared when 
kuron emerged

polish citizens around the world will be able to 
vote in next weekends historic election in poland by going to 
their nearest consulate a prospect that has chicagos large polish 
community skeptical but hopeful 
its time for something new communism hasnt worked out 
halina cessna said while looking over imported sauerkraut and hams 
in a polish grocery 
the most important thing is that these are the first elections 
with a choice in many years she said at last the opposition 
has a voice 
the communist government and the opposition solidarity trade 
union on april 5 agreed to polands first somewhat democratic 
balloting since world war ii 
polish citizens living abroad may vote saturday at polish 
consulates in poland voters will go to the polls sunday 
at stake are 460 seats in the existing parliament the sejm and 
100 seats in the newly created senate the opposition is allotted 
161 seats in the sejm with the rest reserved for the communists 
but the race for the senate is wide open 
chicago is said to have more residents of polish descent than 
any city outside warsaw 
weve been fighting for this for so long now that weve got a 
chance we have to go and vote katarzyna kowalinska said as she 
waited to buy sausages in a delicatessen along milwaukee avenue 
sometimes called the polish broadway 
its not really a free election but its a first step said 
ms kowalinska its already a lot therell be a free press and 
free television 
i love my country but im not interested in politics marek 
stachowicz said as he sipped coffee in a tavern across the street 
is my vote going to make a difference no 
robert michniewicz vice consul at the chicago consulate 
estimated 800000 people in the chicago area are of polish descent 
he said about 50000 are still citizens of poland and he expects 
as many as 10000 to vote here a far cry from the 200odd he says 
voted in past polish elections in which only candidates from the 
communist party and its allies ran 
i believe most of the people will vote for the opposition 
michniewicz said in these elections solidarity is encouraging 
people to vote 
poles voting here and at consulates in new york and washington 
will choose from among 32 candidates running for three senate seats 
in warsaws central district he said voters also will fill two 
seats in the sejm 
those wishing to vote must bring a passport some other document 
showing citizenship or an id and two witnesses swearing to a 
persons citizenship 
the election agreement reserving 65 percent of the seats in the 
sejm for the communist party and its allies has some poles here 
questioning the value of the exercise 
if they want democracy they should give us the whole thing 
theres only going to be 35 percent opposition in the sejm said 
a man who asked not to be identified because he is in the united 
states illegally 
the main issue is not how to vote but whether to vote at all 
said maciej wierzynski who was a journalist in poland and produces 
a polishlanguage tv show here 
the people who are going to vote are certainly going to vote 
for the opposition wierzynski said some people say the 
elections are a compromise with the communists but my feeling is 
that most people will vote 
janina domoradzka who was granted political asylum in the 
united states five years ago said she didnt plan to vote 
nothing will change because were too close to the soviet 
union ms domoradzka said the opposition isnt going to be 
able to do anything the polish government wont let them 
the chicagobased polishamerican congress an organization of 
immigrant poles has raised about 200000 nationally to support 
the solidarity candidates said kazimierz lukomski a leader of the 
group

leaders of this town whose 
incredible dullness bored sinclair lewis into writing main 
street say its time to set aside bad feelings toward the author 
and capitalize on his fame 
but the plans are met with skepticism by some who believe lewis 
was right when his main street lambasted the fictional gopher 
prairie minn a thinly disguised version of the central minnesota 
town where lewis was born in 1885 
so they want to redevelop things historically thats what 
ive always tried to do but i never could get this town to wake up 
and realize sinclair lewis gives them the greatest cottage industry 
in the world said al tingley who is selling the palmer house 
hotel he has owned for 15 years 
id love to see sauk centre be all it can be he said 
thats exactly what sinclair lewis was trying to tell them 
realize what you have and try to do more 
but i dont think itll work this town never changes 
the feeling that the town of 3700 about 95 miles northwest of 
minneapolis has not taken advantage of lewis legacy moved 
business owners and local officials to ask for help from charlie 
nelson an architect from the minnesota historical society 
nelson looked at the hodgepodge of signs aluminum siding and 
bland paint and described the town as a mess of plastic and 
kitsch 
theyve got some pretty wellpreserved buildings behind all 
that tin and plastic nelson said but downtown is kind of a 
void its too easy to get out of there without knowing youve ever 
been there 
nelson told his hosts they should use paint awnings and elbow 
grease to bring their downtown buildings back to something 
resembling their original appearance and make the place more 
inviting and evocative 
mayor bob polipnick said the city should use lewis as much as 
we can 
i dont really care if what he said was positive or negative 
as long as people remember sauk centre he said 
often pitiless about his town lewis railed against the 
incredible dullness of it its vacuousness and bad manners and 
spiteful gossip in the 1920 novel main street when heroine 
carol kennicott arrived in the fictional gopher prairie she found 
no dignity in it nor any hope of greatness it was not a place to 
live in not possibly not conceivably 
among lewis other novels are babbitt elmer gantry 
arrowsmith and it cant happen here in 1930 he became the 
first american to win the nobel prize in literature he died in 
1951 
dave simpkins who publishes the newspaper where lewis once 
worked said the revitalization push doesnt mean someone is 
trying to come in and tell people what they ought to do thats 
what carol kennicott tried 
if enough business owners go along he said we can give the 
tourists something unique so someone from omaha will want to 
come the town is conveniently situated along interstate 94 
between minneapolis and fargo nd 
carol frumkin hopes to be the person to turn the hotel and 
maybe the town around frumkin returning to sauk centre 23 years 
after she left has the capital needed to make the palmer house a 
luxury hotel 
she and her husband are moving to a farm outside town this 
summer bringing their wood products import business from 
california she pledges to turn the palmer house into a small 
elegant comfortable hotel with a fine restaurant well refurbish 
everything 
but if you just have the palmer house its nothing frumkin 
said people dont want to come here and just sit in the hotel 
the rest of downtown has to be interesting too

sandra botelho and christina monteiro 
lived parallel lives growing up in this citys brickenwood housing 
project surrounded by toddlers lines of fresh laundry and hard 
drugs 
their sidebyside lives may also have taken them into the path 
of a serial killer botelhos body was one of nine found along 
several highways near this historic port city since last july 
monteiro is one of two women missing and believed dead 
there have been no arrests despite an extensive police 
investigation 
like most of the killer or killers targets botelho and 
monteiro sold their bodies at 20 a shot and bought heroin with the 
cash 
sitting around a dinner table monteiros brothers and sisters 
threw out easy memories of their sister who loved swimming family 
picnics and dancing to rhythm and blues 
shirley monteiro took down from shelves framed photographs of 
first communions and her daughter who would now be 21 grinning 
wide at her baby shower three years ago 
but monteiro like 25yearold botelho got caught in a web of 
drugs 
they were good friends said deborah botelho sandras 
sister they shared clothes together went dancing together and 
shot up together 
botelho had spent 10 years with a man relatives say was abusive 
but in the last months of her life she still struggled to get a 
high school equivalency diploma and entertained thoughts of 
becoming a secretary 
her sister said she even thought about becoming a cop if you 
can believe that 
she kept ending up back on the streets 
still friends and family say sandra botelhos two sons age 5 
and 7 always had clean clothes and food 
its hard to stay up all night doing drugs and be up cooking 
eggs for the kids in the morning but she did it said deborah 
botelho 
commitment to family runs deep at the brickenwood project one 
of several developments on the citys north end which is home to 
mostly roman catholic families predominantly of portuguese and 
cape verdian descent 
shirley monteiro who now is caring for her 3yearold grandson 
said her daughter moved out when she was about 17 
thats when i started seeing the tracks on her arms she 
said 
mrs monteiro decided to take action when she learned her 
daughter had moved to prostitution 
i was very bold she said i barged right in on her 
apartment one time when a few guys were there and kicked the bed 
rolled over the mattress and started throwing pillows but it still 
didnt help 
neither did deborah botelhos efforts save her sister 
sandy was calling around and looking into rehab centers she 
said i said id take her kids if she followed through on it but 
i wasnt going to be a sucker at home while she was out on the 
streets doing drugs 
the last time deborah botelho 23 saw her sister was at a 
cookout last august 
sandy and i always had a ball and that night was no 
different botelho said she talked more about drugs and where 
she was getting them but she was still the same old sandy 
the following week sandy was gone her body was found in april 
that same august night while the botelhos were barbecuing the 
monteiros gathered next door on their front porch eating ice 
cream talking wondering where christina might be she had been 
missing since june 
the month before christina disappeared she wrote a mothers day 
poem in neat slanting script on paper now frayed from rereading 
she wrote of her pain fear and desire to straighten out and 
make her mother proud 
some relatives hold out hope she simply moved away to get a 
fresh start investigators say it is more likely that her fate was 
similar to that of her friend sandy

jeanette coakley waited 22 years for the 
grim news she calls her best mothers day gift ever the 
reassurance that her son died instantly when his jet crashed in 
vietnam 
oh what a relief said mrs coakley 84 i just felt i 
might die and never know now i have that 
the longmissing remains of navy lt cmdr william f coakley 
were to be buried tuesday with full military honors in a cemetery 
near the house his father and grandfather built a halfcentury ago 
the funeral should also bury the fears of the family that for two 
decades did not know the pilots fate 
mrs coakley wearing the pin that designates her a gold star 
mother said she learned of her oldest sons fate just before 
mothers day the remains were among 17 sets that the defense 
department has positively identified since the vietnamese 
government turned them over five months ago 
i just had such tremendous faith that god would answer my 
prayers she said last week seated in her living room below a 
photograph of her son with former president lyndon johnson and his 
wife lady bird 
coakley was 33 and on his 44th combat mission when his skyhawk 
jet went down on sept 13 1966 over the north vietnam province of 
thanh hoa his death came only six weeks after his youngest brother 
was hit and killed by a drunken driver in their hometown 
handsome and smart coakley graduated no 1 in his class at a 
private jesuit high school in 1953 reaped honors at holy cross 
college and was sent by the navy to earn a masters degree in 
political affairs at harvard university according to his younger 
brother robert now 51 
he had the world the way youd want it said robert who 
heads the guidance department at the local high school 
as a navy social aide coakley escorted actresses and socialites 
at white house parties from 1963 to 1965 but gave up his 
prestigious job to go to vietnam 
he felt it wasnt right that he was in the white house and his 
friends were out there fighting his mother said 
coakley returned to vietnam after his brothers death although 
he could have stayed home on compassionate leave he would have 
been back in lenox in another three months and had decided to go to 
medical school 
he knew what he was facing when he went back to vietnam 
because they were facing terrible terrible odds up there saids 
robert coakley the navy was very shorthanded with pilots 
he said the navy never learned what caused the jet to go down 
another pilot noticed it was off course and radioed to coakley to 
straighten out the last thing he said was im trying his 
brother said 
he called the next two decades a nightmare the terrible 
uncertainty the lingering despair of not knowing are feelings i 
cannot accurately describe he said in a speech five years ago 
the uncertainty vanished with a forensic report from navy 
officials last week its amazing what they can tell said 
coakley who said he did not want to go into details to spare his 
mothers feelings 
the most comforting things to us were that no 1 theres no 
question it was bill and secondly he died instantly

the rent in the house democratic leadership that began with a 
yearlong ethics investigation of wright has unraveled into the 
ranks with the weekend resignation of rep tony coelho no 3 in 
the pecking order and the jockeying for party power and position 
that will follow the elevation of majority leader tom foley to 
speaker 
wright who is expected to resign this week helped make the 
100th congress one of the most productive in years with the 
passage of major legislation on trade welfare reform fighting 
drugs a bipartisan budget agreement and dozens of other important 
items 
but in the doing of that wright generated searing personal 
enmity among his republican opponents without picking up a 
counterbalancing loyalty from his democratic colleagues 
the combination left the texas democrat a veteran of 34 years 
in the house too thinly protected when the attack came on his 
personal financial ethics 
democrat rep byron dorgan of north dakota summed up the wright 
legacy in two sentences the legislative record in his short term 
as speaker is an exceptional record but the price for doing that 
was extraordinarily high 
fellow democrat rep charles schumer of new york elaborated 
jim wright was the quintessential goitalone guy and that 
accounted for his success and that accounted for his failures when 
he made up his mind to do something he got it done but the 
house isnt structured for that kind of thing 
wright never won the tax increase that he contended as many 
members still do privately was the only way the federal deficit 
will be reduced substantially his willingness to take hits to win 
battles met with some notable success 
when it became clear that the reagan administration could no 
longer muster support for its policy of arming the nicaraguan 
contra rebels wright seized the initiative he led negotiations 
himself that resulted in new nonlethal humanitarian aid 
packages for the rebels coupled with support of regional efforts to 
work out a peace settlement 
while the trail wright blazed has essentially become us 
policy he suffered intense criticism for trampling on prerogatives 
usually reserved by the president 
maybe there simply was too much success for wrights own good 
suggested rep david bonior dmich a member of the speakers 
leadership team and a potential successor to coelho 
i think the leadership on our side was so successful that we 
really posed a tremendous threat to the republicans and i think 
because of that they decided that they needed to weaken the 
leadership and they went after the speaker he said 
dorgan said wright would not tolerate the legislative foot 
dragging that was the hallmark of congress for years that means 
you step on some toes and maybe run over some egos said dorgan 
he didnt make a lot of friends 
some of those toes and egos belonged to democrats who mostly 
kept their gripes within the democratic family but who were not 
exactly eager to rush to wrights public defense 
embittered republicans on the other hand complained loudly 
that wrights successes were won with strongarmed parliamentary 
tactics that dictated the results and demeaned the institution of 
the house 
the defining confrontation came early in wrights speakership 
with budget talks with the reagan white house just underway in 
october 1987 wright insisted on going ahead with a democratic 
grabbag bill of budget and tax items republicans rounded up the 
votes to block it and thought they had a rare victory 
but an impatient wright didnt let them savor their success he 
adjourned the house declared a new legislative day a 
parliamentary maneuver to leap to a new calendar day and muscled 
the bill to passage by forcing a texas colleague to change his vote 
the speaker had a luncheon with the republicans and we tried 
to patch things up bonior recalled 
but wright was the not the backslapping chummy guy who could 
smooth over legislative brawls with his personality 
its clear that he doesnt have the same warm effusive 
personality that tip former speaker thomas p oneill did jim 
was a little more aloof than that and a little more alone than 
that dorgan said 
rep dick cheney a gop leader who is now secretary of defense 
praised wright at a dinner a few days before that pivotal budget 
vote afterward cheney rarely had a kind word for the speaker and 
helped file the ethics complaint that lined up the nails for 
wrights political coffin 
despite his bad relations with the republicans wright was able 
to push through all 13 of congress annual spending bills last year 
the first time that had been accomplished in many years 
but the 101st congress began in january on a bad note for wright 
already mired in controversy because of questions raised about 
his ethics wright lost points with members of both parties with 
his handling many of his colleagues termed it mishandling of 
president bushs recommendation that congress receive a 50 percent 
pay increase 
although he personally opposed such a big salary boost wright 
tried to find a way to get it through for his colleagues 
eventually he backed down to supporting a 30 percent increase and 
the whole thing finally collapsed congress not only did not get 
the pay raise but took a bruising from the public 
in typical style wright acted almost alone absorbing most of 
the criticism republican campaign officials helped fan the flames 
of public outrage at wright even though it was bushs pay proposal 
republicans were angered by the democratic senates rejection of 
john tower bushs first choice for defense secretary and with the 
legislative pace slowed in part because of a slowmoving new 
administration the spotlight locked on wrights ethics 
in a scenario that had all the earmarks of wrights final days 
as speaker he tried last week to find a graceful exit he 
dispatched lawyers to see if the house ethics committee might 
consider dropping some charges against him in return for his 
stepping down 
but the ethics committee is the one committee in the house where 
republicans have an equal vote with the democrats and they 
publicly decried any dealmaking 
the embittered republicans wouldnt help their nemesis leave 
democrats didnt rally to his defense instead talking about an 
orderly transition 
and the speaker again was left to act on his own 
if there was doubt he would step down it was lessened by 
coelhos surprise resignation a move the california democrat said 
in part was intended to spare the party further turmoil stemming 
from an almost certain protracted examination of his own ethics in 
connection with his involvement in a junk bond purchase 
without saying so directly coelho was saying indirectly that if 
he would step aside for the good of the party so could anyone else

gunmen attacked a united nations convoy 
carrying emergency food from uganda to wartorn southern sudan 
killing three people and seriously injuring one a un official 
said monday 
the nationality of the dead and injured were not known but they 
were not un employees said diane weathers a spokeswoman for the 
un food and agriculture organization in nairobi the time of the 
attack was not known 
the incident the third of its kind prompted un officials to 
postpone emergency food deliveries by road but airlifts will 
continue from entebbe uganda to juba in southern sudan ms 
weathers said 
the 20truck convoy carrying 270 tons of corn was attacked 
shortly after crossing the border from northwestern uganda the 
convoy reported the attack monday upon reaching its destination in 
yei in sudans southeastern equatoria province ms weathers said 
one truck was destroyed by a land mine but it wasnt clear 
whether the explosion and the attack occurred simultaneously she 
said 
further details of the attack by unidentified gunmen were not 
immediately available 
on sunday the first train carrying emergency supplies reached 
its destination in southern sudan town of aweil according to 
sudans transport minister fadlallah burma nasser the train was 
delayed for four days by armed bandits and broken rails government 
and relief officials said 
the 130 million unsponsored relief operation began april 1 
to stockpile 115500 tons of food in southern sudan before the 
annual heavy rains turn roads and airstrips into mud that would be 
enough food to save 100000 sudanese from starving 
last year as many as 500000 sudanese died in a famine provoked 
in part by the 6yearold civil war 
the food is being ferried from neighboring uganda kenya and 
northern sudan to be distributed equally in areas held by the 
government and the sudan peoples liberation army 
in 1983 the rebel army began fighting the moslem government in 
khartoum the rebels demand greater autonomy for the mainly 
christian and animist south 
the rebels are observing a months unilateral ceasefire to 
permit emergency food and other supplies to reach southern sudan 
even so the unsponsored program has faced difficulties such 
as the attacks by unidentified gunmen and a railroad strike in 
addition ethiopia has not permitted the relief program to truck 
food on roads along that countrys western border with sudan 
on may 21 100 unidentified gunmen attacked the 48car train 
carrying 1500 tons of food and robbed three western relief 
officials of their personal belongings 
in april unidentified gunmen ambushed the first 47truck convoy 
from kapoeta in southern sudan killing seven people

west european leaders on monday hailed 
us proposals for cuts in soviet and american troops and weapons 
in europe temporarily shelving their quarrels over shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
british prime minister margaret thatcher declared that president 
bush had transformed the summit of the leaders of the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization 
she cautioned though that an era of risk and vulnerability lay 
ahead for the west if the cutbacks in conventional or nonnuclear 
forces were carried out 
west german chancellor helmut kohl mrs thatchers main 
european antagonist in the nuclear dispute applauded the united 
states for a great initiative 
president bush has today paved the way for further success of 
our alliance said kohl i congratulate him on this farsighted 
step with which he has once more impressively affirmed the united 
states leadership 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass reported the bush plan 
adding that local observers note that the new proposals were made 
by washington after the bush administration came under serious 
criticism from the public for the lack of any disarmament 
initiatives at a time when the soviet union has launched a peace 
offensive 
at the summits opening session bush proposed a joint reduction 
in us and soviet troops stationed in europe to 275000 for each 
side by 1993 he also urged sharp slashes in conventional weapons 
including tanks and their destruction 
he called on the allies to indicate their willingness to 
negotiate limits on combat aircraft and helicopters in europe to 15 
percent below current nato levels all the removed equipment would 
be destroyed 
us officials were delighted with the allies reaction 
a senior administration official briefing reporters on 
condition of anonymity said the atmosphere as bush unveiled his 
initiative in a closed session of the western alliance leaders was 
enthusiastic even warmer than anything we had reason to 
expect 
dutch spanish and italian officials welcomed the move 
hubert vedrine a spokesman for french president francois 
mitterrand said france supports the bush proposals but expressed 
reservations about including aircraft in the conventional arms 
bargaining 
he said frances air forces cannot be included in the 
negotiations because they contribute to the nations independent 
nuclear strategy france is not a member of natos military 
structure 
the united states wants the nato leaders to endorse bushs plan 
so that it can be put on the negotiating table at recently opened 
talks in vienna with the warsaw pact on reducing conventional 
forces in europe 
the move at the start of a twoday summit took the spotlight off 
what had promised to be a difficult meeting of the 16 allies 
marking natos 40th anniversary 
the united states and britain are leading the opposition to west 
german demands for negotiations to reduce shortrange nuclear 
missiles 
however a cutback in conventional armaments where the soviets 
now have huge superiority would fulfill a us condition for 
entering shortrange negotiations 
mrs thatcher her spokesman reported told the summit in closed 
session that bushs initiative went to the heart of the 
superiority of the soviet union in conventional weapons 
but she said the bush proposals if accepted by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev would take a very considerable time to 
achieve 
the british spokesman who demanded anonymity said mrs 
thatcher added that the interim period would therefore be a time 
of vulnerability and risk making it essential for nato to have 
a sufficiency of shortrange nuclear forces 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said bush had given 
the soviets an opportunity to show they are able and ready to 
reduce their forces 
van den broek and several other european officials warned of 
immediate difficulties for negotiators in agreeing on reductions in 
helicopters and combat aircraft because of differing methods of 
counting warplanes by the superpowers 
spanish foreign minister franciso fernandez ordonez said bush 
had given a new impetus to the conventional arms talks 
this proposal would reduce the possibility of a surprise 
attack by the warsaw pact he said adding it enhanced the 
chances of the nato allies reaching a good agreement among 
themselves in brussels 
bush also pleased some regular critics john isaacs spokesman 
for a washingtonbased antinuclear group council for a livable 
world said arms control took two to tango 
weve had for the last couple of years gorbachev quite willing 
to tango he may have a partner in president bush and nato

the towering goddess of democracy displayed 
in tiananmen square by freedomseeking chinese students is sister 
to the statue of liberty and dramatically highlights the influence 
us ideals have had on the protesters 
at first we wanted to make it exactly like the statue of 
liberty said ke feng a beijing university student involved in 
construction of the 33foot styrofoam and plaster of paris 
monument china needs this type of symbol 
the statue was being assembled at tiananmen for unveiling 
tuesday 
the goddess of democracy feverishly built by central fine arts 
academy student sculptors differs slightly in design from the 
152foot copper statue in new york harbor both depict a woman in 
classical robes holding high a torch of freedom although the 
chinese version does not hold a tablet 
it is not the first time that us influence on the protests for 
democratic change has surfaced replicas of the statue of liberty 
have been carried by marchers in shanghai several times and have 
appeared on campus posters in beijing 
america represents democracy and freedom said wang yue a 
23yearold senior at the beijing science and technology 
university one of the students who gathered monday night in 
tiananmen square i think most of the students received the idea 
of democracy and freedom from america and other western countries 
information about the united states has become widely available 
since china opened to the outside world a decade ago and students 
say they study us history at school 
more than 60000 chinese have gone to the united states to study 
since 1978 and some of those who have come back participated in 
the prodemocracy protests of the past six weeks 
an englishlanguage poster in beijing recalled patrick henrys 
immortal line give me liberty or give me death others have 
quoted nathan hale and the declaration of independence 
of the people by the people for the people this should be a 
universal principle a petroleum university senior at tiananmen 
square said monday recalling abraham lincolns prescription for 
good government in the gettysburg address 
the student demonstrators while not calling for the end of 
communist party rule clearly support us political ideals such as 
freedom of the press and the rule of law 
we want our government to be more like americas said one 
student visiting beijing from the northeastern industrial city of 
shenyang 
prodemocracy protesters are eager that their movement be viewed 
positively in the united states and incessantly ask reporters about 
the reaction of the bush administration and americans to the 
demonstrations 
the chinese people have turned to the united states for 
inspiration before when seeking political change 
john dewey an american philosopher known for his pragmatism 
profoundly influenced some leaders of the may fourth movement of 
1919 when students protested to demand democracy and science 
even communist revolutionary mao tsetung is said to have been 
impressed by george washington and the american revolution 
the 1989 democracy protesters however view neither the united 
states nor the western world as the sole source of inspiration 
chinese students have followed with interest soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness that 
has eased press restrictions and allowed public political debate 
the communist neighbors share recent histories of autocratic 
government and gorbachevs political reforms are viewed by some 
chinese students as models for change in their own country 
when the soviet leader visited china from may 1518 during the 
height of the protests several students carried welcoming signs in 
chinese and russian welcome to a real reformer gorbachev one 
read democracy our common ideal said another 
but when a group of students was asked monday whether they 
considered the united states or the soviet union a better model for 
political change they answered with a chorus you cant put the 
question like that 
they said neither system was suitable as a comprehensive model 
for a new political system in china which will have to travel its 
own road to democracy

the government reported a new 
offensive around jalalabad which moslem guerrillas have had under 
siege since early march but said monday its soldiers repulsed the 
insurgents with artillery fire 
mohammad nabi amani spokesman for the foreign ministry said at 
least 139 guerrillas had been killed and 70 wounded since the 
attack began sunday he did not give government casualties 
guerrillas based in neighboring pakistan said the they began a 
new attack saturday on government posts around jalalabad 75 miles 
east of kabul they claimed to have captured several posts and 
killed or wounded 70 soldiers 
neither claim could be verified each side generally exaggerates 
the others casualties 
amani said insurgents fired rockets and artillery at the city 
and airport but the armed forces responded quickly 
jalalabad was the first major guerrilla target after soviet 
military forces completed their withdrawal from afghanistan on feb 
15 ending nine years of involvement in the civil war when the 
attack began nearly three months ago some guerrilla commanders 
predicted the city would fall within days 
capturing jalalabad about 45 miles from the border with 
pakistan would give the insurgents a base for the interim 
government they formed in february 
amani said about 18000 soldiers had been deployed around 
jalalabad to fight an estimated 22000 rebels surrounding the city 
gulbuddin hekmatyar who leads the fundamentalist hezbeislami 
guerrilla group said monday in pakistan the war would continue 
until the marxist government in kabul falls 
addressing a news conference in islamabad hekmatyar said his 
followers would not accept a political solution involving king 
zahir shah who was overthrown in 1973 and lives in exile in italy 
in kabul amani said insurgents fired rockets sunday into khost 
southern afghanista killing two civilians he claimed 30 
guerrillas were killed and 20 wounded 
he said rockets killed three civilians in kandahar and gave 
guerrilla casualties there as seven killed and five wounded 
amani reported a civilian wounded in herat western afghanistan 
and three insurgents killed in konduz a northern province

white men give and get the majority of transplant 
organs in the united states a disparity that many experts fear 
could thwart efforts to boost organ donation especially among 
minorities 
the bottom line is that there is a racial difference and the 
gap isnt closing said dr paul eggers chief of the federal 
health care financing administrations program evaluation branch in 
the office of research 
transplant doctors will be looking at ways to provide greater 
access to the costly surgery at their annual meeting this week in 
chicago they also will be discussing ways to get more americans 
across the board to donate loved ones organs 
anybody can get on the waiting list but they have to get to 
the transplant center said dr barry levin president of the 
american society of transplant physicians they themselves have 
to want to be transplanted physicians have to refer them 
thats precisely the problem for many women blacks and other 
minorities and lowerincome individuals according to arthur 
caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at the 
university of minnesota 
if americans dont all have an equal chance at access to a 
primary care doctor forget about a transplant surgeon caplan 
said 
statistics just released by the virginiabased united network 
for organ sharing which administers the national transplant 
network and scientific registry show 832 percent of the 4083 
braindead victims whose organs were donated in 1988 were white 
about 86 percent were black and 59 percent were hispanic well 
below their population share 
on the opposite end whites received 889 percent of hearts 
transplanted last year 859 percent of livers 71 percent of 
kidneys and 976 percent of pancreases 
sixtytwo percent of the 1988 donors were male men also 
dominated on the receiving side getting 792 percent of hearts 
transplanted last year 606 percent of kidneys and 564 percent of 
pancreases liver transplant recipients were almost evenly divided 
between males and females however 
the group excluded from its calculations recipients whose race 
or sex were not reported 
while such lopsidedness does not prove bias exists because for 
example men and women have different rates of some types of 
diseases it certainlysuggests it and that alone poses a grave 
threat to organ donation according to caplan 
the fact that blacks received 217 percent of the kidneys 
transplanted in 1988 is particularly worrisome experts say since 
blacks are four times as likely as whites to suffer kidney failure 
thats due in large part to blacks proclivity toward high blood 
pressure 
onethird of the 107000 americans on dialysis are black and 
onethird of the nearly 15000 people awaiting kidney transplants 
in the united states are black said dr william vaughn the 
networks director of technical services 
both dialysis and kidney transplantation are covered under the 
federal medicare program regardless of the persons age 
a study by dr philip held researcher at the urban institute in 
washington found wealthy white men were likelier to get a new 
kidney from 1981 to 1986 than poor white men the same held true 
for black men the higher the income the likelier a transplant 
i think that if there were outcomes that werent expected 
they were ones of ignorance and not evil intent held said 
experts insist the present selection system is sex and 
colorblind the nations more than 240 transplant centers have been 
required since oct 1 1987 to use standardized scoring for 
allocating organs judging each patient on such things as severity 
and length of illness and blood and tissue type 
the emphasis on tissue matching for kidneys is hotly contested 
among transplant specialists proponents say the practice improves 
the patients chances while critics contend the gains are not 
great enough to warrant having organs lie around and deteriorate 
until a close match is found opponents also contend 
tissuematching discriminates against blacks because a minority of 
blacks have tissuematching problems that make them face a longer 
wait for kidneys 
those kinds of odds dont make it any easier convincing blacks 
to pursue transplants according to howard universitys dr clive 
o callender one of the nations few black transplant surgeons 
the black patient often is not comfortable with 
transplantation for the same reasons blacks are disinclined to 
donate organs he said 
those reasons according to callender include religious 
beliefs lack of transplant awareness and distrust of the 
whitedominated medical community 
another factor he says is that some blacks want their 
relatives organs to go to other blacks a request that like any 
other cannot be assured

the navy denied trying to cover up a mishap 
involving a nuclear submarines reactor although the ships logs 
make no mention of the incident 16 years ago private researchers 
said monday 
the us navy claims that it has never had a nuclear 
propulsion accident joshua handler said of the incident but 
their own documents show how misleading theyve been 
the navy denied it had ever tried to cover up news of the 
accident describing it as a minor mishap in which there were no 
serious injuries or radiological problems the ship remained fully 
capable to perform any mission required of it and there was no 
damage to the reactor 
the service acknowledged however that the incident had never 
been publicized and spokesmen were unable to say why the subs 
deck logs and official command history made no mention of it 
the navy had a major nuclear accident and then lied about 
it asserted william arkin a researcher with the institute for 
policy studies a liberal washington think tank we caught them 
with their bellbottoms down 
arkin and handler a researcher who heads the greenpeace 
environmental groups nuclear free seas campaign released their 
findings monday the institute for policy studies and greenpeace 
are about to publish a study of serious naval accidents around the 
world 
according to the deck logs of the uss guardfish for april 21 
1973 which we obtained the submarine was underway submerged as 
before for the entire day without incident arkin said 
in fact the submarine suffered a primary coolant leak and 
then surfaced ventilated decontaminated and repaired its reactor 
unassisted five crewmen were later sent to the puget sound wash 
naval hospital for radiation monitoring 
willis s rich the subs skipper at the time and now a 
professor of engineering at boston university said in an interview 
about the report that had he noticed there was nothing in the log 
about the accident he would have told the navigator to add the 
information 
it was a minor mishap he said nobody was injured but it 
was a primary coolant leak and you cant take that lightly 
earlier this month the two researchers disclosed new details 
about the loss of a hydrogen bomb off the coast of japan in 1965 
lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman responded we did 
not try to cover anything up everything about this incident was 
properly reported through navy channels 
now its true we dont issue a press release every time 
something breaks down that depends for example on whether there 
is a hazard to people a hazard to the environment or danger to the 
public 
quigley said he had not seen the deck logs obtained by arkin and 
handler under the freedom of information act and would not 
speculate on why they made no mention of a mishap 
he did however release a statement outlining exactly what 
happened that day 16 years ago aboard the guardfish a permitclass 
attack submarine that is still in service and based at san diego 
calif 
while transiting from pearl harbor to bangor wash a 
crewman was performing a tightness check of a small valve and 
inadvertently set up a path that allowed for a minor loss of 
primary coolant water through a test fitting opening of 
onequarter inch in diameter the statement said 
within about 10 minutes the ship stopped the leak the 
estimated amount of coolant released was less than five gallons 
in such cases it is standard practice for a submarine to 
surface in order to ventilate the spaces overboard and the 
guardfish did just that the statement continued 
five sailors were subsequently found to have low levels of 
radioactivity on their skin from the leak 
each crewman had the radioactivity removed by washing with 
soap and water the maximum radiation exposure was similar to 
what he would have received in getting a common chest xray 
when the ship reached bangor these five crewmen were 
monitored for internally deposited radioactivity the results 
showed that none of the crewmen involved had ingested any 
detectable radioactivity 
rich who retired as a captain said he was not surprised the 
deck logs made no mention of the incident because deck logs for a 
submarine are a general synopsis at a lower classification whereas 
the quartermasters notebook and patrol report would be more 
definitive and classified

choppers whir overhead sharpshooters 
eye the roads a bomb squad is on standby and buddhist monks are 
beating the drum for peace its summit time again in brussels 
residents have seen it all before and hardly raise an eyebrow to 
what has become a routine of pomp protection and protest 
but with the leaders of the 16 nations of the north atlantic 
treaty organization collected in a single building security 
officials are evervigilant 
at least once a year this capital of 1 million people also 
hosts a top meeting for the heads of the 12nation european 
economic community trade bloc not surprisingly people no longer 
line the streets for a fleeting glimpse of world politics 
for belgium there is a certain routine now said a foreign 
affairs official who asked not to be named many summits have 
identical procedures 
for weeks now the different police forces the army and the 
embassies of attending nations have had coordination meetings at 
the interior ministry to pave the way for a safe summit 
nothing is left to chance said a brussels police official 
who also demanded anonymity holidays are suspended everybody is 
mobilized 
on monday morning security was at its tightest at the nato 
complex when a steady stream of black and gray limousines 
accompanied by hundreds of police motorcycles swept through the 
morning rush hour to deliver their guests for the first session 
as president bush arrived sharpshooters stood on the roof of 
the sprawling nato complex next to men using binoculars to spot any 
sign of trouble for safe measure a helicopter passed overhead 
within the barrackslike compound hundreds of police and army 
officials were posted along the different roads leading to the 
meeting rooms and a bomb disposal squad was discreetly stationed 
outside the main building 
journalists entered through a special side entrance equipped 
with metal detecters all equipment was checked before the 
reporters got close to the headquarters 
outside security forces kept watch on a peace demonstration of 
a dozen japanese buddhist monks who prayed and beat drums almost 
throughout the morning discreetly across the street 
the security operation spans most of brussels from nato 
headquarters in suburban brussels to the international airport on 
the outskirts 
security also was tight at the 18th century chateau stuyvenberg 
where bush is staying on the outskirts of brussels the president 
was accompanied by three secret service agents when he went jogging 
on the grounds for 20 minutes during an evening break 
leading up to the summit bombsniffing dogs checked the 
dignitaries travel routes and accommodations several temporary 
walls were even built to protect highprofile visitors such as bush 
at the coordination meetings cooperation between local police 
and security staff of attending nations had to be smoothed out to 
avoid embarrassing scuffles between officials trying to protect the 
same people officials said 
during the summit well over 1300 police and state police 
worked roundtheclock 
obviously it all costs a lot of money said frank de mot of 
the interior ministry he and other officials said they were unable 
to estimate the total expense 
hosting summits has disadvantages but also advantages said 
de mot to explain belgiums policy it gives brussels prestige and 
provides the tourist industry with considerable income during the 
summit 
a summit also allows the police services to bask in the light of 
global publicity and the competition is tough for the privilege to 
escort leaders such as bush or french president francois mitterrand 
we really have to be diplomatic to resolve such quarrels 
said one official 
escorting the world leaders around brussels is something that 
you can always tell your children and grandchildren about said 
us embassy spokesman jim findlay

leaders in high tech manufacturing are full of 
praise for commerce secretary robert mosbachers endorsement of a 
new industrygovernment partnership to improve american 
competitiveness 
but they acknowledge tongue in cheek minor differences 
over one point money 
the industrial officials say that like mosbacher they oppose a 
heavyhanded program of federal bureaucrats dictating industrial 
policy the governments past tries at picking winners have 
typically been expensive flops such as the effort to create a 
synthetic fuels industry in the 1970s 
instead the manufacturers want an industryled policy where 
the private sector judges the market and chooses products and 
research programs worthy of special backing 
its not a bunch of guys in washington sitting in a closet 
saying this is the way its going to be said robert costello a 
former undersecretary of defense now at the hudson institute a 
private research group 
mosbacher in a major departure from the freemarket views of 
the reagan administration endorsed that concept which involves 
cooperation rather than competition among companies in a speech 
earlier this month to the economic club of detroit 
the commerce secretary and the manufacturers diverge however 
on who should pay mosbacher wants an industryled and mostly 
industryfinanced effort while the manufacturing executives say 
government must match private funding 
i feel it is imperative that we communicate to the 
administration that at some not too distant point more government 
funding is needed said rep mel levine dcalif who led an 
industrial policy conference last week attended by such hightech 
superstars as robert noyce coinventor of the microprocessor 
but mosbacher speaking of the most likely candidate for a 
publicprivate partnership highdefinition television warned at a 
congressional hearing that electronics companies asking for 135 
billion in federal aid shouldnt expect uncle sam to act like 
uncle sugar 
instead he said industry can look to government to encourage 
research through such methods as loosening antitrust restrictions 
and providing tax incentives 
levine and other participants in last weeks conference are 
downplaying the money fight and lauding mosbachers step away from 
the doctrines of the previous administration 
mosbachers statements are a very significant step in the 
right direction levine said i dont want to underestimate the 
differences we have with the administration at this point but i 
think they can be bridged 
however it probably wont be enough to convince mosbacher even 
though he enjoys great influence with president bush an old 
friend the commerce secretary reportedly faces opposition within 
the cabinet from chief economic adviser michael boskin and budget 
director richard darman 
hoping to raise the public profile of industrys problems the 
manufacturing officials held a oneday wake up america 
conference on may 25 the anniversary of president kennedys 1961 
call to put an american astronaut on the moon 
the executives said a government commitment as extensive as the 
effort expended on the space race is needed to win the industrial 
race with japan and other foreign competitors 
we must make it profitable for us business to invest in the 
united states said palle smidt senior vice president of the 
microelectronics and computer technology corp in austin texas 
a model that could serve as an example for many industries they 
say is sematech a consortium of computer companies headed by 
noyce which is working to restore us semiconductor production 
which has been eclipsed by japans 
as to the appropriateness of the government involving itself in 
assisting industries mitchell kwertzman chief executive officer 
of computer solutions in burlington vt said i for one would 
like to see the government invest in winners rather than have 
government see its function as bailing out losers

ethnic groups and soviet republics fighting for 
more independence are using the televised proceedings of the new 
parliament to bring their diverse demands before a national 
audience for the first time 
on monday deputies from two areas that have been the most vocal 
in demanding more independence the baltic republics and the 
southern republic of georgia used the questioning of vice 
president anatoly i lukyanov to present demands striking at the 
very unity of this vast nation 
tamaz v gamkrelidze a university professor demanded the 
congress of peoples deputies condemn the annexation of the 
independent democratic georgian republic by the red army in 1921 
saying it violated a 1920 treaty agreed to by soviet founder 
vladimir i lenin 
for the baltics lithuanian prosecutor egidius v bichkauskas 
questioned lukyanov about the 1939 pact between soviet foreign 
minister vyacheslav molotov and german counterpart joachim von 
ribbentrop 
as a result of this pact sovereign lithuania and the other 
baltic republics were occupied and incorporated into the soviet 
union losing their independent statehood bichkauskas noted 
lukyanov replied only by saying the consequences of the 
sovietgerman pact is under study by a review commission 
both the georgian and lithuanian deputies implied that the 
soviet union made up of 15 republics was created in part by force 
and against the will of the people in their republics 
groups from the caucasian and baltic republics have increased 
contact with one another in recent months to intensify pressure for 
more sovereignty over their own affairs 
such radical demands have been echoed in more muted tones in 
other regions particularly the central asian republics of 
uzbekistan tadzhikistan and kirgizia 
lone central asian deputies such as vladimir zolotukhin from 
tashkent have complained their delegations were manipulated by 
party and other chiefs 
generally however the central asian delegates have been part 
of what historian yuri afanasyev labeled the aggressively 
obedient majority lauding gorbachev and unanimously supporting 
the leadership 
moscow and leningrad progressives scathingly jest about this 
behavior prompting kazakh delegate galina amangeldinova to 
announce monday i am afraid to sit with the moscow delegation 
there also have been fierce exchanges between delegates from 
armenia and azerbaijan two southern republics in bitter conflict 
over the fate of nagornokarabakh an area within azerbaijan with a 
predominantly armenian population 
the ethnic conflict which has sparked fatal rioting in the 
republics boiled to the surface on thursday when armenian artist 
genrikh igityan demanded public condemnation the february 1988 riot 
in sumgait in which 31 armenians were killed he said the deaths in 
the azerbaijani city should receive the same attention several 
delegates from various regions gave the use of special antiriot 
forces in tbilisi 
muslum mamedov communist party leader in azerbaijans capital 
baku shot back angrily that we have never sought confrontation 
and charged without mentioning specifics that armenians also had 
killed azerbaijanis 
in the commotion over the more wellknown ethnic conflicts 
demands from smaller soviet peoples have passed largely unnoticed 
khamzat a fargiev a representative of the 100000 ingushes 
living on the edge of gorbachevs home region of stavropol used 
mondays debate to reiterate what he said were two unanswered 
petitions for an independent ingush region 
each petition has been supported by more than 60000 ingushes 
he noted adding that his people also support demands from volga 
germans and crimean tartars for restoration of a measure of their 
independence they were among the minority groups deported from 
their homes under josef stalin 
this is the next national crisis fargiev warned of the 
problem of the ingushes whose conflicts with chechens ossetians 
and other neighboring peoples led authorities in 1984 to bring in 
special security forces and impose a curfew in the regional center 
of ordzhonokidze 
his prediction drew far less attention than a semiserious jibe 
from a siberian delegate over the ageold russian practice of 
sending criminals and inefficient officials to his bleak region 
please dont send any more of that scum to us in siberia 
pleaded writer roman x solntsev amid general laughter from the 
floor lukyanov gravely thanked him for the remark noting that 
there are whole regions in siberia where its difficult to 
restore order

two bills facing threatened vetoes one 
containing more money to fight drugs and the other restrictions on 
a 7 billion deal with japan to develop an fsx fighter may 
dominate whatever attention congress does not devote to turmoil in 
its leadership ranks this week 
speaker jim wrights problems with alleged violations of house 
ethics rules and the surprise weekend resignation of rep tony 
coelho no 3 in the leadership have cast a cloud not only over 
their own futures but also congress itself 
nonetheless its legislative work goes on even in a 
holidayshortened week in which the speaker could resign and a 
successor be chosen both to him and coelho 
the senate is scheduled to take up a domestic spending bill 
thursday that would devote 822 million more this year atop the 
53 billion already designated for antidrug initiatives 
the bill was approved by the house last week despite a vow by 
administration officials to recommend that bush veto it on grounds 
it deepens the federal deficit and that antidrug spending already 
has been increased by 39 percent since last year 
the legislation also includes 12 billion for raising veterans 
benefits and improving their health programs 893 million to 
student college loans 423 million for foster care aid and 88 
million for public housing 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee also wants to add 66 million to the 
bill to subsidize commercial airline service to rural areas and 75 
million to rebuild a radio telescope in his state that collapsed 
last year 
the house meanwhile may take up the agreement between bush and 
japan allowing japanese firms access to us technology for the 
development of their own version of general dynamics corps f16 
fighter jet 
the senate approved the deal two weeks ago but only by a narrow 
5247 margin and only after amending it to prohibit japan from 
using advanced us jet engine technology to foster their own 
aerospace industry 
the house foreign affairs committee last week softened the 
restrictions to set up a mechanism for congress to disapprove any 
such technology transfers after secretary of state james a baker 
iii was quoted as saying bush would veto any bill that put limits 
on the terms he can negotiate with japan 
the agreement was tentatively scheduled for house action on 
thursday if approved differences with the senate version would 
have to be ironed out by negotiators for both bodies 
critics led by sen alan dixon dill have complained that 
japan should be buying export versions of the f16 and reducing its 
50 billion trade deficit with the united states instead of 
insisting of codeveloping their own version using us technology 
on wednesday the house is scheduled to act on a bill to make 37 
individuals partnerships and companies start developing shale oil 
mining claims on 246366 acres of federal land in colorado utah 
and wyoming or lose them 
most of the 1846 claims were staked out between 1915 and 1918 
while never developed the claims have precluded use of the land 
for other purposes such as recreation or grazing 
the bill by rep nick joe rahall dwva would require the 
holders to spend 5000 a year on each claim in a diligent 
effort to get them in full production between 2015 and 2018 or 
forfeit them 
since shale oil is not viewed as an economically viable energy 
source in todays market the real purpose is to prevent the land 
from being turned over to private interests for as little as 250 
an acre 
rahall and other supporters have said they want to avoid a 
repeat of a 1986 settlement with the interior department in which 
mining claim holders exercised lease rights on 82000 acres for 
250 each only to sell the rights later to shell oil co and 
others for up to 2000 an acre 
the senate on wednesday will consider reauthorizing for another 
five years the strategic petroleum reserve intended to serve as an 
energy life jacket in the event of another oil embargo or other 
worldwide shortage 
the reserve begun two years after the 1973 arab oil embargo 
now has 570 million barrels of oil slightly less than a 90day 
supply stored in salt caves in texas and louisiana 
with us oil imports rising 50 percent in the last three years 
the legislation would raise the reserves ceiling from 750 million 
barrels to 1 billion barrels early in the next century 
the bill also gives the president greater authority to divert 
oil for the reserve to refineries in an effort to suppress price 
shocks such as the upward spiral two months ago after the exxon 
valdez tanker spill in alaska 
also before the senate wednesday is a measure by sen paul 
simon dill to encourage television networks local stations and 
cable systems to develop guidelines on depicting violence and drug 
use 
technically simons bill only exempts the industry from 
antitrust claims that might result from joint efforts to develop 
the guidelines but the legislation is clearly aimed at reducing 
the level of violence on tv 
network executives havent embraced the measure but they also 
havent tried to stop vehement opposition has been voiced by the 
american liberties union which has called it a step toward 
censorship and a threat to first amendment rights of free speech 
under the constitution

stewart 81 who hasnt acted in about five years was 
interviewed for the june issue of vogue 
the star who once ran the movie projector in his hometown of 
indiana pa acquired a degree in architecture from princeton 
that profession was of little use at the height of the depression 
so he opted for acting

years new york led to hollywood within four years hed made 25 
movies 
at 32 with credits that included mr smith goes to 
washington and the philadelphia story stewart entered the 
army in 1941 becoming one of the few movie stars to serve in world 
war ii 
he returned to hollywood fearful of his future with his 
contract expired and wondering if the public would still remember 
him 
thats why i thank director frank capra in prayers every 
day he said cause he just out of the blue called me up and 
said i got an idea for a story and why dont you come down to 
the house 
the result was its a wonderful life which was not 
successful when it became out but has since become a muchloved 
christmastime perennial 
looking back over it i can just see that the picture meant 
more to me than any other said stewart

purple and orange tropical flowers about 150 people listened to 
speeches prayed and watched as air force a37 dragonflies flew 
over in a missing man formation 
the only mention of the political crisis that has brought 1900

being honored

history of memorial day since the civil war with special mention 
of the explosion that killed 47 people aboard the uss iowa which 
he once commanded

former us arms control director ralph

earle who negotiated the 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty 
with the soviet union for the carter administration said bushs 
timetable is overly optimistic 
in an interview the former us official also foresaw potential 
problems in defining combat aircraft and other weapons and a 
possible attempt by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to 
include naval forces 
the north atlantic treaty organization has an edge over the 
warsaw pact in combat ships in europe earle said 
no matter how much political will there are going to be 
substantial problems earle said 
he predicted it would take two years to complete negotiations in 
the conventional forces in europe talks in vienna 
earle praised bush for putting the stress on conventional forces 
instead of nuclear wepaons as the most important disarmament issue 
in europe 
he said the bush plan is achievable but could have gone 
further to ease tensions if the president also had proposed 
withdrawal of tanks and other powerful weapons from the eastwest 
divide he said such a disarmament corridor could help avert a 
conflict between east and west

prosecutors indicted a man with a 
violent criminal past monday for the murder of prime minister olof 
palme who was shot down on a snowy street in stockholm more than 
three years ago 
the 3000 pages of evidence in the indictment outlined a case 
against carl gustav christer pettersson 42 that relied heavily on 
the testimony of palmes widow lisbet and other witnesses who put 
the defendant at the scene 
the palmes were walking home from a movie the night of feb 28 
1986 without bodyguards when the killer fired from close range 
and fled into a side street 
he fits my description the outline of his face his eyes and 
the terrifying face the indictment quoted mrs palme as telling 
investigators 
in addition to first degree murder pettersson is charged with 
the attempted murder of mrs palme who was slightly wounded 
pettersson has denied killing palme 
his attorney arne liljefors said the prosecution had not 
provided a motive or forensic evidence to support the charges 
pettersson was arrested dec 14 in a twist to a case which that 
focused on possible international conspiracies 
police and security agencies had been accused of bungling the 
case and failing to turn up credible leads despite a reward of 50 
million kronor 8 million three police chiefs and a justice 
minister resigned at various points in the investigation 
palme a dynamic and controversial politician was a un 
mediator in the iraniraq war and an advocate of world disarmament 
he led social democratic governments in sweden for 11 years 
prosecutors said 33 witnesses would support their case that 
pettersson followed the palmes down sveavagen boulevard and some 
would testify he had access to a weapon and lied about his 
whereabouts 
liljefors the defense lawyer indicated he would question the 
credibility of witnesses testifying three years after the crime 
prosecutor jorgen almbland said of the evidence i am convinced 
this is enough to win a conviction according to the indictment 
mrs palme said she thought it was youngsters playing with 
firecrackers when she heard the shots and she turned toward 
her husband to comment 
at the same moment he collapsed badly bleeding from his chest 
and mouth it said mrs palme heard another bang and felt a 
burning sensation in her back 
she saw a running man who stopped briefly and turned to face 
her before continuing to flee the indictment said 
he was in his 40s around 180 centimeters 6 feet tall with 
a compact body and short neck mrs palme was quoted as saying 
he was dark but not like from southern lands 
pettersson a drug and alcohol addict has a record of more than 
60 crimes including a conviction for stabbing a man to death with 
a bayonet 
he was questioned and released in the first weeks of the 
investigation but called in again last year when police discovered 
holes in his alibi

president bush says the soviet union which has 
been accused over the years of supporting various terrorist 
organizations no longer fosters terrorism 
in an interview with columnist jack anderson for a syndicated 
television program on terrorism bush said the soviets appear to 
have mended their ways 
i dont believe the soviets are now engaged in terrorist 
activities said bush theres no hard evidence out there that 
i have seen certainly since ive been president that makes 
me feel they are a state thats involved in condoning or 
encouraging terrorism 
bush a former director of the central intelligence agency 
said there was a time when there was some training that went on 
inside the soviet union that was directly related with terrorist 
activities 
he added that such training might not have been done under the 
name of terrorism but we had liberation movements in different 
names for different causes 
asked about indications the soviets are willing to cooperate 
with the united states to fight terrorism the president said if 
that offer is for real we ought to explore it i believe 
that under new leadership the soviets will cooperate not only 
in renouncing terror publicly but working to counter it 
if there are certain areas where their intelligence would be 
far better than ours and if we could enter into a sharing 
agreement that would avert these terrorist acts id be all for 
it he said 
the program for which bush was interviewed entitled target 
usa will be broadcast wednesday on about 140 television 
stations according to gene nichols a spokesman for the producers

a trial that starts this week pitting an 
indianapolis art dealer against the rival greek and turkish 
governments of cyprus could have repercussions throughout the world 
for claims to national art treasures 
art dealer peg goldberg is being sued over four sixthcentury 
mosaics that some call the most important christian antiquities 
ever to come on the market cypriot authorities claim they were 
ripped from the walls of a village church 
if us district judge james e noland rules for goldberg 
millions of dollars worth of plundered antiquities could pour into 
this country some analysts predict 
lawyers for american collectors both institutional and 
private will be watching this for its implications said 
constance lowenthal executive director of the international 
foundation for art research in new york 
american collections do have many antiquities whose origins 
are unclear its an important case the stakes are high and the 
implications could be very broad 
in march the republic of cyprus and the autocephalous greek 
orthodox church of cyprus sued goldberg and her dealership 
goldberg and feldman fine arts of suburban carmel 
cyprus claims the mosaics were taken illegally to europe from 
lythrankomi in 1979 the village is under the control of a 
breakaway turkish government that has ruled the northern third of 
the wartorn island nation since 1974 
the selfdesignated turkish republic of northern cyprus entered 
the fray on wednesday when it filed a request to intervene in the 
lawsuit and claimed it is the rightful owner of the mosaics turkey 
is the only country that recognizes the turkish occupation state 
joseph d youssouf a new jersey lawyer representing turkish 
cyprus said his client was eager to argue its case in court 
who is the republic of cyprus who are the turkish cypriots 
and who owns the mosaics are all interrelated questions youssouf 
said theres an awful lot at stake 
the mosaics analysts say are among only a relative handful of 
artworks surviving from the first centuries of christianity 
fragments of a much larger work at panagia kanakaria church they 
depict heads of christ as a boy the apostles james and matthew and 
an archangel the four pieces are each roughly 2 feet square 
these mosaics priceless examples of byzantine art are 
irreplaceable aspects of our countrys cultural heritage said 
michael kyprianou a deputy state attorney general of cyprus 
goldberg 50 who usually deals in 19th and 20th century 
american and european art said she knew she was onto something big 
when she first viewed the mosaics in geneva switzerland last june 
i had some suspicions as i looked at them and my heart 
stopped i thought they were possibly extraordinarily important 
regardless of whatever else was proven in my mind she said 
weve been told they would be the most important christian 
antiquities ever to come on the market 
goldberg claims she researched the legal status of the mosaics 
before purchasing them in july for 11 million from aydin dikmen 
who said he was the former official archaeologist for turkish 
cyprus she has offered them for sale for 20 million but theyre 
not on the market pending the outcome of the suit 
according to youssouf dikmen is a fraud and so were the customs 
and shipping documents he produced for goldberg 
no us law or treaty applies to the case the united states and 
cyprus have both signed a unesco convention on stolen artworks but 
it does not apply here to properties removed from their home 
country before 1983 
the case could rest on two questions was goldberg a goodfaith 
purchaser of the mosaics as required by swiss law and was the 
republic of cyprus diligent in trying to get the mosaics back 
under swiss law a sale is legal if the buyer acts openly and in 
the goodfaith belief that the item was obtained legally 
regardless of whether the seller legitimately owns the article 
the law has made switzerland a hotbed for international art 
transactions 
as for cyprus efforts to get back the mosaics the governments 
antiquities department notified museums in 1980 the mosaics were 
gone two years later the cyprus embassy in washington issued a 
news release 
but ms lowenthal said her foundation which keeps files on 
30000 stolen artworks was never notified 
were not so famous in the mediterranean but if a government 
was eager to spread the word to all possible agencies it would not 
take them very long to discover our existence she said 
for now the mosaics are in an indianapolis bank vault 
walter hopps director of the menil collection in houston who 
last year solved a similar problem through a loan agreement with 
cyprus said the lawsuit will become a test case 
if the courts uphold the legality of the entry if theres 
even a window of time where it looks like it might stand then the 
possibility exists that millions and millions of dollars worth of 
plundered antiquities will pour into the united states he said 
it will be a horrible precedent

thousands of workers nationwide went 
on strike for higher pay monday defying an appeal by president 
corazon aquino who said labor unrest would discourage needed 
foreign investment 
the government said the general strike affected 169 companies 
employing more than 137000 workers 
unions said however that workers from 800 affiliates 
nationwide walked off the job including 110 at foreign companies 
based in the philippines they said half a million workers on 
central luzon island alone stayed home 
mondays strike was called by the militant labor advisory 
consultative council a union umbrella group that claims a 
nationwide membership of 900000 workers 
council spokesman crispin beltran called the strike a success 
workers are rediscovering their strength beltran said he 
said unions covered by the council also would strike tuesday 
the strikes were called friday by union goups hoping to increase 
the daily minimum wage by 142 currently the minimum wage varies 
from 255 and 3 a day depending upon area and type of work 
the council said its workers also would join a nationwide 
walkout thursday called by the more moderate trade union congress 
which claims a membership of 12 million workers 
mrs aquino has rejected the wage demand as inflationary and on 
sunday appealed to workers not to strike saying the walkout would 
discourage foreign investors and hurt the economy 
i have already appealed to them to reconsider their drastic 
mass action as it will prejudice the unemployed mrs aquino 
said prospective investors might be discouraged and at this 
point the most important thing is to create more jobs and 
livelihood opportunities 
on monday the house of representatives approved a bill that 
would grant workers a raise of between 40 cents and 1 a day the 
senate approved an increase of between 50 cents and 1 to be 
implemented over a year

factories and plantations unions said but local government 
officials contacted by telephone said workers from only five 
companies there were on strike

police said monday they found an arms 
cache that included shoulderfired missiles they believe were to be 
used against lebanese army helicopters possibly one carrying gen 
michel aoun the christian leader 
andreas potamaris assistant police chief said six lebanese men 
were arrested he quoted one as saying we came to cyprus to 
clear up our interlebanese accounts 
five of the suspects arrived illegally in two rubber dinghies 
police said 
the carefully wrapped missiles were found 150 yards offshore 
about half a mile from the larnaca airport apron the helicopters 
use for daily flights between cyprus and lebanon 
police said the plot was uncovered when scuba divers found the 
two sovietdesigned sam7 missiles and launchers sunday on a reef 
in about six feet of water only the firing mechanisms were missing 
aoun had been scheduled to go through the airport last week on 
his way to an arab league summit in morocco where arab leaders 
were discussing the 14yearold lebanese civil war but did not 
make the trip 
potamaris said police raided a beachfront apartment monday and 
found the dinghies five kalashnikov assault rifles 13 magazines 
of ammunition 28 grenades two limpet mines and the firing 
mechanisms for the rockets 
although the targets had not been confirmed he said one can 
draw an inference from the fact that the rocket launchers were 
found less than a kilometer from the larnaca airport apron where 
the helicopters of the christian lebanese army come and go daily 
interior minister christodoulos veniamin said on television the 
target was an arab personality who was to arrive by helicoptr 
but he did not elaborate 
they planned to commit a crime on the soil of cyprus and this 
of course is unacceptable he said we are not sure yet what 
they say is true because we just started the investigation 
police sources said privately it may have been aoun whose 
christian army units have been fighting a moslem alliance of 
syrians and druse militiamen since early march 
two days before the missiles were discovered police detained a 
lebanese for wandering through this southern port in a suspicious 
manner they found that salam khafasi did not have an entry stamp 
in his passport 
through him police found the other suspects and the apartment 
the other five arrested were identified as tawfik wadih ashaar 
idris jamal jaber wadih salim salamon rostom najib sirhan and 
emil gharali 
police said gharali picked up friday after khafasis arrest 
was the only one to enter cyprus legally 
photographers were allowed to take pictures of the suspects but 
when asked why they were in cyprus the men shouted get away we 
cant tell you anything 
in september police found the tripod base for a milan antitank 
missile launcher on the larnaca airport outskirts but were unable 
to determine who put it there or why 
omar ahmed hawwilo a 28yearold lebanese was sentenced to 15 
years in prison last year for trying to blow up the israeli embassy 
in nicosia with a car bomb it exploded 200 yards from the embassy 
on may 11 1988 killing the driver and two cypriots and wounding 
people 
three senior palestine liberation organization guerrilla officrs 
were killed by a car bomb in february 1988 at limassol port in 
southeern cyprus a ferry scheduled to carry palestinians on a 
protest voyage to israel was disabled by a limpet mine the day

head of the main intelligence agency and the home labor and 
construction ministers the officials said speaking on condition 
of anonymity

radical students entered a fourth day monday the protesters want 
roh to step down

cathedral appeared weak and eight collapsed from fatigue but 
refused to resume eating riot police surrounded the cathedral but

wellwishers hung from trees and tossed red roses 
monday as thousands of people marched behind populist boris n 
yeltsin in a spontaneous celebration of his stunning appointment to 
the nations new legislature 
the 58yearold firebrand was besieged by a roaring and 
deliriously happy mass of supporters after he left the kremlin 
where the congress of peoples deputies had just given him a seat 
in the new legislature the supreme soviet 
yeltsin had failed to win enough votes in the congress a newly 
created 2250 parliament to win election to the supreme soviet a 
fulltime legislature that has been given broad powers 
but one candidate who was elected by the congress agreed to 
resign to open a seat for yeltsin a reformer considered perhaps 
the most popular figure behind president mikhail s gorbachev and 
the congress overwhelmingly agreed 
the action came one day after thousands had protested yeltsins 
defeate 
hooray hooray soviets shouted as they joined the towering 
silverhaired man from sverdlovsk in a spontaneous victory march 
through central moscow 
most had learned of his victory from the live television and 
radio broadcasts of the congress session but one incredulous 
pedestrian asked the boisterous entourage is it really true 
congratulations yelled others who greeted yeltsin as he 
walked from the kremlin and then along gorky street one of 
moscows busiest thoroughfares all the people are with you 
one man yelled to yeltsin who wore a bluegray suit and towered 
above the crowd 
anna sabalova with tears of joy in her eyes told a reporter 
we knew he was an honest person we knew he was elected by 
millions but that just a few in the congress had held him back 
a city bus driver stopped after apparently spotting yeltsin on a 
sidewalk in front of the kremlin he honked his horn rhythmically 
and dozens of passengers got off to join the procession 
it was a display of the kind of people power that gave yeltsin 
89 percent of the vote in citywide moscow elections in march to the 
congress 
yeltsin smiled broadly and thanked supporters as he made his way 
through the crush during a onehour march to pushkin square a 
popular site for demonstrations where an estimated 5000 people 
gathered 
women kissed him men shook his hand and he carried red 
carnations and pink roses given him by supporters 
at the square yeltsin told a crowd of thousands some perched 
on trees to get a glance of their new legislator that his 
appointment was a victory by the people over the secret apparatus 
i thank you for your faith yeltsin using a megaphone told 
the jubilant crowd he wound up the rally with his hands held above 
his head in a gesture of victory 
even yegor k ligachev yeltsins conservative foe on the ruling 
politburo was unusually conciliatory 
it was democratic it was just ligachev told reporters i 
have one way of looking at things and he has another the 
important thing is to stick to party comradeship 
yeltsin and ligachev have clashed several times after 
criticizing the slow pace of soviet reform and naming ligachev as a 
cause in october 1987 yeltsin was fired as moscow party chief and 
lost his own nonvoting seat on the politburo 
human rights campaigner andrei d sakharov a congress deputy 
said in an interview that yeltsins elevation marked a 
restoration of justice although he said it was not 
accomplished smoothly 
yeltsin with a wide smile told reporters as he left the 
session his appointment showed the congress was becoming 
gradually more democratic

the process of heating up the reactor at 
the seabrook nuclear power plant reached its first major step 
monday as operators prepare the controversial plant for its first 
lowpower testing 
the first atomic chain reaction expected within seven to 10 
days will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant that is a 
decade behind schedule billions of dollars over budget and a focus 
of the nations antinuclear movement 
the nuclear regulatory commission gave seabrook its lowpower 
license last friday the heating process began saturday and on 
monday morning the water in the reactors cooling system reached 
200 degrees 
everythings going smoothly and as planned seabrook 
spokesman ron sher said we want to conduct lowpower tests as 
soon as possible to make sure there are no adjustements we need to 
make to the plant 
the reactor must reach 557 degrees expected to take five days 
before preparations can begin to start the nuclear chain reaction 
in the 100 tons of uranium fuel 
nearly three years after the reactor was completed the 6 
billion project surmounted most obstacles to win nrc approval for 
the tests on may 18 but the commission granted a oneweek stay of 
the license so a federal court could rule on requests to delay the 
tests 
last thursday the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia declined to delay the tests and the lowpower 
license was issued friday by the nrcs office of nuclear reactor 
regulation 
the license will let seabrook conduct atomic tests at up to 5 
percent of full power the plant must win final federal approval 
for evacuation plans for nearby communities before it could operate 
commercially 
evacuation in case of emergency is the major issue raised by 
opponents of the plant who say communities in the area couldnt 
possibly be evacuated soon enough 
late saturday plant operators began opening valves and rapidly 
circulating 100000 gallons of water through the reactor coolant 
system the reactor is heated by the friction of that fastwater 
circulation 
after the reactor reaches 557 degrees operators will have to 
calibrate instruments and perform other tests before they can 
remove control rods from the reactor core and dilute the boron 
concentration in the reactor coolant water 
the boron and control rods absorb neutrons from decaying uranium 
atoms preventing them from striking other uranium atoms and 
starting a chain reaction removing them allows the neutrons to 
split uranium atoms and begin a selfsustained nuclear chain 
reaction 
there would be about seven days of tests at power levels 
ranging from 001 percent to 3 percent of the reactors capacity 
after those tests the reactor would be cooled down again until the 
next step in the fight over whether the plant will go into 
operation or be scrapped

bat brown 65 recalled later we were both medics attached to 
the infantry and we worked together in a dispensary at the prison 
camp 
brown is a retired insurance agent and molnar is a retired 
broome county sheriffs deputy 
germans captured the two dec 19 1944 during the battle of the 
bulge in southeastern belgium northern luxembourg and northern 
france

to the beat of muffled drums and the sound 
of a fife the remains of 19 black union soldiers lost since the 
civil war were escorted monday to their final resting place in a 
national cemetery 
the remains unearthed two years ago during road construction at 
folly beach sc are those of members of the 54th and 55th 
massachusetts regiment and the 1st north carolina infantry 
regiment three black units that fought for the north in the civil 
war 
the massachusetts regiments were the first union regiments 
formed with volunteer black troops 
the soldiers were believed killed during a july 18 1863 
assault on fort wagner outside charleston sc although they 
also may have died of disease 
they had been buried in a military cemetery within the union 
encampment outside fort wagner but the burial ground apparently 
was neglected and forgotten after the war 
among those at the memorial day ceremony were massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis and two men whose forefathers fought in the 
massachusetts regiments the three laid a wreath in front of the 
coffins laid out in three rows 
more than 4000 people gathered at an edge of the cemetery 
beneath three sprawling oak trees 
here we hear not only the voices of massahcusetts past and 
the cannon of fort wagner but the warm promise of our nation of 
the blood of its men and women black and white alive with a love 
of our beautiful land dukakis said 
this issue of black men fighting for the union army was highly 
controversial at the time im proud to say they were supported by 
the people of massachusetts dukakis said 
the remains were buried in accordance with 1863 army regulations 
and the coffins were covered with a 34star american flag the 
massachusetts state flag also was draped on each coffin 
they were escorted to the burial site at the national cemetery 
in beaufort by actors dressed as union soldiers from the movie 
glory about the 54th massachusetts regiment which recently 
completed filming near savannah ga 
soil from massachusetts was sprinkled onto the coffins 
the black soldiers of the massachusetts 54th and 55th 
regiments were fighting for their own liberty to grasp their own 
freedom and to ensure both for others of their own race dukakis 
said 
deputy state archeologist steven smith said other members of the 
massachusetts regiments also are buried in the cemetery he said 
they died at the civil war battle of honey hill about 12 miles from 
beaufort

kilauea the worlds most active 
volcano has begun ravaging private property again after a 
yearlong quiet spell 
the volcano destroyed four houses in may for a total of 68 
houses destroyed since kilaueas latest eruption began more than 
six years ago 
oozing lava overtook the 68th home saturday and on sunday cut 
off the only road to 21 surviving homes in the royal gardens 
subdivision said hawaii county civil defense administrator harry 
kim he said all residents were evacuated before the road was cut 
for most of the past year lava flowing to the pacific ocean had 
been hidden from sight it was confined inside tubes hidden beneath 
the gray moonscape of hardened lava that cuts a twomilewide swath 
through the otherwise lush puna coastline on hawaii island 
but the tubes became partially blocked earlier this month and 
forced lava into the mostly rural subdivision which has been 
devastated since the eruption began in january 1983 scientists 
said 
approximately 40 percent of kilaueas daily lava output of 
500000 cubic meters was creeping through the lower portion of 
royal gardens which stretches up a slope overlooking the islands 
southeast coast said reggie okamura a spokesman for the us 
geological surveys hawaiian volcano observatory

populist boris n yeltsin a selfdescribed 
childhood hooligan has struck on a formula for political survival 
turn hard talk about economic reform into popular acclaim 
before being resurrected again from political defeat monday he 
used a recent interview to attack the leadership of his old mentor 
president mikhail s gorbachev for inconsistency 
indecisiveness halfmeasures 
earlier this year yeltsin won nearly 90 percent of the vote for 
his moscow seat in the new congress of peoples deputies by 
accusing the communist elite of wallowing in luxury while soviets 
scour the black market for basic items like soap 
the burly rubberyfaced 58yearold who was ousted from the 
ruling politburo in 1987 made his political comeback in a surprise 
turnaround monday by winning a seat on the working legislature 
known as the supreme soviet he was initially rejected but a new 
lawmaker stepped down to make space for yeltsin all with 
gorbachevs blessing 
boris n yeltsin is once again a force to be reckoned with 
not everyone holds him for a hero though some baltic 
independence activists see him as a reformer but not necessarily 
an ally 
and conservative communist party leaders demanded an 
investigation of him when yeltsin called for consideration of 
multiple parties 
this is not the first time yeltsin has sown mischief a 
selfdeclared troublemaker as a child he lost a thumb and 
forefinger playing with a hand grenade 
eventually however he showed a preference for the 
roughandtumble of soviet politics he served as regional 
communist party boss in his hometown of sverdlovsk in the ural 
mountains before gorbachev brought him to moscow in 1985 
as the capitals party chief he quickly moved to center stage 
by fighting party privileges and catching managers holding back 
scarce consumer goods for special customers 
sarcastic and authoritarian he demanded a crackdown on 
corruption and criticized rampant nepotism once he revealed that 
70 percent of the students at a prestigious institute were children 
of ranking officials 
his initial setback came in october 1987 when he took aim at 
politburo conservative yegor k ligachev and gorbachev himself at a 
party meeting 
he demanded faster reforms and charged that gorbachev his 
mentor received intolerable glorification stung party leaders 
promptly fired yeltsin from both the moscow party job and the 
nonvoting spot on the politburo 
typically a disgraced politburo member becomes a 
nonperson vanishing forever from the soviet political scene 
but yeltsin resurfaced within a week as a deputy construction 
minister and remained one of the partys top 250 leaders on the 
policymaking central committee 
now even his old nemesis ligachev who shook with laughter over 
yeltsins initial defeat for a seat on the supreme soviet has 
changed his tune ligachev told reporters monday that it was only 
fair that yeltsin gain a seat

a 27yearold woman who spent a record 130 days 
isolated in a new mexico cave began undergoing a weeklong series of 
tests monday that could yield clues about the medical effects of 
longterm space flight 
early indications are that stefania follini an interior 
decorator from ancona italy who volunteered for the experiment 
is faring well despite losing 17 pounds and showing signs of 
lethargy and inattentiveness during her latter days in the 
underground plexiglass home 
at this point all of the results have been normal there is 
nothing strange that we have noticed not even simple anemia 
said dr andrea galvagno one of two italian researchers in houston 
who have monitored her health 
there is nothing at this point that would make me feel nervous 
about her health he said adding that it is still too early to 
tell what specific effects the longterm isolation had on her 
immune system 
dr jon defrance who is assisting in the research said 
previous isolation studies have shown a change in the immune 
function whereby a person might become susceptible to certain types 
of diseases 
of course this has rather profound implications for a space 
flight said defrance an associate professor at texas medical 
school in houston 
testing this week also will include a skin sensitivity test at 
the johnson space center and a bone density examination at the 
baylor college of medicine researchers said 
ms follini whose sense of time became so disoriented during 
isolation that she emerged may 23 thinking the date was march 14 
said she is still having a hard time adjusting again to a 24hour 
day 
she glanced constantly at her watch during an afternoon press 
conference at hca gulf pines hospital 
i keep looking at it because i still havent found a real use 
for this she said through an interpreter when questioned about 
her frequent glances at the timepiece i can also tell you that 
every time i look at the watch im surprised at how quickly time 
goes by 
she said she also felt healthy and very rested after her 
seclusion despite losing weight and once going for three months 
without a menstrual cycle subsequently she had three in less than 
three weeks 
i didnt even feel that i was losing the weight ms follini 
said adding that her loss of a menstrual cycle did not concern her 
because i felt that it was not necessary for me under the 
conditions 
montalbini maurizio a psychologist who is overseeing the 
experiment said that during a similar study in which he spent 210 
days in isolation he experienced a significant drop in the male 
hormone testosterone because his body found no need to produce it 
he also emerged with immune deficiencies that took eight months 
to overcome but did not even develop a common cold during that 
time galvagno said 
previous subjects of isolation experiments by the nonprofit 
italian research group pioneer frontier exploration and 
researches have shown signs of depression but ms follini did 
not the doctors said 
some of the physical changes she experienced were likely related 
to stress doctors said but ms follini said she did not sense any 
stress during her isolation only some frustration 
the situation for me was all new so every time i was going to 
do something it was a problem for me she said citing situations 
in which she had to draw her own blood or place electrodes on her 
body to monitor vital signs 
ms follini who is 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 90 pounds 
after emerging from the cave last week began wearing a heart and 
bloodpressure monitor on a belt holster before going into 
isolation and will continue to wear it for two more months 
at this point im used to it she said its almost a 
part of me

women and 14 children were aboard the boat that reached biryo 
island early monday and all of the refugees were reported to be in 
satisfactory condition biryo island is 48 miles west of sasebo 
the officials said the vietnamese told investigators they left 
their homeland on april 20 and their boat 18 feet wide had 
drifted for the past week because of trouble with the diesel engine 
at one point the refugees boat was towed by a ship and the 
ships crew provided some rice the vietnamese said but they were 
not able to identify the ship according to the official 
the vietnamese said they had fled vietnam because of harsh 
conditions and they wanted live in a peaceful place said the

communist forces defeated the usbacked government in south 
vietnam in april 1975 of those 2500 settled in japan and the 
remainder left for other countries including the united states 
canada and australia 
the un official in singapore said the government refused to 
allow the dutch tug to land because it was not scheduled to call at 
singapore he said the government asked the un high commissioner 
for refugees to send the refugees to another country 
the tug santania rescued the vietnamese from a sinking boat in 
the south china sea on may 16 and arrived at singapore may 21 
according to the official he said the tug was en route from south 
korea to saudi arabia when it saved the refugees 
last friday we hired a boat and had the refugees transferred 
from the tug to a ship which is now lying in international 
waters he said we hope to finalize formalities to send them 
most likely to the philippines during the next two weeks

guarantees that they will accept them within three months

legislator yossi sarid told parliament on 
monday that the plo has conditionally accepted israels proposal 
for elections in the occupied lands to choose delegates for peace 
talks with israel 
no one in the palestine liberation organization confirmed this 
reported change in its position nor was it confirmed by other 
sources in israel 
sarids remarks came during a stormy parliament session on a 
speech last week by us secretary of state james a baker iii last 
week baker asked israel then to lay aside once and for all the 
unrealistic vision of a greater israel that would include the 
occupied lands 
foreign minister moshe arens said baker harmed israel and the 
peace process when he publicly denounced israeli policies in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip he noted that baker broke a 
longstanding tradition that the united states and israel discuss 
their differences privately 
one facet of a peace plan advanced by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is for elections in the occupied territories 
on monday sarid of the leftwing citizens rights movement said 
the plo has already agreed to elections and passed this on to 
washington 
israel views the plo as a terrorist organization and refuses to 
deal with it 
sarid said the plo told us officials it would agree to 
elections under five conditions including partial israeli army 
withdrawal and a us pledge that it views the plo as a partner in 
the second stage of talks on a final settlement 
the conditions appeared an effort at compromise 
in the past the plo has demanded complete israeli army 
withdrawal before elections shamir has ruled this out but has 
said that as part of an interim autonomy agreement the army could 
pull back from arab population centers 
if sarids report is accurate it would also appear that the plo 
is trying to sidestep israels refusal to deal with the plo by 
insisting only on american not israeli recognition and only at a 
much later stage of the process 
the other plo conditions include international supervision of 
elections participation of palestinians from israeliannexed east 
jerusalem and immunity for candidates said sarid a member of 
parliaments defense and foreign affairs committee 
arens said monday in lashing out at bakers speech the image 
of close relations helps the advancement of peace in the region 
its important that the arabs understand that these are the 
relations between the united states and israel this image is also 
important for israels deterrent power 
im sure baker didnt intend to harm israel but sometimes 
you hurt someone without intention 
referring to media descriptions of bakers speech as balanced 
arens said how can one of our allies take a balanced position 
between us and our enemies between us and those who attacked us 
five times 
arens suggested baker harmed the peace process by emphasizing 
us and israeli differences on a final settlement of the conflict 
washington insists israel return some occupied land in such a 
settlement the rightwing likud bloc to which shamir and arens 
belong opposes all territorial compromise 
im very sorry that baker related to the character of the 
final settlement we are convinced and i thought the united states 
was also convinced that we have to concentrate on the interim 
agreement arens said 
he urged the united states not to raise the hopes of the arabs 
about the final settlement 
under israels peace plan palestinians elected in the balloting 
would negotiate an interim settlement of limited palestinian 
selfrule in the occupied lands 
arens tough rhetoric appeared aimed in part to calm farright 
critics of the peace plan in likud 
three influential likud cabinet ministers are waging a campaign 
to have the plan rejected in a likud central committee meeting 
tentatively scheduled for june 
shamir head of likud threatened to resign if the party rejects 
his initiative shamir rules in a coalition with the leftleaning 
labor party which backs the elections proposal

the government on monday accused the 
united states and other western nations of helping opposition 
forces prepare for polands first democratic elections under 
communist rule 
the polish government judges interference of some western 
figures and institutions in the electoral campaign of our country 
as an unprecedented violation of polands sovereignty this is an 
insult to the national pride of poles said a government 
statement 
the polish government appeals for an immediate halt of 
interfering in the electoral campaign by some western countries in 
any form said the statement that was read on state television 
and carried by the staterun news agency pap 
the statement also charged that some western diplomats were 
actively participating in opposition election meetings and 
sometimes fulfilling instructive functions 
it said members of the public in the united states and other 
countries were raising money for the opposition and supplying 
printing machines for campaign efforts 
the government claimed that munichbased radio free europe is 
conducting an electoral campaign for solidarity for many hours a 
day and the american radio station financed by the us 
government is constantly instructing poles for whom they should 
vote and especially for whom they shouldnt vote 
former carter administration adviser zbigniew brzezinski who is 
visiting poland was criticized for an interview he gave to the 
oppositions election newspaper he was quoted as saying that a 
weak solidarity showing would be a surprise and have unfavorable 
consequences for poland 
this is an open and simply brutal attempt of influencing 
results of elections in a foreign country the statement said 
poles are to vote sunday to fill seats in the 460member sejm 
and the 100seat senate 
under the governments historic accord with the solidarityled 
opposition all seats in the senate will be open to any group or 
organization in the sejm the opposition can seek 161 seats with 
the rest reserved for the communists and their allies 
solidarity has endorsed one candidate for each of the 261 seats 
it can seek 
at a news conference in warsaw party secretary zygmunt 
czarzasty criticized solidarity instructions that voters should 
cross out all nonsolidarity candidates on sunday 
the balloting procedure is complicated in order to vote yes for 
one candidate a voter must cross out all the other names on the 
ballot 
solidaritys campaign literature clearly explains the procedure 
but communist officials have protested that advocating that voters 
cross out all nonsolidarity candidates is unfair 
we say vote for the best and we never say cross out these or 
those czarzasty said 
for the seats set aside for the party and its allies no 
solidarity candidates are running if more than 50 percent of the 
voters cross out all the candidates on those ballots no one would 
be elected and some seats would simply be unfilled 
in other developments about 400 supporters of several banned 
groups held a rally in warsaw groups such as the polish socialist 
partydemocratic revolution and the polish independence party 
barred from the elections advocate a boycott saying the elections 
are not free because the communists are guaranteed a majority in 
the sejm 
protesters shouted boycott elections and down with 
communism police were present but no arrests were reported 
parliament passed a law pardoning political offenses committed 
since the august 1980 agreements that initially legalized the 
solidarity trade union 
pap said the law pardons and erases from the record misdemeanors 
and also fiscal offenses that were politically motivated in 
connection with strikes and protest actions or violations of 
military rules 
solidarity the only free union movement in the soviet bloc was 
suspended when martial law was imposed in december 1981 and 
subsequently was outlawed by parliament it was legalized again in 
april following lengthy negotiations that also set the rules for 
sundays balloting 
thousands of union activists were arrested and many were fired 
from their jobs during the crackdown under martial law that was 
lifted about a year later

president todor zhikvov blamed turkey on 
monday for growing unrest by ethnic turks in this country and urged 
it to accept moslems who want to emigrate 
reports said bulgarian authorities imposed emergency measures to 
stifle ethnic turks who are resisting an assimilation campaign the 
president speaking on television and radio made no reference to 
such measures 
but he accused turkey as well as western circles and radio 
stations of an antibulgarian campaign 
he also told turkish authorities open your frontier to all 
bulgarian moslems who want to go to turkey for a shortterm stay or 
for permanent residence 
even before riots mainly in northern bulgaria a week ago the 
sofia government began deporting ethnic turks deemed to be 
troublemakers or otherwise undesirable 
an estimated 300 of them have been forced to flee mostly to 
vienna austria and belgrade yugoslavia scores have been picked 
up by turkish airliners for resettlement in turkey more turks were 
arriving in vienna and belgrade on monday turkish diplomats said 
turkish refugee sources in belgrade said monday that the 
emergency measures in bulgaria confine ethnic turks around the 
black sea port of varna to their homes at night 
they also said radio broadcasts from neighboring turkey are 
being jammed and all mosques in the area have been closed police 
have forbidden more than two people from walking together in the 
streets of the largely turkishpopulated towns they said 
the deportees declined to be identified for fear of reprisals 
against relatives in bulgaria 
according to an official report three people died in the recent 
ethnic unrest in bulgaria but deportees have put the figure at up 
to 30 the violence flared during demonstrations for restoration of 
ethnic turkish rights according to diplomatic and exile sources 
a nationwide drive begun in 1984 forced the estimated 900000 
bulgarian turks to change their moslem names to slavic and 
restricted their religious and civil rights such as public use of 
their language 
the bulgarian government does not recognize the turkish 
minority it says the people targeted by the campaign are actually 
slavs who were converted to islam during five centuries of ottoman 
occupation 
several western nations have said they will raise the issue at a 
35nation human rights conference starting in paris on tuesday

the uns world food program said monday it needs 
417000 more tons of food to meet emergencies in 1989 and the 
shortage might affect deliveries to refugees 
unless additional resources are forthcoming the program may 
be forced to stop responding to all but the most vital needs 
executive director james ingram said in a report to the 
organizations governing council 
edouard saouma directorgeneral of the un food and 
agriculture organization said the way food aid programs are 
conducted should be reviewed 
he said using cash rather than commodities in some cases would 
allow the purchase of food on local markets 
speaking to the world food programs committee on food aid 
policies and programs saouma said developing countries wanted the 
appraisal partly because new technology and reforms in agricultural 
policy have created the possibility of using locally produced 
staples in aid programs instead of imports 
ingram said in his report the shortage of emergency supplies 
could lead to a disruption in deliveries to refugees and an 
inability to meet unexpected disasters 
he said the shortage included 142000 tons needed for afghan 
refugees in pakistan and iran and 182000 tons for victims drought 
and crop failures in africa

political opposition monday to help them arrange peace talks with 
the new rightist government 
the proposal was the fourth such overture since january the 
others have foundered because of what officials viewed as 
unrealistic demands by the insurgents

offer in a communique signed by two top commanders

governed for five years will transfer power thursday to alfredo 
cristiani of the rightist republican nationalist alliance or 
arena he was elected in march 
despite their renewed call for talks the rebels communique 
said the installation of the arena government means a 
deepening and prolongation of war in el salvador 
moreover the rebels made no concessions or major changes of 
position from previous proposals 
cristiani had no immediate comment on the latest proposal he 
has said previously he is willing to talk to rebel representatives 
but will not negotiate on powersharing 
ricardo alvarenga valdivieso president of congress and arena 
director reacted to the new proposal by telling reporters there 
are things that are done just so they will be rejected 
among the demands the rebels urged arena to ensure the trial of 
party founder and principal ideologue roberto daubuisson a 
cashiered army major accused of involvement in death squads and the 
1980 slaying of archbishop monsignor oscar romero

reform be maintained and that banks and sales of export crops be 
nationalized 
daubuisson denies he ran death squads the party says it has 
nothing to do with such organizations 
cristiani says agrarian reform will not be rolled back but he 
says the private sector will have a dominant role in banking and 
export 
the guerrillas in turn promise not to kill arena officials or 
their family members or family members of military officers they 
also say they would stop blowing up utility poles in the city and 
imposing nationwide road transport bans

cardinal john oconnor of new york said 
monday that his trip to lebanon did not help the nine american 
hostages and nine other foreigners held here and he hoped to return 
to try again 
the roman catholic archbishop appealed three times to 
proiranian kidnappers after arriving saturday to be allowed to 
visit the americans he received no response 
at his final 30minute news conference monday at the bkirki 
monastry north of beirut oconnor said in reply to questions that 
he did not know if acting prime minister salim hoss was a christian 
or a moslem and that he was unsure of army commander gen michel 
aouns political role 
he also said he was unaware of the religion of aoun who heads a 
christian military cabinet vying for authority against hoss 
cabinet 
oconnor was expected to leave tuesday for cyprus by army 
helicopter and to stop in rome before returning to new york police 
in cyprus on monday uncovered a plot to shoot down helicopters 
coming from the christian enclave 
the prelate said monday that if he offended anyone by canceling 
a scheduled visit to moslem west beirut i apologize to them 
the cancellation sunday drew angry statements from hoss head of 
the mostly moslem cabinet in lebanons dual government and other 
moslem leaders 
oconnor said the decision was made because he was told there 
was fighting along the green line that separates the capital into 
christian and moslem sectors 
the information i was given was inaccurate there clearly was 
no special problem oconnor said he refused to say who gave him 
the wrong information 
a civil war has raged in lebanon for more than 14 years 
oconnors visit was an attempt to refocus attention on the 
plight of the 18 foreigners missing and believed held hostage in 
lebanon the issue has been overshadowed by 11 weeks of fighting 
terry anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 and is the 
longest held hostage 
oconnor said monday my time is running out i have not been 
able to learn anything about you hostages i hope ill come back 
and continue trying 
he said he sought through various people who might know if 
they could give any idea of where the hostages might be i have 
been given no leads whatsoever no understanding of where they 
might be 
oconnors last hostage appeal was made in an interview with the 
ap in which he said if your captors will permit me to come to 
see you wherever you are if its physically possible for me i 
will come 
he said of the furor over his canceled west beirut visit 
im sorry that people feel that way if there are those who 
are offended by my visit i apologize to them it was impossible 
for me to do the things i would like to do 
earlier monday oconnor spoke with hoss by telephone for 30 
minutes 
hoss gave his views on the situation and i listened very 
respectfully and he listened very respectfully to mine oconnor 
said adding its not for me to determine a solution for 
lebanon 
hoss later left for damascus for talks with syrian leaders on 
arab efforts to end the lebanese crisis syria has 40000 soldiers 
in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the league and 
has been involved in an artillery war with the christians that 
began march 8 
when reporters told the cardinal hoss was a sunni moslem 
oconnor said i did not know that 
oconnor was guest of maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah 
sfeir in lebanon he met aoun for 1 hours sunday at the bunker of 
the shellbattered presidential palace in baabda east of beirut 
oconnor declared complete support for aouns demands that the 
syrian army withdraw from lebanon 
at least 359 people have been killed in the artillery duels 
between the 20000 christian troopers and an alliance of the 
syrians and druse militiamen which started two days after aouns 
forces blockaded illegal ports run by moslem militias 
an arab league summit in morocco last week urged warring 
factions in lebanon to strictly adhere to a truce the league 
proclaimed may 11 
syrian artillery positions in west beirut continued firing at

patients do not have the right to be fully informed 
of their disease by their doctor a japanese court ruled monday in 
the case of a woman who was told only that she had gallstones 
before she died of cancer 
the womans husband immediately dismissed the decision by nagoya 
district court as ridiculous and pledged to appeal it the 
ruling would not take effect nationwide unless the supreme court 
upheld it and appeals often take 10 years to reach the high court 
kazuko makino a 50yearold nurse died in 1983 of gallbladder 
and liver cancer her doctor etsuro orito of the nagoya second red 
cross hospital found a tumor in her gallbladder but kept that 
information from her and her family 
although orito recommended surgery mrs makino decided against 
it believing she had gallstones the hospital told the court orito 
was unsure if the tumor was malignant and therefore had no 
responsibility to tell her she had cancer 
her husband ichiro makino sued the hospital for 342000 in 
damages he said his wife would have agreed to an operation if she 
had known her true condition 
however the court in nagoya 170 miles west of tokyo ruled 
monday that it is up to a doctors discretion how much information 
to divulge the court said it was the patients fault she did not 
undergo the operation 
although a doctor has responsibility to explain to patients 
about their diseases it is the doctor who decides when to whom 
and to what extent the explanation should be made chief judge 
kuniharu ito said 
makino said he would appeal to nagoya high court 
it is doctors ethics that i have been fighting for makino 
said in an interview why didnt dr orito at least tell us the 
problem may have been something more serious instead of telling us 
lies 
in japan doctors generally give patients little information 
about their diseases and often do not even tell them what medicine 
they are taking 
doctors frequently do not tell patients when they have cancer 
believing it would destroy their will to live many japanese 
believe cancer is incurable 
during the prolonged deterioration of emperor hirohito the 
government refused to confirm widespread reports that he was 
suffering from cancer despite intense worldwide interest in his 
condition it was only after the 87yearold monarch died on jan 7 
that officials confirmed he died of cancer 
in a survey in april by the nationally circulated newspaper 
asahi shimbun 60 percent of healthy japanese said they wanted to 
be told if they had cancer however only 20 percent said they 
would tell relatives with the disease 
cancer the no 1 cause of death in japan since 1981 claimed 
206000 lives last year 
hiroshi horie a surgeon at the kyoto prefectural university of 
medicine hospital supported the courts ruling 
ive seen many patients who got worse after learning they had 
cancer he said we doctors try to do only what is best for 
patients and so we dont tell them directly of course we tell 
their family thats a must he said in a telephone interview 
tetsuo kashiwagi vice chairman of osakas yodogawa christian 
hospital said doctors should be able to decide whether to tell 
patients they have cancer but they should respect patients 
right to decide what to do with their lives 
more doctors have come to tell patients the truth and thats 
the way it should be he said

four neonazi skinheads attacked a 
couple they thought was jewish and a black man who tried to help 
them and were pulling out baseball bats when police arrived 
officials said monday 
bystanders applauded sunday as police arrested william r 
killackey 21 of yorba linda his sister amy killackey 19 of 
west covina scott wilson 28 of west covina and timothy zaal 
25 of glendora 
the four were booked for investigation of assault and violation 
of civil rights and were held in lieu of 50000 bail each said 
police sgt john ortega 
there is zero tolerance in our city for any racially motivated 
crime ortega said we just will not tolerate that in our 
city 
the three men and one woman apparently stopped just before 5 
pm sunday at a shopping center to buy beer then began shouting 
ethnic insults at the jewish couple who were loading groceries 
into their car ortega said 
the 30yearold man was then kicked in the chest and knocked to 
the ground the sergeant said the 28yearold woman was beaten as 
she tried to protect her 2weekold son ortega said the infant 
was unharmed 
the three adults were treated for bruises and scrapes at the 
scene by paramedics police said they were not hospitalized 
the victims whose names were withheld by police are of middle 
eastern descent and speak with accents but officers didnt ask if 
they actually are jewish said officer edward careaga who 
investigated the attack police said the family was from glendora 
another eastern los angeles county city near la verne 
as a black man attempted to intervene the four skinheads began 
shouting racial insults at him police saidonce he came to their 
aid they even threw a shopping cart at him ortega said 
the four all of whom had shaved heads or closecropped hair 
were pulling aluminum baseball bats from their cars as police 
pulled up ortega said they cooperated with the arresting officers 
and were taken into custody about five minutes after the incident 
began he said 
the reason they gave for stopping was that the officers were 
white and they didnt want to fight white people ortega said 
bystanders in the parking lot cheered as the four were taken 
away the sergeant added 
the alleged assailants thought the victims were jewish but the 
couple wasnt wearing any religious garb or didnt have any other 
outward indication that they were jewish the sergeant said 
the selfdescribed skinheads were carrying several cards 
including one from the glendalebased american white separatist 
group and one from the placentiabased group white power

maverick communist boris n yeltsin defeated by 
fellow deputies in a bid for the new soviet legislature was 
suddenly handed a seat monday and celebrated by leading a noisy 
victory parade through central moscow 
in a parliamentary maneuver that had president mikhail s 
gorbachevs blessing a place was opened for the former moscow 
party boss when a winner in the elections to the fulltime 
legislature the supreme soviet resigned on condition that yeltsin 
take his place 
an exuberant yeltsin said the move indicated the congress of 
peoples deputies which elected the members of the legislature 
is gradually becoming more democratic if it goes further along 
this road there is hope it will justify the hopes of the people 
a roaring and ecstatic mass of supporters surged upon yeltsin 
after he left the congress wellwishers hung from trees and tossed 
red roses 
yeltsin smiling broadly led a spontaneous onehour march from 
the kremlin along gorky street to pushkin square where about 5000 
people gathered women kissed him and men shook his hand 
all the people are with you one man yelled 
yeltsin thanked the throng through a megaphone and ended the 
rally with hands held high in a gesture of victory 
also on monday gorbachev pushed his choice for vice president 
anatoly i lukyanov through the congress but not before the 
deputies subjected the littleknown schoolmate of gorbachevs to 
tough questioning on his views and fitness for the job 
the 2250seat congress empowered to elect the national 
president from among its own members and to confirm the presidents 
choice of vice president let omsk university law professor alexei 
i kazannik vacate his spot in the bicameral supreme soviet in 
order to have yeltsin take his place 
the decision reached in minutes without a direct vote on 
yeltsins candidacy defused a tense situation that developed when 
the outspoken opponent of official privilege finished last on a 
list of 12 candidates for 11 russian federation seats in the 
legislatures soviet of nationalities in results announced saturday 
tens of thousands of muscovites chanting shame rallied 
sunday in a stadium parking lot to protest the defeat of yeltsin 
and other outspoken moscow progressives running for the legislature 
leaflets circulated through the crowd proposed a onehour strike 
thursday if yeltsin were not named to some high post by the 
congress staterun tv said sunday a poll found 49 percent of 
soviets surveyed were unhappy with how the elections had been run 
yeltsin the top votegetter in marchs popular elections for 
the congress received 1185 votes from fellow deputies for a seat 
in the supreme soviet while 964 voted against him but he was 
defeated by 11 other candidates including kazannik who got more 
votes than yeltsin 
kazannik a law professor took the podium in the nationally 
televised proceedings to offer to renounce his seat on condition 
yeltsin replace him without another round of voting 
he said he could not return to omsk as a legislator because the 
congress had failed to elect many prominent scientists and 
politicians including yeltsin i would be ashamed to face my 
voters said kazannik who is not a member of the communist party 
only a few deputies voted against a proposal by victor palm of 
estonia to allow kazanniks resignation and his replacement by the 
burly whitehaired yeltsin 58 
inasmuch as comrade yeltsin received a majority of the vote 
the open place can be filled by him gorbachev ruled from the 
dais naturally it does not require a repeat vote 
gorbachev told kazannik the congress welcomed his initiative 
yeltsin stripped of his moscow and politburo posts after an 
october 1987 speech criticizing the slow place of gorbachevs 
reforms emerged from the congress hall beaming with kazannik at 
his side 
he said muscovites who gave him 89 percent of the vote in a 
twoway race in march would be partially satisfied 
on the march to pushkin square a city bus stopped and dozens 
of passengers got off to join in 
one yeltsin supporter anna s sabalova her eyes wet with 
tears declared joyfully we knew he was a honest person we knew 
he was elected by millions but that just a few in the congress 
held him back 
even yegor k ligachev a politburo member accused by yeltsin of 
impeding gorbachevs drive for perestroika praised the decision 
telling reporters it was democratic and the right thing to do 
earlier monday lukyanov underwent nearly four hours of 
meandering questioning in which he was asked to explain his record 
and views on issues ranging from fighting crime to the 1939 
germansoviet treaty that deeded control of estonia latvia and 
lithuanian to the kremlin 
gorbachev allowed the protracted questioning of lukyanov who 
was first elected vice president by the supreme soviet in october 
but made it clear from the outset he wanted his handpicked deputy 
confirmed without competing nominations from the floor 
gorbachev had tried for a vote on lukyanov saturday night but 
gave in to loud objections from weary deputies who wanted more 
discussion 
the second time around gorbachev got what he wanted of the 
2250 deputies only human rights activist andrei d sakharov and 
178 others voted against lukyanov in a show of hands there were 
137 abstentions 
lukyanov a student with gorbachev at moscow state universitys 
law school in the 1950s has spent his career in the party and 
government bureaucracy 
lukyanov takes over with other deputy chairmen of the presidium 
of the supreme soviet if the president cannot perform his duties 
he has no other constitutional duties but may be given assignments 
by the president

politburo member imre pozsgay said the 
ruling communist party could give way to a party based on western 
europes social democratic principles radio free europe reported 
pozsgay considered the leading reformer in hungarys communist 
party made the statement in an interview broadcast this weekend by 
the radios hungarian program 
munichbased radio free europe is a usfinanced network that 
beams broadcasts to sovietbloc nations 
radio free europe provided english excerpts of the interview 
that it said was conducted in hungarian by one of the stations 
correspondents who is based in budapest in march hungary became 
the first warsaw pact country to accredit a radio free europe 
journalist 
the transcript provided to news organizations said pozsgay was 
asked if he would accept the position as the leader of a reform 
communist party and quoted him as replying 
i can say that such a party could not be called 
reformcommunist that party would belong to the conceptual 
framework of european socialism 
only a party capable of adapting to the people and to the 
european ideas could be effective and successful 
pozsgay added it would not be based on the communist 
tradition of clinging to abstract ideas but rather on the type of 
european socialist ideas that characterize the italian or french 
socialist parties or the swedish austrian or west german social 
democratic parties 
he was asked if communism is in a crisis and said according to 
the excerpts this is a crisis of stalinism it has become quite 
certain that stalinism cannot be reformed because it has been a 
failure because it has become unsuitable for giving people the 
experience and feeling of freedom 
he said stalinism with its inclination for terror and violence 
should be cleared away from the path because it does not correspond 
either to socialism or to european political culture or to the 
everyday needs of the people 
pozsgay was referring to the years of rule by the late soviet 
dictator josef stalin 
hungarys communist party is undergoing major changes because of 
the reform movement within the party 
in february the partys central committee decided to accept 
political pluralism 
legislative elections scheduled for 1990 will be the first since 
the communist takeover in 1948 under a law that legalizes other 
parties and will allow them to participate in the elections

president bush challenged soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev on monday to agree to deep american and soviet 
troop withdrawals from europe and nato ministers later worked out 
a compromise on missile negotiations that had threatened to divide 
the western alliance 
nato leaders welcomed bushs plan for acrosstheboard 
reductions in conventional forces which would limit the united 
states and the soviet union to 275000 troops each in europe bush 
said he wants the proposal put on the fast track for treaty talks 
in vienna 
the nato ministers worked past midnight to forge their 
compromise on the shortrange missile question 
a senior us official said it provides for ussoviet 
negotiations to reduce but not eliminate the battlefield nuclear 
weapons in both the nato and warsaw alliances the shortrange 
nuclear cutbacks would be linked to the eastwest talks in vienna 
to reduce troops tanks artillery and other conventional weapons 
the official stressed the negotiations on missiles could not 
begin however until an accord was reached to reduce those 
conventional forces and the two alliances had actually started to 
carry out those cutbacks 
and the nuclear cutbacks could not start until the conventional 
cuts were finished said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
this represented a partial victory both for west german and the 
united states whose division over the missile issue threatened the 
unity of the north atlantic treaty organization and the twoday 
40th anniversary summit itself 
the united states won a major concession from bonn in that the 
communique is to call for partial reductions in the shortrange 
missiles but not their total elimination bush said earlier he 
would never agree to eliminate all battlefield nuclear missiles 
from europe 
bush said he hoped nato and the warsaw pact could work out a 
treaty in six months to a year and implement it by 1992 or 1993 
if that blueprint is followed in vienna the missiles with a 
range of up to 310 miles would not be reduced for three or four 
years 
it worked out very well from our point of view the official 
told the associated press 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and foreign ministers 
hansdietrich genscher for their part won us acceptance of the 
proposition that there be negotiations with the soviets to reduce 
the weapons 
the draft which still requires the approval of bush kohl and 
the 14 other allied leaders straddles another contentious issue by 
calling for keeping the missiles up to date but not specifically 
saying when they should be modernized 
the united states and britain wanted to more than triple the 
range of 88 usbuilt lance launchers to just under 300 miles 
while the west germans opposed making the weapons more powerful 
the official said the british the most ardent supporters of a 
missile deterrent to soviet attack still had some reservations 
about the tentative accord but he gave no details 
a british foreign ministry spokesman called it a text close to 
an agreement genscher told reporters early tuesday it has to 
be confirmed by the prime ministers but it includes the 
comprehensive concept and shortrange forces negotiations 
jurgen chrobog a west german spokesman called it an agreement 
with a reservation by the british the british spokesman who 
asked not to be identified refused to comment on that 
the ministers cancelled a formal dinner and met until 1 am 
brussels time 7 pm edt before producing language chrobog said 
the germans were very satisfied with 
earlier bush called his own proposals bold and said he 
wanted to put gorbachevs initiatives to the test 
having dismissed some of the soviet leaders measures as showy 
but insubstantial bush said to moscow were out there now with 
a proposal that the united states puts forward and that has 
widespread alliance support now test it how serious are you do 
you really want to reduce the imbalances that exist in all these 
categories or do we want rhetoric 
bush sent a letter to gorbachev on sunday outlining the proposal 
and he told reporters he would make secretary of state james a 
baker iii available for talks with the soviet leader or foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to be held the sooner the 
better 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said bushs 
conventional weapons plan transformed the summit kohl 
congratulated bush for a farsighted proposal on nonnuclear 
forces 
at the end of the afternoon working session officials from 
various countries said the leaders had adopted the bush initiative 
in principle and would endorse it in their final statement on 
tuesday 
canadian prime minister brian mulroneys proposal accepted by 
the leaders calls for nato experts to consider the bush offer for 
60 to 90 days and work out a detailed negotiating position before 
putting it before the warsaw pact in negotiations in vienna 
there was no formal response from the soviet government but the 
soviet news agency tass issued a brief dispatch saying the new 
proposals were made by washington after the bush administration 
came under serious criticism from the public for the lack of any 
disarmament initiatives at a time when the soviet union has 
launched a peace offensive 
with his proposal bush deflected attention from the differences 
within the alliance 
he said his plan involves a 20 percent cutback in us combat 
troops it would reduce overall us troop strength in europe by 
about 10 percent there are about 150000 us combat troops in 
europe and more than 150000 support forces 
the soviets have an estimated 625000 troops in eastern and 
central europe gorbachev has already offered to cut down to 
350000 and proposed equal ceilings of nato and warsaw pact forces 
of 135 million 
to reach 275000 the soviets would have to cut 350000 or 
about 57 percent 
bush also challenged the soviets to negotiate cutbacks in combat 
aircraft as well as assault and attack helicopters so that the two 
alliances have ceilings 15 percent below natos current level or 
about 5440 for each side this could result in a wrangle over the 
definition of soviet planes some of which moscow describes as 
defensive 
he also urged the soviets to formalize a proposal by gorbachev 
earlier this month for ceilings of 20000 on tanks 28000 on 
armored troop carries and 16500 to 24000 for artillery pieces 
depending on how the weapons are defined 
nato and the warsaw pact opened negotiations in vienna in march 
to reduce tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arsenals across 
the expanse of europe from the atlantic ocean in the west to the 
ural mountains in the soviet union in the east 
gorbachev had set a target date of 1997 bush doing the soviet 
leader one better said the reductions should be implemented by 
1992 or 1993 
by contrast 14 years of viennabased negotiations over 
reductions in central europe alone were abandoned last year with no 
results 
on the economic front bush said the united states is now 
willing to cancel a blanket ban on transfers of high technology to 
the soviet union the sanction was imposed after the red army 
invaded afghanistan in december 1979 the last soviet troops were 
withdrawn in february

the town where james dean first sported 
his trademark scowl still holds sharp memories for the actors old 
friends who want to restore the abandoned high school where he 
made his stage debut 
so fittingly enough theyre trying to raise money for the 
91yearold brick building with a 1950sstyle sock hop and 
cruisein for hot rods 
the schools ceiling is falling and the paint is peeling but in 
the gym saturday night the numbers on the scoreboard were shining 
1949 for the year of deans high school graduation and 1955 for the 
year he died in an automobile accident 
this is kind of a doordie situation said resident ronald 
idlewine who helps run the madisongrant youth basketball 
league which bought the school for 10 in 1986 sure would be a 
loss to see this stage go 
our first priority is to keep the school from falling down 
and to get that roof fixed he said 
idlewine led visitors to the auditorium and to adeline nalls 
speech room where dean learned how to project his voice find 
emotion in a line of script and to act 
ms nall now 82 showed people around the room 
this corner is james deans corner she said this is the 
corner where hed go whenever he came back to fairmount this was 
after he was making movies this corner has a lot of meaning for 
me hed stand there waiting for class to end once he lit up a 
cigarette 
bob pulley who runs the fairmount historical museum down the 
street remembered sharing the playbill with dean in one of ms 
nalls productions 
in 1948 dean was a lead character in our hearts were young 
and gay a comedy about a jaunt by two coeds aboard an ocean 
liner to europe pulley had a bit part as a steward 
a year later dean wouldnt miss an opportunity to stand on his 
schools stage on halloween he dressed up like frankenstein in a 
spoof called goon with the wind he was in the senior play 
you cant take it with you 
and he placed first in the state speech contest with his 
presentation of the madman by charles dickens it was sixth in 
the national contest in longmont colo 
after graduation dean left fairmount and headed for california 
where he made three movies over the next six years rebel without 
a cause giant and east of eden his death in a car 
crash at the age of 24 gave him a lasting almost mythic status as 
a symbol of brooding youth

but courtly manner when the group dwindles to three couples then 
two men and a woman the two men dance together away from the woman 
and she coyly dances to catch up 
in the second movement which britten called playful 
pizzicato tippet is inventive and amusing again he has two men 
and a woman on stage one man kneels the other jumps across him 
putting a foot lightly down on his shoulder 
as the men john gardner and robert wallace show off dance 
steps for each other deirdre carberry exits unnoticed they do 
notice something besides themselves to the amusement of the 
audience when they are suddenly circled by three women

sentimental saraband two men lift a ballerina in various 
elegant postures the other threesome joins hands and dances 
briskly into a variety of triangles and ways for one to peer 
through a window of entwined arms 
all dancers took part in the brittens first movement 
boisterous bourree and again in the brief frolicsome 
finale charles barker conducted rigaudon had its premiere

kendall l truitt the sailor linked by 
reports to the investigation of the uss iowa disaster said monday 
he wants the navy to apologize for leaking information implicating 
him in the fatal blast 
id like to see a formal apology from an identified navy 
spokesman truitt said shortly after a visit to the battleship at 
norfolk naval base to collect his belongings for a transfer to 
mayport fla 
im sure this will hurt me in the future and certainly now 
life will never be the same i guess but ill try to get it back 
as close as possible said truitt who was accompanied by his 
wife carole and his attorney ellis rubin of miami 
rubin said he has asked rep glenn poshard dill to 
investigate the navys handling of its probe as it relates to 
truitt a 21yearold gunners mate 3rd class who is a native of 
illinois 
there has been tremendous publicity impugning this young 
man poshard said in a telephone interview somebody had to 
give the news media this information if this boy is not 
guilty how is he ever going to recover from this thing it doesnt 
seem appropriate to try someone before the facts are in or in the 
press 
accidental causes have not been ruled out but investigators 
have reported finding no evidence of a mechanical or electrical 
problem in the april 19 explosion that ripped the ships no 2 gun 
turret killing 47 men 
in recent weeks news reports based on unnamed sources have said 
investigators were exploring the relationship between truitt and 
gunners mate clayton m hartwig 25 who died in the explosion 
the navy has never officially named either man as being under 
investigation and truitt has repeatedly denied being involved with 
the blast 
the new york times reported monday that investigators now feel 
it is unlikely truitt set off the explosion to kill hartwig who 
had named truitt as beneficiary on a 100000 insurance policy but 
they say it is possible that hartwig caused the blast to commit 
suicide 
rubin said he was angry with the navy for hustling his client on 
and off the ship monday with no opportunity to visit with friends 
or pay his respects to fallen comrades 
on this memorial day kendall truitt and his wife carole came 
to pay homage to his shipmates who were lost rubin said he 
was not able to do that 
mrs truitt also said she also wants an apology from the navy 
it would be nice to see them apologize for what they have done 
to my husband she said even if it might not fix the damage she 
said it would be a start 
a navy spokesman noting the holiday said the navy would not 
comment

national state of siege monday night in an effort to stem a week of 
looting touched off by economic chaos

all constitutional liberties were suspended in the state of 
siege which takes effect immediately but must later be approved by 
congress it was announced by presidential press secretary jose 
ignacio lopez 
both houses of congress will review the action on tuesday

wave of bombings blamed on rightwing extremists said to be out to 
topple the government 
gov victor reviglio of santa fe province declared a state of 
emergency in rosario stores closed early students were sent home 
and classes were suspended nighttime entertainment was canceled

lake gave a reallife lesson in rescue skills when he repeatedly 
plunged into 25 feet of water to save the pilot of a small plane 
that crashed minutes before

people were on bull shoals lake near the missouri border when the 
incident occurred during the memorial day weekend but no other 
injuries were reported

gear other than a borrowed diving mask went down three times 
before pulling mark seemeyer 35 out of the cockpit of the plane 
i teach a specialty rescue class van der voorn said monday 
as he and his wife packed to return home i did exactly what i 
taught i never thought i would use it 
seemeyer of fenton mo was upgraded from critical to stable 
condition monday according to a nursing supervisor at cox south 
hospital in springfield mo 
a passenger in the plane mike kuhn 33 of sunset hills mo 
floated to the top after the crash but seemeyer who was

quickly into the ski boat and was at the crash site within two

when president bush 
sails by the towering lorelei rock wednesday he will see one of 
the most enduring symbols of romantic germany but with an american 
flag snapping atop the craggy peak 
legend has it that when rhine river boatsmen sailed by the rock 
in days of old a shimmering goldenhaired maiden lured them into 
shipwreck and death with her mesmerizing songs 
this is certainly the prettiest part of the rhine says rolf 
daum mayor of the town that includes the lorelei weve had 
several presidents and heads of state sail past over the years 
the sightseeing cruise aboard the tripledecked stolzenfels was 
planned as the final event of bushs twoday trip to west germany 
bush was being accompanied by west german chancellor helmut kohl 
and 300 invited guests 
daum says the riverfront town of st goarhausen will be 
decorated in a sea of flags and local townsfolk will be waving 
people here are very proud of this he said 
ute port 24 a local pharmacists assistant voted this years 
weinhexe received the honor of seeing bush off weinhexe 
literally means wine witch and the young womans duties 
include promoting the local brands at festivals and similar events 
the itinerary called for the presidential party to head north 
from oberwesel where the 1000year auf schoenburg castle looms 
above the river to the ancient city of koblenz 
security boats will be shielding the presidential cruise from 
the barges from belgium the netherlands france switzerland and 
west germany that ply the rhine daily 
the river has spawned many legends including one that 19th 
century german composer richard wagner turned into his cycle of 
operas called the ring of the nibelungs 
the legend of the lorelei the beautiful siren singing from the 
rock high above the river bank was immortalized by german poet 
heinrich heine 
heines poem ends 
i believe the waves swallow up 
the boatsman and his boat in the end 
and thats what with her song 
the lorelei has done 
among the other sites along the route 
the burg katz or cat castle in a sign that change comes to 
the most traditionbound areas the west german government is 
negotiating to sell the castle to a japanese businessman who wants 
to turn it into a luxury hotel other rhine castles have been 
converted into hotels and restaurants 
burg maus or mouse castle another towering fortress that 
according to legend sparked a local noble family to build the burg 
katz out of jealousy 
ruins of the sterrenberg and liebenstein castles built next to 
each other by two brothers locked in a legendary rivalry 
the storybook town of boppard 
im disappointed he couldnt stop here mayor wolfgang gipp 
said but the president cant be everywhere 
the marksburg castle a conglomeration of spires and 
chateaustyle buildings high atop a steep treecovered hill the 
marksburg is the only rhine castle that was never destroyed 
the last major castle is the stolzenfels a sprawling complex 
that also gave the name to the presidential cruise ship 
the cruise ends in koblenz a city that dates to roman times and 
where the mosel river flows into the rhine 
city spokeswoman dorothee steinhoppe said that after his 
arrival bush will visit the enormous pedestal of a nowdestroyed 
monument to kaiser wilhelm i who united germany in 1871 
american artillery destroyed the monument during world war 
ii ms steinhoppe said adding that bushs visit is the first 
by an american president to the city 
local officials planned to give bush a silver tray engraved with 
thanks for the fond memory of his visit to the city

deposit guaranty bank didnt exist 15 months ago 
now it is a 600 millionasset privately owned financial 
institution built mostly from the ruins of failed banks 
deposit guaranty is the sole holding of texop bancshares inc 
which still has a fund of 30 million it may use to buy additional 
banks enough capital to become a 15 billionasset bank without 
additional financing 
given the troubles of the texas financial community with banks 
and thrifts failing almost weekly some resulting in 
multimilliondollar federal bailouts deposit guaranty is swimming 
against the tide 
but chairman ron steinhart and president terry kelley figure 
they have a sound plan to stay afloat 
the mission is to build a profitable healthy texas banking 
organization and to take advantage of the problems which are 
opportunities for somebody kelley said in a recent interview 
there was some management in place in various banks that had 
no capital and some capital was available if you could find 
management he said 
we felt like it was a rare opportunity if we could provide the 
capital and the management at a time when things were as they 
were kelley said 
timing also was important he said because he and steinhart 
believed the state was returning to economic health 
five years ago wed never have tried it steinhart said 
and i dont think three years from now wed try it because the 
opportunity would have passed 
while the building blocks so far have generally been small 
often onebranch institutions deposit guaranty executives still 
toy with the idea of going after some large texas banks that remain 
on the auction block 
steinhart a veteran of buying and selling texas banks admits 
to continuing interest in texas american bancshares inc one of 
the largest remaining problem banks 
since it was formed feb 8 1988 deposit guaranty has purchased 
13 banks 11 of them in federally assisted transactions that leave 
it with what kelley calls sterilized assets 
the money came from a pool of private capital raised by goldman 
sachs amp co 88 million to buy the first bank and then 62 
million more to finance other purchases 
in its first 11 months of operation deposit guaranty earned 
127 million for its investors the largest of which is the 
harvard university endowment with goldman sachs and brothers 
robert and richard strauss as other principals plus steinhart and 
kelley 
deposit guaranty has the advantage of obtaining its banks 
without the encumbrances of past problems and the burdens of texas 
old banking laws which until last year virtually blocked statewide 
banking 
as a result of the old laws many banks even those owned by the 
same holding company were operated separately within each county 
leading to high management and real estate costs 
we can look at whats the most efficient way to operate a bank 
today and not be encumbered by an existing organization that may be 
operated in a more traditional basis which may not be 
costeffective and efficient in the future steinhart said 
but more important is that all 11 of the failed banks have been 
purchased in closed bank transactions meaning deposit guaranty is 
left with few of the obligations of the former bank even when 
deposit guaranty acquires troubled assets it is protected from 
losses by federal regulators 
were buying essentially with problems fully reserved so that 
the large proportion of our people can direct their energies to 
building a bank and building a customer base steinhart said 
steinhart and kelley see a highly competitive future in texas 
banking as problems are solved and the new owners many of which 
are aggressive outofstate banks turn their attention to the 
market 
initially theyre sorting out the good loans the bad loans 
who are the key people to keep and who are the key people to get 
rid of those kind of things kelley said one of these days 
thatll all be history and theyll be focused on the market

nbc and cbs are going shopping for viewers next 
fall at two of the nations biggest retail outlets 
both networks are hooking up with retailers in ambitious 
promotions that will tout the new television season that starts in 
september through a combination of games store displays tv and 
newspaper ads and direct mail 
the alliances between nbc and sears roebuck and co and between 
cbs and k mart corp are the latest efforts by the networks to halt 
the erosion of their audience to cable independent tv outlets and 
video tapes 
network executives hope that the promotions will encourage 
people to tune in to the shows at least once and possibly become 
regular viewers 
advertising agency executives and network affiliates said it is 
about time that the networks tried something new 
the three major networks nbc cbs and abc claimed only 67 
percent of the audience in prime time during the justcompleted 
198889 tv season down from 70 percent in the 198788 season and 
92 percent a decade ago 
joseph ostrow worldwide media director at ad agency foote cone 
amp belding communications in new york said the networks have been 
slow to recognize the the value of using a variety of marketing 
techniques to boost viewership 
in the past the networks touted their shows simply by running 
promotional spots on their own network or placing ads in newspaper 
tv listings 
they havent gone to the full extent that a marketer would go 
in selling a product ostrow said 
allen banks media director at saatchi amp saatchi advertising 
inc said mass marketers like sears and k mart are logical matches 
for tv networks 
a large percentage of the population shops in either or both 
of those stores he said its a nice marriage between a mass 
medium and a mass marketer 
both the nbc and cbs promotions include contests designed to 
make people aware of the new network shows participants can win 
prizes ranging from cars video equipment and vacations to an 
appearance on an nbc program 
sears and k mart will give space in their weekly newspaper 
supplements to their network partners who will use it to list 
contest questions 
those playing the cbs game will have to watch specific shows to 
see if they have won while those participating in nbcs contest 
will be able to find the answers in the advertising supplement 
itself 
contestants may claim their prizes or drop off their entries at 
the stores which will be decked out with signs promoting the 
networks the retailers will have all of their display tv sets 
tuned to the appropriate network 
the networks for their part will tout their retail partners in 
a barrage of television advertising promoting the contest and and 
fall schedule 
george f schweitzer who oversees advertising and promotions at 
cbs said all three networks suffered last year when a script 
writers strike delayed the start of the fall season 
as a result he said some people never saw some of the new 
shows simply because there never was a clear start to the new 
season 
this is a way to create some of the hoopla and excitement as 
there was in years past he said 
alan cohen vice president of network marketing at nbc said the 
promotion has been designed so that nbc affiliate stations will be 
able to tie in to the national promotion with local events of their 
own 
sears stores will have opening night celebrations that will 
feature some of the local nbc station celebrities audio tapes that 
will be run in the stores will have gaps that can be filled with 
the local stations call letters so it sounds like a network star 
has made a recording just for that location 
schweitzer said cbs plans to outline similar programs for its 
affiliates at an upcoming meeting 
ben tucker an executive of retlaw broadcasting co of fresno 
calif and head of the cbs affiliates advisory board said he see 
tremendous potential in the cbsk mart association 
it sells the benefits of our product in different ways than 
they have done in the past he said 
will two or possibly three network promotions dilute the value 
of all of them cluttering the airwaves and possibly even turning 
viewers off 
saatchis banks said he doesnt think so and expects more 
promotional tieins for the major networks and advertisers 
magazines have been in this business of tieins for years and 
the cable networks have as well advertisers are looking for any 
additional spin they can get out of an advertising schedule he 
said

a majority of us manufacturers that responded to 
a recent survey plan to expand operations in europe despite initial 
fears they would face discrimination in the unified european market 
slated for 1992 
an overwhelming majority of chief executive officers surveyed 
welcomed the freer market with 84 percent predicting the 
initiative would provide an opportunity to expand their sales and 
operations in europe 
the bank of bostons economics department conducted the study 
for the scottish development agency surveying about 10000 
manufacturing executives in four us regions new england the 
midatlantic states the great lakes region and the southeast 
of the 1234 companies that responded to the survey 57 percent 
already have operations in europe and 91 percent plan to implement 
new corporate strategies before the end of 1990 in anticipation of 
the unified european market 
the 12 nations of the european economic community also known as 
the common market plan to dismantle trade barriers and form a 
single europeanwide market by 1992 
of the us companies polled with no presence in europe 58 
percent planned to enter the market through new subsidiaries sales 
representative offices or joint ventures with european companies 
robert crawford the north american director of the glasgow 
scotlandbased trade association told manufacturers at a seminar 
last week that they must start acting rather than thinking about 
1992 or you will fall further behind 
your strategies related to 1992 must include serious 
consideration of locating in europe and establishing a base if you 
are to gain market share and remain globally competitive he said 
the report said that more than half of us companies with 
operations in europe have their main base in great britain and 
many companies planning to open operations in europe favored 
beginning in england 
the report said a small number of us companies antcipated 
problems with the new european market such as intensified 
competition from newly merged european companies and possible new 
restrictive laws 
but most of those polled said they would welcome 1992 among the 
things looked forward to included fewer import barriers the 
development of uniform product standards and common regulations 
and less bureaucratic interference in commercial affairs
