syrian gunners on saturday fired shells 
into lebanons christian enclave in defiance of a ceasefire called 
by the arab league but no casualties were reported 
a police spokesman said syrian artillery emplacements fired five 
howitzer shells into different areas of the 310squaremile 
enclave the 130millimeter shells exploded in unpopulated areas 
said the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing rules 
he said gunners of gen michel aouns 20000 christian troops 
did not respond to the syrian fire 
its what we call artillery harassment its a message that 
says there is no settlement yet and there is no total war the 
spokesman said 
the truce was called wednesday by kuwaits foreign minister 
sheik sabah alahmed alsabah who heads an arab league committee 
on lebanon 
despite the relative calm that had prevailed since early friday 
the divided capital seemed a ghost city 
most civilians stayed indoors out of fear of renewed shelling 
duels 
the current fighting erupted march 8 after aoun ordered a 
blockade of militiarun ports which deprive the government of an 
estimated 100 million annually in lost taxes 
druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party 
militia responded by shelling the christian enclave and syrian 
troops later joined jumblatt in the confrontation 
the fighting has left 177 people dead and 591 wounded 
jumblatt told a news conference in damascus the syrian capital 
that there was no possibility of a political dialogue with aoun to 
settle lebanons problems 
what is the use of a dialogue with these people who 
perpetrated the catastrophe there will be no dialogue with aoun 
and his clique jumblatt said 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of siding 
with the moslems in lebanons 14yearold civil war and failing to 
respect their 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league syria 
has 40000 troops in lebanon 
jumblatt repeated syrian denials of involvement in the fighting 
and also accused aoun of seeking to impose his solution with 
massive imports of material and political support from iraq 
iraq and syria ruled by rival wings of the baath socialist 
party have been at odds for a decade syria supported persian iran 
against arab iraq in the eightyear gulf war suspended by a united 
nations ceasefire on aug 20 
the syrian news agency reported that syrian foreign minister 
farouk alsharaa discussed the situation in lebanon with soviet 
foreign ministry representative jinadi trasov who is visiting 
damascus 
syria keeps close relations with the soviet union its major 
arms supplier 
a commentary on damascus radio reiterated the syrian position of 
seeking to create an ambiance that will secure stability and 
tranquillity in lebanon for the lebanese people

he said the officer may have been confused by rodriguez dark 
leather jacket which is part of the police uniform but could have 
made him look like a civilian

take away fidos bowl of gravyladen 
goodies and treat him instead to a dollop of yogurt or some steamed 
broccoli and if tabby is bothered by fleas try using a collar 
soaked in eucalyptus oil or sprinkling garlic on her supper 
this prescription for happy healthy pets is written by dr 
monique maniet an auburnhaired belgianborn veterinarian who 
practices holistic medicine for ailing dogs and cats 
she uses vaccines and antibiotics if necessary but prefers 
natural foods soothing herbs chinese acupuncture chiropractic 
massages and plenty of tender loving care to help her furry 
patients heal themselves 
dr maniet says she gets astonishing results from 
acupuncture especially among dogs plagued by arthritis or itching 
skin the needles however are likely to provoke a yowling 
furflying complaint from feline pets 
if fido is suffering from swollen joints she might inject some 
honeybee venom if hes uptight about missing his usual breakfast 
of red meat she might calm him with a herbal tranquilizer of black 
cohosh and passion flowers 
research has shown that our pets can benefit from the same 
holistic care that we are learning to give to ourselves dr 
maniet says speaking in a soft french accent 
most of us have just begun to examine the way we live 
assessing our food choices sleeping habits exercise routines and 
emotional support she said animals have many of the same 
needs 
dr maniet came to the united states in 1977 with her new 
american husband a fellow veterinary student in brussels with two 
other woman doctors she opened the takoma park animal clinic last 
november in this quiet residential neighborhood just north of 
washington 
although a counter rack contains the rodeo drive fragrance 
collection of spray colognes for dogs available in chanel 
giorgio and opium scents the bulletin boards recommended reading 
list runs more to dr maniets tastes titles include fleas 
getting the jump on them naturally and spring cleaning from 
head to toe herbs and fasting work wonders 
dr maniet is worried that pets like their owners are being 
poisoned by the drugs they take and the food they eat 
she says commercial pet foods sold in supermarkets are loaded 
with harmful preservatives artificial flavors and coloring toxic 
chemicals and processed meat from diseased animals unfit for human 
consumption 
she says pet food is contaminated by traces of urine fecal 
matter hair and bits of beaks and claws and contains hazardous 
amounts of sugar and salt to make it palatable 
our poor animals are fed this diet all the time she said 
taking all that sugar and salt is like eating nothing but fast 
food hamburgers all the time thats why we have hyperactive kids 
and schizophrenic people 
spokesmen for the 53 billionayear pet food industry and the 
american meat institute said animal food products are safe 
nutritious and carefully regulated by the food and drug 
administration

chinas official news agency on sunday expressed 
doubts vietnam will pull all its troops out of cambodia by the end 
of september as promised saying hanoi has a notorious record of 
insincerity 
the xinhua news agency in its commentary said vietnam is trying 
to conceal a large number of troops in cambodia by moving them into 
the ranks of the hanoibacked hun sen faction or turning them into 
armed immigrants 
xinhua said there was nothing new in vietnams statement 
last week that it will leave cambodia by september and it said 
seven partial pullouts announced between 1982 and 1988 were a 
sham 
hanoi has had a notorious record of insincerity in terms of 
the troop withdrawal it said 
previously vietnam had said it would only withdraw all its 
troops by september if a political settlement of the cambodian 
conflict had been reached 
china supports the antivietnamese resistance in cambodia and 
has long demanded that sovietbacked vietnam end its 10year 
military presence in cambodia hanoi has withdrawn about half its 
troops and says 50000 remain western analysts put the number at 
70000 
if it is really implementing its promise of a total troop 
pullout vietnam should withdraw not only all of its troops of 
aggression who wear uniforms and carry weapons but also those 
concealing their identity among the phnom penh puppet troops or as 
immigrants the news agency said 
the commentary said vietnams refusal to accept un monitoring 
shows that hanoi is not willing to receive real and effectual 
international supervision 
in what appeared to be new optimism in peace talks cambodian 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk on sunday extended his 
plans for a meeting next month with cambodias prime minister 
saying it will take at least two days 
both sides initially spoke only of meeting may 2 in jakarta 
indonesia but in a message to his son prince norodom ranariddh 
in bangkok thailand sihanouk said my unofficial talks with mr 
hun sen about cambodia will take at least two days i will return 
to bangkok from jakarta on may 4 or 5 
vietnamese troops entered cambodia in december 1978 and ousted 
the communist khmer rouge 
in an interview later sunday with the british broadcasting 
corp sihanouk said he believed a good settlement could be 
reached by august if his proposal for an international conference 
on cambodia were carried out in early summer

the bodies of eight young women have 
turned up in recent months along wooded highways near this port 
city and david amarals sister is missing 
family members and investigators fear that she and another 
missing woman are the ninth and 10th victims of an apparent serial 
killer 
she had her problems but she wouldnt just walk off amaral 
said of his 25yearold sister sandra botelho im sure shes 
dead and every time they find a body it starts all over again 
the most recent body was found march 31 and identified last week 
as that of mary rose santos 26 
botelho the mother of two young children has been missing 
since august like the eight women whose remains have been found 
within a few miles of each other since the summer she was a drug 
user who spent time in the citys less savory quarters 
the district attorney says evidence indicates the slayings are 
the work of the same person or persons but he has declined to 
reveal details of the investigation 
until recently the investigation seemed at a standstill but an 
anonymous tipster alerted officials to the killers eighth victim 
last week after ms santos body was found the tipster responded 
to a plea to contact police again but officers wouldnt say what 
information he or she provided 
new bedford police heard from a string of families with missing 
wives or daughters from may to september 1988 and the first body 
was found in july but it was not until the first victim was 
identified in december as a new bedford woman that the 
investigation really kicked into gear 
amaral recalled that when his sister disappeared last summer 
police told him she was over 21 and there was nothing they could 
do 
police defended the delay in beginning the investigation in 
earnest 
were a police department for everyone wherever you stand on 
the social level capt carl moniz said but when youre 
talking about drug addicts or prostitutes theres always the 
possibility that theyve just wandered off 
state trooper jose gonsalves said his special investigation 
unit which is attached to the district attorneys office was not 
initially assigned to the case because of the womens backgrounds 
and because there was little concrete evidence to go on 
the topic of missing girls would come up in the back of our 
minds we were very aware that these people were gone he said 
the thought was that maybe something had happened to them but we 
cant commit four people to doing a lot of work when they may have 
just left for california or florida 
since december though investigators have worked overtime 
painstakingly matching the list of missing women with the eight 
bodies and then finding the common denominators in their lives 
the victims many of whom knew each other all were drug users 
some used prostitution to support their habit others had spent 
time in jail on various charges they were part of the transient 
population that drifts in and out of the citys gritty weld square 
section 
they were also mothers sisters daughters grieving relatives 
dont deny the victims were troubled but they also remember how 
mary rose santos liked to turn leftovers into feasts for her 
family how nancy paiva looked forward to hiding her childrens 
gifts at christmastime and how dawn mendes a high school dropout 
was honored in 1987 for volunteer work at her sons school 
but they find that because of the lives the victims led most 
people in this workingclass city of 98000 are following the case 
with interest but not the alarm the relatives feel 
it doesnt mean the crime is less bad said mayor john 
bullard but because these womens lives share a pattern that the 
great majority doesnt fall into people dont feel personally 
threatened 
state troopers and dogs are still searching for bodies tramping 
over pine needles and weaving among white cedars 
at first we put up posters up all around town said arnold 
harrison ms santos father she had three children to bring up 
and we just couldnt believe she wouldnt be coming home the 
wishing is over now

hospitalized in serious condition on sunday his doctor said

danger and we are treating a kidney infection said dr jaime 
gutierrez 
gutierrez said figueres 83 was admitted friday night to san 
juan de dios hospital after suffering severe chest pains and kidney

been my political guide both belong to the governing national 
liberation party which figueres founded in 1953 
in 1948 after elections many considered fraudulent figueres 
led a band of rebels in a brief but bloody revolution that 
overthrew president fernando calderon guardia who had allied 
himself with the communist party 
figueres took over as president of a provisional junta for a 
year banning the communists and overseeing the writing of a new 
constitution that provided increased social services 
he also abolished the armed forces making costa rica the only 
nation in latin america and one of the few in the world without 
a military since then costa rica has been central americas most 
enduring democracy

a judge who said he lightened the sentence 
of a murderer because his two homosexual victims were asking for 
trouble is claiming that demands for his dismissal are 
politically motivated 
the state supreme court and the commission on judicial conduct 
have launched inquiries into the behavior of district judge jack 
hampton who made the comment in an interview with the dallas times 
herald in december that touched off widespread criticism 
in documents filed friday with the supreme court hampton said a 
petition from 17 lawyers demanding his dismissal is politically 
motivated without basis or foundation 
hampton said in the interview that one reason he sentenced the 
man convicted of killing the two men to 30 years instead of life in 
prison was that the victims were queers cruising the streets for 
teenage boys who were asking for trouble 
court records show the defendants testimony was the only 
evidence that the two men were soliciting sex 
gay and civil rights groups have organized demonstrations some 
urging the removal of the judge 
hampton a republican who has been on the bench for almost eight 
years denied that his behavior during or after the trial could be 
construed as biased and said the democrats were out to get him 
the attacks are the reflection of a county and a courthouse 
charged with political activity in which one political party 
undertakes to bash the other political party he said

the sunday telegraph reported that libya is 
planning terrorist attacks on us airlines and other american 
targets to mark the third anniversary of the april 15 bombing of 
libya 
the official libyan news agency jana in a dispatch monitored in 
rome denied the report 
the london weekly attributed its story out of washington to an 
unidentified senior intelligence official who said the libyan 
threats were being taken very seriously as they were based on 
hard evidence not vague suspicions 
it said the official would not discuss details or the source of 
the information 
the telegraph quoted a spokesman of the us federal aviation 
administration as saying it had not issued any special warning to 
us airlines 
the newspaper said us government posts and military bases 
overseas had been warned to take special security precautions this 
month 
in a commentary by its international affairs editor who was not 
named jana said we reaffirm once again that these claims are 
lies and groundless and we renew our bewilderment at this strange 
determination by the mass media in continuing the promotion of 
these lies

the nations secondlargest city votes for a 
mayor on tuesday and despite increased crime pollution and 
traffic tom bradley appears headed toward an unprecedented fifth 
term 
the citys first black mayor a former policeman and son of a 
sharecropper is 71 yet energetic as ever during his 16 years in 
office proud residents says the city has grown into a cultural 
center a worldclass pacific rim metropolis and an ethnically rich 
mecca for opportunityseeking immigrants 
but with the citys explosive growth has come traffic and 
building congestion pollution sewage problems rampant drug 
trafficking and uncontrollable street gangs who committed more than 
250 murders in the city last year 
as los angeles continues to swell beyond its 3 million citizens 
who speak more than 70 languages the main question in tuesdays 
mayoral election is who will lead it into the 1990s and 21st 
century 
bradley says he can and he will 
ive done an excellent job over the last 16 years we have 
many programs that are under way or planned and i want to follow 
through on them he said thursday 
the years ahead bradley continued can be and should be 
and must be the years of air and water made clean of neighborhoods 
made safer of growth and progress that weighs human as well as 
material values 
the mayors opponents disagree they include a city councilman 
former television commentator an aerospace worker and a woman who 
dances around the civic center in a green dress 
despite the opposition though few expect that bradley will 
even need a runoff in order to win another fouryear term a runoff 
would be scheduled for june 6 only if no one gets more than 50 
percent of the vote tuesday 
bradleys main challenger is a freshman city councilman nate 
holden 59 who only recently gained widespread attention by buying 
back uzis and ak47 rifles from citizens and destroying them 
holden says bradley has been in office too long and predicts 
that residents are not going to vote for him out of habit 
anymore 
in the final weeks of campaigning holden and other blacks have 
also accused bradley of ignoring his roots and the impoverished 
south side in favor of courting big business and foreign trade 
the stress on foreign trade also bothers candidate baxter ward 
a former tv news commentator and former county supervisor who says 
bradley spend so much time away from the city he thinks city hall 
is in tokyo japan 
in perhaps the most damaging personal issue bradley is under 
investigation by the city attorneys office for performing 
consulting work with two banks that do business with the city 
bradley has returned the 18000 in fees he was paid and called the 
charges politically motivated 
bradley has been dubbed the teflon mayor with polls 
indicating residents do not blame him for the citys woes 
in a recent los angeles times poll 65 percent surveyed said 
their quality of life worsened during the bradley years to the 
point that half have recently considered moving 
however in another times poll 78 percent of hispanics 70 
percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a favorable 
impression of the democratic mayor 
they are not holding him accountable for it the drugs and the 
gangs are causing it but they dont think tom bradley is causing 
it hes a lucky politician said joe cerrell a political 
consultant who has known bradley since he was a police lieutenant 
in the 1950s 
arnold steinberg a pollster who assessed the race for a liberal 
councilman who decided not to challenge bradley said they 
concluded bradleys popularity was insurmountable 
tom bradley is too likable cerrell agreed hes a nice 
guy it shows he has a rare quality he doesnt scare people 
the other mayoral hopefuls are socialist joel britton an oil 
refinery worker singerdancer eileen anderson teachers raul reyes 
and maria elizabeth munoz consultant khushro ghandhi aerospace 
worker stewart alexander politician leonard earl miropol and 
political scientist gary passi 
the citys 14 million voters also will choose eight of the city 
councils 15 seats a city attorney a controller and school board 
members

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
sunday he cannot imagine holding elections among palestinians 
living on the west bank and gaza strip as long as the palestinian 
uprising continues there 
while shamir renewed his offer to allow palestinians to elect 
representatives who would negotiate selfrule in the territories 
under continued israeli authority he also said it would be at 
least three years before talks could commence on the future of the 
territories taken by israeli in the sixday war of 1967 
and during an interview on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley the 73yearold shamir voiced regret about the killings 
of palestinians saying israel will not consider attempting to 
quash the uprising the intifada although it has the military 
wherewithal to do so 
its very painful for us to kill people he said shamir 
also said that i personally believe its possible to ultimately 
resolve the question of sovereignty over the territories 
shamir who will continue his us tour this week with a series 
of private visits around the country made his television 
appearance just hours after his longtime rival finance minister 
shimon peres said the jewish state is negotiating through us 
auspices with the palestine liberation organization 
speaking on israel radio peres said israel had in effect 
abandoned its longstanding refusal to talk to the plo by letting 
the united states mediate an israeli proposal for holding elections 
in the occupied territories 
shamir seemed taken aback when asked about this sunday 
well i dont know what shimon peres said he said 
and i will refrain from any comments on his words i have to be 
cautious 
but shamir said a short time later that he believes the plo 
still advocates the destruction of israel regardless of chairman 
yasser arafats statements last year renouncing that 
secretary of state james a baker iii asked about the peres 
statements during the abc interview said i dont think i should 
characterize it and judge it if the prime minister of israel is 
unwilling to do so 
its not up to me i dont think to make a judgment about 
whether they feel they are negotiating with the plo baker said 
im quite sure they dont feel that way and they are very adamant 
in their determination not to 
shamir and president bush held talks last week in which they 
agreed that shamirs proposal for elections among the palestinians 
living in the west bank and gaza strip could set in motion a 
process that could eventually bring about peace in the region 
on sunday shamir brushed aside questions about what he thought 
of the us position that israel should trade land for peace 
saying the parties will have to negotiate and come to an 
agreement 
but he said i cannot imagine that elections will be possible 
under the pressure of violence you cannot have at the same time 
violent manifestations and free democratic elections 
baker said he agreed with shamir that its pretty tough to 
conduct fair and democratic elections in an atmosphere of 
violence 
but he said i do not read him to be saying that as a 
requirement for negotiations with palestinians that there 
somehow has to be an end to the intifada in advance i dont think 
that would work 
since december 1987 israel has faced a palestinian uprising in 
those lands that has left more than 420 palestinians and 18 
israelis dead pressure has grown on israel to open talks with the 
plo since arafat recognized israel and renounced terrorism his 
declarations led the united states to reverse a 13year policy of 
refusing to talk to the plo 
shamir said his election proposal envisions a twostage process 
in which palestinians would first elect representatives to set up 
an interim arrangement of selfrule for up to three years 
this will be a transitional period a test period in which we 
will see if we can live together cooperate and then after this 
period we will start of process of negotiations about the 
permanent status of these territories he said

generosity humility giving of yourself says the rev bruce 
ritter the shelters founder 
voluntarism has become more necessary says arlene 
stepputat director of volunteers it was an answer to all the 
cutbacks in social services 
the federal government has encouraged such an answer which is 
why this is national volunteer week the covenant house volunteer 
department is among 18 recipients of a presidents volunteer action 
award which ritter ms stepputat and andrew boone a 
representative of the agencys volunteers are scheduled to receive

what could i do said kristin king who has been a volunteer for 
more than a year i was tired of walking by homeless people on 
the street i decided not to be helpless anymore 
i do it more for myself now than for the kids said kevin 
callahan who works at covenant house every monday night of 
course they benefit too you know that youre needed especially 
after you serve dinner for a couple of hundred kids 
there are volunteers at all covenant house programs including 
those in anchorage alaska fort lauderdale fla houston los 
angeles and new orleans and in canada mexico guatemala 
honduras and panama

the hardest part is saying no to the kids even when you know 
you have to says ann turnbull who began volunteering in 
february no you cant have another juice no you cant take 
three pairs of socks no no no 
youve talked with these kids and youve gotten some idea of 
how terrible their lives are and you want to load them up with 
juice and socks 
the hardest thing is seeing the kids who wont make it said 
chris foote who has volunteered for more than a year 
you just have to keep coming here giving as much as you can 
any job you do here involves love it doesnt matter what you do 
most of the parttime volunteers arrive at night after work

they bring a specialness that money cannot buy she said it

buses to the reviewing stands of the traditional mummers parade to 
avoid damage to their elaborate costumes from rain and snow 
saturday was a different story although the crowds were smaller 
than for the earlier parade 
saxophones banjos drums xylophones violins cellos and 
accordians provided accompaniment to the antics of featherclad 
strutters 
duffy string bands costumes had a patriotic red white and blue 
motif to go with their theme of thee i swing greater bucks 
county string band dressed for a beach party with tropical 
attire and costumes shaped like ocean waves 
but diehard mummers fans said it just wasnt right to have such 
a parade so late in the year

congress appears headed for its first domestic 
policy showdown with president bush this week along with allotting 
considerable time to debate an issue likely to cause some lawmakers 
discomfort at home 
the confrontation with bush is over the minimum wage with 
senate democrats planning passage by midweek of legislation to 
raise the base wage to 455 an hour by late 1991 despite repeated 
vows by the president to veto any measure boosting the hourly 
minimum above 425 
as the senate puts the finishing touches on its minimum wage 
bill the house will spend 10 hours debating a plan that calls for 
closing 86 military facilities and curtailing operations at an 
additional 59 
it also could be the last week of deliberations in the house 
ethics committees review of allegations that speaker jim wright 
broke house rules and one of wrights allies plans to file ethical 
charges against the speakers chief accuser newly elected house 
republican whip newt gingrich of georgia 
as for the minimum wage final congressional passage of the plan 
being pushed by the democratic leadership would all but certainly 
result in a veto from bush who made it clear last week he will 
stand his ground despite concerns by some in the gop that democrats 
could gain a political issue 
i have no intention of budging one inch on this the 
president said friday 
bush has said he would support three 30cent increases in the 
minimum wage which has been 335 an hour since 1981 over the 
next three years provided newly hired workers could be paid the 
existing minimum wage their first six months on the job 
democrats have balked at the presidents training wage 
proposal and say his 425 an hour final target is too low their 
plan would bring the minimum wage to 455 an hour by october 1991 
and allow a subminimum for only two months 
with the showdown appearing inevitable democrats last week 
began painting the issue as one of fairness 
the president wants to give a tax cut of 30000 a year to the 
richest 1 percent of americans but hes against 30 cents an hour 
more for the millions of poor working americans at the bottom end 
of the income scale said senate majority leader george mitchell 
referring to bushs plan for an expansion of capital gains tax 
breaks thats wrong and unfair 
a final senate vote on the minimum wage bill is due tuesday or 
wednesday whether the bill heads immediately to the white house 
depends on whether the final senate language for the new hire 
wage matches the house bill 
the lengthy baseclosing debate in the house will give lawmakers 
from affected communities time to voice their concerns 
but the plan does not allow for any changes congress must 
either allow all of the closings and revisions or block all of 
them because of that the measure is expected to pass the 
commission that drafted the plan said it would save 56 billion 
over 20 years 
the senate must take up the baseclosing plan by may

gov bob martinez called out two 
helicopter crews from the florida national guard on sunday to help 
fight wildfires covering about 30000 acres of rural land in four 
counties 
the fires were burning in mostly unpopulated areas and werent 
expected to force any immediate evacuations said rod westall 
chief of the state bureau of emergency planning 
winds of 5 to 15 mph were hampering efforts to control the 
blazes in both northern florida and dade county while drought 
conditions statewide had disaster officials watching for further 
outbreaks 
thats pretty brisk and thats been causing problems with all 
the fires westall said of the wind 
martinez signed an executive order allowing the guard to provide 
equipment and personnel if needed to the division of forestry 
the worst mistake we could make would be to wait too long and 
let these fires get out of control said martinez the affected 
areas so far are relatively rural but we must act quickly to make 
sure these fires do not threaten large residential areas 
as of noon sunday state forestry officials reported that 20000 
acres had been burned in western dade county near the southern tip 
of the state 6000 acres in lafayette and taylor counties in the 
northern part of the state and about 3000 acres in hendry county 
in the southcentral part of the state 
westall said the dade county fire had not reached everglades 
national park 
initially the guard was planning to mobilize two helicopters to 
fly spotter patrols over the fires to help coordinate ground crews 
more guardsmen may be used later 
at this point were just making sure the division of forestry 
and the florida national guard are getting together to provide the 
resources that the division is needing he said 
in north port in southern sarasota county in the westcentral 
part of the state firefighters on saturday contained a windwept 
blaze that blackened about 2500 acres forced the brief evacuation 
of 80 homes and contributed to an accident on a smoky highway 
the blaze started friday within 500 feet of an elementary school 
and changed direction five times said north port police spokesman 
bob lovett arson was suspected 
lovett said about 80 homes in residential areas near the fire 
were evacuated friday night and residents were free to return early 
saturday 
only minimal damage was done to homes near the fire 
smoke from the blaze caused police to block off a section of 
interstate 75 near the north port exit early saturday morning

authorities arrested a fourth nurse 
sunday in connection with the deaths of 44 hospital patients who 
police say were killed by lethal injections 
police chief guenter boegl told a news conference the first 
three nurses arrested had confessed to killing patients they 
considered seriously ill another investigator said the nurses also 
killed patients they considered a nuisance 
initial reports said the killings in lainz hospital occurred in 
the past year but boegl said sunday the slayings began in 1983 he 
said 30 police investigators were searching death registers and 
other hospital records to check for more victims 
things are assuming terrifying dimensions the police chief 
said on a later television interview 
the nurses women ranging from 25 to 39 years of age were in 
custody but no formal charges had been filed by late sunday three 
of the nurses were apprehended friday and police said a fourth was 
arrested at her apartment sunday 
franz priessnitz a senior police official involved in the 
investigation said a 30yearold nurse was suspected of killing 
about 20 patients 
the suspects say that they killed out of pity boegl said 
however he said 22 people were killed by forced infusions of 
water adding those deeds do not lend credence to this version 
priessnitz said saturday the nurses also killed patients whom 
they considered a nuisance 
police officials involved in the investigation said the patients 
were aged 75 to 80

the government has passed strict new laws aimed at 
quelling ethnic unrest and burgeoning calls for change in the 
soviet system including mandating prison terms and fines for 
anyone who publicly insults a government body 
the tass news agency said the decree was approved saturday at a 
meeting of the presidium of the supreme soviet 
that was a day after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
returned from london to more ethnic unrest this time in the 
southern republic of georgia sixteen people were killed early 
sunday when soldiers dispersed thousands of protesters in the 
citys center 
as president gorbachev is chairman of the presidium the move 
by the collective presidency signaled the kremlins determination 
to crack down on unrest even at the cost of an improved human 
rights image 
tass said the decree prohibits public appeals for undermining 
and overthrowing the soviet state and social system as well as the 
publication or circulation of materials containing such ideas 
such actions can be punished by three years in jail and a fine 
of up to 3200 almost an entire years salary for an average 
soviet worker carried out repeatedly or by an organized group 
the same actions are punishable by a prison term of up to seven 
years 
the decree imposes prison terms of up to three years and fines 
of up to 3200 for public insults or the discrediting of the 
ussr supreme bodies of state power and government as well as 
government and public organizations formed by it 
tass said the decree also prohibits appeals to kindling ethnic 
tensions and racial hostility and appeals to commit treason 
it could not be determined how soviet authorities would use 
their new powers but the language was broad enough that it could 
be used against protesters like those in georgia who were 
demanding independence from the soviet union as well as more 
moderate grassroots political organizations in the baltic republics 
sergei petrov a soviet who long has been refused permission by 
authorities to emigrate to the united states charged that the 
decree crosses out all they promised at the recently completed 
vienna conference on security and cooperation in europe 
petrov said he regarded the new decree as outlined by tass as 
worse than existing laws which require that the defendant 
knowingly was spreading lies 
two soviet laws now prohibit antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda and antisoviet slander and they were used for years to 
imprison dissidents and jewish refuseniks 
article 70 of the criminal code prohibits agitation or 
propaganda carried on for the purpose of subverting or weakening 
soviet authority and circulating slanderous fabrications 
which defame the soviet state and social system 
article 190 is aimed particularly at limiting spoken slander 
against the soviet system 
in october justice minister boris kravtsov told the tass news 
agency that article 190 would be eliminated and article 70 would be 
substantially rewritten under a series of legal reforms

congress was generally critical of the 441 
million education package offered last week by president bush but 
many members and their staffs acknowledged they have few 
alternatives to the presidents initiatives 
instead most argue that scarce funds should be used to 
strengthen successful existing programs which have already been 
authorized and they say theyll use the budget appropriations and 
authorization process to make their point 
we dont have anything that would be an alternative to bushs 
program said one house education and labor committee staffer 
he said the panel might make changes in the school improvement 
act passed last year to incorporate some of the bush proposal but 
they would not be offering anything totally new this session 
we want to see the current law implemented echoed committee 
chairman rep augustus hawkins dcalif 
theres no need fooling around with new programs when youre 
not implementing the current ones he said 
why take money out of successful programs if money is 
limited queried hawkins 
the education excellence act proposed by bush would include 
a 250 million grant program to reward schools that have cut 
drug use or dropout rates raised standard test scores or improved 
in other ways 
100 million on a new magnet schools program 
and 76 million for grants to outstanding teachers 
other parts of the bill would develop new ways to certify 
teachers help urban schools and enlarge the endowments of 
historically black colleges 
some lawmakers praised the presidents efforts to reward 
educational excellence but said current programs that serve a 
greater number of students and teachers should be expanded 
republican rep marge roukema of new jersey said the pell grants 
and student loan programs which help defray college tuition costs 
are highest on her list of priority programs because she said they 
are important to the nations competitive future 
id like to see those existing programs fully funded said 
roukema 
we cant continue to add to these programs and not understand 
the tax and budget consequences she added 
sen claiborne pell from whom the grant program got its name 
emphasized that bush had not clarified whether the new programs 
would be funded with new money or from cuts to existing programs 
this is of equal concern to me said the rhode island 
democrat 
however pell said he was disappointed that bushs package 
does not contain specific proposals to strengthen critically 
important programs already in existence programs such as 
chapter 1 for lowachieving children compensatory education for 
disadvantaged children and pell grants 
these programs form the foundation of the federal commitment 
to provide educational opportunity and access for students in 
need pell said 
many like sen edward kennedy dmass recognize the 
presidents proposal as only a first step but he said bush 
would have to take greater steps than the less than 2 percent 
spending boost he has proposed because thats only half of what 
it would take to keep up with inflation 
however roukema zeroed in on the likely costs for the 
presidents program and any competing ideas since they have to 
be authorized one could debate at the authorization level but the 
real fight i guess will come in appropriations 
at any rate congress is likely to make its case at each point 
along the way said roukema

kentuckians have gone wild over their new 
lottery and horse racing officials are worried that the 
statesponsored games will cut into the money laid down at the 
states venerable racetracks 
from the opening of the lottery tuesday through saturday 
evening 20 million worth of scratchoff tickets were sold and 
the first week of sales should top 25 million said frank o 
keener president of the kentucky lottery corp the private group 
that operates the games 
if they hit 30 million it would set a state percapita sales 
record now held by florida which had 8 worth of sales for each 
citizen when the lottery began there last year he said 
lottery tickets were a hot item in salyersville in economically 
depressed eastern kentucky 
about once a year the carnival comes to town and it takes all 
the loose change out of here said mayor joe howard now the 
lotterys here and itll take out money all year around 
at lexingtons keeneland race course where a 16day meet began 
friday the firstday handle was down almost 1 million from last 
years opening although officials said the downturn could in part 
be due to unseasonably cold weather 
there are just so many leisure dollars out there said 
william greely keeneland president he said the lottery would 
represent one more slice of the pie 
but some racing officials think the lottery however popular at 
the moment has little chance of eroding kentuckys deeprooted 
interest in racing 
the lottery is primarily a game of chance and thoroughbred 
horse racing and harness horse racing involve a skilled decision on 
your part based on many factors said lyle robey chairman of the 
kentucky state racing commission 
the lottery may be fashionable now i dont ever see it taking 
over thoroughbred gambling interests 
experience from other states shows that lottery sales usually 
slow after the first week said larry sipes executive vice 
president of the kentucky lottery corp 
the state had garnered about 71 million in lottery income by 
saturday there were at least 26 5000 winners in the 
dreamstakes game and 380 people had won 1000 the grand 
prize in beginners luck the dreamstakes winners get to enter 
in another drawing tied to next months kentucky derby 
connie phan manager of a lexington convenient food mart said 
food and other sales had dropped by 200 or 300 a day 
this area the money is very limited for them said mrs 
phan whose store is located near a lowincome section of the city 
lots of people are on welfare and food stamps 
a lot of them will come in and pick some of them up in the 
morning theyll come back at lunch and then they come back after 
work said steve finley assistant manager at a louisville 
convenience store 
its been wild it really has said beverly allen assistant 
manager of a gulf service station one man spent three hours at the 
counter scratching off 100 in tickets then went home and came 
back with more money she said

cold weather slowed the rise of the red 
river on sunday giving a reprieve to weary homeowners who have 
fought flooding with pumps dikes and heaps of sandbags 
the river which forms the boundary between minnesota and north 
dakota was expected to crest sunday evening a foot lower than had 
been anticipated 
the river seems to be slowing down and thats good news 
col roger baldwin of the us army corps of engineers said during 
a tour of the floodravaged area with gov rudy perpich the 
governor later said he would ask for federal disaster relief 
the bloated river flooded breckenridge and wahpeton nd 
across the river last week damaging as many as 900 homes and 
forcing the evacuation of scores of people 
lou bennett chief meterologist for the national weather 
service said cold weather saturday night in moorhead and fargo 
nd helped slow the runoff from the winters plentiful snowfall 
temperatures fell into the teens saturday night and stayed well 
below freezing sunday daytime highs usually are in the 40s during 
this time of the year 
the weather service changed its crest prediction to 35 feet for 
the two communities forecasters had been expecting a 36foot 
crest on monday 
bennett said cold weather should cause the water to drain away 
more slowly the river was expected to remain above its 17foot 
flood stage at fargo for at least 10 days he said 
residents of fargo and moorhead had ample time to prepare for 
the flood hundreds of homeowners built sandbag dikes around their 
property to keep out encroaching water

decades ago daughters of civil war 
soldiers were promised they would be looked after for life in the 
stately confederate home for women but the eight women still 
living in the landmark are being moved to make more room for a 
museum officials said 
the women age 84 to 98 surrendered their worldly possessions 
and future inheritance in exchange for the promise of lifetime care 
in the twostory building nestled among the magnolias behind the 
virginia museum of fine arts 
once the women are moved the museum will take the building for 
its own use and the antiques filling the home will be sold 
the museum wants our home said faye oliff a member of the 
homes board of governors who opposed the move they want it so 
bad theyve been like damn vultures waiting for the ladies to die 
so they can get it 
the confederate home for women is located near historic monument 
avenue lined with statues of rebel generals celebrating the days 
when richmond was the capital of the confederacy dozens of 
daughters of confederate soldiers have lived in the home since the 
1930s 
but after more than a year of negotiations among key 
legislators museum officials and the homes board of directors a 
decision has been reached to turn the home over to the museum and 
send the women to a modern place 20 miles out of town the 
virginianpilot and the ledger star of norfolk reported sunday 
the women themselves wont find out about the move until later 
this week officials said they will lose dozens of worn but 
valuable antiques in use in the home some they or previous 
residents brought threre others bequeathed by wealthy southerners 
the antiques will be sold off with board members receiving 
first dibs at prices based on a 9yearold appraisal the newspaper 
reported 
something needs to be done to stop the private sale ms 
oliff said i think it all ought to be sold at public auction to 
ensure the home gets a fair price for it 
ms oliff said she tried unsuccessfully to persuade other board 
members to open the home to paying descendants of confederate 
soldiers the board also denied her proposal that a smaller home 
for the women be opened about eight blocks away 
the antiques included a 1770 chippendale americanmade mahogany 
grandfather clock valued at 5000 according to a recent appraisal 
by re crawford and associates of richmond the clock was 
appraised for about onefifth that much in 1980 said holly c 
dejarnette the homes administrator 
museum officials and legislators denied they had pressured the 
home to close and said board members first suggested it 
they came to us said hunter andrews democratic chairman of 
the state senate finance committee

sutter said 
when he started his route in 1929 sutter motored a modelt ford 
over the 31 miles of country roads during the spring he used a 
horse to deliver the mail because the dirt roads turned to mud and 
were impassable by car 
now he drives a white oldsmobile cutlass more than 80 miles each 
day to about 139 postal patrons including three of his original 
customers 
youre out there where theres no pressure youre out there

gasoline prices rose more than a dime after 
the grounding of the exxon valdez the greatest single price 
increase in the history of the us gasoline market according to a 
national survey 
the average retail price of a gallon of gasoline from march 17 
to april 7 rose to 11063 cents up from the previous 10037 cents 
trilby lundberg publisher of the lundberg survey said sunday but 
she said there were signs prices were easing 
the increase in wholesale prices was a tenth of a penny greater 
than the retail increase it can be said it was the quickest as 
well as the greatest wholesale price hike in the history of the 
us gasoline market lundberg said 
without factoring in inflation this also was the fastest and 
greatest rise for retail she said 
the average price includes all taxes grades of gasoline and 
both selfservice and fullservice pump prices the lundberg survey 
samples prices from 17000 gasoline stations in the united states 
the surge in gas prices followed the brief shutoff of alaskan 
oil shipments after the tanker accident temporarily closed the port 
of valdez it has since reopened and lundberg said prices already 
were beginning to fall by sunday 
some distributors who sell to gasoline stations accused 
independent refineries of taking advantage of the spill which 
briefly cut off 40 percent of californias crude supply the los 
angeles times reported sunday 
when the news got out the refiners were all of a sudden 
saying theyre out of gasoline said bill wright owner of wright 
oil co of santee they raised prices as high as they could to 
stop the demand for their gasoline because every gallon they sold 
that day was a gallon they wouldnt be able to sell the next week 
for a lot more money 
lundberg defended the price rises from refineries 
it was a price response stemming from actual cutbacks in 
crude oil and refined product and a preventive mechanism by which 
the refiners did not want to run out she said 
she said refiners faced a dilemma in the past three weeks 
you have your choice of supplying to whoever comes quick and 
takes all youve got she said or you raise your price and 
make sure all your accounts get some and you dont have panic 
buying among accounts and consumers the refiners at large chose 
that tactic 
while no data have been gathered lundberg said recent informal 
reports indicated that prices are already slipping back both for 
wholesale and on the street 
but lundberg cautioned that gasoline prices had been rising 
before the valdez spill and that natural price rise will 
eventually meet the rates descending from the upward spurt caused 
by the spill 
gasoline price increases not influenced by the valdez spill 
include more demand as the summer vacation season approaches and 
tighter environmental restrictions on refineries which increase 
the cost of making fuel she said 
the survey prices for april 7 came three weeks after the last 
report the lundberg survey normally comes out every two weeks but 
was on a scheduled hiatus that had nothing to do with the oil spill 
the prices for selfservice gasoline stations which now make up 
80 percent of the domestic market were regular unleaded 10096 
cents up from 9009 cents a gallon premium unleaded 11580 
cents up from 10624 cents a gallon regular leaded 10056 cents 
up from 8772 
full service prices included regular unleaded for 12658 cents a 
gallon up from 11872 premium unleaded for 13807 cents up from 
13008 cents and 12422 for regular leaded up from 11513 cents 
the highest overall average retail price recorded this decade by 
the lundberg survey was 13782 cents a gallon in march 1981 while 
the lowest was 8463 cents a gallon recorded in november 1986

the right to an abortion 
im thrilled to have my baby said kristin mcnamara of 
college park md as she wheeled 4weekold kathryn in a stroller 
during the march from the washington monument to the capitol but

have a child 
law enforcement authorities estimated the rally crowd at 
300000 eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist 
majority said it was more than 600000 by comparison some 90000

sunday they were speaking of a newfound political clout 
its a turning point its a totally new ball game smeal 
said its given us the confidence that we are the majority 
the womens rights advocates men and women democrats and 
republicans and a host of celebrities traded taunts with about 
200300 antiabortion protesters who stood along the constitution 
avenue march route police some on horseback kept the opposing 
forces apart 
the antiabortion activists set up a symbolic cemetery of the 
innocents on the washington mall containing 4400 white wooden 
crosses and stars of david that organizers said is the number of 
unborn children killed daily since the supreme court legalized 
abortion 
at the capitol molly yard president of the national 
organization for women vowed to raise a political army to 
ensure that abortion rights are protected if they politicians 
dont get the message we will replace them with prochoice 
were terribly empowered by this yard said it means we 
can go ahead with what weve planned to do on this issue with more 
troops 
rep tom downey dny declared i have a message for the 
man at 1600 pennsylvania avenue and the nine supreme court 
justices read my lips prochoice prochoice prochoice the 
crowd picked up the chant 
president bush in one of his first acts after taking office in 
january told antiabortion activists at a rally outside the white 
house he wanted the supreme courts roe vs wade decision 
overturned 
speakers suggested sunday that bushs wife barbara was 
prochoice mrs bushs press secretary anna perez responded 
her position is that this is one of those issues where she will 
not discuss her views with anyone except perhaps her husband 
many of sundays demonstrators wore white the color of the 
suffragettes who fought for womens right to vote some brought 
their young children they carried signs saying motherhood 
should always be a choice roe roe roe or sink and going 
public for privacy 
wire coat hangers were hung from the clothing of many marchers 
who carried signs saying never again it was a reference to 
the often deadly selfabortion technique used by women in the 
united states before the procedure was legalized 
the majority of americans do not want to see the clock turned 
back said sen alan cranston dcalif 
whoopi goldberg said abortion is a negative experience 
its not something you want to go through but if you need one you 
should have one thats safe i dont want anyone to end up on the 
bathroom floor with a coat hanger 
students came in bus loads from campuses across the country 
though most are too young to remember the days before the supreme 
court legalized abortion in 1973 students said they recognize the 
threat now posed by a major challenge to that ruling 
gradually were believing its a possibility that the right 
to abortion could be taken away said yale junior bryony romer who 
traveled in an entourage of five buses from the new haven conn 
campus 
florence white a 1933 alumna of hunter college in new york 
traveled to washington with students from her alma mater im 
goddamn angry at the administration she said they want to put 
the country back to the stone age 
celebrities said they believed that a massive display of 
commitment to protect abortion rights will have an impact on the 
supreme court when its considers the missouri challenge to roe vs 
wade 
theyre human theyre political animals and i think we can 
make a difference said actress jane fonda who attended the 
rally with her daughter 20yearold vanessa vadim 
missouri gov john ashcroft appearing on cbs face the 
nation defended the abortion law that is before the court 
we hope that any time we can save the life of a child in 
missouri that we would seek to save the life of that child the 
republican governor said 
the missouri statute outlaws abortions and abortion counseling 
in public facilities but still permits abortions in privately run 
facilities it also requires doctors to try to save fetuses aborted 
after a specified age of gestation 
marcher organizers and supporters acknowledged that abortion 
opponents have waged a highly organized campaign to reverse the 
supreme courts 1973 decision but they say sundays rally 
demonstrated prochoice advocates passion and commitment 
today they will be drowned out by our voices and the marching 
of our beat said sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
several delegations of women from other countries joined the 
rally to demonstrate their concern that if abortion is not kept 
legal in the united states other countries will follow that lead 
its quite terrifying for us to read about whats happening in 
the states said jo wainer of melbourne australia it really 
matters to us what you do here i hope the united states doesnt 
plummet to third world status in the treatment of women

police in massachusetts and pennsylvania searched sunday for 
eleven escaped prisoners who remained at large following unrelated 
jailbreaks 
officials in both states blamed the escapes on overcrowding and 
understaffing in outdated jails 
thirteen prisoners slipped away from the 173yearold norfolk 
county house of corrections in dedham mass after sawing through 
a prison window bar friday night two were recaptured shortly after 
the break and five more were arrested in a massive manhunt saturday 
in new castle penn seven prisoners including a convicted 
rapist escaped the lawrence county jail on saturday evening by 
cutting a hole in the metal ceiling of their cell one was captured 
about an hour later and a second turned himself sunday afternoon 
the pennsylvania escape came just days after the new castle news 
ran a lengthy series of articles that described overcrowding at the 
jail built in 1964 to house 43 minor offenders the lawrence 
county jail has been holding nearly three times that number 
recently including several prisoners charged with murder 
it goes back to the same old cliche overpopulated and 
understaffed deputy warden anthony pagley said 
in massachusetts norfolk county sheriff clifford marshall 
offered a similar description of the problems at his jail the 
oldest section of which was built in 1816 
there is no way with 170 people in here we can watch every 
facet of the institution marshall said i would like to think 
that we can but we cant 
actually although the jail is under a federal cap of 172 
inmates it held 246 inmates on friday night marshall said the 
cells have rusted bars that can be cut through easily a contract 
was signed last october to build a new county jail 
residents of dedham an affluent boston suburb responded to the 
escape with both anger and resignation 
how can they let 13 guys escape over a wall said katherine 
leary its kind of amazing 
after cutting through inchthick window bars the inmates 
crossed a roof and scaled a 15foot brick wall topped with razor 
wire to escape authorities said 
of the six men who were being sought sunday two were serving 
prison terms of less than a year one for breaking and entering 
the other for driving to endanger four were in jail pending trial 
three for breaking and entering the fourth for driving to 
endanger they ranged in age from 18 to 37 
marshall said someone outside the prison probably tossed 
hacksaws over the wall they can cut through these old bars in a 
matter of minutes he said and they try it all the time 
in new castle a town of about 34000 people 40 miles northwest 
of pittsburgh the escapees also used a hacksaw blade to cut 
through the metal ceiling of their cell pagley said he said 
officials do not know where the men got the blade 
in addition to the one rapist those at large included three men 
awaiting trial for burglary and one for robbery

accused pakistan of escalating moslem guerrilla attacks in border 
regions and said more than 270 people mostly guerrillas were 
killed over the weekend 
heavy rocket and artillery attacks were launched on the eastern 
towns of khost and ghazni in the past 24 hours while the battle for 
the key eastern city of jalalabad continued the government said 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani told a kabul news 
conference that government troops killed 195 opposition fighters 
and wounded 142 in the jalalabad area he did not give any 
casualties for the government side 
he also said 54 more fighters were killed by government fire 
near sarobi which is midway between jalalabad and kabul on the 
only paved road linking the two cities 
there was no way to confirm the casualty figures 
if pakistan continues this kind of unbridled involvement in 
the military destructive activities of the extremists against 
afghanistan it is bearing the responsibility of the grave 
consequences amani said 
in response to a question amani said afghanistan was not 
threatening to declare war 
in new york un officials speaking anonymously said afghan 
foreign minister abdul wakil was scheduled to meet 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on monday wakil who 
arrived saturday has asked for an emergency meeting of the 
security council 
on friday a longrange sovietmade scudb missile was fired 
from kabul toward jalalabad and landed across the border in 
pakistan the kabul government said it was an accident pakistan 
said no one was hurt but protested the incident 
afghan government forces have been firing scuds almost daily for 
the past month at the afghan guerrillas besieging jalalabad 45 
miles from the pakistan border the pakistanbased guerrillas 
launched their offensive on the city 75 miles east of kabul in 
march after a soviet troop withdrawal was completed in february 
soviet forces intervened in afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the 
marxist government the withdrawal was completed feb 15 under a 
unbrokered agreement 
najib and his sovietbacked marxist government have long accused 
pakistan of participating in the afghan civil war by backing the 
guerrillas who also are supported by the united states saudi 
arabia and china but the accusations against pakistan have 
intensified as the jalalabad battle continues 
pakistan denies the charges 
amani said pakistani forces arab advisers and the guerrillas on 
saturday launched the attack on khost 18 miles from the pakistan 
border and the fighting continued sunday 
he said he had no casualty reports but he claimed the attack 
was led by two pakistani military officers disguised as afghans

the soviet union said sunday that 42 sailors were 
killed when a nuclearpowered submarine caught fire and exploded in 
the norwegian sea and it disclosed that two torpedoes on board 
were armed with nuclear warheads 
the official tass news agency said the design of the warheads 
completely rules out the threat of radiation when the torpedoes 
are under great pressure deep in the water 
to ensure radiation safety the nuclearpowered engine was 
stopped and the power unit was effectively turned off the agency 
said 
it said the submarine carried 69 men and that only 27 of them 
survived 
in washington pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy wood said sunday 
the department had no comment on the tass statement president 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft said us 
officials had no early indication of a radiation problem 
the indications that we have received from the soviet union 
are there is none scowcroft said said on nbctvs meet the 
press 
the vessel went down in international waters 120 miles southwest 
of norways bear island and about 310 miles west of tromsoe on 
norways northern coast it was the third serious accident in the 
soviet nuclear fleet in 2 years 
norwegian scientists were gathering deepwater samples sunday 
and they placed equipment near the sunken ship that would monitor 
radiation levels for years officials reported the vessel released 
no radiation when it caught fire and exploded 
tass in a dispatch from the soviet northern fleet headquarters 
in murmansk an arctic port said 
the crew of the torpedocarrying nuclearpowered submarine was 
made up of 69 men twentyseven of them were saved the crew of the 
submarine displayed courage in the struggle for keeping it afloat 
soviet officials said the survivors were rescued by a soviet 
warship and were bound for murmansk 
the submarine had on board two torpedoes with nuclear 
warheads tass said 
the torpedoes are designed to prevent radiation leaks even when 
deeply submerged the news agency said in addition it said the 
nuclear reactor was shut off and deadened during the accident 
to prevent radioactive contamination of the environment 
tass did not identify the nuclear weapons on the sub which sank 
to a depth of more than 4500 feet 
the vessel one of the soviets most advanced was capable of 
carrying more than a dozen longrange missiles in addition to the 
torpedoes us officials have said 
the sub under the command of capt e vanin was on its way 
home from a long voyage when fire broke out in a compartment the 
military newspaper red star reported sunday 
the crew bravely fought the fire and tried to save the ship 
the newspaper said basing its information on an interview with 
captain p ishchenko of the northern fleet the fight for life 
continued for more than five hours but with no results 
the decision was then made to abandon ship 
the soviets officially informed norway of the accident nearly 
nine hours after the vessel went down the norwegian news agency 
ntb claimed norwegian rescue helicopters could have reached the 
ship several hours before soviet fishing vessels if the soviets had 
promptly asked for help 
soviet officials were criticized for not providing accurate or 
timely information after the 1986 explosion and fire at the 
chernobyl nuclear power plant that incident sent a cloud of 
radiation into the atmosphere that contaminated crops and livestock 
in europe 
in oslo defense ministry spokesman erik senstad told a news 
conference the soviets declined an offer of sea king helicopters 
from a norwegian rescue base 370 miles away but he refused to say 
if more lives could have been saved had they accepted the offer 
fridays sinking came five months after a reported nearmeltdown 
in a nuclear reactor aboard a soviet icebreaker in murmansk 
according to the newspaper vodny transport a reactor operator 
drained vital cooling water from an operating reactor rather than 
one that was shut down for repairs 
had the water drained 30 minutes longer a meltdown releasing 
radiation into the air over the city of 440000 would have 
occurred the newspaper said the situation was liquidated in 
four minutes the newspaper said 
in october 1986 three sailors died in a fire and explosion 
aboard a yankeeclass nuclearpowered submarine in the atlantic 
ocean that was armed with ballistic missiles

thousands of demonstrators linked hands sunday in 
an attempt to form a human chain around a northern japan site where 
the government is constructing a plant to reprocess spent nuclear 
fuel 
the protesters joined hands twice for three minutes but police 
said they did not cover the entire eightmile distance around the 
site near rokkasho village 320 miles northwest of tokyo 
organizers said about 11400 people mostly housewives 
participated police put the number at closer to 7500 
there were no reports of violence or arrests police said 
in addition to reprocessing spent nuclear fuel the plant is to 
serve as an underground storage site for radioactive waste it is 
scheduled to start operation in 1991 
critics contend that unfavorable sea weather and geographic 
conditions at the pacific coast site mean the plant would endanger 
nearby communities 
they also point to its proximity to the us misawa air base 
last month a us air force plane accidentally dropped a dummy 
bomb near a neighboring residential area during a practice exercise 
the nuclear plant will hang over our lives and our 
childrens said hiroko chiba 
japan seeking to reduce its dependence on imported oil plans 
to rely more heavily on nuclear power officials have said that by 
1995 nuclear plants will provide 36 percent of the countrys 
energy up from the current 28 percent

the interior of british 
columbia was jolted early sunday morning by a mild earthquake 
there were no injuries or damage reported 
the quake registered only 35 on the richter scale but shook 
people awake when it struck 
the tremor was strong enough to be noticed but not strong 
enough to be of concern said bob horner of the pacific 
geoscience center this is just one of the normal kinds of events 
we see in this area from time to time 
salmon arm where the quake was centered is about 200 miles 
northeast of vancouver and about 100 miles north of the 
uscanada border 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 can cause slight damage in a local area

the government said sunday that 96 
sinhalese militants surrendered to police and army troops 
apparently in response to president ranasinghe premadasas amnesty 
offer 
eightythree militants gave themselves up in northcentral 
anuradhapur and kurunegala and 13 others surrendered in southern 
moneragala galle and matar the government said in a statement 
many others have made contact with security forces wanting to 
surrender the statement said 
earlier this month premadasa announced the amnesty as part of a 
peace plan under which sinhalese and tamil militants would receive 
parliamentary seats and jobs in return for renouncing violence 
tamil rebels fighting a sixyear war for an independent 
homeland have not responded to the offer the government said 
tamils who are predominantly hindu comprise 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people they allege discrimination by the mainly 
buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population and 
control the government and military 
sinhalese militants stepped up their attacks after the 
government signed an indiasponsored peace accord in june 1987 the 
pact was aimed at ending the tamil struggle for selfrule in 
northern and northeastern provinces

jane roe sat in anonymity sunday just a few 
steps from the hundreds of thousands who had gathered to voice 
their opposition to reversal of the 1973 supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion that bears her name 
occasionally a handful of reporters would cluster around roe 
the pseudonym attached to one of the most famous cases in history 
to get her reaction to the rally that drew 300000 to the nations 
capital 
and at one point former presidential candidate jesse jackson 
greeted the slight woman with a bear hug a squeeze of her cheek 
and the words precious 
but for most of the afternoon roe her real name is norma

friends barely noticed by the hundreds of hollywood stars rally 
volunteers and political activists who filled the stage 
as it was the attention was almost too much for mccorvey 
shes shaking said gloria allred a womens rights attorney 
from los angeles who sat by mccorveys side shes not used to 
all of this 
nevertheless mccorvey mustered enough courage to answer a few 
questions something she may be doing from now on as she travels 
the lecture circuit with a higher profile 
our laws in jeopardy said mccorvey who wore a blue 
sweatshirt with the words roe v wade and a drawing of the supreme 
court 
she plans to return to washington april 26 when the court hears 
arguments in the missouri case that could reverse roe v wade if 
she had a chance she would tell the court that the decision was 
right and you should not change it

soviet dictator josef stalin was a harsh man of 
few words but he occasionally gave in to softer human emotions 
former soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko said in an excerpt 
from his memoirs published sunday 
the first of a series of excerpts from gromykos book 
memories appeared in the observer newspaper 
an example gromyko gives of stalins more human side was in his 
relations with us president franklin d roosevelt when they were 
allies during world war ii gromyko was ambassador to the united 
states 
during the february 1945 yalta meeting between stalin roosevelt 
and british prime minister winston churchill roosevelt became ill 
one day and the talks were suspended the president who was 
crippled by polio at the age of 39 lived only two months after the 
yalta conference 
gromyko said he accompanied stalin on a 20minute visit to 
roosevelt who was in bed in his room overlooking the crimean sea 
and they exchanged remarks about health and the weather and beauty 
of the soviet crimea 
the president was delighted to see us he was clearly 
tired and drained though he tried not to show it gromyko wrote 
we were descending the narrow staircase when stalin suddenly 
stopped took his pipe out of his pocket filled it unhurriedly 
and as if to himself said quietly why did nature have to 
punish him so is he worse than other people 
despite his basic harshness of character stalin did just 
occasionally give way to positive human emotions gromyko said 
describing stalins manner he said i was always aware 
watching stalin speaking of how expressive his face was 
especially his eyes when rebuking or arguing with someone stalin 
had a way of staring him mercilessly in the eyes and not taking his 
gaze off him the object of this relentless stare one has to 
admit felt profoundly uncomfortable 
he spoke quietly evenly almost as if muffled and raised his 
voice rarely even so whenever he spoke there was total silence 
however many people were there gromyko said

the paralyzed son of underworld financial wizard 
meyer lansky sits destitute in a county convalescent home despite 
a deathbed promise by his father that he would be cared for 
im sure my father would be turning over in his grave 
bernard buddy lansky 59 said last week 
in 1982 the year before meyer lansky died forbes magazine 
called him one of the richest men in america estimating his wealth 
at 100 million other estimates put it at 300 million 
whatever lanskys assets his son was not privy to them dads 
dealings were all in cash the only checks he ever wrote were for 
rent 
where did the money go thats what everybody wants to know 
only a few weeks ago buddy lanskys stepmother thelmy 
teddy schwartz lansky 81 told cbstvs 60 minutes that 
stories of her husbands 300 million fortune were preposterous 
and ridiculous 
she visits her stepson once a week at the dade county 
convalescent home where he shares an austere room with an elderly 
man who doesnt talk although lansky hasnt taken a step in seven 
years his black leather shoes are crumpled and torn 
i never asked my stepmother for help lansky said last week 
i felt if she wanted to do something she would offer its not 
like she doesnt know the circumstances 
for years meyer lansky spoke hardly at all about his sons 
cerebral palsy an incurable disease caused by brain damage at 
birth 
buddy knew little of his father the undisputed patriarch of 
organized crime until he was 19 and saw his fathers picture on 
the front page of the new york sun 
the disease crippled buddy lansky gradually over the years 
forcing him to quit a job as a switchboard operator at a motel in 
sunny isles just north of miami beach 
surgeons fused his vertebrae and he wore a metal brace attached 
to his forehead able to move only his eyes for 10 weeks in a 
wheelchair he saw his father for the last time at mount sinai 
medical center in miami beach a week before lansky died of cancer 
at age 80 on jan 15 1983 
he told me i would be taken care of buddy lansky said 
authorities believe that lansky pioneered organized crimes 
system of financial manipulation and concealment 
but if lansky had hidden millions in banks in switzerland a 
will filed in dade county gave no clue it noted only an estate in 
excess of 110000 
in a trust administered in the courtroom of judge francis 
christie lansky left his son 65 percent of the trusts income to 
provide for medical care comfortable maintenance and welfare 
buddy lansky said he never found out how much was in the trust 
or where his money was coming from except for some royalties from 
oil and gas leases in michigan and ohio that went dry 
his mother anne citron died in 1984 in 1985 he found out 
there wasnt enough money to pay his physical therapist who was 
owed 5240 
lansky also discovered that he was three months behind in 
payments to the nursing home in north miami owing nearly 5000 
attorneys who had handled the trust declined comment citing 
client confidentiality 
as buddy lanskys income dropped from 15000 in 1985 to 5300 
in 1988 a few of his fathers old friends stepped in to help 
one was yiddy bloom former owner of the hawaiian isle motel 
according to records bloom paid the nursing home a total of 
47900 over a period of three years 
but late last year the money stopped and on feb 27 buddy 
lansky had to move out he moved to less expensive home which 
accepts dade county patients the county pays 50 a day for his 
care 
his only income is 564 a month from social security which goes 
directly to the nursing home 
you can pick your friends lansky said but you cant pick 
your relatives

texas aampm university researchers have duplicated 
a controversial university of utah experiment that reportedly 
achieved nuclear fusion using a relatively simple process a 
college spokesman said sunday 
officials at the school in college station said they would hold 
a news conference monday to announce that their researchers had 
achieved the same kind of cold fusion one of the most soughtafter 
scientific breakthroughs 
other labs around the country have been trying to duplicate 
this but nobody else has been able to get satisfactory results 
said ed walraven a spokesman for texas aampm our people are 
convinced that theyve got it so as a gesture to the researchers 
in utah we wanted to announce it as soon as possible 
scientists have long sought the secrets of nuclear fusion 
considered a possible replacement for conventional energy sources 
because it would be clean inexpensive and virtually inexhaustable 
researchers in utah announced march 23 that they had achieved 
nuclear fusion at room temperature their claim has been met with 
widespread skepticism among colleagues 
other researchers have complained that they tried to replicate 
the experiment of stanley pons of the university of utah and his 
british colleague martin fleischmann of the university of 
southhampton but without success 
pons has said he wasnt surprised at his colleagues 
difficulties because the experiment is more complicated than press 
reports have made it out to be and only recently have the 
technical details reached the scientific community 
steven jones of brigham young university in utah said recently 
that he had achieved fusion in a similar experiment but obtained 
far less energy than pons and fleischmann said they obtained 
the texas aampm spokesman said he did not have any details on the 
amount of the amount of energy generated in that universitys 
experiment 
fusion the energy source that powers the sun and hydogen bombs 
is achieved by joining atoms usually through the application of 
millions of degrees of heat fission the energy source for nuclear 
power plants comes from splitting atoms fusion generates far less 
waste than fission 
pons and fleischmann said they produced fusion energy in a 
6inch glass jar at room temperature and normal pressure they said 
the experiment generated four times as much energy as it used 
the utah legislature on friday approved 5 million for further 
fusion research but lawmakers said no money would be spent unless 
the experiment is confirmed

arsonists torched one florida womens clinic and 
may have been responsible for a fire at another early sunday on the 
eve of a huge abortionrights march in washington authorities said 
deborah struthers president of the all womans health center in 
ocala and the fort myers womans health center said both places 
were hit at about the same time fort myers is on floridas 
southwest coast ocala lies about 150 miles to the north 
i dont understand the mentality of someone who would do 
something like this these are terrorists were dealing with 
here ms struthers said but it doesnt matter what they do 
we are not going to stop providing these services 
the ocala fire was the second in less than 10 days someone 
tried to burn the clinic down early mar 31 officials said 
sundays blaze looked like the work of the same arsonist 
information was scarce on the fort myers fire which was 
reported about 330 am sgt ed stone of the lee county sheriffs 
department said authorities were still looking into its cause 
sunday afternoon 
about a half hour after firefighters got that call a neighbor 
spotted the flames in ocala and called firefighters according to 
fire department spokesman barry britton they responded quickly 
but the entire clinic already was burning 
at this point you have the four exterior walls standing he 
said the roof is burnt off it and the interior is totally 
gutted 
a police spokesman said investigators have some leads 
there are some possiblities but nothing we can hang our hats 
on said sgt ken hall of the ocala police department 
ms struthers said it was because she had anticipated trouble 
that she stayed home from the washington rally at which hundreds 
of thousands of abortion rights activists marched from the 
washington monument to the capitol 
i just didnt prepare well enough she added it just 
never dawned on us that someone would be that disturbed and 
unstable and aggressive and vicious 
ms struthers said she had no estimate of damage to the fort 
myers clinic but said it would not open monday 
it appears to be pretty well gutted out stone said 
in addition to local authorities agents of the state fire 
marshals office are working on both fires the federal bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms was also called in britton said 
stone said that agency would probably look into the fort myers 
incident as well 
ocala antiabortion activists say theyre not responsible for 
the fires 
people in my group had speculated about the possibility of 
the abortionists doing it themselves said ed martin president 
of marion county right to life 
he said they would have done it to draw attention to their cause 
and damage the antiabortion movement 
the only way that this can be calmed down is for something 
like this to happen where a clinic goes up and it puts a bad light 
on our movement he said 
ms struthers said thats absurd 
in ocala the antichoice people have been very vocal and 
quite aggressive in their actions she said i wouldnt say 
that those are the people responsible i wouldnt like to point 
fingers but we have had some of the most aggressive picketing in 
the state 
she said the violent tactics wouldnt keep her organziation from 
its work 
what these people dont realize is that it reaffirms our 
commitment to this it doesnt make us think this is too much 
trouble and well just go away it makes us stronger

an israeli naval patrol off the coast of 
lebanon opened fire sunday on a rubber dinghy carrying two 
palestinian guerrillas toward israel and destroyed the vessel the 
navy commander announced 
in sidon lebanon a libyansponsored palestinian faction also 
reported the encounter but said there were four guerrillas aboard 
the dinghy including one woman it made no mention of casualties 
maj gen micha ram the navy chief said the israeli boat dvora 
was on routine patrol when the dinghy was seen just north of the 
israeli border town rosh haniqra 
israel television interviewed the commander of the dvora but did 
not identify him by name 
i spotted a rubber dinghy with two people and i was 
certain of two things the commander said in the television 
interview it was headed for the border and the men inside were 
wearing green uniforms 
it was clear they were terrorists he said adding that he 
could not identify them further 
the commander said his boat fired flares and pursued the dinghy 
for a short time before approaching and shooting we opened fire 
and in a matter of seconds the boat sank he said 
ram said the patrol boat did not stay in the area to search for 
survivors so as not to endanger the dvora the military said 
israeli forces suffered no casualties 
the palestine popular struggle front said in a statement issued 
in the southern port city of sidon that the dinghy was intercepted 
off ras elbayyada six miles north of the israeli border 
it said four guerrillas were on their way to our palestinian 
coast in a rubber dinghy 
our guerrillas fired rockets at the israeli enemy boats the 
enemy used all kinds of weapons in the clash and dropped flares 
that lit the whole area the statement said it did not elaborate 
and a second statement said only that one of the guerrillas was a 
woman 
the popular struggle front is based in syria and is opposed to 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafats recent 
conciliatory moves toward israel 
washington has expressed concern over recent infiltration 
attempts by guerrillas from lebanon arafat and his aides have said 
the plos renunciation of terrorism does not mean a halt to 
guerrilla operations against israeli military targets 
also sunday an israeli soldier suffered light wounds when an 
armored personnel carrier hit a land mine in southern lebanon the 
israeli military command said 
the incident occurred in israels selfdeclared security zone in 
lebanon 
israel carved out the zone in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of 
its troops from lebanon ending a threeyear occupation of the 
southern part of the country

50000 will go into a trust for terrythomas the stage name of 
the actor born thomas terry hoar stevens 
the rest of the proceeds will be divided between the

officials could not be reached for comment 
in several recent reports stern said west german companies were 
involved in exporting technology used in the development of a 
condor 2 rocket with the capability of carrying a nuclear warhead 
stern said the rocket has a 620mile range 
according to the magazine mbbtranstechnica pulled out of 
weapons development projects in egypt and argentina following 
pressure from the west german and us governments but it said mbb 
continues to deliver technology to iraq 
last week the firm delivered equipment to iraq that can be used 
to measure missile trajectories stern said it quoted company 
officials as saying all deliveries were legal and received the 
required government export permits 
stern said the federal economics ministry withdrew previously 
approved export permits for gildemeister on grounds that federal 
officials were not told the real nature of the project in iraq 
the magazine said it also had documents that showed gildemeister 
had exported electronic components developed by a us company 
for the iraqi project

a national accreditation group has begun an 
investigation into the suicides of nine patients in 18 months at 
the milwaukee county mental health complex officials say 
the deaths occurred between may 1987 and last october raising 
questions about the level of care at the facility however the 
centers acting administrator jon e gudeman insisted that his 
staff wasnt responsible for the deaths 
after the situation was reported by an advocacy group for the 
mentally ill the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare 
organizations in chicago requested records on the suicides and 
asked what corrective steps had been taken 
the deaths included four patients who hanged themselves one who 
suffocated with a plastic bag one who took an overdose of 
antidepressant one who jumped through a window to his death one 
who killed himself by carbon monoxide poisoning and one who drowned 
in lake michigan 
gudeman said he provided the information but hasnt received a 
reply he told an interviewer last week that hospitalization 
reduces the risk of suicide but doesnt totally eliminate it 
he said a 1980 study of six mental hospitals in new york city 
estimated there were 13 to 25 inpatient suicides for every 1000 
patients even in 1987 and 1988 the milwaukee figures were within 
that range he said 
in my belief they received good and proper care gudeman 
said of the suicide victims 
however thomas e dixon an attorney for the wisconsin 
coalition for advocacy in madison called the number of suicides 
among the patients at the complex an outrage 
something is missing he said it may be the level of 
staffing the training of the staff the supervision of the 
patients something is missing though we dont have any way of 
knowing exactly what it is 
gudeman said he has made policy changes in response to the 
suicides some were prompted by an inspection by the state division 
of health that found five deficiencies in the care of a 20yearold 
man who suffocated himself with a plastic trash can liner 
this man was talking about killing himself and how he was 
going to do it and he was not put on suicidal precautions said 
vicki lauridsen a state investigator and that to us was rather 
negligent 
the staff did not respond in a normal fashion she said 
they did not take this person seriously they goofed 
gudeman said changes at the complex include more oneonone 
observations of patients by a staff member inservice training on 
care of suicidal patients and increased clinical reviews of patient 
charts

british transport secretary paul channon on sunday 
ordered an urgent inquiry into a newspapers claim of security 
lapses on pan am airliners at londons heathrow airport his office 
said 
the secretary has ordered an inquiry he has asked for an 
urgent report from pan am on the matter said a department 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
mondays editions of the sun tabloid carried an account by a 
reporter who said he worked undercover for two weeks in a baggage 
handling job at pan am and noted repeated security breaches 
the reporter george pascoewatson applied for the job using 
the fictitious name george watson two weeks after 270 people died 
in the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
soctland 
he was hired three months later even though he lied about 
previous jobs and gave the names of two friends as sponsors he 
said 
pascoewatson said that on one occasion more than 50 pieces of 
luggage for flight 103 to new york passed through an xray scanner 
but the pan am security guard glanced at the video screen only 
seven times 
he also said he was allowed to wander unsupervised through 
restricted areas at heathrow despite security rules that new staff 
must be escorted 
just hours after starting work on my first day i was left 
unsupervised and unchecked to pack the israeli soccer teams 
luggage on to a qantas 747 bound for melbourne pascoewatson 
said 
pan am denied the charge that the reporter was unsupervised 
peter joel the airlines spokesman in london said we 
believe it is premature for the department of transport to accept 
that a breach of security has occurred based solely on the 
allegations of the sun and before investigations are completed 
a heathrow airport official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said at no time did mr pascoewatson constitute a security risk 
and his temporary pass allowing access under escort was issued in 
the proper manner 
after the lockerbie crash reporters from three british 
newspapers described how they were allowed to wander through the 
airport and board airliners unchallenged 
british and us authorities have been criticized for not 
issuing public warnings after they received anonymous threats 
against pan am airliners before the bombing occurred

soldiers charged thousands of protesters in the 
georgian capital early sunday and at least 16 people were killed 
in a crushing melee of clubs shovels sticks and stones official 
sources and activists said 
they threw themselves on our people like beasts and our 
people couldnt do anything said leda archvadze in a telephone 
interview from tbilisi capital of the southern republic that lies 
on the turkish border 
the official tass news agency said a curfew was in effect sunday 
night residents flew black flags of mourning troops and tanks 
reportedly patrolled the streets and activists called for a 
general strike 
one activist said 50 people died in the clash in lenin square 
tension has been building in georgia since tuesday when 
thousands of hunger strikers and protesters began pressing demands 
for independence from the soviet union georgian nationalists 
contend that under moscows central control russians have 
encroached on their culture language politics and economy 
they also accuse the kremlin of fomenting unrest among georgias 
ethnic abkhazians who are demanding more autonomy 
georgia is the third soviet republic where authorities have 
brought in troops and tanks to quell disturbances in the past year 
similar measures were taken to quell ethnic unrest last year in the 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
in an attempt to prevent future unrest the soviet presidium on 
saturday passed a decree making it illegal to insult or discredit 
the government it also mandated fines and prison terms for those 
who call for the overthrow of the government among other things 
on sunday authorities imposed an 11 pmto6 am curfew and 
banned public gatherings to end the protests said zurab 
zhankarashvili a member of the helsinki watch group in tbilisi he 
said the demonstrators went home when the curfew took effect and 
streets were deserted except for patrolling troops and tanks 
ms archvadze and another activist estimated 10000 people were 
in lenin square when soldiers moved in at 3 am 
she said said her information came from her brotherinlaw 
svyad gammsachurdia also a member of the watch committee who 
witnessed the clash he was arrested at his home several hours 
later she said 
tass said local officials ordered troops to clear the square 
after protest organizers began to declare plans to seize power 
they kindled interethnic strife and called for the 
elimination of soviet power in georgia the creation of a 
provisional government of the republic and its withdrawal from the 
ussr tass said 
the interior ministry said troops and soldiers followed orders 
not to use weapons but some extremists armed with rocks sticks 
and metal objects offered fierce resistance tass said their 
actions caused a crush in the crowd and as a result 16 people 
died 
georgian television reported at least 100 people were injured 
said a duty officer at the city executive committee 
tass said the injured included 75 soldiers and policemen 
zhankarashvili said tanks and busloads of soldiers appeared 
suddenly and attacked the crowd with clubs and small shovels 
youths in the crowd used stones flagpoles and whatever they could 
find to fight back he said 
a handful of georgian policemen on the scene defended the 
protesters against the soviet troops zhankarashvili said he said 
50 people died and 500 were injured 
the popular front of georgia is calling for a general strike on 
monday to protest the killings zhankarashvili said because its 
not possible to organize demonstrations and this is the only form 
of protest we have left 
unofficial sources said many soldiers and tanks were still in 
the streets and there were reports more were arriving in the city 
of 12 million about 1100 miles southeast of moscow 
authorities detained at least five activists their relatives 
said the five were among the leaders of the proindependence 
rallies and were identified as gammsachurdia georgy chanturia 
chairman of the national democratic party of georgia which started 
the hunger strike irina sarishvili a spokeswoman for that group 
and mirab kostava and irakly batryashvili 
the protests were planned to lead up to the 11th anniversary of 
a 1978 protest that succeeded in destroying plans to drop georgian 
as the republics official language 
no violence was reported in tbilisi before friday but some 
violence was reported in outlying areas last week between 
abkhazians and georgians 
many of the nations more than 100 ethnic groups have taken 
advantage of president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness to demand greater autonomy in cultural economic and 
political affairs

israels justice minister on sunday proposed 
action on a civil rights law that is denounced by religious leaders 
who say it does not recognize the special nature of judaism in the 
state 
the proposed basic law on human rights was first introduced 
in 1965 
it calls for equality between men and women and all people 
regardless of religion nationality race or ethnicity it would 
not apply in the occupied west bank or gaza strip captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 war which are ruled through military 
and not civil law 
justice minister dan meridor said he was concerned that civil 
liberties had been put aside in the arabisraeli conflict 
when a nation is struggling people start to think what does 
it matter what an individual says or what peoples rights are 
meridor told israel radio i think the time has come to set 
matters straight 
israel has no constitution and the supreme court cannot declare 
parliamentary legislation illegal civil rights come from a mixture 
of parliamentary laws and supreme court decisions 
but if approved the proposed measure gives the supreme court 
authority to reject laws that violate civil rights meridor said 
jewish religious courts would retain their exclusive authority to 
conduct marriages and divorces 
the bill was accepted by the cabinet and referred to a special 
committee 
at sundays cabinet meeting minister of religious affairs avner 
shaki vowed to oppose the bill 
i told meridor that the state is first a jewish state and then 
a democratic and humanitarian state he said after all judaism 
includes these concepts 
in a debate on television shaki said he will not accept the 
bill unless it states that man was created by god in his image 
and that israel is a jewish state 
we will never agree to this said shulamit aloni leader of 
the liberal citizens rights movement its like calling south 
africa a white state

intel corp strikes back at motorola inc on 
monday by unveiling its 80486 computer chip the latest weapon in 
an epic battle between the coke and pepsi of microprocessor makers 
the announcement scheduled for the comdex trade show in chicago 
comes less than two weeks after motorola gave some early 
information about its own new chip the 68040 
each chip will have 1 million or more electronic devices packed 
onto a fingernail of silicon a density equivalent to twolane 
roads blanketing all of california arizona and nevada 
the race between intel and motorola is producing chips that are 
so advanced there will not be software that exploits their full 
capabilities for years 
its a testament to human ingenuity that we can even make 
these even think of it said g dan hutcheson president of vlsi 
research inc in san jose calif 
the leapfrogging has lifted the two us companies far ahead of 
any other competitors american european or japanese 
each garnered about 475 million last year from sales of 32bit 
chips followed distantly by national semiconductor corp with 50 
million according to integrated circuit engineering corp of 
scottsdale ariz 
all other companies combined sold 100 million worth the 
research firm said 
a 32bit chip handles instructions that contain information in 
chunks of 32 bits a bit is a zero or a one the smallest units of 
information used in a computer 
now there are signs that intel is pulling ahead motorola used 
to have a substantial lead in 32bit chips because it sold most of 
the ones that were used in technical workstations and noncomputer 
equipment such as phone switches apple computer inc also uses 
motorola chips 
intels biggest market meanwhile has been ibmcompatible 
personal computers ever since international business machines corp 
picked intels 8088 for its original pc in 1981 
the new intel 80486 is the natural successor for pcs made by ibm 
as well as compaq computer corp tandy corp and the rest but 
intel not satisfied is staging an assault on motorolas 
workstation market with the 80486 and the recently announced i860 
another 32bit processor 
motorola has by far the most serious competition theyve ever 
had for that technical workstation market from intel and a host 
of smaller companies said michael slater editor and publisher of 
microprocessor report in palo alto calif 
japanese companies make most of the simple microprocessors that 
go into consumer products such as videocassette recorders and 
microwave ovens they also dominate the world market for memory 
chips where manufacturing skill is the critical factor 
american companies though dominate in topoftheline 
microprocessors which have all the computing power of the 
mainframe computers of less than a decade ago thats partly 
because they have customers locked into their designs 
its also partly because americans are still better at complex 
design work microprocessors require it while memory chips dont 
so much 
its like the difference between writing a novel and writing a 
dictionary in a novel everything has to work together and it has 
to flow hutcheson said 
new microprocessors have come along so frequently that software 
writers never even got a chance to develop programs that took 
advantage of the features of intels 80286 which came out in 1982 
instead they jumped straight to writing for the 80386 which came 
out in 1985 
programs that use some 80386 features are just beginning to 
reach the market fortunately the 80486 is similar enough that it 
will be easy to upgrade programs to take advantage of its special 
features 
volume production of the 80486 is expected to begin in early 
1990 and personal computers built around it will be out at the 
same time 
for users the new computers will mean colorful lifelike 
graphics more userfriendliness faster calculations and the 
ability to do several tasks at once such as writing a memo while 
in the background the machine is recalculating a spreadsheet and 
printing out a graph on a laser printer 
the software to do all that is taking time but the momentum 
is absolutely there said michael swavely vice president for 
marketing at compaq 
the immense power of the new chips is turning engineers 
lawyers accountants and others into doityourselfers when it 
comes to processing information that is changing the nature of 
business 
you can say one thing for sure youll never be chained to the 
mis mainframe computer department again waiting for them to 
grace you with the report you need said mel phelps an analyst 
at hambrecht amp quist inc in san francisco

friends and colleagues of michael milken are 
pledging to mount a public campaign against government charges that 
the deposed drexel burnham lambert inc junkbond mogul is a 
criminal 
dozens of supporters many of whom refused to identify 
themselves or even say whether they worked for drexel attended 
milkens arraignment friday in us district court on 98 counts of 
racketeering and securities fraud 
another 90 corporate executives recently paid for a fullpage ad 
in the new york times and the wall street journal supporting 
milken its slogan mike milken we believe in you has been 
emblazoned on baseball caps and tshirts 
were going to turn this around said martin klein a new 
york bankruptcy attorney and friend of milkens who attended the 
hearing at which milken pleaded innocent its manifestly unfair 
itll be a test of the governments tactics 
milken 42 is widely credited with reshaping corporate america 
in the 1980s from his beverly hills calif office through the 
sale of highyield junk bonds that allowed small and mediumsized 
companies to expand rapidly or take over much larger firms 
his work helped catapult drexel from a thirdtier investment 
house into the fifthlargest firm of its kind in the united states 
since he moved the junk bond division to the west coast in the 
mid1970s 
he also is praised by clients and friends as a man concerned 
with third world debt and educational issues who donates to charity 
much of his annual pay which was in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
mike has always performed according to the highest standards 
of professionalism honesty integrity and ethical conduct said 
the promilken ad 
the ad was signed by presidents and chief executives from firms 
including mci corp metromedia co and gaf corp many of those 
same names have been passed on to reporters by a public relations 
firm milken hired to speak for him 
milken has been a target of government prosecutors for more than 
two years and was indicted march 29 for a series of alleged schemes 
that purportedly defrauded clients investors and the public by 
violating securities laws 
supporters and defense lawyers claim milken has been unfairly 
persecuted in the governments crackdown on whitecollar crime in 
an attempt to nail the highest paid and one of the most prominent 
figures on wall street 
i think theres been enough publicity about the government 
being so heavyhanded and the provenance of the leaks being so 
clear that the view is its high time this man had his day in 
court said ralph ingersoll ii chairman of ingersoll 
publications co and a close friend of milkens 
defense lawyers also charged that the government in its 
indictment released milkens earnings more than 1 billion in 
four years to sully public opinion against milken 
its a question on the minds of thousands of people including 
people who will be jurors in this case said milken attorney 
arthur l liman 
the government reportedly has been upset by drexels statements 
of support for milken whom prosecutors allege masterminded the six 
felonies drexel has agreed to plead guilty to in its record 650 
million securities fraud settlement 
after milkens indictment drexel decried government leaks and 
innuendos against him drexel said he was responsible for opening 
new capital markets to hundreds of companies and helping to 
create hundreds of thousands of jobs 
and after fridays arraignment at which milken was released 
without bail pending the setting of a bond drexel distanced itself 
from direct support for milken but didnt oppose cheerleading by 
others 
some individuals have chosen to express their support for mike 
at this very difficult and emotional time for him a statement 
said we understand their desire to express their feelings 
drexel spokesman steven anreder and assistant us attorney 
bruce baird denied reports that the government asked drexel to bar 
employees from staging a courthouse rally for milken supporters 
did gather in beverly hills where drexel was holding its annual 
junk bond conference sans milken 
none of those attending the arraignment or cheering milken as he 
exited the courthouse afterward would say whether they worked for 
drexel 
despite drexels earlier support for milken it is expected by 
prosecutors to state milken caused the crimes cited in its plea 
bargain which has not yet taken effect 
in addition drexel also has agreed to cooperate with the 
government and that might require the firm to provide evidence 
against milken a separate settlement of civil charges against 
drexel reportedly bars drexel employees from ever talking business 
with milken

a new publication designed for college women in 
view is making its debut on campus this month and its creators 
say they intend to avoid the pitfalls that have recently doomed 
several college magazines 
the 20page publication has been dubbed a newspaper by its 
publisher whittle communications lp although it resembles some of 
the magazines often stuffed in the sunday newspaper 
in view is to appear five times during the academic year and is 
being distributed free through school officials at more than 600 
campuses at sites such as sorority houses and womens dorms and 
athletic facilities 
whittle based in knoxville tenn said it expects in view will 
attract about 2 million readers 
maybelline co the cosmetics maker is the sole advertiser in 
the first two issues placing multiple ads financial arrangements 
were not disclosed 
its tough to reach college women with conventional 
advertising said lewis nolan a spokesman for memphis 
tennbased maybelline 
they dont settle into the routine other poeople have of 
watching tv at regular times of the day or reading the morning 
newspaper or keeping up a subscription to a magazine he said 
but will they find time to read in view 
whittle which has built itself into a 150 millionayear 
business by developing media vehicles that appeal to 
narrowlydefined audiences such as mothers waiting in the doctors 
office or animal owners at the veterinarian spent more than a year 
interviewing college women and says the research has given it the 
insight needs to succeed where others have failed 
we found there is a need for information that college women 
dont get from traditional magazines said jim hilmer a whittle 
division manager who oversaw development of in view they wanted 
straight talk on issues that they have trouble dealing with 
in the inaugural issue in views story am i my sisters 
keeper discusses how to decide what to do when a roommate shows 
signs of having a drug problem eating disorder or severe 
depression others stories discussed how allnighters affect your 
health and what opportunities await psychology majors 
editor mara covell said what readers wont get are howto 
stories or tips on quick fixes for their lives or appearances 
we are not talking down to them she said 
the college market has proven a tricky one for some major 
publishers 
newsweek and mcgrawhill co each discontinued magazines aimed 
specifically at college students last year whittle itself dropped 
its flagship campus voice magazine last year and now publishes 
sponored posters under the campus voice name at colleges 
earlier this year the californiabased alan weston 
communications inc discontinued its three college magazines 
college woman moving up and ampersands entertainment guide 
ampersand had been published since 1977 and was being mailed 
directly with the other two magazines one aimed at women and the 
other at men to a total of 12 million students 
larry smuckler president of alan weston said his company gave 
up on those magazines because of the volatility of ad spending 
aimed at college students 
he said some advertisers would spend a lot of money one year 
reaching the college market but abruptly change direction and try 
something else the next 
how can one operate a business on the basis of those kind of 
decisions he said 
smucklers company is now creating publications under contract 
for companies and produces a sponsored movie trailer for theaters 
there have been some new efforts to reach the college market 
american express co for instance recently developed a 
lifestyle magazine that will be sent four times a year to 
cardholders who are college students 
dow jones amp co inc publisher of the wall street journal sent 
a 44page magazine it described as the college edition of its 
national business employment weekly to more than 1000 schools in 
february the sole sponsor was american honda motor co inc 
follett college stores inc gave away a million copies of its 
new publication great opportunities through its 280 college 
bookstores in january 
the 20page publication which is to be published each august 
and january contained 19 pages of promotional offers from 
advertisers and a single page of tips on resumes and job interviews 
jim baumann vice president of advertising at follett in 
elmhurst ill said students are not very interested in getting 
newsoriented publications tailored for them given their choice 
or reading newsweek or the campus newsweek they would choose the 
real thing he said 
but he said they dont mind being singled out for special 
treatment when it comes to offering bargains

greg oswald figures hes got the answer when 
it comes to breaking into the closeknit cable television industry 
take an old technology but apply it in a new way 
his company capital wireless has just begun broadcasting cable 
programs to customers via a local transmitter in the helderberg 
mountains just southwest of albany 
the signals are transmitted through the air the way 
conventional television and radio stations are avoiding the high 
expense and regulatory restrictions of cable installation 
oswald believes his company will be able to make inroads in a 
local market already littered with nine cable tv companies and give 
an industry thats seen little competition a run for its money 
itll be hard to break in here oswald said but if i can 
make it here i can make it anywhere 
capital wireless is one of only about dozen wireless cable 
companies operating in the united states the firm is headquartered 
in malta about 30 miles from its satellite receiver in the 
helderbergs its signal can reach as far as 60 miles away 
the companys receiver or dish takes in signals from more than 
30 other satellites and transmits them to capital wireless 
customers an antenna placed on each customers house collects the 
signal and converters near the antenna and on the television set 
convert the signal so it can be received on the tv 
wireless is the purest form of transmission because its 
through the air said oswald president of capital wireless 
this means customers dont have to worry about service being 
interrupted by downed cable lines but it does mean that mountains 
tall buildings and even heavy foliage can block the signal experts 
say thats a significant defect because it limits the products 
availability 
capital wireless offers 21 channels including local stations 
superstations like wwor in new york city and satellite networks 
such as cnn and mtv along with a premium movie channel and the 
disney channel 
oswald says the company has the potential to double the number 
of channels it offers using a method developed by general electric 
co the method involves splitting each channel into two 
capital wireless charges 1350 a month for its basic service 
premium channels cost an additional 10 a month 
the average cost of basic cable service nationwide is 1460 a 
month and the average subscriber gets at least 35 channels 
according to john wolf director of the national cable television 
association in washington 
about 55 percent of people nationwide subscribe to cable 
television said william finneran chairman of the new york state 
commission on cable tv in new york state that figure climbs to 61 
percent he said 
those are hard numbers to compete with finneran said i 
know of no success stories where wireless has appreciably captured 
even a corner of a market where cable exists but thats not to say 
it cant happen 
oswald is banking on that and he thinks his ace in the hole is 
a strong emphasis on customer service 
youre not too conscientious when youre the only guy in 
town he said referring to local cable operators sometimes 
people get that feeling pretty quickly 
oswald said his company which began offering its service in 
march signed 50 customers and received 3000 inquiries in its 
first week he estimates the firm will have 10000 customers in 18 
months 
oswald believes many of his new customers were cable subscribers 
who jumped ship because of unresponsive cable operators 
cable operators realize this is an area they have neglected 
said officials with the cable tv association of new york 
its part of the growing pain we went through said richard 
alteri the associations president we have been going through 
various stages the stage were at now is one where we are devoting 
our energies toward increased customer service 
whatever the outcome of the battle for cable subscribers 
customers likely will reap the rewards of competition improved 
products and service and competitive prices oswald said
