the fifth tropical storm of the atlantic hurricane 
season lost its strength as it raced towards portugals azores 
island chain and its remnants were absorbed by a large north 
atlantic storm system sunday 
tropical storm ernesto located roughly 400 miles north of the 
azores near latitude 450 north at longitude 280 west could no 
longer be identified late sunday according to a 1030 pm 
advisory from the national hurricane center 
earlier in the evening the storm had top sustained winds of 40 
mph and was racing northeastward toward the azores at about 50 mph 
the civil protection service on the islands monitored the storm 
but chose to not warn residents sunday evening said azores 
regional government spokesman jose manuel baiao 
meteorologist martin nelson of the hurricane center said ernesto 
probably would lose strength when it moved over colder water 
the storm draws its strength from the warm moist tropical 
water he said even a few degrees can affect the storm 
tropical storms have wind of at least 39 mph rotating around a 
warm core of low pressure if sustained wind reaches 74 mph the 
system is upgraded to a hurricane if wind drops below 39 mph it 
is downgraded to a tropical depression 
on saturday storm warnings for the gulf coast from cameron 
la to apalachicola fla were canceled after a tropical 
depression dissipated several hours after forming off the texas 
coast 
the first hurricane of the season debby swirled to life friday 
but was downgraded to a tropical storm hours later after moving 
inland at tuxpan mexico about 165 miles northeast of mexico city 
the atlantic hurricane season runs from june 1 to nov 30

the death of president mohammad zia 
ulhaq could slow the spread of islamic law in pakistan a cause he 
fervently advanced during 11 years as this moslem countrys leader 
zia an army general who died aug 17 in a plane crash had made 
the islamization of pakistani society a pillar of his policy 
but he faced opposition from some politicians members of the 
middle class and others with his death the fate of a further 
expansion of islamic law in pakistan is in doubt 
islamic law is interpreted with different stringency from one 
islamic nation to another zias islamic laws included a ban on the 
consumption of alcohol the provision of flogging and stoning as 
punishment for such crimes as drinking and adultery and a 25 
percent tax on the rich to help the poor 
zia failed however to codify into pakistani law islams 
opposition to collecting interest payments on loans punishment by 
flogging was rare despite its presence in the legal code and 
there were no stonings 
zia was the most enthusiastic of all of pakistans recent rulers 
in applying islamic law said professor mahmood ahmad ghazi a 
leading scholar at the international islamic university in 
islamabad and the man who led prayers at zias funeral 
if someone not as enthusiastic as zia takes over ghazi 
said the pace of islamization will be slow in this 98 percent 
moslem nation 
ghulam ishaq khan the new president of pakistan and his 
caretaker cabinet met a week after zias death and pledged to 
continue islamization but nationwide elections are scheduled for 
nov 16 and that could strongly affect government policy 
opposition leader benazir bhutto who could become prime 
minister if her party wins the elections has spoken out strongly 
against zias brand of islamization saying no one should impose 
personal religious views on the country 
there are some parties that are enthusiastic and there are 
some parties that are lukewarm ghazi said 
in may zia dissolved parliament citing corruption laxity and 
lawmakers failure to promote islamic law over a threeyear period 
as justification for his move 
he then issued a presidential order in june that decreed the 
legal code of islam to be the supreme law of pakistan and expanded 
court powers to review laws for conformity with the koran the 
moslem holy book 
ms bhutto was quoted at time as saying that islam like in 
the past is again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule 
zia said the decree would not affect the rights of nonmoslems 
or the countrys business contracts with other nations 
the order expires later this year unless reaffirmed by the 
government 
defining the relationship between islam and the countrys legal 
system has been a central question since 1947 when pakistan was 
created as a home for moslems on the indian subcontinent 
many islamic principles were enshrined in law before zia came to 
power but he sought to expand these dramatically giving courts 
constitutional power to determine whether laws conformed to the 
koran and the traditions of the prophet mohammed 
laws dealing with the constitution itself judicial procedure 
and fiscal and personal matters were excluded from the review at 
first but some of these exemptions were removed by zias june 
decree 
although special courts now review laws for compliance with 
islamic tradition final appeals still go to civil high courts 
rather than to the legal bodies of religious scholars that exist in 
some other moslem states 
many groups including much of the middle class and many 
lawyers and educated women have opposed islamization believing 
the country should not turn its back on educational and legal 
traditions from the west that have been in place since the british 
colonial era 
zias policy also was coolly received by moslems with different 
interpretations of islamic law for example the jurisprudence of 
the shiite sect which constitutes about 5 percent of the countrys 
107 million people differs significantly from that of the majority 
sunnis

the last survivor of what many historians 
regard as the last massacre of indians in us history thinks 
returning to the site after more than seven decades may finally 
bring the scope of the tragedy home to her 
it would be strange because i feel like i stand off from all 
of it said mary jo estepp who was an 18monthold child when 
taken from her dead mothers back after the ambush in nevada in 
1911 its in the distance you know 
though she is now making plans for the visit with friends she 
lived most of her 78 or so years with only an outline of her past 
many details were finally supplied a few years ago by the author of 
a book about her grandfather an indian named shoshone mike who 
refused to live on a reservation 
the ambush by a white posse left mike and seven other indians 
dead in the snow near winnemucca nev on feb 26 1911 21 years 
after the last major indian massacre at wounded knee sd 
according to researchers shoshone mike refused to settle on the 
fort hall indian reservation in idaho and instead roamed the 
mountains near twin falls with his sons daughters and 
grandchildren 
the indians lived off the land and worked for farmers living in 
peace 
but in 1910 one of mikes sons was killed by a white horse 
thief and the family retaliated by killing the killer not 
trusting white justice shoshone mike took his family and fled into 
nevada 
the 12 indians survived a brutal winter by stealing cattle for 
food when four ranchers discovered the loss the indians killed 
them and took their horses 
posses from nevada and california pursued the indians for 300 
miles until feb 26 when they caught the ragged band sleeping and 
slaughtered four men two women and two boys during a brief battle 
one posse member was killed 
the four surviving children were put in the reno nev jail 
because there was no place else to put them 
in his 1973 book about shoshone mike titled the last free 
man author dayton hyde noted the four surviving children but he 
was unable to find out what happened to them 
a friend of ms estep contacted hyde after reading his book and 
hyde traveled to her home in yakima 
there is still much ms estep doesnt know about the time before 
she was lifted from that bloodsoaked cradleboard after falling 
facedown in the snow the identity of her father is unclear as is 
her age and whether she was born a shoshone or a bannock indian 
still she said they know my mother was one of shoshone 
mikes daughters her name was snake 
the massacre in nevada appears to have been the last of its kind 
in the united states said frank bergon a professor of native 
american cultures at vassar college in poughkeepsie ny whose 
novel shoshone mike was recently published by viking hyde 
agrees 
many massacres of whites and indians occurred in the 19th 
century what makes this significant is it occurred in 1911 when 
there were automobiles airplanes and movies bergon said the 
fact that it did occur in the 20th century makes the whole thing 
surreal 
after the massacre the federal government ordered evan estep 
then the superintendent of the fort hall indian reservation to 
pick up the children 
ms esteps memories begin with the train trip north in november 
1911 
i remember when we went to the dining car i wouldnt eat the 
food she said the exception was raisins in the raisin bread 
which tided her over they may have reminded her of food her family 
ate but she isnt sure 
the other three children died of illnesses within a year the 
toddler survived tuberculosis and was adopted by estep and his 
wife rita who were childless they guessed she was about 18 
months old when she was found 
she moved with the family to reservations in montana and new 
mexico finally settling at toppenish on the yakima indian 
reservation in 1924 
although her adoptive parents told her about the massacre she 
never asked for details and they never talked much about shoshone 
mike she said she was treated as a white person and noted most 
of my friends are nonindians 
the family moved to yakima in 1930 after estep retired ms 
estep still lives in the house purchased by her adoptive parents 
who died in the 1950s 
she graduated from central washington university with a music 
degree and spent 40 years teaching school before retiring in 1974 
she never married 
her only tangible link with her indian past is a single 
blackandwhite photograph of the four surviving children taken in 
front of the reno jail 
it shows the children she had thought were siblings until hyde 
identified them an aunt hattie age about 4 an uncle cleveland 
about 7 and another aunt heney who appears to be about 18 
and of course the haunting photo shows herself wearing a 
white hat and crying

southwest of honolulu and 350 miles southwest of lihue kauai 
moving to the west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 
and gusts to 100 mph meteorologist clarence lee said 
ulekis westward movement lessened the threat of damaging winds 
for oahu where honolulu is located kauai and niihau lee said 
however a high surf advisory remained in effect for all 
southern coasts that were pounded by large waves from the storm 
rescuers assisted 19 people saturday in 5 to 6foot waves off 
waikiki beach and nearby ala moana beach according to lifeguard 
capt jim howe 
a body was discovered sunday off maunalua bay eight miles east 
of honolulu but it was not immediately known if the death was 
related to the storm police said 
uleki was expected to continue moving westward and gradually 
weaken to the point where it could be downgraded from hurricane 
status this afternoon lee said 
when the storm took an unexpected turn toward the islands 
friday winds near the center gusted to 150 mph 
uleki is hawaiian for ulysses the weather service in hawaii 
said the central pacific region has its own list of hawaiian names 
for storms in the region next will be wila followed by aka ekeka 
and hale 
so few storms originate in the region that the list is used over 
and over and does not start the year with a name beginning with 
the letter a as in the atlantic or other regions of the pacific

utility crews finally restored service saturday 
night to parts of a 50block downtown section that had been without 
electricity since the middle of the week 
but seattle city light officials asked customers not to turn on 
their air conditioning immediately out of fear of a surge of 
demand on one of the hottest days of the year the temperature in 
seattle hit 92 degrees a record for the date the national weather 
service said 
about half of the blackedout areas customers got electricity 
back when four cables feeding power to the area were reactivated 
about 645 pm pdt power company spokesman jim aguirre said 
all the customers were expected to be back on line when two 
other feeder cables are repaired and in place sunday or monday 
aguirre said restrictions on power use also were expected to end 
then he said 
an initial attempt to energize the cables was unsuccessful when 
one of them refused to take power and tripped a circuit breaker 
the reason for the problem was not immediately known aguirre said 
earlier in the day the outage had officials worried about fires 
and the effect of the heat on the elderly 
were keeping an eye on the heat situation and were on alert 
to evacuate people from housing for the elderly said hope 
tuttle seattleking county red cross spokeswoman 
the high temperature friday at seattletacoma international 
airport was a september record of 98 one degree below the alltime 
record for that recording station and a similar reading was 
forecast saturday 
since power was lost in a transformer fire wednesday the red 
cross had been serving three meals a day to 150 to 250 elderly 
residents volunteers had to take some meals up 13 flights of 
stairs in buildings where elevators were inoperative 
street lights but almost no traffic signals came on for the 
first time friday night when temporary overhead wiring was hooked 
into the lighting system 
repair crews hoped to begin restoring power late saturday in a 
complex process that would likely extend into monday said city 
light spokesman scott forslund 
thirty buildings with the largest loads in the area and more 
than 90 others with emergency generators would remain off the 
system when power is restored forslund said 
when the switch is thrown city light engineers plan to wait two 
to four hours to assure that the system is stabilized before 
restoring service to the remaining buildings the area typically 
accounts for roughly 3 percent of the citys 1000megawatt load 
if too much equipment is turned on when the switch is thrown 
the sudden added load would cause an abrupt voltage dip or sag 
said hugh mcintosh chief spokesman for city light 
it would be like halftime during a ball game when everyone 
flushes all the toilets and the water pressure drops he said 
a severe sag could trip currentmonitoring equipment and trigger 
another blackout 
roy davis spokesman for the fire department estimated 90 
percent of the affected businesses were closed 
an office of great northwest federal savings and loan remained 
open but with reduced operations customers identifications were 
checked before they were let into the building two at a time to 
withdraw money for the weekend 
this is banking the way it used to be said dianne backus 
division manager were taking down every transaction by hand and 
every couple of hours run to one of our branches and enter 
everything into the computer 
fire alarm systems were checked regularly as were residential 
hotels where officials feared guests might use candles or gas 
camping stoves 
frankly this situation is new to us and were a little 
nervous said davis weve got several cars patrolling just to 
look for fires 
no injuries were reported during the blackout and heavy police 
patrols were credited with preventing breakins 
by friday many hotel guests had wearied of the novelty of being 
issued complimentary flashlights and complained of 15story climbs 
up stairways 
i began to notice a little soreness in my calves yesterday 
said janet hardin of eaton ohio a guest at the 40story westin 
hotels south tower which had one of three elevators in service 
westin officials tried to accommodate most guests in the hotels 
47story north tower which had air conditioning 
it was another matter entirely for viola davis 83 pausing on 
the ninthfloor landing in the security house two floors from 
where she lives 
i stop every floor and rest she panted have to 
or i cant make it takes me half an hour to get up 
its horrible but some of my neighbors havent been out of 
their apartments all week

iraq used song and poetry to mark the 
eighth anniversary of the persian gulf war on sunday a date chosen 
to underscore its claim that iran started the conflict 
the weeklong celebration of saddams qadissiyeh an iraqi 
term for the war marks the anniversary of iranian shelling of 
iraqi territory that iraq claims began the fighting on sept 4 
iran dates the wars beginning 18 days later when iraqi troops 
invaded iran the united nations ceasefire resolution accepted by 
both sides calls for an independent body to determine who began the 
war 
the armed forces newspaper alqadissiyeh said in an editorial 
that the anniversary has become an immortal event in our history 
so that coming generations will not forget the persians 
iranians aggression and evil intentions against arabs and 
islam 
banners strung in the streets by the ruling baath party and 
poems read over state television heaped praise on president saddam 
hussein 
through the great leader and the great people victory and 
peace have been achieved read one banner 
oh saddam thou art the voice of history a poet pronounced 
on television thou art the only hero at a time when there is no 
one else to confront the foe 
thou hast brought back to baghdad and babylon their glory 
official newspapers hammered at the themes of iraqs stand at 
the unsponsored peace talks with iran in geneva and accused 
iran of violating the ceasefire that took effect aug 20 
they also blasted irans insistence on returning to a southern 
border line established by the 1975 algiers agreement the middle 
of the shatt alarab waterway iraq has renounced the pact saying 
it wants all of the waterway 
saad albazaz directorgeneral of the official iraqi news 
agency wrote in the baath party daily althawra that before the 
war iran violated two important elements of the 1975 algiers 
agreement and chose only one to its benefit 
he said iran refused to return land along the central border as 
the treaty demanded and failed to respect the principle of 
noninterference in internal affairs 
iranian support for iraqi kurdish rebels before the war had 
aggravated tensions between the neighboring states 
iraq dates the war to sept 4 1980 when iran shelled iraqi 
towns on the central border after months of escalating propaganda 
claims by both sides 
iraq also accuses iran of attacking ships in the shatt alarab 
before sept 22 when iraq invaded iran 
the term saddams qadissiyeh recalls a 7th century victory 
by arab islamic troops over the persians in iraq that opened the 
way for islams expansion to the east

the trial of leonid brezhnevs soninlaw accused 
of taking 11 million in bribes is expected to lay bare the 
widespread corruption of the brezhnev era 
court begins monday for yuri churbanov a former first deputy 
interior minister who once moved in the top levels of kremlin 
society if found guilty of bribetaking and abuse of office he 
and eight codefendants could be executed by firing squad 
their trial and the extraordinary publicity given its 
investigatory phase are in line with communist party chief mikhail 
s gorbachevs drive to break with the cronyism corruption and 
nepotism now seen as endemic under brezhnev brezhnev ruled the 
soviet union from 1964 until his death in 1982 
the court case to be heard by the military collegium of the 
soviet supreme court may also have a political aim to signal the 
kremlin old guard who flourished under brezhnev that their time has 
passed and that continued resistance to gorbachevera reforms must 
cease 
churbanov who married brezhnevs daughter galina in 1971 after 
divorcing his first wife in 1964 is a central figure in an 
embezzlement and bribery scheme authorities say centered on the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan 
the communist party newspaper pravda said that beginning in the 
1970s cotton harvests in uzbekistan were padded by almost 1 
million tons annually and moscow was made to pay for the 
nonexistent crop by corrupt officials all the way up to longtime 
uzbek party boss sharaf rashidov who died in 1983 
today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more 
than 4 billion rubles 634 billion from the state half of which 
they stuffed into their own pockets pravda said this year in a 
sensational expose on the fraud whose scale is without soviet 
precedent 
churbanov 51 who held the rank of colonel general in the 
moscowbased ministry responsible for police and law enforcement 
nationwide was a powerhungry epicure who helped shield the 
racket soviet press accounts say 
the soninlaw became the first violin at the end of the 
70s pravda said last week having such a friend was not only 
an advantage for rashidov and his group it was vitally 
important 
churbanov who worked as a mechanic before taking a lowlevel 
interior ministry job in 1961 is accused of accepting bribes 
totaling 651888 rubles the equivalent of 11 million 
that sum stupendous by soviet standards is equivalent to 270 
years pay for the average soviet factory worker 
the weekly moscow news cited this encounter between churbanov 
then deputy interior minister and abduvakhid karimov then 
communist party boss in uzbekistans bukhara region 
when an earthquake struck the town of gazli churbanov came 
to inspect relief efforts there arent any cigarettes in the 
stores he berated karimov on the street at his dacha that 
evening karimov gave churbanov 10000 rubles 15800 in exchange 
for the latters promise not to report shortcomings to his 
superiors 
karimov was sentenced to death for bribery by the soviet supreme 
court in june 1987 after an anticorruption drive in uzbekistan 
that led to the replacement of twothirds of all partyappointed 
officials 
officials announced churbanovs arrest in february 1987 he was 
fired from his toplevel interior ministry job in 1984 but 
reportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administration 
for the ministrys uniformed security troops until september 1986 
along with churbanov currently in kgb custody eight former 
uzbekistan officials will go on trial interior minister khaidar 
yakhyaev two of his deputies and five regional police chiefs 
the evidence against the nine men fills 110 volumes and five 
volumes were needed to spell out the indictment a total of 501 
witnesses are mentioned in the indictment 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov told reporters last 
week the trial is expected to last up to two months churbanov may 
be given the death penalty if convicted gerasimov said because he 
is charged with serious economic crimes 
churbanovs attorney andrei makarov of moscow said in an 
interview published last week that his client is being made a 
scapegoat for the ills of the brezhnev era 
makarov told the moscow news the impression is that churbanov 
is being blamed for everything negative that we used to have or 
that brezhnev is being tried under the name of churbanov 
pravda however called churbanov an example of the 
stagnation period when a person reached high position not 
because of his merits but due to his family connections 
it added glasnost and democracy will help to avoid 
churbanovism and anything similar to it

fighting and seasonal flooding are 
blocking western relief efforts in southern sudan where local 
reports indicate 8000 people have starved to death in recent 
weeks authorities say 
southerners arriving from wau 660 miles south of khartoum said 
saturday that thousands of people trekking north toward the 
kordofan region have been marooned by floods for days many died 
they said 
dozens of people have fallen dead on the roads leading to 
meriam camp due to hunger one new arrival told the associated 
press 
meriam is 500 miles south of khartoum the rev aengus finucane 
director of the irish aid agency concern said last month that 
about 40 people were dying there daily 
bakheet hussein another recent arrival said he knew that 
thousands of people trying to flee the town of wau to babanusa 
have perished before reaching there babanusa is 250 miles north 
of wau 
a government official said last week that at least 4000 people 
died in aweil a way station between wau and babanusa that has been 
under siege by rebel forces for almost a year 
reports from the south reaching the council of the south a 
government body said the death toll in aweil alone rose to 8000 
in recent days and that starvation and disease threatened thousands 
in other southern towns 
outside confirmation of the reports was virtually impossible 
even without the chaos caused by augusts floods travel in the 
south by journalists and most outsiders has been restricted for 
years because of the civil war 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation organization took up arms 
against the government in 1983 and claims control over 90 percent 
of the southern countryside and towns 
fierce fighting between the government and rebels has forced 
southerners to leave crops and cattle for the safety of towns 
faced with dwindling food and medical supplies in these towns 
southerners often try to make their way farther north usually on 
foot 
another report reaching the council of the south said the 
situation in aweil is dramatically deteriorating it said 
floods washed away roads and bridges connecting the town with the 
outside blocking whatever relief supplies might get through 
the report said food supplies especially southern sudans 
staple sorghum are low in wau and juba the souths main city 750 
miles south of khartoum 
the report said floods caused by heavy rains and fighting in the 
area was obstructing western relief organizations efforts to bring 
food and medicine to these areas

a quadriplegic who earns thousands of 
dollars in donations on the boardwalk by using her tongue to play a 
portable keyboard again faces charges of breaking the citys 
antibegging laws 
celestine tate faces 12 charges of playing without a permit she 
was issued summonses in 1986 for the same reason but after a 
trial a lawsuit and a lot of publicity the city allowed ms tate 
to play for money on the boardwalk 
the city in backing down assigned her a spot on the boardwalk 
and required a permit but prosecutors said she has not obtained 
the permit and has been playing in front of ballys park place 
casino hotel two blocks away for most of the summer 
ms tate argues that her ballys spot is shaded and that she was 
misled into thinking she would receive a merchants license 
city officials have instead offered her standard oneday 
boardwalk permits which require a 1 million insurance bond she 
said such a bond would cost her 500 a day 
city prosecutor steven smoger said the city made a great 
dispensation in allowing ms tate to play for money on the 
boardwalk no other person handicapped or otherwise has been 
given that opportunity he said 
birth defects left ms tates arms and legs undeveloped she 
supports herself and her children ages 10 and 12 with the money 
she earns on the boardwalk 
she said she averages 2000 a week enough to send her children 
to private school 
police have also issued summonses to her brother and two paid 
attendants 
the crackdown on ms tates business was prompted by several 
citizen complaints smoger said declining to elaborate 
the prosecutor was unsympathetic to ms tates insurance 
problems if thats the price so be it he said she earns 
more than enough to cover that i think she should absorb the cost 
and pay it 
shes a cunning clever businesswoman he said i think 
she is overexaggerating to a great degree 
ms tate has requested a trial and time to obtain a lawyer 
meanwhile she said she will continue to entertain boardwalk 
tourists with renditions of songs such as we shall overcome

george bush and michael dukakis make 
campaignlaunching labor day appearances monday in a race for the 
presidency that has ignored the ceremonial starting point and is 
already a close and caustic contest 
it kicked off earlier than any presidential campaign ive ever 
seen said frank greer a consultant to democratic candidates 
the intensity this early is really astounding 
dukakis the democratic nominee who has seen a huge midsummers 
lead evaporate campaigns through the industrial northeast and 
midwest hungering for the elusive intangibles of momentum and 
initiative that he once commanded 
bush the vice president and republican nominee enters the 
final nine weeks of his race for the white house appearing in 
control of their longdistance debate at least for now and 
enjoying a resurrection in the polls he was campaigning on the 
west coast 
dukakis communications director leslie dach said labor day is 
when the season really starts and represents the point where 
the massachusetts governor steps up his pace from three days of 
campaign travel to five each week 
but the bush campaign was making no effort to cloak its 
candidate in the traditions of labor day bush passed up a chance 
for a visual sendoff before the statue of liberty where ronald 
reagan began his fall campaign in 1980 and a symbolic appearance 
with his running mate 
labor day as an opening day has been overtaken by events 
said bush spokesman mark goodin 
those events include a blistering round of attacks on dukakis 
leveled by bush immediately after the democrats spent four july 
days ridiculing the vice president at their atlanta convention 
and they include the debate over bushs controversial running 
mate dan quayle whose selection at a minimum forced a vacationing 
electorate to notice this presidential race 
both campaigns have revealed their themes too dukakis is 
focusing on the economy and middle class unease about the economic 
future as well as questioning the judgment and fitness of the 
republican ticket 
most americans dont feel theyre sharing in george bushs 
prosperity said dach the dukakis spokesman were going to 
run on the economic issues those are the issues that are going to 
decide this election what bush is trying to do is deflect the 
debate off the issues that people really care about 
bush has concentrated on raising doubts about dukakis and his 
record as governor while suggesting gentle change from the reagan 
administration in such areas as protecting the environment now 
bush plans to focus on jobs and the economy 
still to come are what may be the main events televised 
debates where an error can wreck a candidacy and the wars of 
television advertising which are certain to be hard fought 
bushs tv ads will begin airing soon campaign manager lee 
atwater said media adviser roger ailes is not tipping his hand on 
the content but campaign sources said among them may be one 
featuring maryland victims terrorized by convicted murderer willie 
horton who escaped while on a furlough from the massachusetts 
prison system 
bush has made a major campaign issue of the furlough program 
that allowed passes for firstdegree murderers and which dukakis 
reluctantly agreed to amend in the face of public outcry 
confident of his debating style honed as a public television 
show host dukakis is eager to confront bush the bush campaign 
however has attempted to minimize the debates it has agreed to 
two debates plus a third between the running mates and is 
insisting on scheduling them in late september and early october 
when the olympics and world series may keep some viewers away 
dukakis responded strongly to bush during their summer jousting 
even at one point evoking the imagery of rotting fish heads in 
describing president reagan and his vice president 
but his campaign clearly is frustrated by the appearance that he 
is reacting and on the defensive unable to direct the debate 
there was implicit admission that all is not well in dukakis 
announcement friday of the return of his former campaign manager 
john sasso who resigned in controversy a year earlier 
and dukakis on occasion has seemed tentative and reluctant in 
their longdistance debates some believe 
im not sure the democrats have given back as good as we 
got said greer i think we were lulled by that large lead 
where he once led by doubledigit margins dukakis was shown in 
a dead heat with bush according to most recent polls including an 
abc newswashington post poll last week it had dukakis up by 1 
percentage point 4342 statistically insignificant 
i dont think anyone in the campaign from top to bottom 
anticipated the race tightening up to our advantage this quick 
said bush manager atwater our key is not to get confident not 
to get cocky about it 
some republicans believe bush still trails a bit however i 
would say were still realistically 567 points down said 
republican consultant eddie mahe who is doing work for the bush 
campaign on the west coast 
he bases that on the difference in some polls of respondents 
who say they are deeply committed to a candidate 
the battle is largely for those wavering or swing voters they 
are often described as reagan democrats selfidentified 
independents or democrats who turned away from the party in 1980 
and 1984 
but what is striking is that the race is breathtakingly close 
all across the nation including the big battleground states like 
california ohio michigan and texas even dukakiss home state of 
massachusetts is even or nearly so in a recent poll 
when dukakis was ahead he was ahead everywhere when bush 
took the lead it was everywhere when it evens out now its kind 
of even everywhere said greer its amazing

us aid has helped prevent the takeover of el 
salvador by leftist guerrillas but has failed to solve the 
underlying social problems that sparked the insurgency say four 
us army lieutenant colonels who have served in the central 
american nation and in vietnam 
the american foundation for conducting small wars is 
defective said the report prepared while the four officers were 
on fellowships at the john f kennedy school of government at 
harvard university in cambridge mass 
the unsatisfactory results of the us effort in el salvador 
which the authors described as neither victory nor defeat stem in 
part from local conditions and in part from the failure of the 
reagan administration to clearly define its goals they said 
the united states provided resources not on the basis of some 
overall vision of success but in response to successive and 
increasingly acute crises said the four us officers lt cols 
aj bacevich james d hallums richard h white and thomas f 
young 
administration officials failed to formulate a longterm 
strategy to help cure the social and economic ills of el salvador 
and did not coordinate the efforts of us military and civilian 
advisers said the report 
the report also concluded that the us military despite the 
lessons of vietnam helped mold the salvadoran armed forces into a 
organization better suited for big europeanstyle conflicts than 
third world guerrilla wars 
their findings were contained in a 58page booklet published by 
the institute for foreign policy analysis affiliated with the 
fletcher school on law and diplomacy at tufts university in 
medford mass 
as long as the united states remains a great power american 
involvement in small wars will recur with some frequency they 
wrote to find fault with american military policy in a 
particular instance is not to suggest that the united states is 
incapable of effective assistance to an ally threatened by an 
insurgency the important thing is to get it right they wrote 
offering the following suggestions 
make room for the study of small wars in military schools 
clarify organizational responsibilities for fighting small 
wars in washington and in the field 
before undertaking any intervention establish a vision of 
what you hope to accomplish and a consensus of political support to 
sustain that vision 
send your first team and permit its members the latitude to 
get the job done rather than training all capable officers to 
fight only largescale wars 
avoid introducing inappropriate technology 
the lieutenant colonels questioned other us officers with 
experience in el salvador and found that none of them viewed the 
salvadoran insurgency as primarily a military problem 
none believed that killing guerrillas alone would win the war 
all expressed the belief that only through political social and 
economic reform could the salvadoran government hope to defeat the 
insurgency the report said 
the us effort was also hampered by unreliable baloneyslice 
funding doled out by an unenthusiastic congress the report said 
in addition the salvadoran armed forces have been molded along 
the lines of the us military which is better suited to major 
ground offensives than to smallunit guerrilla fighting 
almost instinctively americans take a rich mans approach to 
war the report said they view us access to technology 
however expensive as offering a significant comparative advantage 
over potential adversaries it said 
us military advisers have imbued salvadoran officers with the 
same outlook the report said take the example of artillery the 
salvadoran army fields 54 105 mm howitzers employing them in one 
or two gun sections used primarily for harassing and interdiction 
american experience in vietnam demonstrated that harassing and 
interdiction fires in an insurgency are at best wasteful and at 
worst counterproductive nonetheless the report said us 
advisers endorsed the request of the salvadoran military to 
replace its current howitzers with a new model that is identical in 
caliber but airtransportable 
similarly the us military backed a salvadoran request for 
more sophisticated fighters and helicopters although scarcely a 
week goes by without an aircraft being destroyed or damaged in an 
incident stemming from questionable maintenance or dubious flying 
skills by salvadorans inadequately trained to handle 
supersophisticated gadgetry 
moreover guerrilla forces in el salvador are no longer capable 
of fighting major engagements in which sophisticated fighters and 
helicopters can help and now operate in smaller units and 
emphasize hitandrun attacks in which such air support is of 
limited use the authors wrote

the release of silty water from the 
bottom of a reservoir to irrigate alfalfa has killed hundreds of 
fish in one of the last selfsustaining trout streams in the west 
authorities said 
the release turned a ninemile stretch of the oncepristine east 
walker river in the eastern sierra nevada into a siltchoked brown 
wash 
some of the trout asphyxiated when silt clogged their gills were 
almost 2 feet long and weighed more than 9 pounds 
the river was declared dead by california trout a 3400member 
sportsmens conservation group that opposed the water release 
the reservoir release has successfully killed all the trout 
in the river said spokesman rick rockel who called the loss 
catastrophic 
the water the lower 12 feet of the bridgeport reservoir was 
released on wednesday and thursday for farmers and ranchers 
downstream near yerington nev 
farmers and ranchers said they needed the water and had a legal 
right to it they said theyre struggling after two straight dry 
winters and that the water might save this years crop of alfalfa 
used as livestock feed 
the east walker 110 miles south of reno nev was one of the 
eastern sierras last trophy trout streams it did not need to be 
stocked having one of the few selfsustaining wild trout 
populations in the west 
all these dead fish it sends a chill up my spine said mike 
markwith a fly fisherman from redwood city well find some 
place else to fish this weekend but it wont be as good 
in august california trout unsuccessfully tried to obtain a 
restraining order against the draining of the reservoir 
we have no problems sharing this water with our neighbors in 
nevada they have a problem too rockel said but we have a 
problem of losing our fishery and it looks like we did all because 
of improper management

for the first time atlantic citys 
casinos are being allowed to use the miss america pageant almost as 
a publicity prop but the contestants still cannot set foot on the 
gaming floors during pageant week 
the contest rulebook describes the contestants as young ladies 
who exemplify the integrity of american youth and it was on that 
basis that the pageant never let the gaming halls get involved in 
any of the publicity 
the casinos were mostly outsiders to the pageant festivities 
not allowed to do much more than provide rooms for the women and 
decorate floats for the parade 
but things have changed 
casino logos now will figure prominently in many photographs 
taken during this years pageant week 
entertainer merv griffin who is in the middle of a deal to buy 
resorts international was host at a reception friday night for the 
contestants and posed with all 51 under a giant resorts logo topped 
with a crown 
on saturday casino owner donald trump invited contestants to be 
photographed aboard his opulent yacht the trump princess in the 
morning contestants posed for a pool shot underneath a large trump 
plaza sign 
the sands and del webbs claridge casino hotels also jumped on 
the bandwagon bringing in miss america 1988 kaye lani rae rafko 
to cut the ribbon to a small museum exhibit at the entrance to the 
two gaming halls people mover a moving sidewalk that carries 
customers in from the boardwalk 
the move to include casinos in the prepageant publicity came 
with the appointment of leonard horn as the pageants new executive 
director he succeeded veteran albert marks who retired earlier 
this year 
casinos are the only major industry in atlantic city and have 
been very good to the miss america program horn said 
but i found out that many of the casinos felt that while 
theyve been good to us weve never given them the opportunity to 
utilize the miss america pageant 
theyre utilizing the pageant now and the atmospheres changing 
friday nights reception for instance was a rare opportunity 
for the 51 women to be seen in an atmosphere of drinking smoking 
and even some suggestive jokes 
send them in this is a buffet tonight griffin said 
rubbing his hands together in mock anticipation as the contestants 
entered 
of course the contestants and their hostesses were not served 
any alcoholic beverages with their meals although waiters poured 
wine for anyone next to them 
and they cant gamble during during pageant week not even if 
theyre 21 old enough legally

former white house national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane finds very legitimate 
parallels between us involvement in vietnam and reagan 
administration policy in central america according to a new book 
in which he is quoted 
the book on bended knee the press and the reagan 
presidency also quotes michael deaver former deputy white house 
chief of staff as saying that alexander haig wanted to clean 
house in central america and made outrageous statements about 
the subject when he was secretary of state 
the book was written by mark hertsgaard an investigative 
journalist who has written two books about the nuclear power 
industry it is being published this month by farrar straus amp 
giroux 
hertsgaard argues in the book that the news media have shown a 
more deferential attitude toward president reagan than toward 
other recent presidents 
this made it easy he says for haig to promote his analysis 
of the situation in central america through the press an 
analysis that held that the soviet union and cuba were fomenting 
revolution in the region 
as controversy developed over the administrations central 
american policies however hertsgaard writes a new theme 
emerged in news coverage was the united states getting involved in 
another vietnam 
reagan repeatedly denied that he intended to send us troops to 
the region and seemed almost to resent the vietnam parallels 
hertsgaard said 
the author reports however that mcfarlane in an interview for 
the book said the issues of cubansoviet involvement and of a 
possible repeat of vietnam contribute to a very reasonable 
framework for press treatment of the issue 
evoking a recollection of vietnam is a very legitimate point 
to make because it simply exposes the reality of difficulty you 
will have in sustaining popular support for your policy 
mcfarlane is quoted as saying thats a valid criticism you may 
not like it but its real 
mcfarlane has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from congressional committees investigating 
covert aid to nicaraguan rebels at a time when military assistance 
to them was prohibited 
hertsgaard reports that both deaver and his boss then white 
house chief of staff james baker were leery of the central 
america initiative from the start 
baker and i tried constantly to keep under control the whole 
central america thing deaver is quoted as saying haig wanted 
to go in there and clean house i cant even tell you what things 
he said things that were outrageous and i remember him saying in 
his inimitable style mr president this is one you can win 
talking about nicaragua 
this was five years ago this is one you can win and you can 
win it quickly deaver is quoted as saying in the november 1986 
interview continuing to recall haigs words 
baker and i constantly cautioned the president about that 
deaver said a you cannot win b the american people will not 
stand still for a war in central america 
hertsgaard said haig declined to be interviewed for the book 
mcfarlane told the writer al wanted a major stress and the 
use of reagans high political standing early in his first term 
the president didnt want to do that he wanted to invest that 
capital in tax reduction 
hertsgaard reports that the three major television networks 
broadcast 186 news stories about el salvador in the first three 
months of 1981 however he says after a white house decision to 
lowkey the issue the number dropped to 60 in the following 
three months although the civil war in the central american country 
continued unabated

the communist government has approved a 
new group that advocates multiparty elections but members say they 
have no intention of starting their own political party 
the hungarian democratic forum established itself as a 
democratic intellectual and political movement by adopting a 
charter on saturday the state news agency mti reported 
hungarian state radio said the forum wants to field candidates 
for national regional and local elections 
but forum members said they dont plan to form a political party 
and only want to promote an open coalitiontype movement open to 
any honest thoughts and initiatives 
the forums 364 delegates met in a tent at lakitelek 75 miles 
south of budapest the same village where a group of nonconformist 
intellectuals met in september 1987 to form a loose organization 
under the same name 
commenting on the forum meeting government spokesman gyoergy 
marosan told hungarian radio on the basis of government policy 
this is a welcome development 
marosan the son of a former leading social democrat in 
precommunist hungary said the government would cooperate with the 
movement as long as the forum cooperates 
he said if people wonder about the foundation of a new 
party they underestimate recent changes in hungary 
prime minister karoly grosz who took over from janos kadar in 
may has pushed for political and economic reforms kadar had led 
hungary since soviet troops put down the hungarian uprising in 1956 
the fact that the meeting was reported in the state media was 
another indication that the forum has received official blessing 
mti said the forum considers a multiparty system indispensable 
in the process of democracy 
the news agency quoted forum leaders as saying the movement 
wants to operate within the framework of constitutionality and 
legality before the general public in all openness 
one of the speakers at the meeting csaba g kis called for a 
coalition of socialists christian democrats and liberals said 
austrian journalist karl pfeifer who attended the meeting 
we do not strive to hold power but we want to control 
power kis was quoted as saying 
sandor csoori a leading member of the forum said he received 
official permission to publish a journal called credit every other 
week beginning in november 
delegates told a news conference that dissidents who have been 
able to write only for underground publications would be given a 
chance to contribute legally to the forums journal

the most negative political advertising 
campaign ever is likely this fall from two presidential candidates 
who are close in the polls close on the issues and far from shy 
about going on the offensive 
students of political advertising say media drives by the george 
bush and michael dukakis campaigns are likely to begin on an upbeat 
note 
but viewers shouldnt expect sunshine and roses on the air 
critical ads ranging from mild comparisons to outright blasts are 
planned by independent groups and the two parties and the 
candidates are expected to follow suit later in the season 
ultimately the race will be the most negative in the history 
of tv predicted kathleen jamieson a university of texas 
professor and author of two books on political communications 
democrat dukakis and republican bush both scheduled traditional 
labor day week media assaults with at least one of them employing 
a soft sell as the campaign season formally begins 
our plan is to be on the air with ads about michael dukakis 
record said dukakis spokesman leslie dach the major thrust of 
the first wave will be cutting taxes balancing budgets putting 
people to work cutting crime and taking charge of our economic 
future those are ads that george bush cant make 
dach would not say how much money will be spent on the first 
wave but he said it will hit a lot of states we intend these 
ads to be seen by people not just to be read about 
the bush campaign is more closemouthed about its plans although 
it has been reported that a threeweek 1 million tv campaign will 
start this week in california 
were firm about not discussing any media buying strategy or 
any creative strategy said sig rogich bushs director of 
advertising operations the democrats will tell you their 
plans and we appreciate it he added 
rogich refused to comment on a report from campaign sources that 
media adviser roger ailes has taped ads attacking dukakis defense 
ideas and interviewing a maryland couple victimized by convicted 
murderer willie horton a massachusetts prisoner furloughed under 
the states program 
dukakis predecessor republican gov francis sargent 
instituted the furlough program which dukakis has supported 
earlier this year the massachusetts governor reluctantly signed 
legislation removing eligibility for firstdegree murderers 
at least one independent group plans a monthlong 540000 
assault on dukakis via national cable networks starting tuesday 
according to the washington post the two 30second ads produced 
for americans for bush charge that dukakis is soft on crime and 
criminals one cites the weekend prisoner furlough program and 
dukakis opposition to the death penalty the other focuses on 
horton 
dach says dukakis plans to counter such attacks with ads touting 
his effective crimecutting record in massachusetts but he said 
plans could change depending on what comes out of the republican 
camp 
some relatively negative ads are coming from the democratic and 
republican national committees which are running multimillion 
dollar generic media campaigns designed to promote party themes and 
accomplishments as superior to the opposition 
the gop just completed a 4 million tv ad campaign that involved 
three spots running for two weeks in every state the ads claim 
americans have known only peace and prosperity under republicans 
so why change 
rnc spokesman beth brainard said plans for the timing and 
content of next wave were up in the air but things are in place 
for another hit if it is needed were going to wait and see the 
tenor of the campaign she said there may be a need to issue 
specific ads of some kind that incorporate our message of peace 
prosperity economic growth and seven years of success 
the dnc financially equipped to run its first major generic 
campaign this year bought 75000 worth of texas airtime for a 
quick counterpunch to the initial gop ads and this week embarks on 
a 1 millionplus generic ad campaign in seven to 12 swing states 
likely to include california illinois ohio pennsylvania 
missouri new jersey iowa wisconsin and texas 
the dnc ads centered on the theme of bringing prosperity 
home are twopronged some deal with competitiveness world debt 
and the deficit making america no 1 again others talk about 
economics on a more personal scale health care child care the 
ability to buy homes and cars 
the point said dach is that if youre a family thats 
working harder to stay in place you cant afford to vote 
republican 
by the time the bushdukakis campaign ends jamieson said 
negative tv advertising should surpass the highwater mark set 
during the bitter 1964 johnsongoldwater battle the most negative 
to date 
observers cite a number of factors in explaining why they expect 
a nasty tv campaign 
attack ads were a major feature of both partys primary 
contests this year providing both precedent and raw material 
bush and to some extent dukakis are already giving very tough 
speeches and advertising traditionally is more negative than 
speeches 
the candidates are neckandneck in the polls giving them both 
an incentive to go negative 
neither candidate is particularly welldefined making it 
imperative that every attack be answered by a counterattack lest 
voters get and keep the wrong idea 
both candidates are relatively centrist with few significant 
differences on issues if you dont have broad issue 
disagreements then you concentrate on the personal said larry 
sabato a university of virginia professor specializing in election 
media polling and direct mail 
jamieson said the 1964 campaign was the most negative in the 
number of negative ads produced and aired but neither candidate 
devoted more than onethird of his air time to negative ads 
she and sabato predicted negative messages will fill onethird 
to onehalf of each candidates air time this year and neither 
will let negative ads eclipse positive ones 
why its just too risky in terms of backlash sabato said 
attacking is not presidential added jamieson you can get by 
with negative ads as long as the positive message is out there

while politicians normally dont want to be 
linked with women other than their wives theres one gal that 
candidates have been fawning over for more than 100 years 
shes 151 feet tall and stands demurely in new york harbor 
candidates and their image makers say theres no better company 
to be seen in especially on coasttocoast television than that 
of the statue of liberty 
so coveted is she as political company that the campaigns of 
michael dukakis the democratic presidential nominee and 
republican vice presidential contender sen dan quayle clashed over 
which of them would hold the ladys hand this labor day 
quayle prevailed but only because he asked first according to 
the national park service as the statues custodian the park 
service takes great pains to assure the statue does not show 
favorites

a chlorine gas leak from a swimming pool 
supply company forced up to 1000 people from their homes for the 
second day in a row early sunday authorities said 
no injuries were reported most of the evacuations were in 
montebello eight miles east of downtown los angeles and residents 
were allowed back about 8 am 2 hours later 
the leak occurred during cleanup at the grow group inc 
warehouse where a mishap on saturday spewed a lowlying 
halfmilelong chlorine cloud sent 37 people to hospitals and 
forced the evacuation of up to 15000 
i understand that the cloud was not as visible and seemed to 
be much smaller said los angeles county fire capt richard 
sweeney there was a definite smell of chlorine 
chlorine can be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise 
causes mostly burning eyes and sore throats 
the leak saturday occurred when a powdered chemical used to make 
chlorine tablets for pools contacted moisture or another 
contaminant producing a reaction authorities said 
theres a company cleaning up from the incident yesterday and 
they just happened to dump a little more on the ground sweeney 
said it wasnt any big deal it was less than 100 pounds 
as before soda ash was used to neutralize the material but 
more small spills were possible as the cleanup continued sweeney 
said a guy turns a shovel the wrong way and it might react 
again he said 
the evacuation was ordered by county health officials monitoring 
the cleanup fewer than 1000 residents were involved said deputy 
chief steve simonian of the montebello police department 
the earlier evacuation covered several square miles of east los 
angeles monterey park montebello and commerce authorities said 
a similar reaction occurred in several drums of the same 
material on aug 17 but no gas cloud was released and no injuries 
were reported said les wilde president of grow groups consumer 
and professional products group 
the prime suspect is moisture some moisture from 
condensation from the high humidity weve been having wilde said

group the lack of organization was frightening said angie 
rojas this morning there were many people walking the street 
with their children looking for a safe site

west bank jewish settlers demonstrated sunday 
to demand government permission to shoot at palestinian 
stonethrowers soldiers in the occupied lands shot and wounded 
three palestinian protesters 
at a cabinet meeting prime minister yitzhak shamir denied news 
reports that he recommended expanding defense rules to allow 
soldiers and civilians to fire back at stonethrowers in the 
occupied lands ministers said 
jewish settlers have been demanding both the army and settlers 
be allowed to open fire on palestinians throwing stones only 
soldiers now are allowed to shoot at arab firebombers settlers are 
permitted to fire back only in the case of imminent danger to life 
the controversy over those rules flared last week when a 
usborn jewish settler accidentally shot and wounded two israeli 
soldiers the settler gedalia becker stopped his car and fired in 
the dark after a firebomb attack 
about 200 residents of the west bank settlement of einav 
occupied a park opposite shamirs office sunday and said they cant 
live in their settlement because government policies dont allow 
adequate protection against stonethrowers 
small children and their mothers sat under tents marked day 
care center and kindergarten surrounded by six police vans 
and about two dozen policemen 
einav secretary baruch lior said two people from his settlement 
of 40 families have been hit in the head in stonethrowing attacks 
the last 10 days 
we demand an elementary right to protect our lives the army 
is doing everything it can but the government ties its hands can 
the government say it did not spill this blood lior said 
an elderly injured settler shlomo levi lay nearby on a 
stretcher a bloodstained bandage on his head levi was surrounded 
by praying jews one of whom held a prayer book and an uzi 
submachine gun on his knees 
at shamirs office the cabinet debated rules of opening fire 
energy minister moshe shahal of the labor party told israel radio 
he accused shamir of trying to turn the occupied lands into a 
wild west where each one takes the law in his hands 
shahals attack followed media reports that shamir head of the 
rival likud bloc supports the idea of shooting stonethrowers 
but shamir denied supporting such a proposal said his 
spokesman avi pazner 
israel is facing a wave of terror and has to meet it with a 
firm hand security forces are working on methods to counter the 
stonethrowing its good that the cabinet debates it and we 
hope the army will soon find an answer pazner quoted shamir as 
telling the ministers 
in the occupied west bank troops shot an 18yearold 
palestinian suheil harb wounding him in the stomach arab reports 
and hospital officials said they said he was wounded during a 
clash with soldiers at kafr sur village close to einav 
in the occupied gaza strip another arab 22yearold mahmoud 
abdel fatah of deir el balah village was shot in the leg 
officials at the ahli arab hospital in gaza said 
an official at al ittihad hospital told the associated press 
that 26yearold ibrahim yussef sohahmi was shot and seriously 
wounded in the neck during a clash with israeli soldiers in the 
west bank village of silat el harithiya near jenin 
the army said it knew of no clash between soldiers and 
palestinians in deir el balah confirmed that a palestinian was 
shot and lightly wounded in the leg in kafr sur and was 
investigating the reported shooting in silat el harithiya 
since the palestinian uprising began dec 8 against israeli rule 
in the occupied lands 5600 arabs have been wounded according to 
israeli army figures at least 258 palestinians and four israelis 
have died

gorky residents received dramatic proof of the 
greater openness in their nations public affairs when local 
communist party officials allowed a party meeting to be televised 
live for the first time 
during the broadcast residents of the volga river city 250 
miles east of moscow could call in and make proposals to the party 
officials the government newspaper izvestia said sunday 
we hope the discussion of burning problems in the presence of 
the people and with the help of television will become a standard 
of party work ivan v chapanov a senior gorky party executive 
was quoted as saying 
the newspaper said the broadcast of the gorky regional party 
organizations meeting on saturday was a first for the region but 
it was believed to be the first time any body in the 20 
millionmember party had allowed a full live broadcast of its 
proceedings the broadcast also was reported by the tass news 
agency 
despite soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs promotion of 
glasnost or more openness in public affairs deliberations of 
party organizations up to the ruling politburo continue to be held 
in secret often their meetings are only sketchily reported to the 
public 
at a nationwide party conference held in moscow this summer 
some delegates demanded more information be made public about the 
work and responsibilities of party organizations and officials 
speaking in a telephone interview with izvestia chapanov said 
saturdays plenary party meeting in gorky was preceded by a month 
of strenuous work for preparing the live broadcasting which is 
unusual so far in party practices 
a newspaper in gorkey announced in advance the plan to televise 
the regional party plenum chapanov said 
phone numbers that gave people access to the meeting hall were 
also made public he said 
according to chapanov people appreciated the initiative some 
50 telephone calls and proposals were registered during the work of 
the session 
izvestia and tass did not make clear whether the gorky regional 
committee intended to continue allowing live coverage of its 
sessions or whether the practice could spread elsewhere 
in the past top communist party officials including ideology 
secretary alexander n yakovlev have defended the partys practice 
of holding meetings behind closed doors saying the need for 
greater openness in government does not oblige the party legally a 
private body to open its proceedings to all

i think there is no question that burma is on the dawn of a 
new era of democracy solarz said the only question is whether 
the new era will emerge peacefully or whether it will be the 
product of chaos anarchy and violence

change

bolts of lightning strike far more often than 
weather records indicate making electrical storms more dangerous 
than previously believed a weather researcher warns 
the reason is that most records on lightning occurrences are 
compiled by observers who listen for thunder which is produced by 
lightning 
but new research shows that between 22 percent and 40 percent of 
lightning flashes occur when no thunder was heard 
it is not good news researcher stanley a changnon said of 
his findings reported in the august edition of the journal of 
geophysical researchatmospheres 
those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage 
for example nuclear power plants have had to use data based on 
thunder records to develop their risk analyses changnon said 
in a telephone interview 
its very clear that thunder rather dramatically 
underestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point he 
said 
changnon a weather researcher affiliated with the illinois 
state water survey who also teaches at the university of rochester 
in rochester ny used electromagnetic detectors to record actual 
cloudtoground flashes of lightning 
his report was done in conjunction with his son david changnon 
of colorado state university and richard b pyle of the state 
university of new york at albany 
detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s 
changnon said but they have always depended on the reports of 
trained observers who primarily listen for thunder 
in recent years however electromagnetic detectors have been 
installed in many areas to record actual lightning strokes 
the researchers compared the thunder reports of weather 
observers with the lightning records from sensors used by the 
federal bureau of land management in western states and by 
electrical utilities along the eastern seaboard 
the degree of relationship is relatively weak changnon 
reported it gives one a lot of pause in many respects about 
how the atmosphere works how good our weather records are and how 
safe we are 
in the west changnon reported between 31 percent and 40 
percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listening 
for thunder 
the situation was better in the east with 22 percent to 26 
percent of lightning strokes being missed the report said 
the differences between observations in the east and the west 
occurs at least in part because of greater problems in hearing 
thunder in the west particularly in mountainous areas he said 
lightning killed 86 americans last year the highest death toll 
in this decade but lower than the annual average of 96 according 
to records kept by the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the agency counted 365 lightningrelated injuries in 1987 about 
50 percent higher than the annual average due largely to a series 
of strikes that hit groups of people 
lightning apparently does not command the respect it deserves 
as a dangerous killer e w friday director of the national 
weather service has warned friday said only floods compete with 
lightning in deadliness 
last years death toll was the most since 88 people died in 
lightning strikes in 1978 but that falls far short of several 
deadly years in the 1960s including 1963 when 210 people were 
killed by lightning 
as usual florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last 
year tennessee ranked second with 6 followed by 5 in new mexico 
and 4 each in alabama arkansas minnesota mississippi new york 
and north carolina 
colorado georgia illinois louisiana maryland new jersey 
oklahoma and south carolina each recorded three fatalities there 
were two each in arizona kentucky missouri utah and virginia 
states recording a single lightning death for the year were 
washington dc kansas montana north dakota pennsylvania and 
south dakota

gang violence rages on in the city of angels 
and street thugs are expanding their drug trade to other us 
cities despite police sweeps a new fbi task force and two gang 
summits 
more than 200 people have died in gangrelated slayings so far 
this year 11 people were slain last weekend and an undercover 
policeman was shot to death saturday while tailing suspects in a 
driveby shooting 
los angeles county had a record 387 gangrelated slayings in 
1987 and authorities are expecting more than 420 in 1988 said 
deputy district attorney michael genelin head of the district 
attorneys hardcore gang unit 
driveby gang killings now average more than one a day and often 
claim innocent bystanders 
community outcry prompted los angeles police to launch a 
fullscale assault in march twice since then they have marched 
1000 officers into the most ganginfested areas on weekends 
the result has been a decline in the overall crime rate 
although the gang murder rate continues to climb 
were in a holding action were keeping the flames from 
spreading but were not putting them out said robert 
philibosian former district attorney and head of a state task 
force on gangs and drugs 
los angeles gangs are expanding their cocainetrafficking 
networks as far as seattle kansas city mo and philadelphia law 
enforcement authorities said 
we have people coming from la to sell cocaine not to start 
gangs its a business deal here its not gangs said seattle 
police officer dan fordice 
a los angeles gang member was recently sentenced to 25 years in 
prison in seattle for selling drugs near a school he said kansas 
city has had eight successful prosecutions of los angeles gang 
members for narcotics offenses said sgt kathleen pierce 
it just another brand of slug we have to deal with fordice 
sighed 
authorities said it will take much more than cops on corners to 
make a dent in the 70000 members of the 600 gangs in the county 
its going to take years the fbi has worked at stopping the 
drug problem for 30 years and still hasnt stopped it said 
lawrence lawler the new fbi chief for los angeles its a form 
of life to some people it may be an entire generation before this 
goes away 
when lawler arrived here from minneapolis two months ago his 
first big action was to establish an fbi gang unit here because he 
had begun to see los angeles bloods and crips gangs sell cocaine 
in st paul minn 
us attorney robert bonner also created an antigang unit of 
federal and local law enforcement 
city police will continue the sweeps and will also begin 
targeting hardcore leaders of the most powerful gangs said deputy 
police chief william rathburn 
a similar effort was conducted in 1979 and 1980 and authorities 
found that when the leaders were put away activity in their gangs 
and their neighborhoods dissipated philibosian said but those 
leaders are now coming out of prison he said 
clergy members tried their part this summer by holding two gang 
summits the first in july attracted about a dozen people a 
twoday summit last week drew 50 and some members of the rival 
crips and bloods vowed to lay down their arms end their gang 
affiliations and form a network to persuade others to do the same 
we have intelligence and want a quality education i know that 
were running out of time america listen today said gang 
member raymond cook bay who attended the summit 
officials have criticized the summits for giving a false 
impression of optimism because the handful of gang members 
participating dont represent the 70000 on the street but 
organizers said at least theyre doing something 
officials also cautioned it will be a long time before new 
programs and law enforcement efforts take effect 
be patient a little longer said sheriffs sgt wes mcbride 
whos been fighting gangs for 15 years it will change well get 
a handle on it but it wont be an overnight thing

a retired south dakota congressman joins a 
former maine senator this month as the first members of congress to 
receive 1 million in government retirement pay a taxpayers group 
said sunday 
the national taxpayers union said former rep ben reifel will 
receive a september pension check for 6966 giving him more than 
1 million since he retired from congress in 1971 the south dakota 
republican served five terms in the house and receives 83589 
annually the group said 
in may former republican sen margaret chase smith became the 
first senator to get a millionaire pension said david keating 
executive vice president of the taxpayers group 
while most americans can only dream of a million dollars in 
retirement income dozens of retired legislators will soon become 
pension millionaires keating said in a news release 
the group said mrs smiths annual pension is 88715 she 
retired in 1973 after more than 30 years in congress and has 
received 1034914 in retirement benefits according to the group 
in november former tennessee sen albert a gore will receive a 
check putting him over the 1 million mark the group said he 
retired in 1971 after 32 years in the house and senate and receives 
an annual pension of 81347 
reifel gore and mrs smith each made 42500 during their last 
year in congress current congressional salary is 89500 
congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula that 
includes the average congressional salary over the last three years 
the group said a proposed increase in congressional pay to 
135000 next year would greatly increase the number of 
milliondollar pensions 
the taxpayers union a nonprofit organization that says it has 
150000 members interested in reducing government spending and 
taxes estimates that for every dollar paid in congressional 
salaries 35 cents is paid in congressional pension benefits 
it says 85 percent of the retirement funds come from general 
revenue because the 8 percent that representatives and senators pay 
into their retirement fund is not enough to cover the benefits 
meanwhile consumer advocate ralph nader said he was sending a 
letter to all members of congress on labor day reminding them that 
the national minimum wage has not increased in seven years while 
their own salaries have gone up 28838 
congress reluctance to adjust the minimum wage is 
particularly surprising in light of the diligence it has shown in 
raising its own pay nader said in the letter made public sunday 
nader noted that a worker earning the minimum wage of 353 an

jim bakker offered assurances sunday hell 
have the money this week to back up his 165 million offer for ptl 
bakker said in a telephone interview from his fort mill office 
that he has been working 15hour days in anticipation of regaining 
the tv ministry he left in 1987 in a sex and money scandal 
we have made quite a few contacts with bankers bakker said 
when the contracts to take over ptl are ready well have the 
money to back it up 
he said he hopes he and his wife tammy will be back on the air 
on sept 12 
on friday ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red benton said he 
was very very skeptical about whether bakker would come up 
with the cash to back up his offer if bakker does not have a 3 
million letter of credit by tuesday benton said he will start 
considering other offers for the ministrys assets 
a least four other offers ranging from 113 million to 200 
million have been made for ptl officials said 
benton has a deadline of saturday to present a buyer to us 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds for approval the evangelical 
empire filed for bankruptcy in june 1987 three months after the 
scandal over bakkers sexual liaison with jessica hahn 
bakker said working out deals with banks is especially difficult 
during a holiday weekend but a midwestern bank one in atlanta and 
another in tennessee are interested in handling the funds from the 
greek investors he said are are backing his offer 
bakker declined to identify the investors or the banks 
his lawyer jim toms said in a telephone interview from 
hendersonville nc that some banks are leery of involvement 
because of the controversy surrounding bakker but he feels certain 
one will cooperate before the week ends 
the evangelist said hes readying for the takeover by asking 
experts for advice on such things as tv production hotel 
management direct mailings accounting and musical production 
bakker who was defrocked by the assemblies of god said the 
denomination has nothing to do with what were doing he said 
he is an ordained minister of the faith christian fellowship and 
the new ptl will be under that churchs guidance 
he said that he knew some viewers have lost faith in him but 
that his name recognition has increased dramatically since he left 
the ministry and he expects to more than make up for the loss 
sure we have people who are turning their backs on us and will 
turn their backs on us he said but were known by so many 
millions more were excited about it

federal investigators wound up their 
field work at the site of last weeks delta air crash sunday 
refusing to comment on speculation that double engine failure might 
have led to the disaster 
the dallas morning news quoting anonymous sources close to the 
investigation reported sunday that investigators are trying to 
determine whether two of the three engines on the boeing 727 failed 
in the seconds before wednesdays crash 
when someone says engine failure there are a whole host of 
things that might mean lee dickinson a member of the ntsb said 
at a briefing sunday one of the things i will not do is 
speculate on anything 
some pilots said the fact that the wing flaps on the jet were 
apparently retracted at the time of the crash when they ordinarily 
would have been extended for takeoff may have been a sign the 
pilots were trying to fly the plane on one engine not a cause of 
the crash newspapers reported 
thirteen people were killed when flight 1141 en route to salt 
lake city crashed and burned seconds after takeoff at dallasfort 
worth international airport ninetyfive people survived 
a recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine 
failure two loud pops were then heard which could have indicated 
a compressor stall but dickinson said a compressor stall 
which occurs when an engine is starving for air is not critical 
keep in mind compressor stall is not serious its a hiccup 
at the site sunday investigators sealed the cockpit in a blue 
tarp it will be taken to delta headquarters in atlanta where it 
will be dismantled and studied 
workers used power saws to remove the landing gear beneath the 
727 and also bored into the ground beneath the left wing to 
determine the amount of fuel that may have spilled during the crash 
two surviving flight attendants were taken to the wreckage and 
questioned by investigators dickinson said he said he had no 
immediate information on what they said 
dickinson said he planned to leave dallas later sunday and only 
a few investigators would remain as the center of the inquiry moves 
to washington 
meanwhile nbc and the washington post reported that as the 
plane taxied to the end of the runway the cockpit crew spoke about 
previous air crashes including the 1985 delta flight 191 crash that 
killed 137 at the airport 
the newspaper said the crew talked about recent reports about a 
cockpit recording in the crash of a jet last november in denver 
which revealed the crew members discussing a coworkers dating 
habits 
nbc reported saturday that the delta crew members last week 
joked that they should be careful since their comments could become 
public if the plane crashed 
dickinson said saturday night that he had not heard the cockpit 
voice recording but added if in our analysis we decide thats 
pertinent information well analyze it 
the role of the wing flaps which are extended during takeoff to 
provide added lift continued to be discussed 
flight engineer stephen judd has told investigators that the 
wing flaps were extended in the proper position upon takeoff but 
evidence collected from the wreckage indicates the flaps were 
completely or almost completely retracted 
we have further verification that the flaps were retracted 
dickinson said sunday 
the delta copilot carey wilson kirkland jr told 
investigators saturday that he did not remember anything from when 
the plane left the gate dickinson said doctors said the pilot 
capt larry davis was not well enough to be interviewed 
bill melvin a dallasbased delta pilot participating in the 
crash investigation on behalf of the air line pilots association 
said he believes the pilot could have been facing engine failure 
and decided to retract the flaps in a lastditch effort to save the 
plane 
a 727 will still fly if it loses one engine but all 727 
pilots know if you lose two engines the only way you can fly the 
plane off is to get rid of the flaps melvin told the dallas 
times herald noting the manuever is not approved emergency 
procedure with two engines out theres only one way that plane 
could fly with the flaps up 
dickinson said he didnt know what the procedure for the pilot 
would have been if both engines failed each airline has 
different operations as you know we will be documenting deltas 
procedure

the leader of angolas 
anticommunist rebels claimed cuba now has 60000 troops in angola 
and is planning to attack his guerrilla forces within days 
rebel leader jonas savimbi said cuba has sent 10000 more 
soldiers to angola in recent weeks and the cubanangolan forces 
have used a recent ceasefire to move farther south in angola and 
position themselves for an offensive 
there are now 60000 cubans in angola and they are prepared to 
launch attacks within days savimbi said the cubans didnt 
come here to wave goodbye it is an initiative for an offensive 
savimbi made his comments saturday at his headquarters in jamba 
a rebel stronghold in southern angola the associated press in 
johannesburg received a videotape of his remarks 
angola cuba and south africa agreed on aug 8 to a ceasefire 
in angolas civil war as part of a regional peace initiative but 
savimbis national union for the total independence of angola 
known as unita did not participate in the negotiations 
portugal granted angola independence in 1975 and the marxist 
popular movement for the liberation of angola defeated unita 
fighters in a battle for power 
unita with us and south african backing then began a 
guerrilla campaign and cuba sent troops to the southern african 
country to help the government 
savimbi has said his guerrillas will continue the war because 
they were not included in the ceasefire talks that were mediated 
by us assistant secretary of state chester crocker 
some us officials in washington last week told the associated 
press that cuba had increased its troop strength in angola to 
60000 but the us state department said friday it still 
estimated the cuban forces at 50000 
a new round of peace talks between south africa cuba angola 
and us mediators is scheduled this week in brazzaville congo 
south africa said tuesday that it had withdrawn all of its 
forces from angola 
it also said it is prepared to begin withdrawing its troops from 
southwest africa on nov 1 and to allow the territory to hold 
independence elections next june 1 if the cubans are out of angola 
by june sources involved in the last round of negotiations said 
the cubans offered to withdraw from angola over a 24month period 
southwest africa also known as namibia is located between 
angola and south africa and has been administered by south africas 
whitecontrolled government since the end of world war i under a 
mandate of the defunct league of nations the united nations 
repudiated that mandate but south africa has rejected un 
resolutions calling for immediate independence for the territory 
south africa with us backing has insisted that the cuban 
forces must first withdraw from angola 
savimbi called the talks dealing with the withdrawal of cuban 
and south african troops from angola a cosmetic solution to peace 
when the participants know they are going to leave behind a war 
he said he supported us efforts to end the 13yearold 
conflict but claimed crocker was giving all the cards to the 
angolan government

two visions of vermont have 
collided in this picturesque hilltop village of austere white 
buildings and a village green 
one has to do with polished antiques fine food and weekends of 
leisure in the countryside the other has to do with morning 
chores rutted pastures and muddy shoes 
the dispute is being aired in hearing rooms and involves an 
effort by a small college here to build a genuine livestock barn 
within sight of the manicured english gardens of the inn on the 
common with its croquet lawn clay tennis court and adirondack 
chairs from which guests take in the panoramic view 
people come here for peace and quiet they dont come here to 
be put in the middle of a farm yard said michael schmitt who 
with his wife penny opened the inn 14 years ago after leaving 
their jobs in new york in investment banking and advertising 
students at sterling college a 75student school offering 
programs in farming and forestry served up with a backtotheland 
ethic are erecting a barn whose rafters can be seen from the inns 
garden 
the schmitts opposition to the barn and a second one planned 
nearby was dismissed recently by the district 7 environmental 
commission based in st johnsbury but they have appealed to the 
state environmental board 
mrs schmitt said the barn violates the artistic intent of the 
inn whose gardens were built in the 1930s and are part of a 
historic district on the national register of historic places 
the idea is to create not just pretty flower clumps but to 
create a total outdoor room if you will she said 
we are not antifarming she said this is not a farm 
versus tourism issue tourism and farming are bound together in 
vermont people come to vermont to look at the beautiful farms and 
fields 
a vermont view can contain barns she said but you do what is 
appropriate where you find it 
construction permits are granted in vermont under a 1970 
development control law written to preserve the states rural 
character a district 7 commission member said this is the first 
time in his memory that the law has been used to oppose 
construction of barns 
sterling college president robert cowen said the school needs 
the barns to continue its agricultural programs 
we have tried to do this with the least negative impact as 
possible on our neighbors he said 
in its ruling the district commission dismissed the schmitts 
concerns about barnyard noises smells and insects wafting over a 
fence and onto their property the barn is about 800 feet from the 
inn 
although animals may occasionally be heard at the inn and at 
area residences this noise will be similar to the sounds produced 
by other farming operations in the area the commission wrote 
legally construction can go on during the schmitts appeal to 
the state environmental board but the college is proceeding at its 
own risk 
on the issue of aesthetics the commission applied a test in 
vermont law that bars projects having an undue adverse impact 
it found that while the impact of the barns would be adverse it 
would not be undue

sweatshops continue to exist in the united 
states with businesses in the restaurant apparel manufacturing 
and meatprocessing industries the worst offenders said a 
government report released sunday 
the general accounting office report said hispanics and asians 
were the ethnic groups most heavily represented among workers in 
restaurant and apparel sweatshops 
the gao the investigative arm of congress based its assessment 
on interviews with more than 100 federal and state officials 
nationwide surveyed between january and may 1988 
the report said some of the reasons cited for multiple laborlaw 
violations were similar to those that existed in the 19th century 
a large immigrant work force and low profit margins in 
laborintensive industries 
rep charles e schumer dny who requested the gao study 
said the results show the ugly side of the reagan legacy 
i think most americans believe sweatshops vanished generations 
ago but they are here today in all parts of the country he 
said in a statement released with the report 
schumer supported the reports conclusion that penalties for 
labor law violations must be increased to deter abuses 
as it stands employers can violate the minimum wage law and 
if they get caught they only repay lost wages the new york 
congressman said right now the penalties arent even a slap on 
the wrist they are more like a knowing wink 
the gao described a sweatshop a term not defined in federal law 
or regulations as a business that regularly violates both wage 
or child labor and safety or health laws 
the agency excluded from its study industries such as 
construction and agriculture where work is performed outside of 
enclosed structures it also excluded work done in employees homes 
the agency said it received responses to its survey from 
officials in the district of columbia and all states except oregon 
the gao also surveyed federal officials 10 regional administrators 
of the labor departments wage and hour division 10 occupational 
safety and health administration regional officials and 33 
immigration and naturalization service district directors 
the restaurant apparel manufacturing and meatprocessing 
industries were most often cited by these officials as having the 
most serious problems with labor law violations the gao said 
other industries cited were hotel and motel maid services security 
agencies footwear and supermarkets 
officials reported problems in every state except alaska and 
hawaii 
the results of the surveys suggest that many workers may be 
underpaid and working in unsafe or unhealthy conditions the gao 
said 
the agency gave no estimate of the total number of workers 
affected but said one respondent estimated that half of the 
approximately 5000 restaurants in chicago employing about 25000 
people were chronic labor law violators another respondent 
estimated that 25 percent of the 100 apparel manufacturing firms in 
new orleans employing about 5000 workers are violating labor 
laws 
the officials said problems in the apparel manufacturing and 
restaurant industries have not improved or have become more serious 
in the past decade 
the report said officials estimated hispanics represented an 
average of 53 percent of workers in restaurant sweatshops and an 
average of 60 percent of workers in apparel manufacturing shops 
that are chronic labor law violators the comparable figures for 
asians were 25 percent in restaurants and 35 percent in apparel 
examples of the violations found include failure to keep 
required records of wages hours worked and injuries wages below 
the minimum wage which currently is 335 per hour or failure to 
pay overtime illegal work by minors fire hazards and work 
procedures that cause crippling illnesses the gao said 
the report said limited coordination among enforcement agencies 
too few inspectors and inadequate penalties for violations limit 
efforts to enforce labor laws

with the presidential election nine weeks off 
sizable numbers of likely voters say they dont know much about the 
candidates and feel the contenders are avoiding the issues time 
magazine reported sunday 
a poll conducted for the magazine last week found improvement in 
republican george bushs ratings for trustworthiness and 
reliability and declines for democrat michael dukakis in terms of 
trustworthiness and experience 
overall 47 percent of the 1103 likely voters nationwide 
favored bush and his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana to 
42 percent for dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen of texas the margin 
of error was three points meaning the race statistically was a 
dead heat 
that result was among voters who are registered and considered 
likely to vote among all registered voters 1474 of them in the 
poll the race was even tighter 44 percent for the republicans 
42 percent for the democrats 
times survey conducted thursday and friday found that public 
opinion remained largely unformed about the candidates as the 
campaign enters its final stretch and large swings in support 
remained possible a fifth of the likely voters backing each ticket 
said they might change their minds 
fully 50 percent of the likely voters said they knew not much 
at all about dukakis and what kind of president he would be and 
29 percent said that about bush despite bushs nearly eightyear 
tenure as vice president 
about half the likely voters said bush was avoiding the real 
issues and nearly as many 44 percent said that of dukakis 
but bush who caught up in the polls with dukakis after the 
republican convention last month was rated favorably by 58 percent 
of the likely voters compared to a 49 percent favorable rating for 
dukakis each of the men was rated unfavorably by a third of the 
likely voters 
moreover 58 percent rated bush as someone you can trust up 
from 48 percent in a time poll in april and 60 percent said bush 
could handle an international crisis up from 51 percent in april 
fiftythree percent rated dukakis as trustworthy down from 61 
percent in april and 43 percent said he has the experience to be 
president down from 53 percent in april 
bush was rated far better on experience 83 percent and 
dukakis was viewed as reliable in a crisis by just 40 percent 
however 72 percent said dukakis cares about average americans 57 
percent said so of bush 
forty percent in the survey rated dukakis as too liberal 
indicating that bushs attacks on ideological grounds have had some 
effect 
but while bush has tied himself to president reagans record 51 
percent in the poll said they wanted the next president to follow 
different policies to 42 percent who favored continuing reagans 
policies

favor the republican ticket while 42 percent prefer the democrats 
the margin of error was three points meaning the race 
statistically was a dead heat 
the survey conducted thursday and friday also found that 
public opinion about the candidates remained largely unformed and 
major swings in the support remained possible 
bush who caught up in the polls with dukakis after the 
republican convention last month was rated favorably by 58 percent 
of the likely voters compared to a 49 percent favorable rating for 
dukakis each of the men was rated unfavorably by a third of the 
likely voters 
although the republican nominee took a respite from campaigning 
two of his surrogates used television appearances to lash out at 
dukakis record on education and labor 
education secretary william bennett in an appearance on 
nbctvs meet the press said dukakis is a member of an elitist 
massachusetts crowd that has disdain for the simple and basic 
patriotism of most americans including the reciting of the 
pledge of allegiance 
bennett said the pledge is the abcs of education and added 
if you have trouble with the pledge youre going to have trouble 
with a lot of things down the road 
in 1977 dukakis vetoed legislation requiring mandatory 
recitation of the pledge in public schools after massachusetts 
highest court citing us supreme court precedent said the 
legislation was unconstitutional 
last month dukakis defended his decision saying that although 
he encourages children to say the pledge the issue centered on the 
measures constitutionality 
bennett said he lived in that brooklinecambridge world for 
eight years referring to dukakis hometown and the site of 
harvard university these are people who dont like things like 
the pledge they have disdain for the simple and basic patriotism 
of most americans 
asked if he was accusing dukakis of disdain for patriotism 
bennett said i think the crowd with which he runs do think 
they are smarter you know they have these advanced attitudes 
they dont like what most americans think and believe 
bennetts comments drew cries of foul from former democratic 
candidate paul simon who described himself as dukakis point man 
on education and officials in brookline 
george bush as education president would be easier to believe 
if he had been an education vice president simon said in a 
statement theres no evidence george bush ever raised his voice 
picked up a phone or lifted a finger to protest the miserable 
education record of this administration 
jeffrey allen chairman of the brookline board of selectmen 
demanded an apology from bennett 
my reaction is one of outrage that the secretary of education 
on national television sees fit to question the patriotism and 
committment to this nation of a town of 59000 people allen said 
sunday afternoon 
i believe he owes this town an apology he said 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin who appeared on abctvs this 
week with david brinkley said she did not see plans that dukakis 
has had in massachusetts that are transferrable to the nation at 
large 
bushs running mate took a break from touting the republican 
ticket and criticizing the democrats indiana sen quayle attended 
the southern 500 stock car race in darlington sc where he was 
given the honor of telling the drivers gentlemen start your 
engines 
at the opening ceremonies of the race he received a smattering 
of boos from the audience when he was introduced 
later sunday quayle attended a private fundraiser in richmond 
and flew on to newark where he prepared for the speech he will give 
monday morning in the shadow of the statue of liberty 
labor day marks the official countdown to the november election 
but political events including the furor over the selection of 
quayle forced the candidates to start in earnest earlier this year 
the contest remains close as reflected in three state polls 
released sunday 
in iowa dukakis nearly 21 early summer lead has disappeared 
and he now leads bush 4742 percent the des moines register poll 
of 687 likely voters conducted aug 2331 had a margin of error 
of 38 percentage points 
in the same poll taken in june dukakis led bush by a 6028 
percent margin 
in a survey conducted for the wilmington newsjournal papers in 
delaware bush led dukakis 38 percent to 34 percent with 28 percent 
of the 1824 registered voters undecided the poll conducted aug 
1926 had a margin of error of 3 percentage points 
bush also led dukakis in a poll of 502 registered voters in 
alabama the survey for the birmingham news found bush favored by 
507 percent and dukakis by 34 percent the survey with a margin 
of error of 5 percentage points was conducted aug 2731

winstonsalem nc ap a smokeless cigarette that rj 
reynolds tobacco co plans to test market apparently is not for 
everyone 
it smells like a tennis shoe burning said tom martin of 
danville va who took a puff during an informal taste test last 
week a reebok 
woody added shawn evans of columbus ohio 
the unscientific survey was conducted by the winstonsalem 
journal 
reynolds tobacco announced last week it would begin 
testmarketing the cigarette called premier oct 1 in st louis 
and in the arizona cities of phoenix and tucson 
reynolds one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers 
and a subsidiary of atlantabased rjr nabisco inc began selling 
the new brand last week to distributors supermarkets and discount 
chains in the three cities 
company spokesmen say the product simulates smoking by heating a 
capsule containing tobacco flavor pellets instead of tobacco when 
a smoker lights the cigarette heat filters through the pellets and 
the little bit of tobacco packed around the unit 
it produces no odor and only a trace of ash or smoke that could 
irritate people nearby the company says it also reportedly 
contains fewer of what reynolds calls controversial compounds 
the hazardous byproducts associated with cigarette smoke

two palestinians fighting 
deportation orders pleaded their case sunday in an open hearing 
the first time the army permitted the public to attend an appeals 
session 
defense lawyers lauded the armys decision but said due process 
was still being violated because prosecutors could submit secret 
evidence without having to show it to the defense 
said barakat 32 a moslem fundamentalist leader and riad 
adjour 26 accused of being a plo activist are among 25 
palestinians from the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
fighting deportation orders issued last month 
since the dec 8 start of the palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories israel has expelled 33 arabs the practice 
has been denounced by the united states and other western nations 
as violating international human rights conventions 
there is no hope no justice for me here but i dont want to 
go without fighting barakat told the tribunal 
the hearing before a threemember military review committee took 
place at the armys gaza city headquarters and was attended by 
three journalists and about two dozen relatives of the defendants 
barakat and adjour sat quietly on a wooden bench as the 
prosecutor capt meir klinger read the charges against them 
klinger said barakat a high school teacher from the gaza strip 
town of bani suheila was a chief ideologust of islamic jihad a 
moslem fundamentalist organization pledged to the destruction of 
israel 
he also said that barakat who was arrested may 11 signed a 
15page statement in which he acknowledged writing underground 
leaflets inciting antiisraeli violence 
we had enough evidence to put him on trial klinger told the 
panel instead we decided to deport him because experience has 
shown that fanatic islamic leaders usually continue their hostile 
activities in jail 
the prosecutor said adjour was a palistine liberation 
organization activist who led outlawed popular committees of 
palistinian miliants in the daraj neighborhood of gaza city 
klinger claimed adjour distributed plo funds and ordered the 
burnings of stores whose owners ignored strike orders 
in both cases klinger submitted secret evidence which 
usually involves reports by israels shin bet security service the 
defense is barred from seeing such evidence on security grounds 
you cant argue against secret evidence said fayez abu 
rahme one of the defense lawyers and head of the gaza lawyers 
association 
after defense lawyers present their case in a separate session 
the review panel will issue its recommendations if it upholds the 
deportation orders the defendants can appeal to the supreme court 
neither the review committee nor the supreme court has struck 
down a deportation order since the uprising began 
an israeli lawyer speaking on condition of anonymity suggested 
the hearings were opened to the public to provide more legitimacy 
to the proceedings and defuse international criticism 
but the defense lawyers expressed concern that israel was 
setting the stage for mass deportations 
they used to deport just the leaders now theyre deporting 
the small fish said tamar pelleg a lawyer representing adjour 
on behalf of the association for civil rights in israel she noted 
that adjour had not been arrested previously

venereal diseases have spread to every city in 
china and medical experts are calling for more action to fight the 
worsening problem an official report said sunday 
the daily newspaper health news said the number of vd patients 
has increased steadily since the late 1970s when china began 
opening its doors to foreigners 
it said the problem has spread from a few coastal cities which 
have more contacts with foreigners to almost every city in the 
country 
in southern chinas canton the number of vd victims most of 
whom were under the age of 20 quadrupled in 1987 from the previous 
year the paper said 
the report blamed the spread of the diseases to the closing of 
vd clinics in the early 1960s when venereal diseases were 
virtually wiped out and to the lack of education about the 
diseases backward medical equipment and treatment and lax 
enforcement of the ban on prostitution 
it suggested that a national body with representatives from 
public security the judiciary civil affairs the womens 
federation the tourist industry and the public health sector be 
set up to prevent and treat venereal diseases 
laws and regulations should be tightened to ban prostitution 
and sufferers should be compelled to get medical treatment the 
paper said

residents frustrated by the citys failure 
to clean up their neighborhood flipped some abandoned cars over and 
pushed others into intersections and one of the 23 vehicles caught 
fire police said 
angry residents of the impoverished north side neighborhood took 
to the streets in a frenzy of protest saturday when city trash 
trucks drove by without picking up garbage from a cleanup effort 
police said 
capt gerald baker said police were looking for the group of 15 
or so men involved in the spree but no arrests had been made by 
sunday morning no injuries were reported 
the protest was apparently triggered by the botched cleanup 
effort and frustration over the hundreds of abandoned cars that 
litter the areas streets and never get towed 
theres cars here for six months said neighbor stella 
martin you call and you call and nothing gets done they were 
told the only way the city would pick up the abandoned cars was if 
theyre in the middle of the streets

president corazon aquino said sunday 
that many filipinos oppose the return of ousted ruler ferdinand 
marcos and have vowed to hold demonstrations if he comes back 
in her weekly radio program mrs aquino said her government 
would comply if the courts ruled that marcos could return from 
exile in hawaii but she said there has been no such ruling because 
no criminal charges have been filed against him 
a militarycivilian uprising in february 1986 ousted marcos and 
carried mrs aquino to power two weeks ago marcos filed a 
petition with a manila court asking that he be allowed to return 
and confront a former cabinet member scheduled to testify in 
november on alleged corruption during the his 20year rule 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to return citing 
national security 
many people have sent letters and called up on the phone to 
tell me that they dont want ferdinand marcos to come back yet 
she said sunday some people have sent word to me that they would 
go out into the streets to protest the return of marcos 
the government has been seeking to recover up to 10 billion 
that it claims marcos and his associates plundered from the country 
but it has not filed criminal charges against marcos under 
philippine law a defendants presence is required in criminal 
proceedings 
since no criminal charges have been filed against the former 
president there is really no necessity yet for the courts to 
probably call for him mrs aquino said 
marcos had filed the petition seeking to return after the 
anticorruption court granted the solicitorgenerals request for a 
special hearing to perpetuate the testimony of former public 
works secretary baltazar aquino 
baltazar aquino who is not related to the president had served 
in marcos cabinet government lawyers have said he will testify 
about millions of dollars marcos allegedly received in kickbacks 
from japanese firms the lawyers said baltazar aquinos testimony 
must be taken soon because he is ill 
the court did say marcos has the right to defend himself in the 
proceedings that will begin nov 7 because the solicitorgeneral 
declared he intended to use testimony in the hearing in a future 
criminal suit against marcos 
the government has asked the court to reject marcos petition 
on thursday the court gave marcos 10 days to submit a written reply 
to the governments motion

give details about the talks now in their 11th day

representatives 
theres no recess planned for the time being eliasson said 
we are in this intensive working phase and i am hopeful and 
expect progress on the issues we discuss 
the geneva talks are to arrange followup procedures for the

withdrawals and the shattalarab waterway between iran and iraq 
that leads into the northern gulf 
eliasson who was appointed mediator on thursday was asked if 
there had been any progress in the negotiations 
he said to me it is progress that both sides sit in a meeting 
discuss problems of substance and characterize the talks as 
businesslike and constructive 
aziz after meeting with eliasson saturday said the talks were 
still in square one and he again blamed iran for the stalemate 
both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire 
and eliasson said the complaints had been submitted to un 
officials in iran and iraq but we havent received any feedback

changes in emergency procedures that 
were implemented after the delta flight 191 tragedy three years ago 
helped make a smooth response to last weeks crash an official 
said sunday 
this emergency response appears to be one of the most 
effective that ive ever seen said lawrence d roman a 
representative of the american association of airport executives 
and a member of the survival factors group of the national 
transportation safety board team investigating wednesdays crash 
delta flight 1141 crashed and burned on takeoff at dallasfort 
worth international airport killing 13 ninetyfive people 
including the three members of the cockpit crew survived as the 
boeing 727 skidded to rest at the end of a runway 
it would appear that on first impression that this response 
was excellent roman said i dont know of any screwups at all 
in the whole operation 
he stressed that he was not speaking on behalf of the 
investigation but as a representative of the airport executives 
association 
roman said changes made in emergency response procedures at the 
airport since the aug 2 1985 crash of delta flight 191 
including installation of cellular telephones in ambulances helped 
in evacuating survivors 
also he said an automated telephone system implemented at the 
airports department of public safety office reduced the time it 
took to notify rescue workers after the crash 
those procedures resulted from ntsb recommendations made after 
the 1985 crash which resulted in 137 deaths roman said 
meanwhile eight crash survivors were released from hospitals 
saturday some recalled the crash and rescue operation which they 
said involved little panic 
stella grigg at age 80 the oldest person on the downed plane 
said she was pushed out of the aircraft through a hole near the 
cockpit and caught by a group of men on the ground 
i was thrust forward and back even though i had a seat belt 
on she said the plane tipped to the left and tipped to the 
right and just skidded along

back part of the money

six men indicted to stand trial the others pleaded guilty to

about 50000 people some carrying candles and 
saying prayers lined up hand in hand on a latvian shore to protest 
pollution they say is killing the baltic sea an area journalist 
reported sunday 
some protesters also collected money to help pay for the cleanup 
of the sea robert bambitis editor of the latvian staterun 
television program said by telephone from riga the latvian 
capital 
he said protests also were held saturday in the two other baltic 
republics lithuania and estonia but he gave no details 
worries about pollution have been a major factor fueling 
nationalist resentment toward moscow in the three baltic republics 
many residents feel central authorities recklessly built 
factories that pollute the environment and they demand more 
regional control over environmental and economic decisions 
bambitis did not say exactly where the protests took place in 
latvia 
this summer some of the soviet baltic coasts most popular 
beaches including jurmala in latvia were closed to bathers 
because of polluted water and refuse that washed up on shore

smoke was billowing and about 150 
people were evacuated both in and around yellowstone national park 
on sunday but more than 200 square dancers decided the show must 
go on 
a 57000acre fire closing in on the parks northeastern 
entrance apparently did not faze about 250 square dancers who 
gathered on the west edge of the park for the 33rd annual knothead 
jamboree 
square dancers are tough we can take what they dish out 
said betty rae bronson of shelley idaho who is that states 
chairwoman for this years event or else were knotheads thats 
what were called 
the dancers come from montana wyoming idaho and utah and have 
held their jamboree each labor day weekend at west yellowstone 
since 1980 
this years attendance is about half what we had last year 
because of the fire ms bronson said 
nancy johnson of missoula the montana cochairman said 
attendance at the jamboree usually numbers closer to 800 
it wouldve been too late to move it or cancel unless it 
would have been an emergency situation or evacuation of the town 
she said 
so they pressed ahead with the festival which began saturday 
and is to conclude monday but the event was hurt financially by 
the low attendance and may not break even this year johnson said 
the neversaydie square dancers had reserved a hall in the fly 
fishing center which meant that fire officials who had set up a 
fire information center there were obliged to move their operation 
into two nearby tents until the jamboree ends 
meanwhile tourists continued flocking to the nations oldest 
park despite weeks of headlinemaking fires 
weve never been here before we just decided we wanted to see 
yellowstone said eugene kistner of carmi ill his wife esther 
said they knew what to expect because they had been following the 
fires progress on television but decided not to let that 
interfere with their plans 
we wanted to try it anyway she said 
we got to see everything we intended to see eugene kistner

arena set up as part of a hispanic festival saturday 
four matadors confronted three 1000pound bulls using the 
traditional capes but instead of being killed the animals had 
velcro patches glued to their backs to grab onto the matadors 
velcrocovered swords and darts 
the cruelest thing theyre doing is teasing the animal 
poholik said its not right but its not physically harming the 
animal weve got enough of animal exploitation we dont need 
this he said in a telephone interview sunday 
bullfighting is not permitted in the united states but three 
states kansas oklahoma and texas have allowed the bloodless 
variety poholik said 
chicago has an ordinance to prevent bullfights but cook county 
circuit judge albert green on friday ordered the city to grant a 
permit to jaass productions inc to stage the exhibition because 
the bulls are not killed 
im going to work with the mayor and city attorneys and get an 
amendment to an ordinance so we can ban bull baiting the 
commissioner said this bloodless bullfight is just another form 
of teasing and torment 
but rodolfo mancilla an aide to state rep benjamin martinez 
who helped arrange the festival said bullfighting is part of 
hispanic culture 
theyve already taken away our language in schools he said 
now they want to take away our folklore tradition heritage 
culture you just cant keep doing that and have people stand for 
it 
poholik who watched saturdays bullfight with an investigator 
from his staff and state officials said the animals were not 
treated harshly 
the promoters kept their word there was no blood drawn 
poholik said the animals were in excellent condition well fed 
there was a good corral area you could tell they were well cared 
for 
many of the spectators were also concerned about the animals 
most of the people were rooting for the bulls poholik said 
they cheered when the matadors got knocked down 
the bulls ultimate destination is the butcher shop said 
breeder manuel correla the animals learn quickly and can only 
be used for one bullfight he said we use them for hamburger

prime minister noboru takeshitas government passed 
a key test in its bid to overhaul japans tax system when the 
governing liberal democratic party scored twin victories sunday in 
a provincial election 
final results monday in conservative fukushima province gave the 
liberal democrats the governorship and a seat in parliaments upper 
house of councilors 
officials said 812 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots 
a record for fukushima 
eisaku sato won the gubernatorial race with 685791 votes 
compared to 461350 for toshio hirose a liberal party rebel who 
opposed the tax changes and communist candidate masaru kusano who 
polled 61630 votes in the northern province 
liberal democrat kentaro ishihara won the house of councilors 
seat with 702940 votes to 312203 for kazuo ishiga of the 
socialist party and 186503 for yumiko abe of the communist party 
the victories were a boost to the governing partys attempt to 
reform tax laws to include a controversial 3 percent consumption 
tax on nearly all goods and services 
takeshita has staked his political life on the success of the 
tax measure he said this year i am prepared to take political 
responsibility if the tax reform cannot be realized 
it is japans third attempt to overhaul a tax system drafted by 
american occupation officials shortly after world war ii previous 
failures dealt embarrassing political setbacks to two of 
takeshitas predecessors 
opposition parties had hoped to spark nationwide resistance to 
the consumption tax making the governors election a showdown on 
the reform proposals 
takeshitas party had not officially endorsed either sato or 
hirose in the gubernatorial campaign 
the results have stirred high interest they will exert 
great influence on the tax reform said a statement from 
takeshita on ishiharas victory 
as the governing party we have taken the long view and 
advocated the necessity of tax reform we gained the voters 
understanding with our efforts takeshita said 
the japan socialist party blamed the governing party for its 
defeat the conservative liberal democratic partys disunity 
alone was emphasized by its skillful concealment and ambiguous 
treatment of the consumption tax secretary general tsuruo 
yamaguchi said in a statement 
the conservative victories stymied opposition hopes of building 
up momentum against the tax reform last year a gubernatorial 
victory by the socialists in another conservative stronghold 
prompted nationwide protests that led to the defeat of thenpremier 
yasuhiro nakasones tax reform proposals 
faced with a political opposition united against the tax plan 
however takeshitas government has managed to win agreement only 
on initial cuts in income taxes parliamentary deliberation on the 
rest of the package has been stalled by a stockprofit scandal 
involving several politicians and aides 
the package calls for reducing japans heavy reliance on direct 
taxes by trimming income and corporate taxes and introducing the 
consumption tax critics say the plan falls short of the 
governments goal of easing inequities in the present system and 
preventing future increases in the consumption tax rate 
although the liberal democrats hold commanding majorities in 
both houses of japans parliament tradition and popular resistance 
have kept the party from ramming through the proposals

romania on sunday accused the hungarian 
news media of distorted coverage of events in romania even after 
the leaders of the two communist countries agreed to try to improve 
relations 
a major issue that has strained relations is romanias plan to 
raze some 7000 villages including hundreds of communities 
populated mainly by ethnic hungarians and resettle the people in 
agroindustrial centers as part of a land reform program there are 
about 17 million ethnic hungarians in romania which has a 
population of 23 million 
an editorial in scinteia the newspaper of the romanian 
communist party said the hungarian media is becoming the echo of 
hostile chauvinistic and nationalistic circles and groups 
romanian president nicolae ceausescu met with hungarian premier 
karoly grosz in the romanian town of arad a week ago in the first 
toplevel meeting between the two countries in eleven years 
scinteia said ceausescu told grosz the hungarian media distort 
in their coverage the situation in romania give accounts that are 
not real including the program of modernization and organization 
of settlements of the country of improvement of the romanian 
peoples living standard 
it reported ceausescu also said those programs are internal 
matters the resolution of which is the exclusive concern of our 
party of the romanian people 
the editorial said the romanian people are outraged by such 
gross attempts by the hungarian media to falsify the romanian 
realities and denigrate the romanian policy and most firmly 
disapproves of such practices 
some hungarian officials have called romanias resettlement 
plan which is to be completed by the year 2000 idiotic and a 
crime against mankind

a 110degree reading tied the citys alltime 
record sunday and the heat drove hundreds of thousands to beaches 
for the labor day weekend causing power outages and helping feed a 
swarm of brushfires 
to the north grants pass ore broke a 33yearold record of 
103 degrees with a 107degree reading and spokane wash baked 
under a third day of recordbreaking temperatures this time with 
a little smoke added 
the last time the temperature reached 110 in los angeles was 
sept 1 1955 the temperature easily beat the record high for the 
date of 100 set in 1984 
to the south a record for the date of 107 was set at san 
diegos lindbergh field surpassing a 1961 record of 95 
other tripledigit temperatures in southern california were long 
beach 104 burbank 106 fullerton 108 and ontario 110 
riverside and san bernardino usually the inland hot spots were 
cooler with 104 and 106 degrees respectively 
the hottest spot in california sunday was about 300 miles 
northeast of san francisco at red bluff which posted a record 118 
degrees 
beach highways were jammed with no parking available anywhere 
observers said guards at beaches near los angeles estimated some 
775000 people took to the sand while lifeguards at newport and 
huntington beaches in orange county reported 207000 people 
it was so crowded you could probably hop from blanket to 
blanket to avoid the hot sand play beach blanket bingo on your 
way to the water said huntington state beach lifeguard jim balok 
southern california edison reported 1000 customers without 
electricity due to peak demand from air conditioners that knocked 
out 425 transformers 
power outages also were reported in watts and in hancock park 
home of mayor tom bradley but they were not believed caused by 
demand related to the heat said dorothy jensen spokeswoman for 
the citys department of water and power 
as the heat raged so did the brush fires fast moving blazes 
were reported in san diego riverside orange san bernardino and 
ventura counties with more than 2800 acres charred 
sunday was the second day of the southern california heat wave 
the national weather service predicted lower temperatures for the

electricity flowed downtown again sunday after a 
threeday blackout that halted elevators in highrises thawed 
frozen food and shut down air conditioners during one of the 
hottest weeks in seattle history 
power was finally restored to much of the 50block area saturday 
night but seattle city light asked customers to conserve power and 
not turn on air conditioners until two more firedamaged cables 
could be repaired 
three days without electricity had taken their toll 
too many problem too many problems said dae w kim as he 
slowly began turning on the dozen coolers in his grocery and deli 
ive got a headache 
about half the blackedout areas customers began receiving 
power via four repaired feeder cables at 647 pm saturday by 
sunday night 90 percent of the affected customers had power back 
but there were load restrictions on four buildings said jim 
aguirre a spokesman for the cityowned utility 
crews still were working on restoring a fifth feeder cable and 
the sixth feeder was expected to be brought back into service 
monday or later aguirre said 
until then many buildings will have only partial power since 
they receive electricity from a combination of the cables said 
hugh mcintosh another city light spokesman 
at the twin towers of the 875room westin hotel for example 
full service was restored to the south tower early sunday while 
the north tower remained on a generator rented for 6200 a week 
marketing director dell schooly said 
the six cables were destroyed wednesday by an unexplained 
underground fire 
city light superintendent randall hardy said the fire apparently 
started in the city light cables in which power should have been 
cut off by automatic current limiters that act when a cable gets 
hot 
electricity also continued to flow through a nearby metro 
transit cable powering electric trolleys and that may have made 
the fire worse he said 
when the power restoration began patrols roamed the area to 
make sure no fires were triggered by equipment left switched on 
when the outage began 
it went very smoothly i have no reports of problems other 
than the sprinkler in the battery street tunnel which apparently 
began wetting down the tunnel when it was tripped by the power 
surge mcintosh said 
we called the fire department and told them it was their 
problem 
air conditioning was lost as temperatures soared to a september 
record of 98 degrees friday and to a record for the date of 92 on 
saturday sunday dawned with a cool fog and a forecast high of only 
80 to 85 
city light had no estimate of its costs to restore power or of 
damage from the fire 
our field people were really extending themselves a lot of 
them volunteering to go 16 hours double shifts until they could 
get the thing done mcintosh said 
no injuries were reported and steppedup police patrols were 
credited with preventing breakins 
at the height of the blackout city officials estimated that 90 
percent of all businesses in the area were closed the area has 
about 130 restaurants 55 shops in the popular pike place market 
the large bon marche department store and several hotels grocery 
stores and taverns 
pike place market businesses saw a drop in traffic even though 
many shops never lost electricity 
people think the whole market is closed said garth wilson 
of jacks fish spot 
the red cross served three meals a day to 150 to 250 elderly 
residents stuck in the darkened area volunteers had to take some 
meals up 13 flights in buildings where elevators were out of 
operation

residents outside the northeastern 
entrance to yellowstone national park were told to evacuate sunday 
as hundreds of firefighters mounted a lastditch effort to save 
this town and a spokeswoman said the situation within the park 
was deteriorating 
its going to be a siege for the next 48 hours said pat 
kaunert a fire information officer 
more than 50 fire engines stood by to protect homes in silver 
gate and nearby cooke city as the 57000acre fire approached from 
the west park county disaster coordinator bob fry said about 150 
people were being evacuated 
we were threatened with evacuation two weeks ago so i packed 
then ellen gesensway said in the doorway of her rented cabin 
ive been packed ever since 
bulldozers carved a 65footwide fire line through forest just 
west of here and nearly 500 firefighters helped dig the line by 
hand crews planned to set a backfire to cut off the main 
fires fuel source 
were creating a massive buffer in a lastditch effort to save 
this town kaunert said we need two miles of buffer in front 
of the fire to hold it two miles of black 
the blazes now cover some 910000 acres of the greater 
yellowstone area including 611000 acres within the park itself 
or more than onefourth of yellowstones 22 million total acreage 
within yellowstone itself firefighters sunday tried to save 
wooden foot bridges and protect a campground 
this situation is growing increasingly more serious day by 
day said yellowstone national park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
it is a magnitude that no one in their wildest imagination or 
scientific predictions could have suggested 
anzelmo added that without help from the weather no amount of 
money spent by the national park service or the us forest service 
will help douse the blazes winds were relatively calm sunday but 
forecasts called for variable winds up to 30 mph later in the week 
mother nature is making the decisions here said anzelmo 
some us forest service firefighters criticized the national 
park service for allowing fires to burn uncontrolled earlier this 
summer despite dry conditions officials said at the time that it 
was their policy not to fight lightningcaused fires in the 
wilderness which they consider a natural part of forest 
regeneration 
amy vanderbilt another park spokeswoman said the firefighters 
dont understand the problem 
what these firefighters who are coming in from other states 
may not realize is that firefighters were on that north fork fire 
within 15 minutes after it started she said in a telephone 
interview from park headquarters at mammoth hot springs wyo 
because of the extremely dry conditions that fire grew 
amazingly fast and beyond anyones expectations she said 
elsewhere sunday washington states most serious forest fires 
ballooned to more than 12500 acres sending smoke and ash over the 
town of republic but posing no immediate threat 
in silver gate a sheriffs department vehicle drove down the 
street at 8 am its siren blaring authorities knocked on doors 
and phoned people asking them to leave under montana law 
officials cannot force anyone to evacuate 
wayne johnson watched the firefighters march by and said he was 
staying theres no real reason to leave he said i dont 
think the towns going to burn 
inside the log cabin cafe the owners dashed around preparing 
to close up and get out 
im angry said coowner cecile king we have been 
battling with the park service since the first of july to do 
more and now the fires are threatening every town around the 
park 
the lightningsparked fire threatening silver gate has been 
burning june 14 under forest service policy for naturally 
occurring fires the blaze was allowed to burn as long as it 
remained within certain boundaries 
but in midaugust wind gusting to 70 mph blew the fire across 
several miles in a matter of hours and a humancaused fire to the 
west also gained ground 
that fire now stands at nearly 54000 acres and officials 
expect the two blazes to merge as of sunday they were two miles 
apart 
elsewhere in northeastern montana firefighters battling a 
9100acre fire northeast of libby had a pretty quiet night but 
still had no deadline for containment said kootenai national 
forest spokesman dick guth 
guth said 1600 firefighters were stymied by unbelievably hot 
dry conditions it is hard to say when well be able to get a line 
that will hold 
hot dry weather and a smoky haze that covered much of idaho 
continued to hamper efforts to contain four major fires that have 
blackened more than 80000 acres of forest and grassland crews and 
pumper trucks were stationed around several ranches as firefighters 
expected the largest of the fires to jump the boundaries of the 
frank churchriver of no return wilderness and move onto private 
property 
in southern california wildfires blackened nearly 3000 acres 
of brush and timber and damaged at least 21 structures as searing 
dry weather and santa ana winds harried firefighters and ignited 
new flames 
temperatures neared 110 degrees throughout the region humidity 
was low and gusty northeasterly desert winds rolled through 
canyons and hills 
in san diego county firefighters mopped up hot spots from a 
600acre blaze whose sparks scorched the roofs of at least 20 
hilltop homes 
arcing power lines caused a fire about 15 miles northeast of san 
diego 
a total of 21 homes were damaged by that blaze which forced the 
evacuation of 150 people from a mobile home park authorities said 
in utah firefighters received a break from calm winds to help 
keep a raging 4000acre brush fire away from more than 70 canyon 
homes east of salt lake city authorities said 
lt gov val oveson urged residents to avoid spending labor day 
in the mountains to reduce the risk of starting additional fires in 
dry forests

federal investigators wound up their

the dallas morning news quoting anonymous sources close to the 
investigation reported sunday that investigators are trying to 
determine whether two of the three engines on the boeing 727 failed 
in the seconds before wednesdays crash 
when someone says engine failure there are a whole host of 
things that might mean lee dickinson a member of the ntsb said 
at a briefing sunday one of the things i will not do is 
speculate on anything 
some pilots said the fact that the wing flaps on the jet were 
apparently retracted at the time of the crash when they ordinarily 
would have been extended for takeoff may have been a sign the 
pilots were trying to fly the plane on one engine not a cause of 
the crash newspapers reported

as any casual follower of the stock market 
knows a lot of the markets recent woes have been blamed on rising 
interest rates 
but it is the way rates have been rising even more than the 
simple fact that they have been moving up that particularly 
troubles some analysts 
with several nudges from the federal reserve shortterm 
interest rates on debt securities with lives of a year or less 
have climbed more sharply of late than longterm rates on bonds 
with maturities of up to 30 years 
that means that what wall streeters call the yield curve a 
graphic representation of the relationship between short and 
longterm rates is flattening 
if it inverts that is if shortterm rates go higher than 
longterm rates many analysts believe it would be a sign of 
significant trouble for both the stock market and the economy 
normally interest rates on longterm debt tend to be higher 
than on shortterm loans because longterm borrowers expose 
themselves to greater risk that the purchasing power of their money 
will be eroded by inflation or that the issuer of the debt will 
default 
so when the yield curve tilts in the opposite direction it is 
widely taken as a sign that something is out of whack 
inverted yield curves showed up early in the bear markets and 
recessions that occurred in 197374 and again at the beginning of 
the 1980s 
if the yield curve inverts there is a very high probability 
that a recession will follow said susan berge kent an analyst 
at tucker anthony amp rl day inc in a recent commentary 
recently she noted the ratio of rates on threemonth treasury 
bills to those on 30year treasury bonds stood at 78 
if the ratio rises above 80 and the fed does not cut the 
discount rate historical probability indicates that the yield 
curve will invert she said 
another cause for concern in the view of anthony sorrentino 
technical analyst at standard amp poors corp is the fact that 
rates on threemonth tbills at more than 7 percent are higher 
than the feds discount rate which it recently raised from 6 
percent to 65 percent 
such a positive spread is a sign of a restrictive federal 
reserve policy which usually places downward pressure on the stock 
market sorrentino said 
until the tbill rate falls below the discount rate this 
measure will remain in a bearish mode 
analysts at the financial advisory service donoghues 
moneyletter say managers of money market mutual funds have also 
been sounding a warning about interest rates and the financial 
outlook in recent months 
as a group these managers have been shortening the average 
maturities of the securities in their portfolios 
the standard motive for shortening maturities is to avoid or 
minimize price declines for existing securities when interest rates 
rise and to have money available soon to invest at higher rates 
when these managers believe interest rates are poised for a 
rise they invest their funds in shorterterm securities the 
newsletter said 
since the shortening began the stock market generally has 
been moving sideways and it recently has declined in the face of 
higher interest rates

when he was just barely a teenager gary 
e hoover decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book of 
retailing 
by 1982 armed with an economics degree and experience as a wall 
street analyst and department store executive he was ready to 
start writing 
hoover then 31 opened his first bookstop store in the texas 
capital modeling it loosely on the successful toys r us design 
big selection and discount prices a book superstore he called 
it 
six years later the bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores 
with three more scheduled to open by years end in texas florida 
and louisiana and the bookstop founder and chairman says 
confidently that there will be more to the story 
i decided when i was like 13 years old that someday i was 
going to start a chain of stores everything ive done since then 
was toward that goal he said 
but if your idea of a bookstore is a small musty darkpaneled 
place awash in pipe smoke bookstop stores might come as a shock 
the company says its average store covers 9500 square feet and 
stocks 35000 titles in 300 subject areas 
hoover is an architecture buff and the stores have moved into 
some unusual sites including houstons artdeco alabama movie 
theater the store being opened in new orleans will be located in a 
100yearold cotton warehouse 
weve got the flexibility to do those things old cafeterias 
old rollerskating rinks old theaters he said id love to be 
in an old bank too 
bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more some closing only two 
days a year they offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles 25 
percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers who 
annually purchase readers choice cards the company counts more 
than 200000 cardholders 
bookstop has centralized distribution so books arriving at the 
austin headquarters from publishers can be inventoried labeled 
with the chains own price tags and shipped to stores the stores 
transmit their sales results nightly by computer making them 
available the next morning so bookstops four buyers can see whats 
selling 
with a superstore like ours to break even our annual sales 
volumes got to be three four times the sales of the average 
bookstore its a much harder thing to do to carry that big a 
selection we need an advanced computer system real sophisticated 
inventory control systems and yet we try to do it all at a 
discount hoover said adding that bookstop moved 45 million 
volumes through its distribution center last year 
retailings always been an intensely competitive business but 
its becoming a much more technological business our survival 
depends much more on research on understanding the customer on 
computerized controls he said 
the privately held company doesnt make public sales figures 
although hoover has said in the past that 1986 sales were 26 
million in 1985 the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days 
the companys founder got his start with an economics degree 
from the university of chicago he was a retailing analyst with 
citibank in new york and worked for department store companies in 
dallas and st louis he says he spent seven years working on his 
bookstop business plan before raising the money to open the first 
store 
hoover readily credits the toys r us stores with the concept he 
voices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be among 
retailings big winners between now and the end of the century he 
cites such companies as drug emporium inc sound warehouse and 
new superstores in office supplies and sporting goods 
books is one of the fastestgrowing categories of retailing 
that demand ties to the baby boom because baby boomers are 
getting richer every day their incomes are rising as a group and 
theyre really oriented toward buying books continuing 
selfeducation and now buying their children books hoover said 
although other bookstore chains already were major national 
forces hoover said he didnt encounter too much skepticism when he 
approached investors with his idea of another 
books have survived the introduction of radio the 
introduction of television the introduction of phonograph records 
and movies books are a way of transmitting information and 
compared with other ways of transmitting information they are 
still cheap portable compact and readily available were trying 
to do our part to make them more readily available he said

all business thats how carl westcott came to be 
one of the latest success stories in the television industry 
the 48yearold westcott founder and chairman of dallasbased 
westcott communications has jumped to the forefront of the 
business television industry with his automotive satellite 
television network 
astn billed as the worlds largest private satellite television 
network delivers about 30 hours of auto industry news and training 
programs to about 3600 subscriber automobile dealerships across 
the united states and canada 
the fledgling network has been a rapid success some 18 percent 
of the nations car dealerships pay about 385 a month to receive 
astn programming westcotts goal is to have his programming aired 
to 50 percent of the industry 
it does take people by surprise westcott said of his 
creations success theyve been shocked 
industry experts say private television networks devoted to a 
particular business are a tremendous growth industry and the market 
could generate billions of dollars in business within 10 years 
westcott said 
westcott already is looking ahead he just moved his company 
into a new 6 million headquarters with three studios and 
production facilities where more than 600 thirtyminute programs 
will be created and produced this year 
westcott communications plans soon to create private television 
programming for the banking hotel and travel industries westcott 
said he also has contacted the internal revenue service with a 
proposal to create training programming for its employees 
westcott who owns auto dealerships in atlanta ga huntington 
beach calif and tyler texas formed his private television 
network after buying an nbc affiliate in tyler and discovering at a 
network meeting in new york how inexpensive it was to buy satellite 
time 
he decided that a private television network might be the 
perfect vehicle to provide topquality training materials for the 
automobile dealerships he owned he had found that existing films 
and other materials were not effectively training his employees 
we didnt invent anything westcott said but we just 
rolled it over into what it is now we realize that people grow up 
watching 30 to 40 hours of television a week and most people 
receive more information daily from television than any other 
source 
the private network also allows businessmen to get important 
industry news as soon as possible instead of having to wait for 
newsletters that might not arrive until 10 days or more after an 
important event 
the news is what the dealer is most interested in westcott 
said 
with a detroit news bureau and reporters in los angeles and 
washington dc astn delivers news about plant closings strikes 
new financing rates and other items of interest to the automotive 
industry newscasts are made every 90 minutes 
westcott said many dealerships plan their sales meetings to 
include astn programming and that an astn broadcast may be watched 
by as many as 20000 people

to michael levenson the cafeteria is an 
allamerican standby that occupies a perfect sturdy niche in the 
often volatile restaurant industry 
its not a juicier hamburger its not a faster pizza its 
not a fad said levenson chairman and chief executive officer of 
furrsbishops cafeterias inc and its a reliable stream of 
cash flow 
the cashrich lowdebt balance sheets of the cafeteria segment 
drew levenson to acquire furrsbishops and has made dallasbased 
wyatt cafeterias inc his acquisition target for the past two years 
levenson said thursday he would not give his takeover attempts 
but refused to specify his plans if his latest overture is rejected 
the closelyheld wyatt has revenues of about 190 million and 
120 restaurants nationwide 
after first offering to buy the company in may 1986 levenson 
made several bids for wyatt last wednesday he sweetened his offer 
for wyatt to 1881 million in cash and securities from an earlier 
1793 million bid 
the latest 9125 pershare bid came after wyatt rejected 
levensons 87 pershare cash offer in favor of one from a wyatt 
managementbased employee stock ownership plan that bid 84 per 
share 
wyatt shareholders are scheduled to vote on the esop offer sept 
6 and wyatt management has not yet responded to the latest 
furrsbishops offer levenson said 
if we dont get the wyatts deal that doesnt mean were out 
of the business of buying cafeterias said levenson who owns a 
small stake in wyatt were going to grow this company 
the cafeteria business captured the 38yearold levensons 
attention after he bid unsuccessfully on companies such as 
midlandbased texas american energy aloha airlines of hawaii and 
tesoro petroleum corp of san antonio 
when i began studying the restaurant industry the cafeteria 
segment of the restaurant industry stood out with some real unique 
features he said 
convinced he had discovered a gold mine in 1987 he acquired 
furrs cafeterias and bishop buffets based in cedar rapids iowa 
from k mart corp for 2375 million 
he converted furrsbishops into a limited partnership got it 
listed on the new york stock exchange and sold 11 million 
partnership units at 10 apiece the partnership has promised to 
pay a cash distribution of 130 a share this year 
furrsbishops is the nations second largest operator of 
cafeterias in the nation with 126 operating under the furrs name 
in 10 states and 26 under the bishops name in seven states 
he never earned a college degree but levenson became the 
president of a familyowned bank in carlsbad nm before being 
lured away by the burgeoning oil and gas industry 
just being able to walk along and pick up the crumbs the 
exxons of the world dropped and left would make you rich beyond 
your wildest dreams he said 
after buying and selling oil and gas leases during the late 
1970s his attention was drawn to the takeover attempts within the 
oil and gas industry by fellow west texan t boone pickens jr of 
amarillo 
levenson said his unsuccessful takeover runs at companies helped 
establish his credibility in the new york financial community 
enabling him to consummate the deal for furrsbishops 
for the second quarter this year the cafeteria company posted 
revenue of 709 million a more than 6 percent increase over the 
same quarter of 1987 furrsbishops had earnings of 2 million 
or 12 cents per share the partnerships first quarter in the black 
levenson predicts the companys revenue will total 273 million 
this year and that will post a profit 
he is confident hes in the right business and cites the 
cafeteria businesss lack of foriegn competition and relative 
isolation from costly hightech development 
cafeteria companies have survived the great depression they 
survived world war ii they survived the oil crunch and every boom 
and bust in the agriculture market he said
