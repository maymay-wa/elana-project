la moderna plaza del mercado de ponce que funciona 
aqui hace anos con serias dificultades economicas podria ser 
privatizada si el gobierno consigue inversionistas que se hagan 
cargo de la estructura reconocio hoy el secretario del 
departamento de comercio jorge r santiago 
el funcionario anuncio que la instalacion que cubre una manzana 
en el centro tradicional de ponce pierde un millon de dolares al 
ano en su operacion y reconocio que esta cifra debe ser absorbida 
por su agencia 
santiago dijo que la enorme estructura tiene amplios costos que 
elevan sus perdidas entre ellas un sistema de aire acondicionado 
central y modernas faciliadades de elevadores y escaleras 
electricas 
esto se planifico asi y hay que bregar con eso dijo 
santiago al hablar con periodistas cuando se le pregunto si las 
perdidas de la facilidad son producto de una mala planificacion 
santiago reconocio ademas que han fracasado en el pasado 
intentos de que companias privadas se encarguen de la operacion de 
la plaza donde operan decenas de pequenos comercios

eastern europe generally turned its 
back on the soviet union after the regions communist rulers bowed 
to popular revolt a year ago but trade and geography make the huge 
neighbor impossible to ignore 
new governments must balance the lingering emotion of revolution 
with economic and political reality 
they rejoice over the departure of soviet soldiers and the 
warsaw pacts impending demise but warily watch the floundering 
giant that supplies most of their oil and much of the electricity 
natural gas and timber and buys their mediocre consumer goods 
some east europeans wonder whether they are trading one form of 
domination for another 
it is well known that hungarys energy supplies are largely 
based on soviet raw materials laszlo lengyel an economist and 
political scientist wrote in the hungarian labor daily nepszava 
there is no need for tanks to maintain their influence in the 
region 
anger and distrust toward the soviet union are evident among 
ordinary people throughout the region 
in bulgaria once the kremlins closest ally in the soviet bloc 
only 30 percent of those polled favored close ties with moscow and 
75 percent were against celebrating nov 7 the soviet unions 
revolution day 
in countries where the study of russian was required for 
generations hardly anyone seems to understand it people are 
learning english and german instead 
statues of lenin have come down and places named for soviet 
heroes and their local cohorts have been rechristened 
andras hegedues of hungary the only living signer of the warsaw 
pact feels eastern europeans always must keep their powerful 
neighbor in mind 
even if the soviet union disintegrates russia its largest 
republic will remain a military power he said 
richard sumann director of czechoslovakias foreign investment 
agency said we must prepare for a situation where the soviet 
republics are independent or more independent 
poland czechoslovakia hungary and romania border the soviet 
union bulgaria is tied to the eastern slavs by language and 
custom 
the soviet union says the close ties of four decades were forged 
by more than soviet military might 
eastern europe is eastern europe and it will exist as eastern 
europe forever said oleg a grinevsky the soviet delegate to 
talks on reducing conventional weapons in europe we have 
historic economic and political ties and it is impossible to 
exclude them from everyday life 
in addition to most of its oil hungary gets about onethird of 
its electricity from the soviet union other eastern european 
countries are equally dependent on the soviets with little 
opportunity to change 
cheap and reliable energy supplies are disappearing along with 
soviet political domination beginning in 1991 the soviets will 
demand the market price in dollars for oil delivered to east 
european countries instead of the much lower prices by complex 
agreements within the comecon economic alliance 
several former soviet bloc nations sought oil supplies from 
iraq then the persian gulf crisis tightened supplies and drove 
prices up eastern european countries have pledged to obey the un 
sanctions on iraq 
soviet oil supplies to czechoslovakia this year will be at least 
18 million barrels short of the 116 million promised poland is 
expected to get only 70 million barrels nearly 20 million less 
than expected 
hungary and romania have reeived less electricity from the 
soviet union than anticipated 
the soviet economy is in such chaos that moscow could not even 
promise supplies of chemicals coal timber cellulose paper 
products and consumer goods said laszlo timar who oversees 
hungarys trade with the soviet union 
their problems and troubles are very big and we cannot rely 
on these problems being solved in a short period timar said 
germany is replacing the soviet union as hungarys main trade 
partner but the soviets are not likely to fall below second or 
third he said 
that is a matter of geography according to timar when hungary 
and the others begin paying the world price for soviet oil the 
soviets probably will prefer them as customers because pipelines 
exist to deliver it 
when hungary imposed stiff gasoline price increases in october 
taxi drivers and truckers blocked roads for a weekend virtually 
shutting down the country the government struck a deal with the 
protesters after threatening police or military action 
hegedues who was premier of hungary at the time of the 1956 
uprising against stalinism said he felt civil war was in the 
air during the price protests 
gasoline price increases in czechoslovakia set off two rounds of 
hoarding this year 
czechoslovak officials used looser rules within the soviet union 
to augment their oil supply they cut through the moscow 
bureaucracy to swap trucks buses bulldozers cranes and consumer 
goods for 35 million barrels of oil from the tyumen region of 
siberia 
timar said hungary was close to an agreement to trade its ikarus 
buses for oil 
the soviet union is a huge hungry market for machinery 
manufactured items and consumer goods produced in eastern europe 
beginning jan 1 that trade also will be conducted primarily in 
hard currency 
many of the products canno be sold in the west but east 
european countries need to earn convertible currency from them 
timar estimated hungary will lose 20 to 40 percent of its soviet 
business next year including half of its machinery market because 
soviet customers will be freer to buy from the west 
he predicted hungary will remain a major supplier to the soviet 
union because our products are well known there we think that 
slowly slowly our exports will be increased but they will be 
tragically cut back for the time being 
even though hungarians look west business will draw them east 
he said there is more personal interest in the west now but to 
make money they will travel to moscow

law enforcers say john j gottis indictment 
could mean a promotion for his son john whom they describe as a 
quickfisted barrelchested mafia prince with more brawn than 
brains 
because most of the top men in the gambino crime family are 
under indictment behind bars or both gotti could very well try 
to run the family through his son jules bonalovonta the fbis 
organized crime expert in new york said in an interview last 
month 
well nothing could please us more he said youre not 
talking about a brain surgeon 
bonalovonta said gotti recently elevated his 26yearold son 
known universally as junior to the rank of capo or captain 
the father was indicted wednesday on charges that he ordered the 
murder of his predecessor and could be held without bail until his 
trial 
born feb 14 1964 john a gotti was the first child of john j 
and victoria gotti after graduating from a military high school 
outside new york city in 1982 he apparently went right into the 
family business 
in 1985 the younger gotti allegedly slugged an offduty 
policeman who was telephoning for help to break up a fight at a 
queens diner authorities said 
in 1986 his drivers license was suspended after he ignored 
numerous traffic summonses authorities said 
in 1989 he was arrested for beating up three people outside a 
long island nightclub one of several such brawls in which he has 
been embroiled usually because one of his friends insulted or 
accosted a woman authorities said 
but gotti seemingly inherited his fathers talent for dodging 
prosecutorial bullets he was found innocent of the diner assault 
after a man he allegedly threatened with a knife claimed to have 
kept his eyes closed throughout the fight 
in the nightclub case a grand jury refused to indict gotti 
after witnesses said they could not identify any of the assailants 
the younger gotti describes himself as president of a brooklyn 
trucking company but investigators say he has his own crime 
crew involved in construction extortion auto theft 
loansharking and narcotics 
junior is treated with respect by the other mafia crew 
leaders an unidentified law enforcement source told the daily 
news a year ago they kiss him on the cheek like hes somebody 
special 
but junior takes orders too in a conversation recorded by 
investigators john gotti complained to his son that one of the 
sons friends had dropped gottis name in a telephone conversation 
about a criminal scheme 
gotti told his son the friend should desist or enter the 
hospital before you do anything he said you tell me first 
now make sure you see me tomorrow and ill tell you what i want 
you to do there 
all right the son replied 
the elder gottis lawyer bruce cutler describes junior as an 
honors student devoted son and health nut who has no social 
life because he works 14 hours a day as a totally legitimate 
businessman 
as for drugs cutler says young gotti wont even take an 
aspirin 
although he dresses as flamboyantly as his father the 
5foot9inch gotti is best known for his muscular physique the 
product of many hours in the weight rooms of various long island 
health clubs 
earlier this year he married kim albanese the daughter of a 
carpet installer with no apparent mob ties his father stayed away 
from the ceremony in a successful attempt to make sure journalists 
did the same 
two months later the new mrs gotti gave birth to a son john a 
jr john j gottis first grandson the family lives in a split 
level house in an expensive waterfront section of the long island 
suburb of massapequa 
whatever his shortcomings young gotti apparently has some sense 
of duty he helps out at his fathers annual fourth of july party 
for neighbors of the gotti crews queens clubhouse we dont do 
this for ourselves he told a reporter last year i got a house 
in the poconos id rather be at

federal investigators studying a huge 
highway pileup reduced the death count from 15 to 13 on wednesday 
and said it was possible a paper mill added to the dense fog blamed 
for the 83car wreck 
the confusion over the number of people killed in tuesdays 
crash on interstate 75 stemmed from problems identifying the 
victims said robert barlett who heads the national transportation 
safety board probe 
more than 50 people were injured in the pileup about 40 miles 
north of chattanooga federal investigators did not expect to find 
more victims barlett said at a news conference in nearby 
cleveland 
the pileup was caused by two separate chainreaction crashes in 
the same spot of the interstate investigators first estimated 75 
vehicles were involved and raised the count to 83 on wednesday 
the lead vehicle in the accident on the southbound side of the 
road apparently was a truck that had slowed down and was rearended 
by another truck said barlett a car apparently was the lead 
vehicle in the crash on the northbound side he said 
this was a most unusual fog very intense very difficult to 
see through said barlett he said a fog warning light had been 
turned on for southbound lanes but not for northbound traffic 
investigators planned to conduct more interviews thursday said 
barlett he said videotapes and computers would be used to help 
reconstruct the crash 
ntsb vice chairman susan coughlin said earlier that 
investigators would be looking at weather highway design driver 
response and environmental factors 
workers removed the last of the wreckage from the scene 
wednesday but the southbound lanes remained closed 
the rolling stretch of highway has a history of fogrelated 
accidents and is just north of the hiwassee river where bowater 
southern industries operates a paper mill east of the highway 
ms coughlin said investigators would talk to officials at 
bowater and other plants about industrys possible contribution to 
the fog 
but she emphasized that the query was just one part of the 
agencys investigation which she said would take six to nine 
months to complete 
to even speculate on anyones involvement at this point would 
simply be prejudicial ms coughlin said 
a 1978 study done by the university of tennessee after a similar 
accident involving 62 vehicles concluded that the primary source 
of fog appeared to be the bowater paper plant 
wayne davis a civil engineer who directed the study said 
wednesday that a paper plant by its nature contributes to fog 
problems 
a paper plant is a process where you take wood cook it and 
evaporate the water to make paper davis said a tremendous 
amount of water is converted into steam if you look around the 
nation you will always find the potential for dense fog around 
paper plants 
bowater spokeswoman astrid sheil said bowater considered that 
study flawed and that tuesday mornings weather conditions could 
have occurred whether the paper plant was nearby or not 
the weather conditions with the inversion from the hot air 
during the day time and the cold ground trapped the fog in said 
ms sheil that is well documented and thats a natural 
phenomenon that happens at this time of year especially in these 
areas 
at least 51 people were taken to hospitals after the crash and 
the tennessee emergency management agency treated others at the 
scene six people remained in critical condition wednesday night 
for three minutes after i stopped cars kept hitting each 
other virgil metts who escaped serious injury told the 
chattanooga newsfree press they kept driving into the fog at 60 
mph 
it was deadly silent a real eerie silence you couldnt see 
anything because of the fog and all you heard was exploding gas 
tanks 
george and margaret dawson were in the southbound lanes tuesday 
in a van packed with valuables for their retirement move from 
michigan to florida 
seconds later those valuables were scattered across the 
highway 
the whole back of the van is gone mrs dawson said but 
after seeing some of the other people we consider ourselves lucky 
what a way to start retirement

an alignment of the planets will 
interfere with the magellan spacecrafts ability to send pictures 
of venus back to earth for the next six weeks beginning sunday 
nasa says 
during late october and early november the sun was between 
venus and earth forcing a twoweek halt to magellans 744 million 
mission to use radar to map the surface of cloudshrouded venus 
this time venus itself gets in the way although mapping 
can continue said steve wall magellan experiment representative 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
because of the relative positions of earth and venus as they 
orbit the sun a straight line drawn from the spacecraft to the 
earth goes straight through venus for part of each day during the 
42day period wall said wednesday 
magellan has already shown venus is marked by quake faults 
gargantuan flows of solidified lava and countless volcanoes some 
of which may be erupting now

donald g whatley arrived in kuwait on aug 1 at 1030 pm he 
was at the iraqi border by around 1 am had a sandwich and was 
soon after in bed 
by 345 am the sky was saturated with helicopters missile 
fire was showering down over my head he never got a chance to 
relieve charlie amos another american oil worker who was to have 
headed home aug 2 
about 25 soldiers drove up to the oil rig site and they had 
guns amos said from his home in gilmer texas it was tense 
we were taken into custody at 530 am by 630 am we were in 
iraq 
among saddam husseins earliest captives both men by dawn had 
spent the first of many sleepless nights four months would pass 
before their vigil ended last week with the iraqi leaders decision 
to free his foreign guests 
it wasnt until tuesday that amos and whatley let down it 
wasnt until theyd finally collapsed into the arms of family 
gathered around the kitchen table or nestled deep into familiar 
blankets that they truly knew rest 
ive had four or five hours of sleep now and feel real fine 
whatley said from shreveport la but the willpowers gone all 
during it i wouldnt let the iraqis get into my head and break my 
mind now im exhausted 
whatley and amos spoke in whispers drained by their long 
journeys home from iraq numbed by the suddeness of saddams 
turnaround all at once the monotony was broken the fear shaken 
out of them like a bad dream 
its been such a long trip whatley 48 said before joining 
his wife for breakfast bacon and eggs like on just about any day 
amos said he was perhaps most stunned by an unexpected shock of 
sympathy for the guards left behind after praying day and night 
for his freedom it was actually rather emotional saying 
goodbye 
amos and whatley were separated at the baghdad hotel where they 
were taken shortly after the invasion 
during amos stay at a barren site near syria iraqi guards 
played pool with their captives and scared up a few old spy novels 
if he wanted a little exercise saddams men went along for the 
run 
it was a group activity they were actually friendly 
said amos 60 who with whatley works for santa fe drilling co 
they didnt like what they were doing any better than we did 
guards told amos who has been drilling oil in the middle east 
for the better part of 20 years that he was being held at an 
abandoned phosphates mine but he said haltingly it didnt look 
like that 
the site he said looked more like a military or chemical 
installation i tried not to think about it amos said before 
going to sleep for the first time since leaving baghdad for home 
sunday via germany 
whatley said his iraqi guards never called him a human 
shield but he like amos could guess at his part in saddams 
strategy by looking at the series of power plants and satellite 
centers that were his home over the weeks 
we were meant to deter attacks whatley said 
it was perhaps that threat of death that bound captor and 
captive the installation where we were wed have been the first 
to die whatley said 
while living in the shadow of that knowledge whatley had 
nothing to go on but the wife and family he holds so close hope 
is what i held on to said the oil worker who received two 
letters from his wife while in captivity 
doris whatley meanwhile heard nothing at all like relatives 
of so many of the 900 ushostages she spent 4 months as a human 
barometer their emotions have risen and receded depending on the 
threat of war 
sarrah amos slept on a couch in the living room bathed in the 
televisions bluish light and ear cocked to the telephone always 
somewhere near at hand 
i know emotionally our families had it worse than we did 
amos said we knew where our families were located and their 
conditions they knew nothing 
until sarrah amos and doris whatley awoke last thursday to the 
news theyd given up hoping for anytime soon their husbands were 
coming home 
it came as a surprise for us too said amos the father of 
three adult children it came as such as glorious surprise

the case of a badly beaten 3yearold boy who died 
after being dumped near a bayfront home has generated new alarm 
about floridas childprotection system 
the state passed childabuse reforms and boosted spending after 
last years widely publicized death of 2yearold bradley mcgee 
who was under state supervision but was returned home in spite of 
reports of abuse he died from being dunked repeatedly into a 
toilet because he had soiled his pants 
four state social services workers were charged in that case 
one was convicted of felony child abuse for negligence and placed 
on three years probation 
the latest case involved a boy who was returned to his mothers 
custody after she left him with a sitter for three months 
chief dade juvenile judge william gladstone summoned state 
social services officials to a hearing friday to find out what 
happened to the boy initially known as baby lollipops 
he was told of a lack of training and crushing caseloads the 
boys caseworker had 50 children compared with a national standard 
of 12 per childprotection caseworker 
this case is my failure too gladstone said his eyes 
tearing we all failed somehow this child was killed and he 
was killed by every person in this state 
baby lollipops was found nov 2 beside a wall around a bayfront 
miami beach home the extensive injuries and severe neglect 
including a daysold diaper held with packing tape were 
incomprehensible said police detective tom hoolahan 
before the boys identity was determined officers named the 
victim after the lollipops on his tshirt 
dade countys medical examiner dr joseph davis said monday it 
was the worst case of child abuse he has ever seen in 34 years in 
the office 
the boys mother and her female lover were arrested dec 5 on 
firstdegree murder charges 
police said the mother ana marie cardona admitted she and 
girlfriend olivia gonzalez 24 left the boy in a yard in an 
upscale neighborhood hoping he would be found by a wealthy family 
they fled with two other children to the orlando area 
the boy wasnt found for four days 
it turned out the boy was lazaro figueroa who with his sister 
had been placed under state supervision two years earlier that was 
after their mother left them with a baby sitter and didnt return 
for three months authorities said lazaros father was a drug 
dealer killed four weeks before his birth 
the children were returned to ms cardona now 29 because there 
was no evidence of abuse the state health and rehabilitative 
services department said however ms cardona and her three 
children the department wasnt aware of the third subsequently 
moved and the agency lost track 
the caseworker didnt report ms cardonas disappearance to the 
court for four months 
the caseworker has not been charged 
department spokesman steve konicki said criticism of the 
caseworker was unfair because at the time she was hired the state 
had no training for childprotection workers the worker wasnt 
aware at the time the mother moved that she should go to court and 
seek a police pickup order 
the caseworker tried diligently on her own to locate the family 
konicki said but simply hadnt been properly trained she had been 
since he said 
this is a case that proves why we need what we have now 
konicki said 
there also have been reforms in the departments background 
checks computerization of records and tightening of standards on 
separating children from abusive parents 
state rep mike abrams a legislative leader on childrens 
issues said the case could bring more reforms 
abrams said caseworkers are still underpaid undertrained 
overwhelmed by their caseload starting pay for workers is 
16000 to 20000 a year and 42 percent quit in their first year 
jack levine executive director of the advocacy group center for 
children and youth said the wonder is there arent more such 
tragedies 
the only childrens program in florida without a waiting list 
is the morgue levine said

govelect pete wilson is giving no 
clues about who hell pick as his successor in the us senate the 
possibilities include sonny bono peter ueberroth and national 
security council aide condoleezza rice 
we neither confirm nor deny any names the senator is not 
talking about it wilson spokesman bill livingstone said 
theres no set timetable on when hes going to make a 
decision livingstone added he said wilsons first priority is 
preparing the budget message he will deliver three days after 
taking office and that a senate successor probably wont be named 
for several more weeks 
wilsons selection of his successor could be one of his toughest 
political decisions the california republican party is sharply 
divided between antiabortion and prochoice advocates and between 
conservatives and moderates on fiscal and environmental issues 
wilson who narrowly won the gubernatorial election last month 
must resign his senate seat before taking his oath of office jan 
7 
under state law his appointee will assume wilsons us senate 
seat without any confirmation until californias next general 
election in 1992 when the new senator must stand election for what 
then will be the remaining two years on wilsons term 
californias senior senator democrat alan cranston has 
announced he will retire when his term ends in 1992 so both senate 
seats will be on the same ballot since the winner of cranstons 
seat gets a full sixyear term it is viewed as the greater prize 
but so far most potential candidates in both parties are waiting 
for wilsons appointment before committing themselves to either 
race 
wilson and his staff have refused comment on all speculation 
except to confirm when a rumored contender has asked to be 
eliminated from consideration so far three people have done so 
including us trade representative carla hills 
bono the singerturnedmayor of palm springs has said 
repeatedly that he is interested in running it is not clear 
whether republican power brokers take him seriously but he has 
wide name recognition and presumably could tap wealthy 
entertainment interests for campaign contributions 
ueberroth the former baseball commissioner who made millions in 
the travel agency business has been considered a major contender 
for public office since he organized the 1984 olympics in los 
angeles and turned the games into a major moneymaker 
he has been linked most commonly to running for the us senate 
and in 1986 and 1988 was seen as a possible candidate by some 
republicans but he was also talked about as a successor to 
retiring gov george deukmejian 
other rumored prospects include rice a national security 
council adviser who is the highest ranking black woman in president 
bushs administration us reps tom campbell david dreier jerry 
lewis and robert dornan state sens marian bergeson and ken maddy 
and orange county supervisor gaddi vazquez one of californias 
highest ranking hispanic republicans 
wilson has said he is looking for someone who agrees with his 
moderate gop views 
ill try to find someone who s as nearly like myself as 
possible wilson said but he hasnt commented on what weight he 
would give to which of his political priorities which include a 
prochoice abortion stand sympathy with environmental causes and 
conservative stands on the death penalty 
livingstone says the only people wilson is confiding in are his 
wife gayle and his longtime chief of staff bob white they both 
refuse to comment 
theres no structure like you have in a judicial selection 
where you have an advisory group livingstone said there is no 
frontrunner that i know of the eventual nominee may not even be 
on that list

budget director richard g darman whose tax 
and budget maneuvering drew criticism from both parties is again 
in the eye of a policy storm as he wages an unusual battle against 
a junior colleague 
as he works on what some associates say may be his final budget 
darman seems to be losing the contest 
the inveterate gamesman and prankster who once donned a gorilla 
suit to delight president bush is finding little to clown about 
these days in his snit with james p pinkerton bushs deputy 
assistant for policy planning 
darmans decision to go after a junior aide has baffled other 
senior administration officials and conservatives many of whom 
still blame darman for bushs shift on taxes are using the flap as 
ammunition in a new getdarman effort 
will the director of the office of management and budget now 
working on the presidents budget for fiscal 1992 survive the 
latest onslaught many insiders say they expect him to leave soon 
after the new budget proposal goes to congress in early february 
furthermore what prompted darmans scorn pinkertons proposal 
for a range of selfhelp programs for the poor seems to be 
finding support from bush the man who counts in fact the 
president may incorporate some of them in his state of the union 
address in january 
it all began last month when darman gave a speech attacking the 
empowerment agenda that pinkerton prepared for bushs 
consideration the package includes programs like tenant ownership 
of public housing and tax breaks for businesses that locate in 
inner cities 
darman mocked the plan as too pretentious and mere 
sloganeering and said it was a throwback to ideas that failed 
in the 1960s war on poverty 
the budget director also took a slap at the phrase pinkerton 
chose to describe the programs new paradigm or new model 
darman called that neoneoism and also neonewtism a 
stab at house gop whip newt gingrich rga an outspoken supporter 
of the concept 
just as darman touched off democratic criticism last winter by 
comparing the federal budget to a cookie monster and a pac 
man that gobbles up resources his mocking attack on pinkertons 
work generated heat among conservatives 
there are a lot of phrases going around like empowerment and 
new paradigm the fact is they all come down to that fundamental 
approach of not having a movement toward an overall centralized 
process said white house chief of staff john sununu 
gingrich called for darmans resignation accusing him of an 
assault on members of his own party 
vice president dan quayle housing secretary jack kemp and 
william bennett president bushs choice to be the new republican 
national committee chairman also quickly made their support known 
for an empowerment agenda 
quayle told a gathering of gop governors there is nothing 
wrong with a battle of ideas but once the president decides it 
will not be republicans vs republicans but republicans vs 
democrats 
bush himself championed some of pinkertons new paradigm 
proposals in a speech last spring 
and at a rose garden ceremony last week the president praised 
the concept anew calling this idea of empowering people not 
bureaucracies a cornerstone of his effort to reduce the heavy 
hand of government 
neither darman nor anyone at the budget office would comment on 
the dispute despite repeated attempts to elicit his views 
pinkerton isnt eager to discuss the disagreement either but he 
said im just happy the ideas are getting a thorough 
discussion 
pinkerton 32 who was bushs chief issues researcher during the 
1988 campaign says he knows some people find new paradigm 
something of a mouthful as the president and other administration 
officials put forth their agenda theyll use their own 
rhetoric he added 
the 48yearold darman who served in six different agencies 
under three republican presidents before getting one of his own to 
head remains the white house aide conservatives love to hate 
his work in negotiating the 500 billion fiveyear package of 
tax increases and spending cuts angered many republicans who saw it 
as a big electionyear liability 
many members of congress of both parties accused darman and 
sununu of being heavyhanded and abrasive in negotiating for the 
president 
gary bass director of omb watch a public policy group of 
former budget officials that monitors the agencys performance 
said darman has justly earned a reputation for brilliance in 
developing schemes hes always five steps ahead of everyone 
else 
but he is also arrogant and i think people on capitol hill 
resent that bass added 
he said the real issue in the darmanpinkerton dustup has 
little to do with pinkerton but is a battle to see who controls 
the administrations agenda whether conservatives like kemp 
bennett and gingrich or more establishmentoriented politicians 
like darman

at 99 the father of public relations 
is still promoting clients and himself 
edward bernays showed signs of outlasting his listeners tuesday 
as he made a whirlwind tour of the university of massachusetts 
at 99 i work 12 hours a day just as i did before and if a 
client comes in we make no bones about it he pays 1000 an 
hour for advice bernays said during three hours of gab about his 
career promoting such clients as sigmund freud enrico caruso 
vaslav nijinsky calvin coolidge and other presidents 
in 1923 bernays taught the first college course in public 
relations at new york university his 1923 book crystallizing 
public opinion is considered the bible of the business 
bernays who lives in cambridge dismissed retirement at age 65 
as a cockeyed idea he said his theory that work keeps him 
young was supported during a doctors visit at 94 when tests 
showed he had the body of a 62yearold 
he made the 16 tests again when i was 95 and i found i was 
61 bernays said 
colleagues marvel at his ability to captivate the public and his 
mastery of getting clients stories into newsprint and onto 
broadcasting airwaves 
he is absolutely indefatigable said scott m cutlip dean 
emeritus at the university of georgia and coauthor of a widely 
used public relations text 
cutlip credited bernays with establishing twoway communication 
between clients and news media rather than simply distributing 
news releases or waiting for reporters to come to the client 
another of his principles involves staging the kind of 
demonstrations that have since become the norm worldwide 
actions speak louder than words bernays said giving as an 
example his efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry decades ago 
to make it acceptable for women to smoke in public 
he said he helped engineer the change in attitudes with the help 
of debutante friends who lit cigarettes as socalled torches of 
freedom during easter day parades 
about 30 years later when the surgeon general revealed the 
hazards of smoking bernays said he campaigned to get tobacco 
advertising off the airwaves in atonement 
his contact with freud a maternal uncle resulted in the 
american publication of introductory lectures in 
psychoanalysis which previously had been published only in 
europe 
and there were efforts to revamp coolidges sourpuss image 
trying to erase the image created by the frequent sarcastic 
comment that calvin coolidge was weaned on a pickle bernays 
said he promoted a white house breakfast visit by a group of 
actors who were considered slightly raffish in those days 
newspapers all over the country carried the story 
i recall the new york times they had a story that had about 
five subheads and the fourth headline in the new york times 
was president nearly laughed bernays said

havent you ever wished somebody would invent a 
doohickey that fastens on the bathtub and holds your book while you 
wash 
how about a gadget that opens and closes toilet lids no hands 
or a box that creates your own subliminal advertising 
injecting microsecondlong messages into your tv which could help 
you kick a cigarette or other drug habit 
well they exist on display at torontos new product store a 
home for the mad scientist and crazy inventor 
the business was founded a year ago by brian gray his brother 
joseph and ed zwolinski 
brian gray was a frustrated inventor says zwolinski who 
manages the place he had a line of hardware products a radon 
gas detector a disco music light box custom construction hard 
hats and was frustrated by all the doors closed to him being 
told to buzz off 
he says the biggest problem for inventors is skepticism 
its so hard to get attention you really have to have a lot 
of clout behind you one person alone doesnt have that 
the new products store cant offer much in the way of clout but 
it can offer exposure both in shelf space in the store and via the 
publicity it has generated 
it also offers professional evaluation from its board of 
engineers and lawyers distribution leads contacts with retailers 
and a sympathetic ear 
the typical inventor usually follows a path like this he gets 
an idea becomes obsessed with it creates a product and produces 
it at that point the honeymoon is over because he then has to 
sell it 
thats where we come in says zwolinski we offer them a 
start in the market there is no way an inventor can know how good 
his product is without public exposure 
the store is not very large but it is located in one of 
torontos most fashionable shopping districts the store manager 
can judge customer response to products even browser response 
robert dubeck invented the device for readerbathers an 
obsession that has consumed nine years of his life 
no one thought this was going to go says dubeck everyone 
wanted me to give up the dream just keep working i was put down 
by friends and family they basically said work for a living dont 
come up with a dream to better yourself 
the secret is getting the big stores and chains to buy and stock 
the item and according to dubeck buyers in these recessionary 
times are not given to speculating on unproven products 
our main concern is marketing publicity and distribution 
says zwolinski were publishing a distribution catalog in 
december sending it to 10000 distributors in canada and the 
united states 
in it potential customers will find such items as the leisure 
reader for the bathtub a lapel or blouse pin for holding 
eyeglasses the bathroom butler that opens and closes toilet lids 
erase protection tabs for computer disks or the box that creates 
those microsecond positive affirmation messages for your tv as a 
means of changing behavior 
some of the stuff zwolinski admits is novelty such as the 
floating toilet bowl posters but a lot of it is genuinely 
practical 
about 40 percent of the inventors represented in the store are 
american 
its really good working with americans because they are more 
risk oriented and more willing to take a chance says zwolinski

fiftyfive pilot whales beached 
themselves near the kennedy family compound tuesday and rescuers 
managed to get fewer than 10 headed out to sea before deciding to 
kill many of he mammals to end their suffering 
volunteers struggled throughout the day to save the creatures 
most of them mothers and calves with little success 
they splashed the beached whales with water and soothed them 
with wet towels the whales up to 20 feet long and 3000 pounds 
were listless with eyes closed making squeaking and whistling 
sounds and occasionally twitching 
im offering a little comfort said one volunteer karen 
kelly they respond to your touch and your voice they are scared 
and they dont know whats going on 
say a prayer she added 
by midnight two whales had been moved to an aquarium eight or 
nine had been seen swimming away and the rest were either drowning 
as the tide rose or being injected with a lethal chemical the 
volunteers were sent home and the wouldbe rescuers expected all 
the whales to be dead by morning either from drowning or the 
lethal injections 
scientists decided on euthanasia becuase the airbreathing 
animals were too weak to swim away on the rising tide and drowned 
as they submerged the whales suffering was worsened because 
without being immersed in cooling water their body temperatures 
rose 
experts were unable to explain why the whales beached 
themselves 
about 100 volunteers endured high wind and 35degree 
temperatures in the futile effort to save the whales they used 
stretchers to return nine of the whales to open water but one was 
believed to have beached itself again 
the whales got stuck in shallow pools at low tide at squaw 
island said ian mcmillan associate director of the cape cod 
aquarium 
on the beach a few floodlights and car headlights illuminated 
the moonless night ruben baker a volunteer said the subfreezing 
temperatures didnt spoil his enthusiasm for the task 
you get a really neat feeling from the whales baker said 
these whales could pick you up and throw you through the air but 
it feels like they know were trying to help them 
theyre sort of flopping around said roger cadrin a 
lieutenant with the hyannis fire department who helped free a few 
of the animals we named ours betsy and there was bob scraps a 
few others when we let them go they were all pointing in the same 
direction they were all anxious to go they were happy to get 
moving 
two freed whales have radio transmitters attached to their tails 
and were followed by marine experts in an inflatable boat they 
also have luminescent tags attached to their fins so they can be 
seen at night 
mcmillan said it was unusual for whales to beach on the southern 
side of cape cod 
historically its been on the other side he said there 
are certain areas where they seem to strand time and time again 
dave wiley of the international wildlife coalition which 
assisted in the rescue said the test for the freed whales was 
whether they remain at sea or beach themselves again 
the rescue effort was the first test of a 600person volunteer 
whale rescue program set up by the new england aquarium two years 
ago mcmillan said 
it was the first mass beaching in the area since 70 pilot 
whales a small type of whale beached at several spots four years 
ago three young whales that beached on the cape three years ago 
were rescued and returned to the sea 
some scientists speculate that the beachings occur when the pod 
or group of whales follows a sick leader ashore or that the 
mammals become disoriented by magnetic variations along geological 
faults 
mcmillan said aquarium scientists are working on a theory that 
high tides can cause beachings planetary alignments last week 
caused the highest tides in 60 years 
whales may use current flows to navigate and they may get 
confused by a change in the flow that you only see in very high 
tides mcmillan said 
whales give out heat in only three places the dorsal fin the 
tail and around the flippers the system is designed to conserve 
body heat in the water so when they come onto land the whales cook 
inside 
some of their extremities could be freezing because of the 
cold weather and at they same time they overheat internally 
mcmillan said when this happens their body chemistry goes beyond 
any limits that are considered treatable or recoverable

the communist party used to advertise itself as 
the conscience of the nation by the time andrei sakharov died 
that title was more commonly accorded to him 
since the physicist and political activists death a year ago 
this friday friends and colleagues in the human rights movement 
have battled for sakharovs cause but they say no one has emerged 
to take his place 
the conscience of the nation that has remained a vacant 
position said sergei grigoryants editor of the unofficial 
journal glasnost and one of many former political prisoners who 
sakharov pressured the government to free 
since sakharov died of heart failure at age 68 public esteem 
has continued to climb for the man who helped invent the soviet 
hydrogen bomb and later won the nobel peace prize 
he campaigned tirelessly for justice for stalins victims 
nuclear disarmament freedom of emigration and above all democracy 
in a poll published last week by the moscow news soviets were 
asked which of the following names will have great meaning for 
the people of the ussr in the year 2000 jesus christ lenin 
stalin gorbachev and sakharov 
sakharov finished second to jesus but well ahead of lenin 
stalin and president mikhail s gorbachev 
moscow news a reformist weekly also published an unusual 
confession admitting that it had shortened and corrected 
effectively censored articles by sakharov as recently as 1988 
if we had listened to him our road to the truth would have 
been shorter and less tortured but we shortened and corrected him 
we did not listen or pretended that we did not hear the 
newspaper said 
i dont know whether he forgave us but we cannot forgive 
ourselves it said 
a decade ago sakharov was denounced in the official press as an 
utterly ignorant person and banished to the industrial city of 
gorky for criticizing the soviet invasion of afghanistan he spent 
seven years in internal exile before being recalled to moscow by 
gorbachev in december 1986 
soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan last year that war now 
is viewed by soviets as a national disaster 
sakharovs former apartment in gorky is being turned into a 
museum his memoirs are being serialized by znamya a literary 
journal with a circulation of 1 million 
and both his grave in southwest moscow and his apartment 
building on the citys ring road have become unofficial shrines 
decorated daily with flowers by visitors 
sakharovs name frequently serves as a rallying cry for 
reformers including boris yeltsin president of the russian 
republic and moscow mayor gavril popov his comrades in the 
national legislature 
but idolatry of sakharov annoys his widow yelena bonner 
why are we so inclined to create cults out of sakharov 
out of me the magazine ogonyok quoted her as saying last month 
i think it is absolutely unbearable when people who are trying 
to develop a democratic consciousness so easily create a cult o 
new heroes she added 
bonner was to commemorate sakharovs death at a memorial concert 
today in strasbourg france she was then to fly to new york where 
the second volume of his memoirs moscow and beyond is to be 
published in january 
in moscow sakharovs friends and colleagues said they were 
dismayed that some organizations and political movements have taken 
his name without embracing his ideals 
at least one of the groups the sakharov union of democratic 
forces which recently called for a national state of emergency 
is far from his political views said larisa bogoraz a human 
rights campaigner and widow of dissident anatoly marchenko 
grigoryants ms bogoraz and others said they believed sakharov 
would be embarrassed and upset at becoming a largerthanlife 
character a symbol freely appropriated by politicians and 
movements of varying stripes 
but they also said he would be pleased by some events of the 
past year 
at the time of his death sakharov was pushing for elimination 
of article 6 of the soviet constitution which accorded the 
communist party a leading role in society 
less than four months later the party agreed to surrender its 
constitutional monopoly on power 
sakharovs proposed draft of a new constitution was rejected by 
the communist party central committee little more than a year ago 
today his vision of truly sovereign republics joining in a 
voluntary union is widely embraced as the only way to hold the 
country together 
only now are people beginning to realize how right he was on 
the nationalities question and many other issues ms bogoraz 
said

president bush may have a hard time saying 
anything reassuring about the state of the union next month after 
all its hard to be upbeat about the twin threats of war and 
recession 
finding applause lines for an audience sure to be anxious and 
skeptical is bound to present new challenges to the presidents 
speech writers who havent won many plaudits lately 
even so white house advisers are working on a series of ideas 
new policy initiatives and lofty language for bushs second formal 
address to a joint session of congress on the nations wellbeing 
in what may be a portent of rocky times ahead chief of staff 
john h sununu usurped a traditional prerogative of the house 
speaker tuesday by announcing the date of the spech himself jan 
29 
thats two weeks after the united nations security councils 
deadline for iraq to withdraw from kuwait or face military action 
the president has said military action will not necessarily be 
launched on jan 15 if saddam hussein continues to defy the un 
resolutions but by state of the union time the whole world should 
know which side blinked first 
congress which is usually sluggish when it reconvenes after the 
holidays to hear the presidents annual address is sure to be wide 
awake and combative this year particularly if bush has taken 
military action without first getting its consent 
beyond the issue of whether the nation will be at war by late 
january is the current sharp economic downturn already pronounced 
a recession by many private economists 
less than a week after bush gives his state of the union 
address he must submit his budget for fiscal 1992 
the economic downturn will make it even harder to meet new 
deficitreduction targets approved by congress as part of octobers 
500 billion fiveyear package of tax increases and spending cuts 
furthermore the desert shield military operation threatens to 
cost tens of billions of dollars in additional federal spending 
the breakdown of international trade talks in geneva this week 
over the issue of farm subsidies which the united states wants to 
eliminate but europe doesnt could take another big bite out of 
federal spending 
under a newly enacted trade retaliation provision the 
administration must boost spending on us export subsidies by 1 
billion a year if no international agreement is reached to cut such 
subsidies 
that all adds up to a pretty bleak budget outlook 
white house aides said they havent started drafting a state of 
the union message although there are plenty of suggestions on what 
it should include 
but dont look for much soaring language this time john kennedy 
had his new frontier lyndon johnson had his great society 
richard nixon his silent majority and ronald reagan talked of 
morning in america 
even bush promised a kinder and gentler nation in his 
campaign and spoke of the winds of change in his inaugural 
address 
but so far about the only new catchphrase being tossed about 
is the new paradigm 
that term has been trumpeted by bushs deputy assistant for 
policy planning james p pinkerton who says it means a new model 
or a new way of looking at an old problem 
it includes a range of selfhelp programs for the poor 
including tenant ownership of public housing and tax incentives for 
businesses that locate in inner cities 
it has won the backing of many conservatives if not budget 
director richard darman who has ridiculed the phrase as mere 
sloganeering and neoneoism 
what does darman suggest instead how about new balance he 
offered in a recent speech although he quickly added i should 
make clear that there is absolutely no threat of a new balance 
slogan sweeping the nation 
for his part pinkerton said he knows that new paradigm may 
seem a bit unwieldy but he said he likes it anyway ill 
probably stick with it even if nobody else does he said 
aides said they expect bush to propose major changes in bank 
regulation and limits on congressional terms in his speech 
but with so many uncertainties remaining in the persian gulf 
they concede that domestic initiatives could easily be 
overshadowed

sen alan cranstons banking aide contends she 
was acting on her own when she took steps that helped savings and 
loan owner charles h keating jr in his disputes with federal 
regulators 
among the actions for which carolyn jordan took responsibility 
was placing a statement in the congressional record in cranstons 
name that supported keatings position in a lawsuit challenging 
federal regulators 
but jordan testifying before the senate ethics committee on 
tuesday said repeatedly that she could not recall events or 
conversations she had on behalf of keatings lincoln savings and 
loan association in irvine calif 
her assertions drew skeptical comments from some members of the 
ethics panel and her faulty recall prompted demands for clearer 
answers 
the witness obviously has very good recollection about some 
things and very poor recollection about others said sen warren 
rudman of new hampshire the ranking republican on the ethics 
panel i think weve got to guard against just getting totally 
meaningless answers 
jordan testified in the 16th day of hearings into the socalled 
keating five case 
the committee planned to begin closeddoor questioning today of 
james grogan keatings former lobbyist and top aide who is being 
given immunity from prosecution based on his testimony 
chairman howell heflin dala said the panel would announce 
later when it would meet in public again committee sources said 
grogan may not appear in public until early january 
cranston dcalif is one offfive senators under investigation 
by the ethics panel they face allegations of improperly 
intervening with regulators on behalf of keating a major financial 
contributor who with associates provided 13 million for the 
campaigns and causes of the five senators 
the others are sens john mccain rariz dennis deconcini 
dariz john glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich 
jordan denied applying pressure on staff members at the federal 
home loan bank board in may 1988 to ease a decision tightening 
regulatory control on keatings troubled thrift 
she said cranston did not ask her to make the call although she 
described it in a memo to him afterward she said the impetus came 
from keatings lobbyist james grogan who called her immediately 
after the bank board met to complain about its action 
federal regulator william k black testified last week that the 
reversal by the bank board two weeks later delayed the ultimate 
seizure and permitted lincoln to sell more junk bonds in which 
investors lost millions of dollars when the thrift collapsed 
the government seized lincoln on april 14 1989 and the cost to 
taxpayers is expected to exceed 2 billion 
jordan also asserted she was acting on her own when a prepared 
statement in cranstons name was placed in the congressional record 
on march 27 1987 
her assertion that cranston didnt know of the statement in his 
own name provoked skeptical comments by rudman and sen jesse 
helms rnc another panel member 
now what is the story did he approve that going in the 
record helms asked 
no he did not jordan replied 
helms so just staff members put it in without his 
knowledge 
jordan that is correct 
the statement in cranstons name directly contradicted a 
statement the day before by william proxmire dwis then the 
chairman of the senate banking committee 
proxmire had agreed to drop proposed amendments from 
savingsandloan legislation specifically giving the bank board 
authority to limit direct investments but had inserted in the 
congressional record a statement saying it was congress intent 
that the board already had that power 
the statement published the next day under cranstons name said 
the board did not have that authority over statechartered 
institutions such as lincoln that was in line with the position 
keating was taking in a suit against the bank board

wheat farmers have seen prices drop sharply 
from a year or two ago and a new supplyanddemand report by the 
agriculture department doesnt find much improvement in sight 
overall 199091 global wheat production forecasts increased 
from a month ago with gains in canada china and mexico more than 
offsetting reduced prospects in brazil the european community and 
south africa 
the projected average us market price was reduced 5 cents a 
bushel from november to a range of 250 to 270 for the marketing 
year that began on june 1 in the previous two years the farm 
price of wheat was 372 per bushel 
according to the report issued tuesday exports are still 
expected to be 1075 billion bushels in 199091 down from 1233 
billion last year 
the us wheat stockpile carried over next june 1 into the new 
harvest and marketing year was projected at 937 million bushels 
down slightly from the november outlook but still much larger than 
the 536 million bushels carried forward last june 1 
looking at corn and other coarse grains the report showed 
global production in 199091 and the yearending stockpile to be up 
slightly from last month 
although prolonged dry conditions have cut corn planting in 
south africa gains in the ec canada and turkey are more than 
offsetting the report said the smaller crop likely will 
eliminate corn exports by south africa during their 199091 
marketing year 
as with wheat farmers harvested a bumper corn crop this year 
however unlike wheat total corn use is expected to exceed output 
meaning some reduction in the stockpile during the 199091 
marketing year that began on sept 1 
consequently corn prices at the farm are projected to average 
220 to 250 per bushel this season compared with 236 in 
198990 
the corn stockpile next sept 1 was projected at 1236 billion 
bushels down from 1344 billion estimated this sept 1 
world oilseed production including us soybeans also is 
forecast at a record level in 199091 up 2 percent from last year 
the us soybean carryover next sept 1 was projected at 265 
million bushels up 10 million from the november forecast the 
soybean inventory this sept 1 was 239 million bushels 
farm prices of soybeans were projected to average 525 to 625 
per bushel in 199091 down 10 cents on both ends of the range from 
november last season soybeans averaged 570 per bushel nationally 
at the farm

the influx of soviet jewish immigrants is 
beginning to hit israelis in their paychecks and is showing signs 
of straining prime minister yitzhak shamirs fragile coalition 
government 
while public support remains generally high the sheer magnitude 
of the task ahead housing employing and educating 1000 
newcomers a day is becoming increasingly daunting 
the impact of the immigration flood 150000 so far this year 
an estimated 1 million by the end of 1992 is now felt throughout 
this country of about 44 million people 
some people are voicing doubts about whether israel can take the 
strain 
there is an atmosphere of panic among the politicians 
absorbing an immigration wave of the scope we are now facing is 
a mission beyond israels capability warned the respected 
haaretz newspaper 
but to do anything to stem the flow would negate israels very 
reason for existing as haaretz pointed out this is a zionist 
state taking in jews is its aim and essence so nobody dares to 
say it out loud 
the 1991 state budget for the first time allocates more to 
immigrant absorption than to defense the military lost its fight 
for a budget increase and had to cancel an order for two 
germanbuilt submarines 
the budget is also stretching israelis ability to pay 
last month the cabinet approved a hike in the valueadded tax 
a rough equivalent of a sales tax from 16 percent to 18 percent 
it also endorsed an immigration tax a 5 percent income tax 
levy for the next three years 
an attempt to lower the minimum wage and tax pensions was 
thwarted by the histadrut the trade union federation which held a 
twoday general strike last month 
on tuesday two government ministers traded accusations on 
television over immigration 
absorption minister yitzhak peretz whose ministry sees to the 
needs of immigrants claimed that at a meeting sunday of the 
cabinet immigration committee chairman ariel sharon behaved like 
a dictator 
he roughly attacked the director general of my ministry he 
was banging his fist with full force on the table and shouting 
peretz complained 
sharon the toughtalking former general who heads the housing 
ministry retorted angrily in a separate interview 
peretz a rabbi supported by the orthodox shas faction in the 
coalition tacitly threatened to bring down the government over 
sharons behavior 
interviewed separately sharon implied that peretzs ministry 
wasnt pulling its weight 
the housing ministry works 18 hours a day and the absorption 
ministry has to work too he said when i hold meetings at 
midnight is that dictatorship when i in my capacity as the head 
of the coordinating committee demand that a ministry submit a 
certain plan is that dictatorship 
sharon also alluded to another issue that is bedeviling the 
immigration flow peretzs controversial claim that up to 30 
percent of the immigrants are not jewish and therefore not entitled 
to automatic entry into israel 
sharon was also reported to have chewed out the army for 
demanding payment for putting up immigrants at its bases saying it 
was their job to follow orders not first ask for payment 
nevertheless the israeli public remains broadly upbeat schools 
proudly display what they are doing for the immigrants radio 
stations run programs designed to bring newcomers and oldtimers 
together it is a social must for wellestablished families to 
adopt an immigrant family 
the immigration wave is also a morale boost at a time when the 
persian gulf crisis has forced the distribution of gas masks and 
the palestinian uprising in the occupied territories enters its 
fourth year looking more violent than ever 
absorption ministry officials recently returned to work after a 
twoweek strike over pay and hours and found long lines of 
immigrants outside their offices many immigrants had arrived 
before dawn and scuffles broke out 
the strike had deprived many of their only income the 
government stipend of 9000 a year for a family of three

meals are being shipped by the millions but 
rivets are scarce new uniforms and desert boots are in production 
and in demand 
four months after president bush ordered us troops to the 
persian gulf sustaining the stillgrowing deployment is proving to 
be an extremely complex and costly endeavor 
more than 12 billion has been spent on food clothing and 
medical supplies alone never mind the millions more on weapons 
parts and other materiel needed for the desert deployment 
the operation is providing at least a temporary boom to many 
suppliers who were expecting less military business this year 
instead of closing plants or cutting shifts several food and 
clothing suppliers are adding workers or offering overtime to meet 
pentagon pleas for quick delivery 
a sampling of the orders 
113 million meals including 744 million meals readytoeat 
the basic field ration 108 new entrees including pot roast and 
beef sukiyaki and 14 million new lunch bucket entrees to add 
chili and macaroni and cheese to the menu 
48 million pounds of sugar 32 million pounds of flour and 
14 million pounds of coffee contracts worth a combined 56 
million 
547000 sundry packs at a cost of 194 million to supply the 
troops with razors shaving cream toothpaste and the like 
15 million tubes of lip balm costing 278000 
796008 pairs of desert and hot weather boots a 316 million 
deal 
379375 cans of foot powder 165000 pairs of sunglasses 
371000 wool sweaters and 33 million desert camouflage uniforms 
just one of several bigticket clothing buys 
more than 600000 armorpiercing rounds for the armys bradley 
fighting vehicles a contract worth 143 million to gencorps 
aerojet ordnance division 
and buying is just half the task the pentagon has to get the 
goods 7000 miles to saudi arabia and other mideast points as it 
masses a 60day or better supply cushion 
the scope of the supply effort is giving pause to some military 
planners who worry the inevitability of sustainment problems will 
be used to advance arguments for early use of force if iraqi 
president saddam hussein ignores a jan 15 deadline to end his 
occupation of kuwait 
the operation is also expensive and getting more costly by the 
week as stocks now filling desert shield requisitions run low 
forcing the pentagon to issue new contracts 
so far there have been only isolated shortages officials say 
roughly 90 percent of parts orders are being filled from 
existing stocks according to defense department figures scarce 
items rushordered from suppliers include rivets electrical cable 
and strapping used to hold down pallets on military transport 
planes 
most orders are shipped by sea but if a unit in the mideast 
needs something in a hurry it can turn to desert express an 
emergency nextday delivery service the air force is running to 
saudi arabia from two us bases 
to date desert express cargo has mostly been parts in short 
supply for tanks and planes particularly vietnamera f4g wild 
weasel antiradar jets 
the overall air leg of the supply line operated by the military 
airlift command has made nearly 7000 missions to the mideast 
since august carrying more than 200000 passengers and 480 million 
pounds of cargo the navys sealift command has delivered 28 
billion pounds of dry cargo and nearly 6 billion pounds of fuel 
as it orders more food the pentagon is trying to spice up the 
menu as a morale booster 
that initiative meant a 446 million contract to george a 
hormel and co for sukiyaki pot roast spaghetti lasagna and 
other dinners and a 208 million deal for dial corp for beef 
stew chili macaroni and cheese and other lunches 
other big beneficiaries are the pentagons clothing suppliers 
who are rushing production of uniforms the new line of desert 
boots and chemical protective clothing overall more than 83000 
requisitions for 411 million in clothing have been processed for 
operation desert shield

the international monetary fund is cutting its 
loan interest rate in a move that could save debtor countries about 
100 million a year sources say 
at the end of october the fund had about 30 billion worth of 
loans outstanding mexico argentina brazil and venezuela are the 
biggest debtors among 78 borrowing countries 
the fund with headquarters in washington is owned by 154 
countries with the united states the largest contributor 
the interest that the fund charges is based on rates that five 
major governments the united states japan germany britain and 
france pay on the shortterm bonds they sell to the public the 
fund has been charging 913 percent of this rate which it 
calculates every week 
one source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the funds 
board of executive directors decided monday to cut the proportion 
to 878 percent retroactive to nov 1 the directors met behind 
closed doors and did not announce the change they review the 
formula every three months 
for the week of dec 3 the interest the fund charges to debtors 
had worked out to an annual 827 percent the decision to change 
the formula reduces that by 32 basis points or 32100ths of one 
percent to 795 percent 
on loans of 30 billion such a cut would amount to 100 million 
in savings to debtors if the reduction is maintained for a year 
in recent years the imf has lent largely to third world 
countries in financial trouble to get a loan a government 
promises to change its policies and put itself in better condition 
to repay this involves devaluings its currency reducing subsidies 
on basic goods and cutting spending in many cases 
critics say the price of the promises can be too high greatly 
increased prices and many lost jobs in the borrowing country such 
effects have repeatedly led to bloody riots including in the 
dominican republic last month 
the imf maintains that the pain will be worse if changes are 
delayed 
an arrangement with the fund has often been the seal of 
approval that private banks want to see before making much bigger 
loans of their own

major discrepancies in the count of soviet 
weapons will delay senate approval of a new treaty slashing 
nonnuclear armaments in europe by at least two months 
congressional sources say 
the kremlin figures understate the total numbers of tanks 
artillery and other conventional weapons the soviets would have to 
destroy under the agreement by tens of thousands the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said tuesday 
although the differences involve several weapons the largest 
problem involves tanks the kremlin has been gradually moving tanks 
out of central europe the area controlled by the treaty and 
basing them east of the ural mountains in the soviet union 
some in congress fear that instead of dismantling 10000 to 
20000 tanks as the pact requires the soviets would have to 
destroy few or none 
in a letter to president bush sen jesse helms rnc the 
senior gop member of the senate foreign relations committee 
complained about the wholesale differences in the soviet figures 
the soviets may in fact be defeating the object and purpose 
of the treaty from the outset helms wrote 
the precise numbers of weapons in eac category held by each 
side although they are part of the treaty remain secret 
leaders of the 16member north atlantic treaty organization and 
the sixnation warsaw pact signed the conventional forces in europe 
treaty in paris on nov 19 bush praised the pact then for reducing 
to practically nil the tensions that have existed 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said instead of 
military force our world order will be based on equitable 
dialogue 
at the same time the us envoy to the negotiations hinted of 
problems underlying the treaty but congressional officials said 
they were not expected to be this large 
we expect and have expected all along with an unprecedented 
data exchange of this sort for there to be mistakes inaccuracies 
incomplete pieces of information said ambassador james woolsey 
the problems were spelled out on monday in a briefing for 
congressional aides by the state and defense departments the cia 
and the arms control and disarmament agency 
they also were the subject of discussions between secretary of 
state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze in houston a white house source said 
several democratic staff sources said the problems are 
correctable and should not derail eventual senate approval of the 
treaty which had been planned to be one of the first items of 
business when the new congress convenes in january 
the discrepancies occur at a time when the united states and the 
soviet union are enjoying their warmest relations in four decades 
under the treatys terms each side has 90 days until feb 19 
to correct inaccurate data 
now a republican source said the administration will not 
submit the treaty for ratification until march because of the 
accounting problems 
in addition to the undercounting of tanks the soviet data 
understate numbers of armored personnel carriers by 12000 
artillery pieces by 10000 and combat aircraft by about 3000 
according to administration calculations 
one democratic source said the problem arose in part because 
us negotiators had been working from 1989 weapons lists provided 
by the soviets between the time the lists were provided and the 
treaty was put in final form the soviets already had withdrawn as 
many as 20000 tanks from the area governed by the treaty to east 
of the ural mountains 
the senior democratic aide said the situation was viewed as an 
accounting problem and that such numbers discrepancies are not 
unusual in the field of arms control 
last year as us negotiators prepared their own numbers they 
discovered 900 tanks they didnt know the united states had in 
europe the source said some 750 of those excess tanks have since 
been transferred to egypt in a move not unlike what the soviets 
apparently have done he said 
the 160page treaty limits each side to 20000 main battle 
tanks 30000 armored combat vehicles 20000 artillery pieces 
6800 fighter planes and 2000 combat helicopters 
each side has 40 months to reduce its armaments to the ceilings 
spelled out in the treaty which covers a 25 million square mile 
area stretching from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains

pilobolus dance theater formed in 1970 for 
communal choreography opened a monthlong 20th anniversary season 
at the joyce theater with the most interesting dance being the 
newest one 
the particle zoo danced at tuesdays opening night had its 
premiere in january in pittsburgh it was commissioned by the 
pittsburgh dance council 
it was danced by four men and choreographed by seven people 
three of the companys five artistic directors and four dancers 
recorded music by 10 composers is used 
one of the four performers is an outsider two face each other 
and clasp hands supporting a third when the third leaves and the 
outsider jumps onto their hands they let go and he falls 
sometimes they catch him then drop him 
they leapfrog two jumping over each other from side to side 
while one rolls along the floor the outsider gets into the game in 
the wrong rhythm making the dance fast hilarious and dangerous 
looking 
its a fairly long dance with many parts whirling each other 
diving onto the floor etc its interesting right up to its trick 
ending 
carol parker performed the solo moonblind from 1978 to 
spacey music by jane ira bloom once sitting on the floor she 
extended one leg and turned her foot out at an extreme angle it 
looked impossible the audience laughed and when the dancer stared 
in disbelief laughed more 
once she spun like a comedian pretending to be a mad top it had 
all begun with her looking like a distraught housewife 
televisitation from 1985 had kent lindemer being visited by 
jude woodcock who came out of his tv set which he slept and stood 
on his chest she stands on him through much of the dance on his 
legs when he turns over on his shoulders when hes sitting 
standing he lifts her gracefully and twirls her around she 
responds by getting his neck in a hammerlock 
he also lifts her with a hand on the back of her head and a hand 
on her face and he swings her so her feet are higher than their 
heads she takes bows like a mechanical doll then throws him over 
her shoulder 
after those three amusing pieces the final dance debut c 
from 1988 to debussy music took itself very seriously six lightly 
clad dancers were aiming for sensuousness and it struck this viewer 
as mostly pretentious and silly it is very difficult to loll 
around to debussy music and make the motions look like that 
translucent music sounds 
we can remember when pilobolus dances had dancers come out 
melded together like spoons in a drawer then tumble in ways that 
pretty much kept their bodies together the company has gone in new 
directions but pilobolus still doesnt look like any other dance 
company around

john sununu says he has no apologies to make 
for his pugnacious performance as white house chief of staff and 
furthermore wants it known that he never lands the first blow 
i merely put myself down as a political counterpuncher 
sununu said in a vintage performance for an overflow audience at a 
national press club luncheon tuesday 
he lambasted the democrats accusing them of forcing president 
bush to raise taxes by holding the economy hostage and 
forecasting more party strife in the next two years 
he also suggested the democrats were looking at the persian gulf 
crisis as an excuse to raise taxes 
he defended the much maligned budget deal and his own 
contentious role in shaping it which drew brickbats from democrats 
and republicans alike 
sununu who called a gop senator trent lott of mississippi 
insignificant at one stage of the negotiations said when 
push comes to shove republicans will work with republicans to make 
sure this country continues to grow and thrive 
it has been a rocky past few months for the abrasive former 
governor of new hampshire with a storied temper and capacity for 
political invective 
sununu denied that he has damaged white house relations with 
congress or that he was becoming as one questioner put it the 
don rickles of washington politics 
when someone takes a shot at the president of the united 
states in a gratuitous manner i will respond sununu said in 
defense of his truculent style i believe it is part of my job 
i guarantee you that contrary to the legend any strong 
statements on my part are both controlled deliberate and designed 
to achieve an effect sununu said there is no random outburst 
i merely put myself down as a political counterpuncher youve 
never seen me initiate an attack he said 
sununu blamed the democrats for a sixmonth delay in getting the 
500 billion deficitreduction deal passed and said that delay 
will make it tougher to keep this country moving rather than 
floundering 
sununu said bush will not bend again on taxes 
the president was forced to pay the tax ransom once in order 
to save the economy he will not be forced to pay that tax ransom 
again the chief of staff declared 
bush only gave in on raising taxes this year because our 
nations economy was held political hostage by those that control 
congress he said 
he signaled that bush will try again in the new year for a cut 
in the capital gains tax 
sununu said the democrats are already looking for a reason to 
raise taxes 
theyre looking for a bumper sticker that justifies it 
whether its a bumper sticker called tax the rich or theyre 
looking for a cause to justify it whether it is a surtax on the 
war said sununu 
the democratic chairmen of the senate and house budget 
committees sen james sasser of tennessee and rep leon panetta of 
california have raised the possibility of a surtax on income if 
america goes to war against iraq sasser has suggested it might be 
necessary to raise income taxes by 5to10 percent

president bush is renominating a banking 
regulator who has been criticized for creating a credit shortage by 
cracking down too hard on institutions with sour real estate loans 
the white house said tuesday that bush planned to appoint robert 
l clarke to a second fiveyear term as comptroller of the 
currency the regulator of nationally chartered banks he must be 
confirmed by the senate 
according to government and industry sources who spoke 
anonymously last week white house chief of staff john sununu had 
sought to block the nomination 
sununus home state of new hampshire where he served as 
governor has been particularly hard hit by the socalled credit 
crunch 
according to a government source white house aides last week 
began soliciting criticism of clarke from bank and business 
executives after receiving a letter of complaint from major 
republican contributors 
bankers and borrowers in the northeast have been saying for a 
year that clarkes examiners have overreacted to the savings and 
loan crisis discouraging bankers from making even sound loans 
however clarke and other regulators maintained that they have 
not tightened standards inappropriately they blame banks 
reluctance to lend on deteriorating real estate markets and on a 
lack of loan demand resulting from the sluggish economy 
clarke had the backing of treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
a longtime friend of the president the secretary is the 
comptrollers boss but in practice the comptroller has 
considerable independence 
after reports of sununus opposition were published democratic 
and republican members of the house banking committee rushed to 
clarkes defense they warned that the white house would be sending 
the wrong signal to regulators if they failed to reappoint a 
regulator for being too tough 
although clarke jokingly embraced the nickname regulator from 
hell he has since moderated his public remarks 
in a statement thanking bush for the reappointment he said 
we can work through the current problems if lenders assume their 
responsibility to make loans and take reasonable risks and if 
regulators follow a responsive balanced approach that takes into 
account the very significant national interest in not 
unnecessarily depressing credit availability 
i believe that now is a time for the application of common 
sense a time when neither lenders nor regulators should overreact 
or be unresponsive he said 
national banks which are chartered by the federal government 
are about a third of the nations commercial banks the rest are 
chartered by the states national banks tend to be larger and 
together account for more than half of commercial bank assets

though the bush administration is pressing 
congressional democrats to stop sniping at white house policy in 
the persian gulf leaders on capitol hill say its their duty to 
raise questions 
i dont accept the premise that they have all the wisdom 
said rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign 
affairs middle east subcommittee 
their job is to present their policy and ours is to test it 
probe it understand it criticize it and out of that process a 
better policy emerges said hamilton who has largely supported 
president bushs actions in the gulf so far 
since bush announced nov 8 that he was nearly doubling the us 
force in the gulf to provide an offensive threat against iraq 
support for his policies has weakened at home in seeking to scare 
saddam hussein the president also has scared americans 
a key indication of that has come in congress which has been 
holding hearings for more than two weeks hammering away at what 
many lawmakers and their witnesses believe is the administrations 
overeagerness for a military solution 
administration officials say theyre worried the criticism will 
weaken the us position when secretary of state james a baker iii 
meets with iraqi leader saddam hussein saddam baker said at a 
hearing last week simply cannot receive discordant or confused 
or mixed messages 
so baker bush defense secretary dick cheney and national 
security adviser brent scowcroft will be meeting privately with 
senior members of congress in an effort to build a united front 
one senior official said tuesday 
it would be nice if we could figure out a way for at least the 
leadership to convey a unified message said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
hamilton called bakers call for congressional restraint the 
classic argument of the authoritarian trust me fellows dont 
bother me i can handle it thats about as strong an 
antidemocratic argument as you can make you cant turn off 
democracy because its inconvenient 
but when the issue involves american lives is there a time to 
put aside legitimate disagreements in favor of presenting a united 
front 
to sen richard lugar rind thats part of the tough job of 
being a lawmaker 
weve just got to cut this out said lugar it suggests to 
saddam hussein that americans have at least two alternative 
policies maybe more none of which has congressional 
authorization that makes the situation confusing for friend and 
foe alike 
lugar wants the democrats who control congress to call a special 
session and force members to take sides in a formal vote 
lugar said there are political considerations as well while few 
want to talk about it democrats seem to be hedging their political 
bets by not taking a formal position he said 
rep stephen solarz dny cautioned colleagues in a 
closeddoor session of conservative democrats last week that the 
party might never regain the white house if the public perceives 
that bushs gulf policies succeeded without help from the 
democratic congress 
theres no question there will be winners and losers from this 
politically said rep vic fazio dcalif but he added that no 
one should act based on those considerations he conceded that if 
democrats appear too shy of military action it could revive the 
weakness charge effectively used against the party by former 
president reagan

so what if the mares dont care robins 
parteebuilt is a stud and his owners care they want the stallion 
to look his best 
so a plastic surgeon who normally works on patients of the 
twolegged variety was summoned to repair the dent in 11yearold 
robins parteebuilts forehead 
the stallion nicknamed partee got the dent in 1989 when he 
galloped headfirst into a fence post this week a team at the 
university of illinois veterinary school filled in the mark with a 
sort of body putty 
this is one of the top 10 sires of halter horses in the nation 
a precious animal said owner roger dewitt of gillespie 
university veterinarians had patched partees face as best they 
could in 1989 using wires to hold together broken bones 
but when it came to a face as pretty as partees the subject 
of oohs and aahs at the university clinic the veterinarians 
decided a plastic surgeon was needed 
they called in dr jim sheridan from carle clinic in urbana one 
of his specialties is repairing faces 
it took 19 people using a hoist to get the anesthetized 
1350pound stallion onto the operating table 
boy hes a handsome dog veterinary surgeon gordon baker 
said after the dent was filled in and everyone in the operating 
room agreed

most state insurance departments are spending 
more money to investigate consumer complaints but some cant keep 
pace because of budget problems says a new report 
spending on consumer services rose an average of 12 percent from 
1989 to 1990 says the report prepared by a consumer organization 
and several insurance industry groups and released tuesday but the 
study found wide variations in spending levels 
state insurance budgets for consumer services ranged from 38 in 
michigan for every 1000 people to a high of 712 in delaware 
massachusetts spends about 60 per 1000 people on consumer 
services while washington state spends 444 
the average is 230 per 1000 people in the 36 states that 
provided the information the study found 
the good news is that most departments offer many services to 
consumers said stephen brobeck executive director of the 
consumer federation of america 
but states such as michigan and massachusetts have undergone 
statewide budget cuts that have hurt consumer services the report 
said michigans tollfree phone for insurance complaints was 
discontinued a number of years ago staff size has been cut in 
half 
there is a largescale demand for our services which we are 
not encouraging or tapping acknowledged howard spence 
michigans deputy insurance commissioner 
despite the cuts michigan recovers more than 2 million a year 
for consumers through the complaint process spence said 
despite the budget cuts in massachusetts the state managed to 
recover 600000 last year for consumers 
the bestrun consumer services programs according to the 
report 
florida with a substantial population of elderly residents 
spends 567 for each 1000 people 
new york with a 55 million budget for consumer services in 
1990 the largest of any state that comes out to 307 per 1000 
population 
texas which receives almost onequarter of the 2 million 
requests made each year to state insurance departments for 
information about the industry 
delaware which funnels 90 percent of its budget for consumer 
services into handling complaints the remainder goes for 
information and education programs 
kansas and wisconsin which each spent more than 1 million 
this year for consumer services 
half of the states responding to the survey have a tollfree 
telephone hotline for complaints about insurance 
more than 40 percent of the states distribute information about 
insurance pricing the insolvency of some insurers and whether 
there are large numbers of complaints against a particular company 
large states such as pennsylvania spend a relatively small 
amount on consumer services 19 million which comes out to 158 
per 1000 people but employees in other parts of the state 
insurance department take consumer inquiries pointed out amy 
dugan a spokeswoman for the agency 
state insurance departments set rates approve mergers 
investigate consumer complaints and have the power to revoke 
licenses of insurance companies federal law leaves all insurance 
regulation to the states 
the study was prepared by the consumer insurance interest group 
the national association of professional insurance agents the 
american insurance association and the american council of life 
insurance the consumer group includes the consumer federation of 
america public citizen and the national insurance consumer

donald trump is back in the singles game now 
the question is how much is his freedom going to cost the virtuoso 
dealmaker 
a tearful ivana trump left court a single woman tuesday after a 
judge citing trumps cruel and inhuman treatment of his wife 
dissolved their 13year marriage 
that makes trump dubbed the donald by ivana during happier 
times one of the most eligible bachelors around 
but with his financial empire crumbling its unclear how much 
that freedom will cost him and how eligible hell be after paying 
off 
there are two parts to any marriage one are we married and 
two do i owe you any money today weve cleared the way for the 
real issue division of property said jay goldberg trumps 
lawyer 
the alleged other woman marla maples kept a low profile 
marla is out of town on business she wont be having any 
comment said her spokesman chuck jones 
michael kennedy mrs trumps lawyer said ivana had nothing to 
say after the uncontested divorce was approved but donald issued a 
brief statement of good will 
i wish ivana the best i have no doubt that she will do very 
well in the years to come he said 
whether ivana 41 will do well with proceeds of a marital 
agreement updated in 1987 or with a larger piece of the trump pie 
remains to be seen the marital pact calls for ivana to receive 10 
million and the couples connecticut estate worth an estimated 12 
million lawyers have said 
child support division of property and the validity of any 
marital agreements will be decided at trial unless they are 
settled out of court 
mrs trump in court papers filed earlier this year said she 
was seeking 25 billion of trumps estimated 5 billion fortune 
a figure financial experts say has dwindled drastically in recent 
months 
the trial is expected to start april 11 goldberg said 
trumps penchant for publicity backfired somewhat as his marital 
troubles were splashed across newspapers radio and television with 
reports of his alleged affair with miss maples a model who wants 
to become an actress 
a new york post frontpage headline quoted miss maples 26 as 
saying of her relationship with trump best sex ive ever had 
a picture of a smirking donald ran next to the headline 
further tales of their trysting some liaisons allegedly carried 
out virtually under ivanas nose at trump tower kept tongues 
wagging coast to coast until donalds financial woes edged news 
about the breakup aside 
mrs trump argued in court papers that the couples updated 
agreement signed in 1987 was drawn up while her husband was 
already committing adultery and intended to leave her trump 45 
maintains the agreement remains valid 
it was not clear what effect the divorce would have on mrs 
trumps position as head of the plaza hotel trump speaking later 
at the plaza said he had not decided whether to keep his exwife 
as an employee 
trump who has come under pressure from creditors at his taj 
mahal casino in atlantic city and had to refinance millions in debt 
to stay afloat was zapped by the judge in the divorce decree 
judge phyllis gangeljacob gangeljacob said mr trumps 
cruel and inhuman treatment made it unsafe or improper to 
continue to be married 
the trumps have three children ages 12 8 and 6 who have been 
staying with mrs trump since the couple separated last winter

economic sanctions will not force 
saddam hussein to back down because his legions looted enough from 
kuwait to sustain iraq for years a canadian businessman who fled 
the captive nation said early today 
the baghdadborn executive said he was utterly amazed by the 
oversimplification of the issue that economic sanctions will 
have their effects on iraq 
what has been looted from kuwait is enough to last the system 
for up to 10 years the 50yearold businessman said 
in addition to computers cars and other consumer goods he said 
the amount of food taken from kuwait could last iraq at least two 
years this issue of starvation is highly exaggerated 
the university of california at berkeley graduate lived in 
kuwait 11 years and through his work was closely connected to 
kuwaiti and western businesses he spoke on condition that he and 
his company not be identified for fear colleagues in kuwait would 
be harrassed 
there is widespread debate over whether the un embargo on 
trade with iraq could by itself force saddam to back out of kuwait 
the trade cutoff has shut down iraqs oil exports and food 
imports but baghdad has taken measures toward achieving 
selfsufficiency 
the canadian was among 14 people who landed in frankfurt late 
tuesday the group included seven americans two britons two 
canadians an irishman an italian and an australian 
their uschartered boeing 707 was one of three jetliners 
delivering former hostages from iraq on tuesday two others flew to 
bangkok and london 
us consulate spokesman craig springer said the men would take 
commercial flights to their destinations 
saddam announced last week that he would free all those trapped 
by the aug 2 invasion and more than 170 former hostages arrived 
in frankfurt on monday in the blanket releases first wave 
another flight believed to be the last is expected in 
frankfurt on thursday carrying the us ambassador and embassy 
staff from kuwait 
most of the former hostages looked tired and refused to speak to 
waiting reporters 
tom litrenta 28 of allentown pa said the mood on the flight 
was really quiet believe it or not 
litrenta who left behind several iraqi friends said he had 
mixed feelings about the persian gulf crisis 
the people i talked to just said they want no more war said 
litrenta who was working on an irrigation project for the iraqi 
government iraq fought an eightyear war with iran that ended with 
a 1988 ceasefire 
the canadian businessman said an iraqi friend in kuwait asked 
him to give president bush a message that they hope he will not 
betray them and they are waiting for him to liberate not only 
kuwait but the iraqi people from this tyranny 
the businessman said he finally left kuwait at the insistence of 
his family which is waiting for him in mississauga near toronto 
but he said he planned to continue lobbying for kuwaits 
liberation 
i am willing to fight and encourage the world to flush them 
out of kuwait he said i believe the whole world is held 
responsible for the catastrophe and the tragedy of kuwait because 
we dont unite against tyranny

that our families have stood back and watched other hostage 
situations being resolved peggy say said tuesday on nbcs

frustrated that the beirut hostages have been known as the

the administration to the fire 
anderson the associated press chief middle east correspondent 
was kidnapped march 16 1985 he has been in captivity the longest 
of the six americans and seven other western hostages held by

mrs say in a letter to bush published in part in tuesdays usa 
today asks when did my brother get lost in the course of human 
events mr president who declared his life and liberty less 
valuable than that of any other hostage ever taken 
she said that while bush spoke in indignant anger about the 
hostages in iraq god help those that fall outside the realm of 
political exposure and expediency 
they can only weep in despair and puzzled wonder as their 
president and peers continue to accept their desperate situation 
she noted that the last picture she received from irishman and 
former hostage brian keenan showed anderson pedaling an exercise 
bicycle with an 18inch chain holding his wrist to the wall

the district of columbia city council has 
given preliminary approval to legislation that would make 
manufacturers of semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons liable for 
injuries and deaths those guns cause in the nations capital 
the council voted for the bill 83 with two abstentions on 
tuesday a final vote was scheduled for next tuesday 
its time for these merchants of death to pay a price said 
council member william lightfoot who sponsored the legislation 
we can set a very meaningful precedent 
carl rowan jr a lobbyist for the national rifle association 
decried the law as good theater but frivolous legislation that 
could not stand constitutional scrutiny 
i dont think it stands a chance in court rowan said 
the city already has a very strict gun control law and sales of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons have been illegal since 1976 
but police say criminals can get firearms in neighboring maryland 
and virginia which have less restrictive laws

ershad was arrested and confined to a house in an exclusive 
diplomatic area on wednesday six days after yielding power under 
massive public pressure

to the former home of the british ambassador which was hastily 
prepared for his detention 
ershad with his wife raushan and their 8yearold son shahd 
looked grim as he rode through the gate of the home in the gulshan 
district 
the 60yearold former army general resigned thursday after 
seven weeks of escalating street demonstrations for his ouster his 
opponents demand he stand trial to answer accusations of corruption 
and abuse of power during his eightyear rule 
more than 150 police surrounded the wallenclosed building to 
which ershad was taken it is opposite the british embassy which 
once served as a guest house for queen elizabeth ii the house had 
stood empty for some time 
a sign near the gate said law enforcement commission 
indicating it belongs to one of the countrys security forces or 
intelligence units 
only a few hours earlier workmen were installing air 
conditioners beds and carpets in the twostory colonialstyle 
house police tents were pitched in the back garden 
also wednesday about 6000 students chanting hang ershad 
marched from dhaka university to the presidents office just 
outside the heavily guarded military compound where ershad had 
lived while in office 
students had played a key role in toppling ershad who took 
power in the impoverished country of 110 million people in a 
bloodless 1982 coup 
on tuesday police said they were given orders to arrest ershad 
and some cabinet ministers and other officials of his deposed 
government police squads raided a dozen homes in search of 
officials who had gone into hiding in fear of mob violence 
ershads home minister mahmudul hassan was the first to be 
placed under house arrest specific charges against him have not 
been published 
mahmudul was in charge of the police and the paramilitary forces 
assigned to keep order during the demonstrations 
an estimated 100 people were killed during the campaign begun in 
october that led to ershads resignation most by security forces 
and some in clashes between ershads supporters and his opponents 
ershad handed over the government to an caretaker administration 
led by supreme court chief justice shahabuddin ahmed who was

congressional investigators are accusing 
auditors at the environmental protection agency of not aggressively 
pursuing potential fraud by private contractors involved in 
millions of dollars in environmental cleanup programs 
but epa inspector general john martin told a house subcommittee 
tuesday that he stands by his offices work and said its 
investigations have led to 250 indictments since 1984 as well as 
the recovery of 16 million in fines through administrative 
actions 
investigators for both the house energy and commerce committee 
and for the general accounting office testified that hundreds of 
epa contracts have not been audited because of backlogs and in 
some cases they said questions of possible fraud have not been 
pursued adequately 
three subcommittee investigators acknowledged however that 
their yearlong investigation uncovered no proof of fraud or 
evidence of deliberate wrongdoing by epa auditors 
the gao report said that most of epas contracts dating back 
four years have yet to be audited because of a backlog both within 
the epa and at the defense contract audit agency which handles may 
of the contract reviews for the agency 
the defense audit agency has 273 outstanding requests for 
contract audits from the epa as of the end of last month with 40 
percent of them made more than two years ago said the gao 
investigators 
martin who has been the epas inspector general since late 
1983 said the congressional investigators have not found fraud 
they have not found anything wrong that we did not find 
already they found it in our files

a harvard divinity professors dismissal as 
editor in chief of the dead sea scrolls was prompted by remarks 
attacking judaism the new york times said today 
in a newspaper interview published last month in israel 
professor john strugnell was quoted as describing judaism as 
originally racist and suggesting that all jews should convert 
to christianity 
in dismissing strugnell as editor of the scrolls last week the 
international team of scholars overseeing the work had cited health 
problems and criticism of the slow pace at which the ancient 
documents are being published 
but the times said today that strugnells colleagues 
acknowledged that the antijewish remarks had forced the issue 
the interview certainly contributed said frank moore cross 
another harvard scholar on the dead sea scrolls team but the 
interview was impossible without his illness 
strugnell 60 who has been editor since 1987 could not be 
reached for comment the times said harvard spokesman peter costa 
said he was in a hospital which was not identified for treatment 
of an illness which was not disclosed 
the times reported that several of strugnells colleagues said 
he had a drinking problem while others alluded to his mental 
condition 
the dead sea scrolls discovered in 1947 in a cave in what is 
now the israelioccupied west bank contain the oldest known copies 
of the old testament other biblical writings ancient literature 
and poetry 
the scrolls illuminate the evolution of judaism and the origins 
of christianity about 35 percent to 45 percent of the scrolls 
remain unpublished 
the interview with strugnell was published nov 9 in haaretz a 
tel aviv newspaper 
in the interview strugnell a roman catholic was quoted as 
saying of judaism its a horrible religion its a christian 
heresy and we deal with our heretics in different ways you are a 
phenomenon that we havent managed to convert and we should have 
managed 
the israeli journalist who interviewed strugnell avi katzman 
said in an article in biblical archeology review although 
strugnell drank beer throughout the interview this did not 
surprise me as his drinking habits are well known in jerusalem he 
did not appear to be inebriated he was lucid and spoke in a firm 
voice

two japanese legislators flew to the united states 
today to meet with american black leaders and seek to cool tempers 
inflamed by insulting remarks the justice minister made about 
blacks 
yoshiro mori and motoji kondo senior legislators representing 
the governing liberal democratic party were to visit washington 
new york and los angeles 
were going at prime minister toshiki kaifus request but 
also because i feel personally worried that we havent really dealt 
with the problem yet mori said in an interview 
on sept 21 following a police roundup of foreign prostitutes 
in tokyo justice minister seiroku kajiyama said they ruin the 
atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into the area is 
becoming mixed just like in america where blacks move in and whites 
are forced out 
kajiyamas comment was the latest in a series of 
minorityrelated faux pas by japanese politicians slips that many 
analysts blame on ignorance and insensitivity to racial issues 
kajiyama apologized for his remark and was publicly reprimanded 
by kaifu leaders of the congressional black caucus and other 
groups have demanded more drastic action 
they want kajiyamas resignation and the teaching of black 
american history and culture in japanese schools 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said his ministry 
highly recommended the legislators mission to the united 
states 
it should not be a oneshot effort watanabe said but the 
first of several such bridgebuilding efforts 
mori said he and kondo hoped to explain to black leaders that 
japan takes the issue seriously although demanding kajiyamas 
resignation was going too far he said the government planned 
to promote more awareness of american minorities although changes 
in school curricula usually take time 
until now weve tended to avoid teaching about such bad 
aspects of american society as racial tensions we thought it would 
be disrespectful now i guess wed better start mori said 
mori said white americans were to blame for teaching the 
japanese racist attitudes 
i want to stress that japanese themselves have no bad feelings 
toward blacks or other minorities and we respect the united states 
for making a free and open society with such a diverse mixture of 
peoples he said 
he said japan must deal with its own complicated racial 
attitudes 
the korean minority in japan and people from other asian 
countries face social and economic discrimination japanese 
designated centuries ago as belonging to the burakumin or 
village people caste also face deeprooted prejudice 
japan with all its wealth hasnt made southeast asian 
refugees feel welcome and we colonized korea for 37 long years we 
really must reflect on that mori said its about time we 
resolved these issues 
in 1986 former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone aroused us 
anger when he said intelligence levels in the united states were 
inferior because of a considerable number of blacks puerto 
ricans and mexicans 
in 1988 michio watanabe the liberal democrats policy chief 
said american blacks had few qualms about going bankrupt implying 
that they walk away from their debts 
such comments incensed minority groups which also have accused 
japanese firms operating in the united states of deliberately 
discriminating against blacks and hispanics in their hiring 
policies 
those groups plan rallies outside the japanese embassy in 
washington and japanese consulates in other cities on saturday to 
express their dissatisfaction with japanese racial attitudes said 
masatake takahashi an international political commentator who 
helped organize the legislators visit 
they also have called for a boycott of japanese imports to drive 
their point home

president bush will advocate a constitutional 
amendment to limit the number of terms for members of congress 
says his chief of staff 
bush has been on record for some time as favoring the idea 
which is enjoying increasing grassroots support but it remains 
unclear how hard he will push the issue 
the president also is on record as favoring constitutional 
amendments to ban abortions and flag burning to require a balanced 
budget and to give president lineitem veto power over 
congressional appropriations 
all are issues with intense passionate support among those who 
favor them but far less support in congress where a twothirds 
majority is required to submit a constitutional amendment to the 
states for ratification 
the idea of pushing for a limitation on congressional terms in 
particular could be politically tempting for a president 
attempting to convince voters that his programs are being stymied 
by a recalcitrant congress dominated members of the opposite party 
democrats in the current instance 
john sununu bushs chief of staff concluded a lengthy speech 
at the national press club on tuesday by outlining some of the 
agenda bush will pursue during the upcoming session of congress 
the president will continue to press for reforms such as a 
lineitem veto he will press for reforms in campaign financing 
and he will press for a termlimitation amendment that deals with 
the problems associated with perpetuating the life of those who are 
elected to govern people the public life of those who are elected 
to govern people said sununu 
the reality that incumbency breeds a very different attitude 
is now sensed by the public and i think if you take a look at what 
was intended as a structure by those that founded this country 
youll see weve moved a great distance from it

san mateo county has tentatively 
approved what is believed to be the first measure in the nation to 
require owners of dogs and cats to either buy a breeding license or 
get their pets sterilized 
over the protests of pet owners the board of supervisors 
approved the measure 41 tuesday after a fourhour hearing that 
drew breeders from across the country the ordinance faces a second 
vote next week before becoming final 
the ban on unlicensed breeding is intended to reduce the number 
of unwanted animals put to death 
under the ordinance effective in 1992 professionals and 
amateurs would have to obtain a license to breed their pets or else 
spay or neuter them rules for the program such as the cost of the 
license have not been worked out 
the ordinance would affect only unincorporated areas of san 
mateo county or about 10 percent of the 628000 people in the 
primarily suburban welltodo county immediately south of san 
francisco thus it would not apply to such communities as redwood 
city san mateo menlo park and south san francisco 
we just lost said bettyanne stenmark a member of 
responsible dog breeders of san mateo county 
she and others said they may challenge the ordinance in court 
the peninsula humane society has said some 10000 stray dogs and 
cats a year are put to death in san mateo county breeders argued 
that they were not responsible for the pet overpopulation problem 
they blamed that on stray animals 
during the meeting some in the audience hissed rock singer 
grace slick of the jefferson starship as the animal rights activist 
spoke in favor of the ordinance 
were users the human race one of the things we use the most 
are the animals she said 
outside one of about 50 demonstrators against the ordinance 
carried a sign reading if the humane society had been in 
hollywood there would be no lassie 
when introduced the legislation called for an outright ban on 
pet breeding it was later amended to allow owners and breeders to 
obtain licenses 
it was further amended tuesday night to require breeders seeking 
a license to submit a plan showing how their litter would be used 
and pledging that most of the offspring would be spayed or 
neutered

what was to have been armand 
hammers bar mitzvah instead became a tribute to the industrialist 
one day after his death 
the beauty of it is that while we are celebrating this 
evening my grandfather is celebrating the best bar mitzvah ever in 
heaven said michael hammer said tuesday night at the 
starstudded ceremony at the beverly hilton 
eight hundred guests paid as much as 500 a plate to attend the 
event with the money going to jewish charities 
hammer who died monday at age 92 had planned the event as both 
a fundraiser and a longdelayed observance of the ceremony marking 
a jewish boys passage into adulthood hammer was born a jew but 
didnt have a bar mitzvah at the traditional age of 13 because his 
socialist father eschewed religious practices 
as it turned out the event marked the final fundraiser 
organized by the flamboyant globetrotting chairman of occidental 
petroleum corp who raised millions for cancer research and other 
causes 
i think he was a trailblazer and contributed a great deal of 
resources to cure cancer to free soviet jews and to help children 
all over the world said actor elliot gould emcee of the event 
others who attended included former govs edmund g pat 
brown sr and edmund g jerry brown jr actors cesar romero and 
shelley winters and ida nudel a soviet refusenik brought from 
moscow to israel by hammer in 1987 
he was a great man she said 
hammer who promoted and profited from trade with the soviet 
union throughout most of the 20th century knew every soviet leader 
from lenin to mikhail gorbachev 
he is to be entombed thursday in the family mausoleum at 
westwood village memorial park in los angeles not far from 
occidental petroleums headquarters and the armand hammer museum of 
art and culture which opened last month

murder he also was convicted of rape sodomy robbery assault and 
riot 
kharey wise 18 was cleared of the more serious charges but 
found guilty of assault sexual abuse and riot one juror said 
physical evidence like that against richardson was lacking in 
wises case 
the verdicts came after 12 days of deliberations in the case

to police the defense had argued that the teenagers were 
intimidated and told what to say by police

the judge and prosecutor of railroading wise and richardson who 
are black the victim is white

and the court was cleared so emergency workers could administer

assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer and said you 
bitch youre going to pay for this 
lederer who won convictions against three other defendants in 
an earlier trial stemming from the attack was escorted from court 
by police 
the case symbolized rising fears of random violence in new york 
city and brought the term wilding into the citys mainstream

violence and robberies 
critics in the black community said the case received wide 
attention only because the victim an investment banker was white 
and affluent

charged as a minor could get a maximum of five to 10 years in 
prison 
wise who was charged as an adult because he was 16 when the 
attack took place could be sentenced to eight and twothirds to 26 
years in prison 
defense attorneys said they would appeal 
juror victoria bryers said richardson was convicted of the more 
serious charges because of stronger physical evidence which 
included strands of the joggers hair found on his clothing and 
his underwear which was heavily soiled on the inside with mud and 
grass stains 
in his videotaped statement wise claimed he only fondled the 
womans legs while holding her down as others beat and raped her 
he said the attack was my first rape and it will be my last 
richardson admitted less during his statement but acknowledged 
he was there during the attack

injuries she was found about four hours later unconscious 
bleeding and covered with mud 
she lost threequarters of her blood and was initially given

church officials praised a judges ruling that 
the government violated the first amendment rights of church groups 
when it infiltrated and secretly taperecorded religious 
gatherings 
us district judge roger strand ruled tuesday the government 
does not have unfettered discretion to conduct investigations and 
law enforcement activities 
the infiltration came during an investigation of the sanctuary 
movement which provided shelter to undocumented central americans 
fleeing political persecution in their homelands 
the investigation resulted in the conviction of eight people in 
may 1986 on conspiracy and aliensmuggling charges no prison terms 
were levied 
four arizona churches and two national denominations sued the 
federal government later that year over the immigration and 
naturalization services use of paid informers to secretly record 
church services in 1984 
this is a good victory for one of the basic founding 
principles of this country and that was the free exercise of 
religion from government interference said the rev john fife 
pastor of the southside presbyterian church in tucson one of the 
churches that sued 
the government is constitutionally precluded from unbridled 
and inappropriate covert activity which has as its purpose or 
objective the abridgement of the first amendment freedoms of those 
involved strand wrote 
but he rejected the churches claim that their fourth amendment 
rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated 
because investigators did not obtain search warrants 
patrick kane acting director of the phoenix ins region said 
the agency was satisfied with the ruling claiming a partial 
victory because strand did not find the ins or its agents guilty of 
specific crimes 
we see it simply as a validation of the fact that our officers 
conducted their investigation according to the proper procedures 
and in an appropriate manner kane said 
fife said kane was interpreting the decision to his advantage 
the government was wrong in their sanctuary investigation and 
theyre wrong in the ins assertion he said 
the other plaintiffs were camelback united presbyterian church 
and sunrise united presbyterian church of phoenix the presbyterian 
church usa and the american lutheran church

a murderer made a 25year mistake when he appealed 
his sentence in a 1986 slaying a prosecutor said 
robert hernandez was convicted of murder in the slaying of a man 
trying to protect his brother during an argument and sentenced to 
65 years in prison he appealed the sentence on the basis of what 
he claimed was an error during the trials punishment phase and in 
1988 won a new trial 
a new jury on tuesday sentenced him to 90 years in prison and 
added a 10000 fine 
that appeal turned out to be a 25year mistake said 
prosecutor clark birdsall 
hernandez was convicted of stabbing ruben lueda to death sept 
27 1986 two years later an appeals court ruled that prosecutors 
erred during closing arguments by inviting jurors to consider state 
parole laws during their deliberations 
because the improper argument occurred during the punishment 
phase the court ruled that he deserved only a new punishment 
hearing 
jurors were unaware of the earlier sentence hernandez received 
for killing lueda less than three months after he was paroled from 
prison after serving 10 years of a 99year prison sentence for 
aggravated robbery 
defense lawyer brad lollar said the stiffer sentence is 
misleading because any sentence of 60 years or more is weighed the 
same by the parole board 
hernandez will not be eligible for parole until 2006 
lollar said he will appeal the latest sentence

president mikhail s gorbachev has urged the 
communist party to fight those who are trying to topple the 
soviet union according to a report published today 
publication of gorbachevs comments came the day after the 
chairman of the kgb security police warned that unidentified 
foreign powers were waging a secret war against soviet 
authorities 
gorbachev in remarks tuesday ending a twoday plenum of the 
partys central committee renewed his calls for a new union treaty 
to retain central control over the politics and economies of the 15 
soviet republics 
the committee approved gorbachevs proposed draft treaty 
despite complaints from representatives of some republics that it 
did not give them enough power 
gorbachev said that soviet leaders had abandoned the policy of 
diktat from the center but he took issue with the sovereignty 
and independence declarations that have been passed by the 
legislatures of all the soviet republics except kirgizia in central 
asia 
we must not give a helping hand to those who are trying to 
topple the soviet union under the guise of criticizing the old 
center gorbachev said his remarks were published by the 
communist party newspaper pravda 
we must beware of falling from one extreme to the other 
instead of strong central government to have something that 
resembles an amoeba he said 
kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov voiced even stronger concerns 
tuesday night in a nationally televised address 
workers of the kgb see their duty in preventing interference 
into our domestic affairs by foreign special services and those 
foreign organizations and groups who have for decades conducted 
and continue to conduct a secret war against the soviet people 
he said 
in remarks reminiscent of cold war rhetoric kryuchkov 
threatened to crack down against what he described as a efforts to 
block food from being sold though stateowned stores 
kryuchkov saying he spoke on gorbachevs orders described a 
complex conspiracy in which special services of unidentified 
foreign powers were working in tandem with ultraradicals to 
reap financial and political capital while seeking to shatter 
the soviet state 
the formation of some ultraradical political movements is not 
at all spontaneous but it is deliberate and well thought out some 
of them have ample material and moral support from abroad he 
said 
destructive elements take the path of organizing what in 
effect is economic sabotage aggravating the situation in the 
consumer market said kryuchkov 
he said the kgb would work to fight economic sabotage and 
prevent foreign products from being illegally diverted 
any attempts to hinder these activities will be resolutely 
stopped by all means that are at the disposal of the kgb he 
said

a powerful state legislator has been indicted on 
fraud charges in an alleged real estate scheme involving the sale 
of cooperative apartments in new york city 
assembly speaker mel miller the states most powerful democrat 
next to gov mario cuomo was charged tuesday with jay e adolf a 
top aide and former law partner with cheating their law clients 
out of hundreds of thousands of dollars 
but miller said the federal indictment contains baseless and 
outrageous charges that he will challenge in court 
i have never defrauded anyone in my life miller said 
tuesday 
the allegations unrelated to millers legislative duties stem 
from three real estate transactions in the mid1980s allegedly 
engineered by miller and adolf 
they were taking advantage of their positions as attorneys to 
turn a profit without the knowledge of their clients said andrew 
j maloney us attorney 
miller and adolf were named in a 19count indictment charging 
them with mail fraud conspiracy and falsifying documents the 
federal felonies are each punishable by up to five years in prison 
and 250000 fines 
if convicted of a felony miller would be expelled from the 
legislature 
the men will be arraigned next week 
miller has denied any wrongdoing and said federal law enforcers 
targeted him because he was a prominent politician maloney denied 
the charge 
gerald b lefcourt millers lawyer said of his client he 
feels among a hunted class of wellknown politicians and he is 
going to deal with it in court 
adolf also has denied any wrongdoing 
in one alleged scheme miller and adolf are accused of cheating 
clients of their manhattan law firm adolf amp miller by secretly 
investing in valuable apartments in a brooklyn building that was 
being converted to cooperative apartments at the same time they 
were representing a group of investors who were purchasing 
apartments in the same building according to prosecutors 
in another scheme involving the same building miller and adolf 
allegedly acquired the apartment of a deceased former client by 
preparing a false affidavit indicating the client had given her 
purchase rights to a coconspirator of the defendants 
the defendants quickly disposed of the apartments at two to 
three times the original purchase price prosecutors said 
miller 51 a native of brooklyn who still lives in that 
boroughs flatbush section has served in the assembly since 1970 
where hes earned a reputation as outspoken liberal unwilling to 
shrink from a battle 
he indicated to me he felt kind of liberated by the 
announcement because now he can fight this thing and can fight it 
publicly cuomo said 
miller and adolf have given up their law practice 
assistant us attorney matthew e fishbein who is prosecuting 
the case said that under state law the defrauded clients may seek 
the return of some 238000 paid in legal fees to the adolf amp 
miller firm

the soviet union has no plans for any military 
involvement in the persian gulf foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze told lawmakers today 
none of our moves on the international scene and none of our 
diplomatic actions implied given even the wildest fantasy any 
participation of soviet combat auxiliary or any other troops or 
units in any military operations in the gulf area shevardnadze 
advised soviet lawmakers 
speculation on this score was totally groundless 
shevardnadze said in a text given to the legislators and reported 
by the official tass news agency 
the foreign minister who is in the united states sent the text 
to the soviet parliament after a rightwing group of deputies 
accused him of preparing to send soviet troops to the gulf without 
legislative approval 
moscow pulled its troops out of afghanistan in 1989 after nine 
years fighting guerrillas trying to overthrow the afghan 
government 
the soviet union does not and never had plans to get involved 
in any form in a possible military conflict in the gulf 
shevardnadze said 
i dismiss as naive accusations by those who would like to 
project matters as if the foreign ministry and the minister 
personally are heading toward a war in the middle east tass 
quoted the text as saying we did not nurture this thought even 
for a single moment we totally excluded this 
president mikhail s gorbachev and shevardnadze in recent weeks 
have abandoned their cautious tone regarding iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and threatened to support military action unless saddam 
husseins forces end their 4monthold occupation of the emirate 
although shevardnadze told lawmakers there were no plans to send 
soviet troops to the gulf he did not rule out the possibility that 
sometime in the future the executive branch might have to act 
without parliaments consent 
we will act this way if the lives and security of soviet 
citizens appear to be jeopardized when rapid and decisive actions 
are needed to save them he said 
in his meetings with secretary of state james a baker iii 
shevardnadze urged the bush administration to find a sensible 
way out of the gulf crisis in negotiations with iraq there is 
still potential for a peaceful solution he said at a joint news 
conference tuesday with baker 
at that session shevardnadze reiterated soviet support for un 
security council resolutions imposing an international trade 
embargo on iraq and threatening military force unless iraq 
withdraws by jan 15 
of soviet participation in military action against iraq 
shevardnadze said this option is not under consideration this 
option is nonexistent 
while baker said on tuesday he did not request soviet military 
help he has asked moscow in the past for at least a token 
contribution the soviet union has some ships in waters off iraq 
but has not deployed any other forces to join the usled 
multinational force assembled against iraq 
fewer than 3000 soviet advisers remain in iraq a onetime ally 
of the soviet union more than 400 have left in the past week 
on tuesday lawmakers from the russian republic parliament told 
national leaders not the let the country get caught up in a 
military confrontation in the gulf 
the russian congress of peoples deputies said in a nonbinding 
resolution that gorbachev must not let the country be drawn into 
a military conflict in the gulf that could lead to very grave 
consequences for global peace and stability

solidarity national commission in gdansk where the movement was 
born in the shipyard strikes of 1980 it is an honor and at the 
same time a great responsibility i hope you will support the 
polish reforms 
solidarity the soviet blocs first free trade federation 
spearheaded changes that led to the toppling of polands communist 
government and helped cause peaceful revolutions elsewhere in 
eastern europe 
the solidarity leaders passed by acclamation a resolution 
thanking walesa for his leadership he has well served his 
homeland it said 
walesa who is to be sworn in by parliament for a fiveyear 
presidential term about dec 21 is conducting intensive talks 
about naming a new prime minster and cabinet said solidarity 
spokesman andrzej drzycinski 
the presidentelect urged solidarity to be active in free 
parliament elections this spring and help poland weather the 
difficult transition to a capitalist economy and democracy 
walesa appealed for support in fending off any attack of the 
tyminskis referring stanislaw tyminski his defeated opponent in 
the presidential race who had promised quick prosperity for 
economically struggling poland 
tyminski left for canada today after posting a 100000 bond to 
assure his return to answer charges of slander the emigre 
businessman lost by a 3to1 margin to walesa in sundays runoff 
tyminski who holds polish canadian and peruvian citizenship 
had to plead with prosecutors to allow him to leave the country 
because of a pending case alleging that he defamed prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki during the campaign 
tyminski 42 accompanied by his peruvian wife graciela was 
seen off this morning at warsaws okecie airport by about 50 
supporters chanting his name and poland is with you 
i am of poland he said before being boarding a polish lot 
airlines flight for london and toronto

eliminated from the election in the first round of balloting on 
nov 25 had betrayed the nation by creating economic chaos 
meanwhile outgoing president wojciech jaruzelski delivered his 
own farewell in a nationally televised speech tuesday night 
jaruzelski apologized for each harm pain and injustice 
caused during his nine years in power apparently referring to his 
1981 decision to impose martial law in an effort to crush 
solidarity and the repressions and years of stalemate that 
followed 
the word of sorry may sound all too casual jaruzelski 
said but i cannot find another one 
jaruzelski as communist party chief was polands leader from 
october 1981 until july 1989 when he was elected president an 
office whose powers he used only passively his term will end when 
walesa is sworn in 
solidaritys national commission decided its vice chairmen lech 
klaczynski and stefan jurczak will run the union until an 
emergency national congress to be held as soon as midjanuary 
the congress will formally accept walesas resignation elect a 
new chairman and likely decide whether to form a political wing of 
solidarity or stick to union work representing workers in 
negotiations with the government as some members advocate

former east german leader erich honecker lies 
deathly ill in an intensive care unit at a soviet military 
hospital near berlin a newspaper reported today 
the bild newspaper said honecker 78 was suffering from a 
serious heart disorder and that his kidneys were failing 
honecker is wanted by berlin justice authorities on charges of 
manslaughter as a result of shoottokill orders he allegedly 
issued at the berlin wall honecker has denied all charges against 
him more than 200 east germans died trying to escape to the west 
german police cannot serve a warrant that was issued nov 30 
because they have been unable to get permission to enter the soviet 
military hospital in beelitz 20 miles south of berlin where 
honecker sought refuge in april 
the soviets claim they are keeping honecker on humanitarian 
grounds 
bild said the soviets had two possibilities to resolve the 
problem 
the first would be to allow honecker and his wife margot to 
travel to the soviet union for medical treatment 
the second would be to turn honecker over to the germans 
the berlin wall divided berlin from 1961 until late 1989 and 
was part of the fortifications that prevented east germans from 
going to the west 
germany was unified in october ending the division imposed 
after its defeat in world war ii

doctors performing a heartlung test that can 
cause fatal complications should receive specialized training and 
certification say researchers who found many doctors have a poor 
grasp of the procedure 
a written exam about the procedure was given to 496 physicians 
at 13 us and canadian hospitals it found that 47 percent were 
unable to derive even the most basic information from the data 
generated by the test researchers reported in wednesdays journal 
of the american medical association 
the study did not record any attempt to give the exam to doctors 
known to have used the heartlung test rather researchers gave 
the exam at random to doctors in hospital departments that use the 
tests the most 
the test called pulmonary artery catheterization or pac is 
performed an estimated 2 million times a year and can provide 
lifesaving information if used by a doctor with adequate training 
but it can cause fatal complications or lead to treatment errors if 
used without adequate knowledge the researchers said 
no training standards exist for doctors learning to use the test 
and no special credentials are required they said 
dr roger c bone chairman of internal medicine at rush medical 
college in chicago said tuesday a moratorium on the use of the 
test would be going off the deep end 
bone said in a telephone interview tuesday that the rate of 
serious complications overall is probably 2 percent to 3 percent 
and the rate of lifethreatening complications less than 1 percent 
the pac is very important very helpful he said it can 
give us information that may allow interventions that will be 
lifesaving 
he agreed with the researchers that doctors should have to earn 
credentials to use the test bone serves on the american board of 
internal medicine and the critical care board which set standards 
to certify doctors qualified for those specialties 
bone said the abim and the joint commission on accreditation of 
healthcare organizations which sets quality standards for 
hospitals are evaluating the findings 
the pac introduced in 1970 involves inserting a tube carrying 
a monitoring device into a neck or leg vein and threading it 
through the heart into a lung artery there it can measure blood 
flow temperature and oxygen 
its been an amazing advance to monitor the effects of 
medication help in the diagnosis of different cardiac conditions 
and in patients with lung diseases said dr thomas j 
iberti director of critical care at mount sinai hospital in new 
ork and lead author of the study 
it also allows you to follow the effects of therapy he said 
in a telephone interview tuesday you can now rather than asking 
patients if they feel better get data 
but the tube which is sometimes left in place for two to three 
days can cause serious or fatal complications such as rupturing 
the lung artery disrupting the heartbeat or allowing infection to 
enter the body he said 
iberti and his colleagues developed a 31question 
multiplechoice test about pac and gave it to doctors in the 
departments of medicine surgery and anesthesiology at hospitals 
recruited for the study 
the doctors average score was 207 questions correct or 67 
percent with a low of six correct and a high of 31 the 
researchers said

afghans are tired of fighting and 
will welcome the superpowers decision to stop weapons shipments a 
moslem guerrilla spokesman said today 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on tuesday announced 
the ussoviet agreement to cut off weapons to the sovietbacked 
kabul government and the moslem guerrillas who are backed by the 
united states pakistan and saudi arabia 
the announcement came after a meeting in houston with secretary 
of state james a baker iii in 1989 the soviets pulled the last 
of their troops from afghanistan where the 12yearold civil war 
has claimed 15 million lives 
most of the mujahedeen guerrillas and most afghans will 
welcome it theyre tired of war said azim nasserzia spokesman 
for the national islamic front of afghanistan his group is one of 
the seven major afghan resistance parties based in pakistan 
its true everyone in afghanistan carries a gun while a gun 
may give a degree of safety it also generates fear he said 
both afghan president najibullah and gulbuddin hekmatyar leader 
of the most radical guerrilla faction have called for reciprocal 
weapons cutbacks 
najibullah said last month he would accept a lack of symmetry in 
each sides arms including the soviet arms assistance program to 
be cut off and we would destroy all weapons stockpiles in 
afghanistan and turn it into a totally demilitarized and neutral 
country 
diplomats in islamabad and pakistani officials called the 
announced weapons cutoff a significant development in the costly 
political and military stalemate most anticipated a joint 
statement by baker and shevardnadze and had prepared their 
responses 
afghanistan is one of the few irritants remaining in 
ussoviet relations said one diplomat who insisted on 
anonymity its a detriment and an annoyance president bush and 
others in the us administration seem convinced its not worth the 
aggravation and just want it off the agenda so its difficult to 
understand what the holdup is 
shevardnadze said no date has been set for the weapons cutoff 
most of the guerrilla groups say they have not received weapons 
from the united states since midsummer according to reports from 
the afghan capital the number of soviet transport planes 
delivering arms ammunition and other supplies has dropped from an 
average of 40 per day to about 10 a day 
but both sides possess huge stockpiles of weapons and 
ammunition and most diplomats and observers believe the fighting 
will likely continue for some time between troops loyal to 
najibullah and the guerrillas 
within months after moscow withdrew its 115000 red army troops 
from afghanistan in february 1989 the superpowers began searching 
for a solution 
but their afghan clients have proved recalcitrant moreover a 
superpower deal will be no guarantee of peace in the landlocked 
tribal society which has traditionally resisted interference by 
outsiders 
the guerrilla leaders so far have refused to negotiate directly 
with najibullah instead offering their own ideas for ending the 
war and holding elections for a new government 
the united states has provided as much as 300 million a year to 
the moslem guerrillas washington has estimated soviet assistance 
at 500 million a month although most observers say the exact 
amount is difficult to calculate because most of the weapons were 
pulled out of eastern europe and are outdated 
one of the major obstacles has been agreeing on an acceptable 
formula for reducing weapons supplies equally there have been 
questions about when a cutoff would start who it would involve and 
how it would be verified 
it was unclear whether the announcement regarding a cutoff of 
weapons would apply to saudi arabia which reportedly has matched 
us assistance to the guerrillas on a dollarfordollar basis in 
september saudi arabia reestablished diplomatic relations with 
moscow 
moscows involvement in afghan affairs is at least in part 
driven by soviet fears the afghan insurgency could spill across the 
border into its predominantly moslem central asian republics

japan and germany two of the worlds leading 
economic powers have delivered barely onefifth of the money and 
materials they promised in support of us military operations in 
the persian gulf the pentagon says 
of the six countries that offered the largest contributions to 
operation desert shield at its outset in august only kuwait has 
given all that it promised pete williams the chief pentagon 
spokesman said tuesday 
williams declined to comment on the reasons for the delayed 
contributions from other allies pledges totaling more than 65 
billion were made for calendar year 1990 
japanese officials denied today that japan is dragging its feet 
in disbursing 2 billion us dollars pledged to support the 
multinational forces deployed against iraq 
a japanese foreign ministry official said that of a total of 4 
billion pledged for the military effort and to support frontline 
states some 600 million has been contracted or disbursed 
the process for disbursing another 600 million dollars in 
emergency commodity loans for jordan and turkey will be completed 
very soon said another the remainder is under discussion at 
various levels they said 
in bonn a spokesman for chancellor helmut kohl today disputed 
the pentagons figures hans klein said his government already has 
made available more than 136 billion for the gulf operation 
including 109 billion in military equipment and transportation 
williams had said the germans have delivered 337 million in 
cash and materials toward a pledge of 15 billion and japan 
which said it would give about 2 billion for the gulf operation 
has provided 426 million 
neither japan nor germany has sent armed forces to the gulf 
citing constitutional restrictions 
williams said the united states plans to ask an undisclosed 
number of allied nations to increase their financial contributions 
for 1991 he said he did not know how much money would be sought or 
when the requests would be made 
we will probably seek additional support from other nations to 
continue their share of the responsibility for desert hield 
williams said 
the united arab emirates a federation of gulf sheikdoms 
bordering saudi arabia pledged 1 billion and has given 280 
million williams said south korea offered 95 million and so far 
has delivered 4 million 
williams said saudi arabia which is the host nation for the 
vast majority of us and allied forces arrayed against iraq was 
the only ally to make an openended offer of support he said 
that as of oct 31 it had provided material support such as fuel 
food water and transportation valued at 987 million 
kuwaits exiled royal family has delivered 25 billion 
williams said that is part of a pot of private and foreign 
government contributions totaling 39 billion an amount certain 
to fall short of covering us costs in the gulf 
williams said the pentagon would ask the congress in february 
for supplemental funds to cover desert shield expenses in 1991 he 
said the amount was uncertain because the pentagon did not know how 
much the gulf operation will cost and because its unclear how much 
more the allies may be willing to contribute 
government and congressional sources said monday that desert 
shield may cost 30 billion in 1991 the pentagons original cost 
estimate was 15 billion but that was before president bush 
ordered huge reinforcements to the gulf on nov 8 
williams said american air sea and ground forces in the gulf 
area have risen by 10000 since last week to 260000 the latest 
arrivals apparently are the lead elements of army and air force 
reinforcements from europe and the united states 
the pentagon said tuesday that elements of seventh corps 
headquarters us army europe began deploying to the middle east 
from their base in stuttgart germany also the us 2nd corps 
support command began deploying from nellingen germany 
by late january about 430000 us army navy air force and 
marine corps personnel are expected to be in the area 
williams said forces dispatched to the gulf area from britain 
france and 24 other allied nations now total more than 220000 he 
said he could not disclose how many forces were sent by each 
country 
the spokesman also announced that iraq now has more than a 
halfmillion troops in and around kuwait 50000 more than us 
intelligence estimates of a week ago and five times the size of the 
army that invaded kuwait on aug 2

the publisher of the new york daily news says the 
tabloid will keep plowing ahead as long as it is gaining ground 
against an employee strike a move a union spokesman called sheer 
masochism 
publisher james f hoge made the announcement tuesday after a 
board meeting of the news parent the tribune co some wall street 
analysts had speculated the board would close the paper and cut its 
losses 
our rule is that we are plowing ahead as long was we can show 
that we are making significant progress hoge said 
theodore kheel the striking unions legal adviser countered 
the decision is a form of sheer masochism 
the news has no hope of survival whatsoever in the absence of 
a settlement or sale he said the sooner the board realizes 
that the better everyone including the tribune co will be 
the news using managers replacements and employees transferred 
from other tribune co newspapers has continued to publish despite 
the 7weekold strike by 2100 employees in nine unions 
negotiators for both sides arrived in washington today at the 
federal mediation and conciliation service which is trying to end 
the sixweekold strike 
members of the negotiation teams began arriving at the services 
headquarters shortly after 9 am but declined to comment on the 
talks they met with bernard e delury director of the service 
and other mediators 
hoge said the news is regaining strength daily and increased net 
paid circulation by 28000 to 580000 since the end of last week 
through a network of dealers and hawkers now totaling almost half 
the prestrike number of 12000 outlets 
the paper had daily circulation of 109 million copies before 
the strike began on oct 25 
it is the opinion of everyone involved in this process that we 
are making significant progress and we are going forward hoge 
said 
the publisher said the strike is costly but not as expensive 
as trying to run the paper with all the excess costs and contract 
abuses that we had in the old contract 
hoge said the paper is losing money but could be profitable if 
the company reaches reasonable settlements with the unions he said 
he is confident many advertisers who left for rival tabloids will 
return as circulation increases 
about 100 people most from various chicago unions picketed the 
tribune tower on tuesday led by several of the striking daily news 
workers tribune co also publishes the chicago tribune

secretary of state james a baker iii 
hopes to meet with foreign ministers of the other permanent 
security council members in europe this month to reassure iraq it 
wont be attacked if it withdraws from kuwait by jan 15 diplomats 
said today 
but the foreign ministers will also tell iraqi president saddam 
hussein that they will not accept a partial withdrawal thus 
forestalling any idea that he could hang on to two islands that 
control access to the shattalarab waterway or part of an oil 
field straddling the iraqkuwait border 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who is in 
washington for talks with baker and president bush urged a 
sensible way out of the persian gulf crisis in negotiations with 
iraq 
there is still potential for a peaceful solution he said at 
a joint news conference with baker on tuesday 
it is very important that a goodwill grace period that expires 
on jan 15 is taken up by a very active diplomatic and political 
effort he said it is also my strong hope that us troops 
will not see action 
the foreign ministers agreed in principle to meet in europe 
after iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz meets bush in washington 
this month but before baker travels to baghdad for talks with 
saddam diplomats said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the message is intended to emphasize international solidarity 
behind baker when he travels to iraq they said 
baker has been waiting for word from baghdad on a date to see 
iraqi president saddam hussein the united states rejected the 
iraqi suggestion of a jan 12 date because it is too close to the 
jan 15 deadline 
shevardnadze said we pin much hope on the coming contacts 
the meeting would involve the united states britain france 
the soviet union and possibly china 
chinas willingness to participate is questionable though 
since beijing is opposed to the use of military force to drive iraq 
from kuwait 
china abstained on the security council resolution passed on 
nov 29 which authorizes un members to use all necessary 
means up to and including military force to liberate kuwait if 
iraq doesnt pull out by jan 15 
diplomats have speculated that iraq might be willing to withdraw 
from kuwait if it was able to retain the southern end of the 
rumailah oil field which extends from iraq into kuwait 
an unresolved dispute over whether kuwait was tapping oil that 
belonged to iraq was one reason for iraqs aug 2 invasion of the 
emirate 
iraq also wants a deepwater port which it was unable to win 
during the 19801988 iraniraq war 
baghdad had asked kuwait for a 99year lease on two uninhabited 
islands at the mouth of the shattalarab waterway from kuwait 
which would give it control over access to the passage forming the 
border between iran and iraq 
kuwait declined to lease the islands to iraq the day before the 
invasion 
the meeting of the foreign ministers would emphasize that iraq 
must withdraw from the islands of warba and bubiyan and from the 
rumailah oil field baker has insisted on that point but has also 
said recently that when the emir of kuwaits government is restored 
to power iraq and kuwait could then negotiate the economic and 
territorial disputes between them

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
dec 11 
albuquerque nm journal on the persian gulf 
what do you know another unconcession from the united states 
in response to the iraqi announcement that all foreign hostages 
could go home washington announced that the last us diplomats 
would leave the beleaguered embassy in kuwait after all american 
citizens had been allowed to leave 
administration spokesmen denied it was a conciliatory move 
saying it was decided based on the hostage departures ending the 
embassys immediate duties in conquered kuwait and out of concern 
for the situation of the diplomats themselves 
perhaps what we are witnessing here is the worlds first 
instance of backchannel diplomacy by press release in any event 
it cannot help but reduce the tension of the gulf standoff if the 
remaining us diplomatic personnel in kuwait were to finish their 
job and head home it certainly has the look if not the fact of a 
deliberate us decision to eliminate one potential flash point 
the george bush of long experience in diplomacy and government 
may indeed be handling this crisis with a more subtle touch than 
the bombastic rhetoric his pronouncements portray 
whatever else the kuwait embassy gambit signals it signals that 
it is time for congress and its individual members to lay off the 
secondguessing of bush and let him play his cards with his 
military force ace at full strength 
 
dec 11 
the richmond va news leader on the persian gulf 
there is in the west a softhearted temptation to declare peace 
at hand with saddam husseins release of hundreds of foreign 
hostages from iraq and kuwait people who display such sentiment 
fall into the trap of treating despots as if they are compassionate 
individuals saddam hussein like those numerous bloodthirsty 
communist leaders who enjoyed american jazz and good scotch is 
unreasonable and uncaring 
while supposedly making a grand overture for peace by as 
secretary of defense dick cheney put it stopping a practice that 
obviously is abhorrent to the civilized world saddam has 
proceeded to bolster troop deployments and fortifications in 
occupied kuwait furthermore the iraqi government has refused to 
offer secretary of state james baker a facetoface meeting with 
saddam in time for iraqi troops to withdraw from kuwait before jan 
15 following such a meeting 
on its face the hostage release might appear to be a 
humanitarian gesture but saddam does not see it that way not even 
publicly in announcing the impending hostage release saddam 
said their presence had been necessary to deter military attacks by 
the west but now that iraqi troops have achieved full force in 
occupied kuwait it is no longer necessary to hold hostages 
 
dec 9 
the palm beach fla post on the persian gulf 
in taking hostages saddam hussein gained nothing but an extra 
measure of scorn in releasing hostages hussein should be allowed 
to gain nothing at all 
husseins quest for gain wont end with humanitarian posturing 
because his invasion of kuwait and release of hostages came before 
any new united nations action on the israelipalestinian conflict 
hussein undoubtedly will claim credit there he is capable of 
unilaterally declaring that his actions have reinforced un 
concern for the palestinians and even if un action has no 
practical effect hussein can after saving face by declaring 
himself vindicated and a hero of the palestinians withdraw from 
kuwait 
hussein doesnt care about the palestinians neither do most of 
the other arab leaders except insofar as the palestinians are a 
weapon against israel

philadelphia daily news on the persian gulf 
lets all say it together real loud 
george bush is not a wimp nor is he a weenie he is the 
biggest baddest critter in the whole forest 
maybe hell hear and we can skip getting carloads of people 
killed this public relations effort to convince us that we should 
sacrifice american young people may be one of the most cynical 
exercises since lyndon johnson told us all how heavy his heart was 
moments after the polls say we wont back a war in the persian 
gulf except to stop nuclear proliferation the bush administration 
changes its reasoning its to stop saddam hussein from getting 
the bomb yeah thats the ticket 
worst of all though we continue trying to back ourselves into 
a corner just as it appears that 400000 troops and a blockade may 
have created a climate for cutting a deal secretary of state james 
baker tells us that all hes going to do is lecture and threaten 
saddam 
none of the rationales for war makes sense at least not yet

los angeles daily news on the space shuttle program 
it has not been a stellar year for space astronomy first there 
was the monstrously expensive disappointment of the hubble space 
telescope that 15 billion eyeinthesky that cant quite get 
things in focus now the 150 million astro observatory 
plagued by computer trouble more than 100 planned 
observations out of about 250 had to be scrubbed 
yet not all is gloomy out there hubble in spite of its 
optical flaws is enabling astronomers to do some serious science 
and is returning some spectacular images from the solar system and 
the realm of distant galaxies the magellan probe is currently 
assembling a remarkable detailed map of the planet venus and the 
astro observatory glitches and all helped astronauts make a 
significant and poignant bit of history 
columbias astronauts beamed a lesson from space just as new 
hampshire schoolteacher christa mcauliffe had wanted to do nearly 
five years ago when she won a place on the disastrous challenger 
mission 
teaching is probably the most useful thing along with its usual 
national security work launching spy satellites and such that 
nasa can do for the country right now 
so it is good finally to see someone teaching from orbit 
answering questions from kids on the ground the lesson from the 
shuttle columbia was a modest comeback for a project that has been 
stalled far too long the project of bringing space down to earth

florence sc morning news on our resources 
ten years ago an ecologist and an economist took the unusual 
step of submitting their opposite theories to a reality test they 
made a bet the result was written up in the influential new york 
times magazine 
the more famous lost 
he is paul erlich stanford universitys butterfly expert and 
the mass medias favorite ecologist his 1968 bestseller the 
population bomb is among the environmental movements founding 
texts 
in 1980 erlich took up the gauntlet thrown down by university 
of maryland economist julian simon to demonstrate the point that 
far from becoming scarcer as population grows natural resources 
actually become more available thanks to human innovation simon 
offered a challenge to predictors of overpopulation pick any 
natural resource simon said and he would bet that its price would 
decline by any stipulated date 
erlich and two colleagues bet 1000 on five metals chrome 
copper nickel tin and tungsten the 10 years erlich stipulated 
ended in october world population grew by 800 million in the 
decade but all five metals declined in real price together they 
declined by almost 40 percent 
this adds one more thing to the long list of erlichs 
predictions that have proven false notably mass starvation in the 
1970s and neardepletion of many key minerals before 1985 
yet erlich retains his standing with the mass media as an authority 
on the planets future 
biologists think in terms of closed ecosystems but market 
economies are flexible and responsive instead of disparaging the 
economists ecologists should incorporate the obvious truth that 
resources are not static but rather depend on mans power to adapt 
and invent

the atlanta constitution on banking laws 
merely a decade late washington now appears ready to begin the 
huge task of reforming the financial system with proposals being 
drafted by the treasury department the bush administration is 
preparing to revamp banking laws from top to bottom and congress 
may be ready to join the effort 
clearly the system is in great need of reform the fundamental 
laws that regulate commercial banks were developed during the great 
depression of the 1930s as the nation gears up for the 21st 
century new laws are needed to keep up with changing technology 
new competitive pressures and growing international commerce 
still its not surprising that both the white house and 
congress have been reluctant to meddle with a system that grew out 
of the hard lessons learned in the 1920s and early 1930s older 
americans still have nightmarish memories of bank runs and lost 
savings tampering with the depositinsurance system is not 
something to be done lightly 
but the need for reform is now overwhelming while a complete 
overhaul may sound radical the real danger lies in taking halfway 
steps that leave the system with one foot in the 1930s and the 
other in 2000

the daily oklahoman oklahoma city on trade talks 
collapse of the world trade talks in brussels is bad news for 
american producers especially our farmers 
chief cause for the breakdown was the european communitys 
refusal to cut internal farm price supports japan also balked on 
opening its closed rice market 
a successful gatt agreement could increase us exports to 
developing countries alone by 200 billion over the next 10 years 
a large portion of which would be agricultural goods the united 
states needs more export sales to help the economy and lower the 
trade deficit 
negotiators might get the talks back on track in january if 
not fallout may include increasing trade frictions rising 
protectionism and possibly even a global trade war instead of a 
new era of free trade and prosperity the world could split into 
regional trading blocs each with its own barriers 
this at a time when world leaders should be striving for more 
not less cooperation 
 
dec 10 
houston chronicle on trade talks 
for general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt substitute 
world trade more to the point make it eliminating barriers to 
increased world trade 
to further simplify it gatt is about jobs 
the process of setting new international rules on matters 
ranging from banking to patent protection stumbled last week in 
brussels on the issue of agricultural protection us negotiators 
backed by most of the worlds other large agricultural exporters 
wanted to cut internal farm supports by 75 percent the europeans 
would agree to only a 30 percent cut 
in effect the interests of a few heavily subsidized european 
farmers now threaten the trade structure that has brought 
increasing global prosperity since just after world war ii theres 
nothing arcane about that threat its plainly and simply wrong 
 
the gatt ministers will meet in geneva after the first of the 
year to try to break the deadlock the subsidies of inefficient 
european farmers must be cut in the interest of freer global trade

the greenwood miss commonwealth on lech walesa 
americans remember lech walesa as the courageous gdansk shipyard 
electrician who led his fellow workers in strikes against polands 
then communist government 
walesa went to jail for his efforts that was before eastern 
europes revolutionary political changes of the past year or so 
now walesa a 47yearold electrician with a vocational school 
education is the new elected president of poland 
before communism began to crumble walesa had built the 
solidarity movement into a broadbased anticommunist social 
consensus which united polish intellectuals workers and the 
catholic church once solidarity took over the government however 
its ranks began to splinter 
after four decades of communism prime minister mazowiecki 
engineered economic shock treatment to poland it seems to be 
working but mazowieckis defeat reminds us that it is easier to 
criticize from outside the government than it is to lead from 
within especially when times are hard 
walesa no doubt is going to face the same trouble for it will 
not be easy to create a modern market economy in poland or for that 
matter in the rest of eastern europe a hard road lies ahead it is 
easier to rally people against something or someone than it is to 
rally people in support of a difficult plan of action no matter 
how necessary that plan may be

the chattanooga tenn times on china 
only 18 months since china massacred prodemocracy demonstrators 
in tiananmen square president bush was meeting at the white house 
with chinas foreign minister and us ambassador to china john 
lilley was recently in seattle chastising demonstrators against 
chinas gross violations of human rights 
what is going on 
never mind that china has shown no remorse for its massacre of 
innocents but has continued to persecute those involved in the 
prodemocracy movement bush counted on the shift of public 
interest to the middle east as a cover for reopening the door of 
the white house to beijing but not everyone was looking the other 
way 
confronted by demonstrators against chinas humanrights abuses 
lilley got into a shouting match calling them cowards and 
ridiculously suggesting that if they hadnt been at tiananmen 
square they had no right to protest he even shouted at a tibetan 
man that he should go back to china and serve china 
the ambassador has since admitted he made a mistake but 
defended himself by saying he was provoked by namecalling from 
some of the demonstrators that is no excuse any diplomat so 
easily pushed to the point of losing control should be in another 
line of work 
in light of the administrations weakkneed response to chinas 
brutal repression of internal dissent lilley should have been 
prepared to take his lumps from demonstrators rightly protesting 
beijings humanrights abuses an apology is clearly called for 
but was conspicuously absent from the ambassadors statement 
admitting error and the white house has been silent derelict in 
its duty at least to reprimand lilley for his unseemly and 
unwarranted outburst but that we suppose should come as no 
surprise

le monde paris on the persian gulf 
saddam hussein has finally accomplished one of the gestures that 
the international community ordered of him four months ago his 
decision to free all the hostages without delay or conditions and 
no longer as he previously announced between dec 25 and march 25 
was swallowed dec 7 by the parliament in baghdad 
if this initiative which puts an end to a long scandal 
shouldnt reward him with any gratitude it nonetheless marks a 
political retreat for the first time since the annexation of 
kuwait the iraqi dictator has satisfied one of the principal 
demands of the united nations 
in the eyes of the united states and its allies the fate of the 
hostages and in particular the fear of taking the lives of these 
human shields dispersed on the strategic sites of the host 
country never played the deterrent role that baghdad expected 
hostages or not nothing has stopped a logic of war from 
unfolding in the gulf and the western military detachment 
reinforced at the end of the month is from now on credible in

la repubblica rome on the persian gulf 
for the first time since aug 2 the day of the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait it is right to say that the caravan of peace has started 
to move in the arabian desert 
if saddam hussein seriously intends to liberate the thousands of 
americans western europeans and russians who until now have been 
used as human shields and if this is not the strategy of a 
crafty merchant trying to gain time and divide his adversaries 
then the bloodbath in the persian gulf is not the one and only 
inevitable conclusion to the crisis

the observer london on trade talks 
removing barriers to trade in manufactured goods has led to an 
immense growth in world commerce in the postwar years 
trade has kept growing even at times of economic difficulty yet 
now european and american leaders seem incapable of pursuing a 
broad common interest even though they know its longterm benefit 
to both their own countries and the world community to be beyond 
doubt 
the persian gulf crisis has revealed the reluctance of most of 
americas european allies for vigorous cooperation now that the 
cold war is over 
if rich europe relapses into selfish regionalism it will find 
itself paying a price its prosperity and stability are bound to 
lure the less fortunate 
there is already alarm over the flow of illegal immigrants from 
north africa the collapse of communist border controls in east 
europe has made it easier for asians to slip unnoticed into the 
west 
it is time for western leaders to show they recognize the 
responsibilities beyond their own parish

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir told 
members of congress today he firmly supports president bushs 
decision to ease trade with the soviet union as a reward for its 
liberalized policies 
israel and its supporters in congress had spearheaded opposition 
to trade concessions for the soviets but are now trying to help the 
strapped soviet economy since the relaxation of restrictions on 
jewish emigration 
shamir spoke to the senate foreign relations committee in a 
closed session but israeli officials relayed the gist of his 
remarks 
shamir was meeting later in the day with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze the hastily scheduled meeting requested by 
the soviets and arranged by the state department reflects the 
fastimproving relationship between the two countries 
before meeting shamir shevardnadze is calling on president 
bush who has been weighing how to ease immediate soviet food 
shortages and to help the economy in the longer term bush has 
decided to temporarily waive the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment which 
limits trade with the soviets unless they allow free emigration 
we think it the amendment could be dispensed with for a year 
or more because of the very liberalized policies related to the 
emigration of soviet jews shamir told reporters at a conference 
of the american enterprise institute 
gorbachev has been allowing jews out at a rate of 1000 to 2000 
a day a far cry from the virtually closed gates of the soviet 
union through most of the 1970s and 1980s 
the subject of the flood of immigrants is expected to come up 
with shevardnadze shamir said as well as israels request for 
direct flights from the soviet union and its desire for resumption 
of full diplomatic ties which the soviets broke in 1967 
the crisis in the persian gulf and prospects for israeliarab 
peace talks are also expected to come up said other officials 
the session with shamir will give shevardnadze an opportunity to 
try to persuade him that an international peace conference could 
help settle the arabisraeli dispute 
but shamir said israel will not participate in such a 
conference and israel will not accept imposed solutions 
instead israel wants direct talks with its arab neighbors as 
outlined in a fourpoint peace plan shamir proposed last year and 
the united states endorsed 
peace plans are neither fashions nor automobiles we must not 
introduce a new model every year shamir said 
israel also has not changed its mind about excluding the 
palestine liberation organization from peace talks and it hopes 
the plos support for iraq has convinced the world of its 
unsuitability as a peace partner shamir said 
sounding a conciliatory tone the prime minister said israel 
wants to cooperate with its arab neighbors on an arms control plan 
that would rid the volatile middle east of its vast arsenals of 
arms 
israel also wants to cooperate on a plan to ease the reigons 
increasingly severe water shortages he said 
he pledged again that israel would refrain from a preemptive 
strike against iraq unless attacked 
shamirs meeting with bush tuesday went a long way toward 
calming his fears about the steadfastness of us support for 
israel despite recent strains over the new us alliances with 
arab states aligned against iraq 
the meeting will enhance the special relationshi between the 
united states and israel shamir told reporters at the white 
house 
shamir said his meeting with bush convinced him the 
administration doesnt favor an international conference 
the administration has been fighting a proposed resolution at 
the un security council calling for such a conference mainly to 
avoid linking the israelipalestinian dispute with the usled 
drive to force iraq to leave kuwait 
bush also sought to smooth the strains in his relations with 
shamir 
he voiced us concerns about treatment of palestinians living 
under israeli occupation said assistant secretary of state john 
kelly but he did not bring up the slaying of 17 palestinians by 
israeli police during an october riot at a jerusalem holy site 
shamir asked bush for help possibly in the form of loan 
guarantees in absorbing soviet jews who are coming to israel the 
president said he would think about it

two california communities are 
being challenged by the american civil liberties union to remove 
religious symbols that mark the holiday season from public 
property 
in beverly hills the american jewish congress and four jewish 
residents backed by the aclu filed a lawsuit in federal court 
seeking the removal of a 28foot hannukah menorah displayed at a 
municipal park 
in monterey the aclu has demanded that the city remove a 
nativity scene from the city hall lawn by thursday or face a 
lawsuit 
the civil liberties union contends the displays amount to a 
government endorsement of religion but the communities say they 
are celebrating the diversity of religious beliefs in the nation by 
offering space for holiday displays from a variety of groups 
chabad a movement of hasidic jews installed the large 
candelabra in beverly hills on monday for public celebration of the 
eightday jewish holiday 
the suit filed by the american jewish congress contends the 
menorah on public property violates the first amendments guarantee 
of separation of church and state 
carol plotkin of the jewish congress argued that religious 
freedom is best preserved by banning all religious objects on 
public lands 
there are plenty of opportunities to put up creches or 
menorahs or any other religious object on private property 
government should be free of any religious objects she said 
city attorney greg stepanicich defended the citys approval of 
the chabad menorah 
we have a lighted christmas tree a lighted seasons 
greetings sign and now weve allowed the menorah as part of that 
overall holiday message stepanicich said 
he said that state and federal courts have allowed religious 
holiday displays if they also show cultural diversity and 
pluralism 
hanukkah or the jewish feast of lights began tuesday evening 
it commemorates the rededication of the temple in jerusalem by the 
maccabees after they ousted foreign occupiers 2100 years ago 
it is celebrated by lighting one candle on the menorah for each 
of the eight days 
in monterey the city for years has made space on the city hall 
lawn available to the monterey civic club to set up the nativity 
scene on tuesday the city posted a large sign on the lawn saying 
the space on the lawn was available for noncommercial holiday 
displays 
the sign also says the city does not endorse or support any of 
the points of view expressed by the displays or their sponsors the 
message is the sole expression of the person or group erecting the 
display 
but michelle welsh a lawyer representing the aclu said the 
sign doesnt make any difference 
its abundantly clear that the law requires the city to remove 
the creche from city property she said

volunteers coaxed eight beached 
whales back to sea and took two to an aquarium but 43 others 
grounded near the kennedy family compound were given up for dead or 
put to death overnight to end their misery 
the whales that returned to the sea appeared to be all right 
this morning despite fears on tuesday that they would be 
disoriented and in danger of beaching themselves again 
authorities said 
but the whales left behind were less fortunate 
rescuers on cape cod had struggled most of the day tuesday to 
save the pilot whales splashing them with water and soothing them 
with wet towels as the giant mammals most of them mothers and 
calves lay listlessly making squeaking and whistling noises and 
occasionally twitching 
im offering a little comfort said one volunteer karen 
kelly they respond to your touch and your voice they are scared 
and they dont know whats going on 
say a prayer she added 
when the weakened whales began foundering in seaside pools 
filled by the rising tide and could no longer keep their blow holes 
above water and avoid drowning more than a dozen were put to death 
with lethal chemicals 
the volunteers were sent home around midnight expecting all the 
whales to be dead by morning 
experts were unable to explain why the whales beached 
themselves the animals were 6 to 15 feet long and many weighed 
more than a ton 
about 100 volunteers had endured high wind and freezing 
temperatures in the effort to save the animals working with the 
help of floodlights and headlights they used stretchers to return 
some of them to open water 
one rescued whale later washed ashore and was destroyed eight 
others were tracked by boat for more than a mile 
radio transmitters were placed on two of the rescued whales and 
their fins were fitted with glowinthedark tags but their 
ultimate fate remained unknown whales pushed back into the water 
often beach themselves again 
its like a person being in a real bad car accident and then 
telling them to go drive again said colleen crogan a national 
marine fisheries service official who operated a spotlight during 
the rescue 
two whales were taken to the new england aquarium in boston 
where scientists hope to nurse them back to health both were 
juvenile females and both were reported in guarded condition early 
today 
early today the new england aquarium revised its official count 
of the number of stranded whales downward by two to 53 most were 
euthanized but 13 died of natural causes and eight were returned 
to the sea 
despite the mass deaths volunteers with the cape cod stranding 
network said the possible rescues outweighed the losses it was 
really a fantastic experience said roger cadrin you could 
tell they knew we were there to help 
the whales beached themselves in shallow pools on squaw island 
at low tide tuesday the island is near the kennedy family 
compound where rose kennedy lives 
in eight whale strandings on cape cod and nantucket island in 
the past decade 368 whales have beached themselves including 
tuesdays group the largest such grounding came when 97 whales 
swam ashore near eastham in october 1984 
only three of the 315 previously grounded whales survived and 
they spent seven months at the aquarium they had beached 
themselves in 1986 
on tuesday some people worried that the rescued whales werent 
much better off than they were before they became stranded 
i think these whales at this very moment are confused and 
dont know where they are said charles mayo director of the 
center for coastal studies in provincetown who was in the tracking 
boat 
reuben baker of brewster a veteran of other strandings said 
these whales could pick you up and throw you through the air but 
you can tell they knew we were trying to help them 
theories about what causes whales to beach themselves include 
sickness navigational disorders or drastic changes in tidal and 
ocean current patterns 
there are as many theories as there are whales on the beach 
today said jenny montague supervisor of marine mammal training 
at the boston aquarium

young people who undergo surgery to repair one of 
the most common birth defects of the heart can look forward to 
normal life spans a 30year follow up shows 
the study which looked at people who had been operated on for a 
problem called atrial septal defect showed that those who were 
under age 25 went on to live just as long as those with healthy 
hearts 
older people did not do as well but surgery still makes sense 
for these people because the outlook for survival is still far 
better than for those who didnt undergo the operation 
the study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine was based on the experiences of the first 123 patients 
who had the operation at the mayo clinic between 1956 and 1960 
atrial septal defect is the technical name for a kind of hole in 
an interior wall of the heart in this abnormality blood 
improperly flows from the hearts left upper pumping chamber into 
the right the defect is often discovered in late childhood and 
symptoms can include trouble breathing fatigue and chest 
palpitations 
the study found that 97 percent of those who were under age 11 
at the time of the operation and 93 percent of those between ages 
12 and 24 were still alive 30 to 34 years later this was not 
significantly different from a comparison group with healthy 
hearts 
from the perspective of employment and insurability such 
patients should be strongly reassured wrote dr joseph g murphy 
and colleagues 
however among those between ages 25 and 41 survival was 84 
percent while 91 percent in this age category in the comparison 
group were still alive survival among those over age 41 was worse 
still 40 percent among the heart patients and 59 percent in the 
comparison group 
the longterm results of repair at older ages are unfavorable 
as compared with those of correction at earlier ages they wrote 
but this does not mean that older patients shouldnt have the 
surgery 
other studies have shown that the outlook is grim for those who 
do not get the defect fixed by age 50 threequarters are dead 
and by age 60 90 percent are dead 
atrial septal defects account for between 7 percent and 10 
percent of all genetic malformations of the heart

mailboxes are filled with sometimes 
tearjerking requests for money during this season and some care 
is needed in deciding on charitable gifts 
battling disease and protecting the environment feeding 
children overseas and the homeless in america are among the many 
causes turning to the mail airwaves and other media to make their 
pitches 
the national council of better business bureaus while normally 
thought of in connection with protecting consumers also tries to 
ride herd on the thousands of charities across the nation 
the council periodically publishes a list showing those 
charities that generate the most inquiries to the group it shows 
which do and do not meet 22 voluntary standards set by the better 
business bureaus 
the councils general guidelines for folks considering giving to 
charities at any time of the year include 
if unfamiliar with the organization ask for written 
information about its programs and finances 
dont succumb to pressure to give money on the spot a charity 
that can use the money today will welcome it just as much tomorrow 
watch out for appeals that bring tears to the eyes but tell 
little or nothing about how the donation will be used appeals for 
money should clearly identify program activities 
dont give cash make a check or money order out to the 
charity not to an individual 
if candy calendars or other goods are being sold to benefit 
charity ask how much of the money actually goes to the charity 
ask if the donation is deductible for federal income tax 
purposes and keep a record for use at tax time 
check out charities with the local better business bureau or 
state charity registration office usually a part of the state 
attorney generals office 
copies of the pamphlet give but give wisely may be obtained 
for 2 and a stamped selfaddressed envelope from the

the main defendant in the murder trial of 
ecologist and union activist chico mendes stunned a courtroom today 
by confessing to the crime during the first day of the proceeding 
during questioning by judge adair longhini darci alves pereira 
23 admitted shooting mendes in an ambush in 1988 the young cattle 
rancher had denied any role in the killing during routine opening 
motions this morning 
as bailiffs led pereira from the courtoom in this remote amazon 
jungle town longhini stopped them and questioned the defendant 
again 
pereira paused then looked up and said i confess 
what said the judge did you kill him 
yes pereira said 
there was a buzz in the tiny courtroom and longhini called for 
order 
ilzamar mendes the widow of chico mendes clapped her hands and 
asked he confessed its hard to believe 
she added hes probably doing it to protect his father 
pereiras father 53yearold cattle rancher darly alves da 
silva is the other defendant in the trial 
he is charged with planning the shooting and has pleaded 
innocent 
the confession was a startling development in a trial that has 
drawn international attention and is seen as a test of brazils 
commitment to protecting its rain forests and to equal justice for 
rich and poor 
thousands of brazilians politicians and international observers 
had traveled to this western village drawn by one of the biggest 
legal spectacles in brazils history the trial of two ranchers 
accused of killing mendes 
at stake many say is the future of the worlds largest rain 
forest the struggle in which mendes was killed pits the 
traditional way of life in the amazon against ranchers and others 
who want to open up large tracts of lands 
mendes a 44yearold rubber tapper who led a movement to stop 
destruction of the rain forest was gunned down dec 22 1988 in 
the backyard of his modest wooden home in xapuri 2650 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
this is a historic trial not only for brazil but the world 
marcio thomaz bastos the chief lawyer for the prosecution said 
earlier today 
in brazil it is a test case against reckless lawlessness and 
for the world a marker of whether or not man will allow the amazon 
to be destroyed 
private and government development efforts in the amazon region 
have intensified since 1980 the world resources institute says as 
much as 20 million acres of forest were destroyed in brazil in 1987 
alone the amazon rain forest is the sole habitat for thousands of 
plant and animal species 
peasants from around the region have come to xapuri in canoes 
mule and steerdrawn carts on horseback by bus or simply on 
foot tents were popping up in the main square hammocks hung on 
front porches and matresses were laid wherever theres a free spot 
in peoples homes 
i want to see what chico did justice and men living at 
peace with the forest said luis vieira de souza a 63yearold 
rubber tapper who arrived at xapuri after an eighthour canoe 
journey on the acre river 
our lives will fall when the trees do said souza 
about 2000 people make a living tapping rubber and collecting 
wild nuts resins and other forest produce 
locals are scampering to accomodate the crush of visitors 
telephone booths are sprouting on street corners street curbs 
park benches and tree trunks are getting fresh coats of white and 
green paint 
telephone trucks television vans and food delivery trucks come 
headtohead with horse and steerpulled carts town workers are 
removing weeds from in front of the oneroom wooden courthouse 
to get to the village rubber tapper raimundo da silva maia 51 
walked 30 miles over 12 days through thick forest with more than 30 
pounds of rice beans and manioc slung in packs on his back 
if darly and darci are found not guilty only god will be able 
to saave my family and the rain forest said the father of 13 
hundreds of politicians including some government officials and 
many representatives of leftist workers party of which mendes was a 
member began to arrive late tuesday aboard chartered planes and 
buses from rio branco 110 miles away 
more than 100 state troopers were flown in to prevent violence 
between ranchers residents and rubber tappers roadblocks of 
heavily armed police were set up along the muddy rutted road that 
connects xapuri to rio branco

deposed president hussain muhammad 
ershad was placed under house arrest wednesday while the caretaker 
government prepared corruption charges against him 
ershad was moved under heavy guard to a house in the gulshan 
district formerly occupied by the british ambassador and once used 
by queen elizabeth ii 
home secretary azimuddin ahmed said ershad and his wife 
raushan were ordered held for 120 days under the special powers 
act which permits detention without charge 
acting president shahabuddin ahmed said last week he intended to 
repeal the widely resented law which ershad frequently invoked 
during his eightyear rule 
police who earlier arrested ershads home minister were 
searching for 12 other cabinet ministers and senior officials of 
his government ershads government collapsed last week after seven 
weeks of street protests 
a convoy of police and army vehicles escorted a grimlooking 
ershad to the twostory house guards were earlier cautioned not to 
salute or stand at attention when the 60yearold former army 
general arrived 
officers later said ershad complained he had not been given any 
food since tuesday night they quoted him as asking his military 
guards is this any reward for 38 years of army service 
ershad was confined with his wife and 8yearold son shahd he 
was later visited by at least one member of his wifes family no 
telephone was installed for his use 
thousands of political activists meanwhile paraded through 
main streets of dhaka the capital of 7 million people in what 
amounted to the kickoff of the campaign for elections to 
parliament the elections must be held within 90 days 
news of ershads arrest had not spread through the city and the 
marchers chanted slogans supporting their various parties 
demonstrators did not approach the gulshan house earlier however 
students marched toward the presidential office chanting hang 
ershad 
a leading constitutional lawyer said ershad would be tried 
probably by a special tribunal on charges of misappropriation of 
funds under anticorruption laws 
the tribunal and others created for other defendents would be 
headed by sitting supreme court justices and likely would be 
assisted by commissions of inquiry empowered to quickly assemble 
evidence said syed ishtiaq ahmed 
the existing court machinery is inadequate to deal with the 
enormity of the crimes and the high place of the people said 
ishtiaq who has been asked to join the interim cabinet 
ershads political opponents accused him or his wife of taking 
kickbacks on government deals amounting to millions of dollars 
they have offered no specific evidence 
nearly half of bangladeshs budget is covered by donations 
totaling 16 billion annually from international agencies and 
other nations the us contribution was projected to be 155 
million this year diplomats say the aid money is closely monitored 
to avoid corruption 
army troops pitched tents in the backyard of ershads luxurious 
prison and the house was surrounded by 150 policemen and soldiers 
floodlights lit up the house when night fell 
workmen completed preparations on the building just before 
ershad arrived installing air conditioners carpets and some 
furniture 
ershad previously remained secluded in his presidential 
residence in dhakas cantonment a heavily guarded military 
complex united news of bangladesh said he was only allowed to 
bring a blanket two pillows and a color television set from his 
home 
acting foreign minister fakhruddin ahmedi said the ministry was 
reviewing several ershad appointments which he said were 
irregular mohiuddin ahmed the alternate representative to the 
united nations who is ershads brotherinlaw has been recalled

lauro f cavazos the first hispanic american 
ever appointed to the cabinet resigned today as secretary of 
education 
he is the second member of president bushs cabinet to depart in 
recent weeks 
there was no immediate reason given for cavazos decision to 
resign and the resignation letter did not say what cavazos plans 
to do 
adminstration sources said that cavazos had tired of criticism 
aimed at his performance behind the scenes by white house chief of 
staff john h sununu his critics had faulted the education chief 
as an inadequate salesman for the administrations policies who 
never mastered television skills 
cavazos 63 has led the department of education since 1988 he 
was appointed by former president reagan and held over in the job 
by bush 
the resignation was announced at a meeting of bushs cabinet 
today 
cavazos did not attend the cabinet meeting he is out of town a 
white house aide said 
bush in a letter accepting cavazos resignation said for 
more than two years and under two presidents you have 
distinguished yourself through your devotion to improving the 
education of our nations children 
bush mentioned the cavazos resignation in passing today during a 
speech on education today before a group called jobs for americas 
gradutes calling cavazos my dear friend bush cited his 
contributions to setting national education goals and said i 
think the country will always be very very grateful to him for his 
service to country 
the department of education said ted sanders now the deputy 
secretary of education and former illinois schools chief would 
serve as acting secretary upon cavazos departure 
cavazos in his own letter said he was stepping down effective 
dec 15 
i am especially proud of the contributions i was able to make 
in expanding choice in education promoting the executive order on 
excellence in education for hispanic americans and raising 
awareness of the growing diversity of americas student 
population said cavazos former president of texas tech 
university 
i have only the greatest expectations and highest hopes that 
each child in america will be educated to his or her fullest 
potential said cavazos 
he is the son of a ranch foreman and zoologist by training 
cavazos departure had long been rumored he was one of the 
lowest profile members of bushs cabinet and was considered by many 
in the education community to be ineffective 
william bennett bushs drug policy director also resigned last 
month but subsequently agreed to become the next chairman of the 
republican national committee bennett cavazos predecessor at the 
department of education did not hold cabinet rank 
cavazos was a far less controversial secretary of education than 
bennett who warred with teacher unions and was an acerbic critic 
of americas universities 
cavazos made peace with the national education association and 
other leading groups in the socalled education establishment 
cavazos had campaigned for efforts to give parents more choice 
over what public school their child attends 
bush praised cavazos for his help and guidance in arranging 
last years education summit with the nations governors at 
charlottesville va which produced a set of education goals for 
elevating standards in americas schools 
those goals are the driving force behind our education 
agenda said bush your tireless promotion and pursuit of these 
goals has set us on a path to educational excellence through the 
end of the decade 
cavazos was only the fourth person to be secretary of education 
the post was created when education was elevated to cabinet status 
in 1980 during the carter administration 
labor secretary elizabeth dole announced her resignation in 
october the first of bushs cabinet to resign 
cavazos had earned a bachelors degree in zoology and a masters 
degree in cytology at the same school then known as texas 
technological college before getting a doctorate in physiology

associate professor at the medical college of virginia in 
richmond later he was dean of the school of medicine at tufts 
university in medford mass 
in 1980 he became the first alumnus and the first hispanic to 
be named president of texas tech

cavazos has two brothers who also attended texas tech and went on 
to successful careers bobby cavazos was an allamerican running 
back in college afterward he ran his own ranch brother dick 
became a fourstar army general

hands at dreidel the childrens game played during the holiday

candles lit during each day of the holiday saved from the warsaw 
ghetto and one rabbi likened bush to judah maccabee a heroic 
jewish warrior for standing up to iraqs saddam hussein 
hannukah emphasizes the courage to fight and overcome evil and 
wickedness said rabbi chaskel besser your actions in the 
persian gulf are in the true macabeean spirit 
judah maccabee and a small band of followers triumphed in 
ancient times against a stronger enemy 
bush called hanukkah a holiday of hope for it shows us the 
glory of god in our own lives and the power of miracles in the 
world 
bush said 150000 jews have emigrated from the soviet union this 
year alone including a girl at the ceremony lidia shestopalova 
the ancient story of the first hanukkah is one of victory over 
persecution aggression and intolerance said bush but the 
struggle has continued for your people through the centuries

a jewish congregation in newport ri pledging that the new 
government would sanction no bigotry or persecution

worship an ideal that we reaffirm here today said the 
president 
here is the text of bushs message released by the white house 
i am delighted to send greetings to jews in this country and 
around the world as you celebrate the festival of hanukkah 
the jewish religion is rich with tradition and this special 
holiday is one of both teaching and joy it commemorates the faith 
and the perseverance of judah maccabee and his followers who were 
able to defeat their oppressors and rededicate the temple in 
jerusalem according to tradition even though the maccabees could 
find enough purified oil in the temple to keep the sacred menorah 
burning for only one night of celebration the oil lasted for eight 
days and eight nights 
this story of abiding trust in the mercy and justice of the 
almighty continues to be a source of inspiration to jews around the 
world the miracle of the lights illustrates that the power of the 
lord can overcome what seem to be impossible obstacles and that 
working together to achieve common objectives can make the world a 
brighter place for all 
barbara and the entire bush family join with me in sending our 
best wishes for a memorable hanukkah

the us government valuable information about conditions inside 
kuwait and iraq over the past four months officials say 
one former hostage says he made a diagram of the strategic site 
in iraq where he was held as a human shield 
about threefourths of the hostages have voluntarily submitted 
to debriefing sessions with officials from the state department and 
the military 
hundreds have been interviewed and hundreds more have agreed 
to be interviewed joe reap a state department spokesman said 
tuesday 
another us official said the government is interested in 
information on the americans remaining in the two countries and 
anything else they might have seen while they were there and they 
might want to pass on 
miles hoffman 33 of roswell ga said he spent eight to 10 
hours earlier this month with air force intelligence officers who 
quizzed him about his captivity in kuwait and iraq 
hoffman a money manager in kuwait was evacuated in 
midnovember because he needed a bone graft on his arm which had 
been hit by a bullet he said he had been one of the human 
shields confined to two strategic sites in iraq 
i diagrammed the actual site hoffman said 
the state department said the debriefing sessions are voluntary 
for the returning hostages who are private citizens they have no 
obligation to submit to interviews with the government 
on the airplane home the evacuees were handed a piece of paper 
asking if they would like to provide information to the us 
government special teams are sent to question those who agree 
some former hostages however said they have had no contact 
with the us government 
bobby parker 49 of vidor texas said he was a human 
shield at a military installation about 25 miles north of 
baghdad parker arrived in houston on sunday on a flight arranged 
by former gov john connally 
parker said the installation was teeming with soldiers rockets 
helicopters and other military equipment i think it was a repair 
facility he said in a telephone interview 
but parker who worked for kuwait drilling co said no one has 
approached him to tell his story he received a call sunday from 
rep charles wilson dtexas who helped arrange for parkers son 
eric 25 to return home for a temporary leave from his assignment 
in saudi arabia with the army 
dawn bazner of palm desert calif said us officials were 
keen to talk to her about the attitude of the iraqis and other 
americans when she left the country in september 
but she said her husband mark hasnt talked with anyone since 
he returned sunday 
about 510 american citizens most of them children with dual 
citizenship have opted to remain in kuwait and iraq state 
department spokesman richard boucher said today 
the final american chartered flight is scheduled to leave early 
thursday with about 15 americans from iraq on board including the 
last remaining person who was a human shield 
the state department has not made a final decision on whether 
five diplomats at the us embassy in kuwait will be on the flight 
he said that will be made when officials determine there are no 
other americans who want out in kuwait 
after the uschartered flight end americans could presumably 
get out of kuwait on regular iraqi airways flights that have begun 
between kuwait city and baghdad he said 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the us government has 
evacuated 2520 american citizens and their family members on 13 
chartered flights 
americans whose paychecks were halted after the invasion are 
eligible to apply for financial aid from the us government

tens of thousands of albanians chanting 
democracy democracy hailed the founding today of their 
countrys first noncommunist party an eyewitness reported 
crowds surged into university square in tirana the albanian 
capital and cheered wildly as students and others addressed the 
throng announcing formation of the democratic party of albania 
said a tirana engineer reached by telephone from vienna 
chants of democracy democracy we want albania to be like 
europe and we want democratic albania reverberated from the 
huge peaceful crowd the engineer said he asked not to be 
identified by name 
however there was also a cheer for president ramiz alia for his 
decision to allow alternative political parties the engineer said 
alia met tuesday with students who had boycotted class since 
violent clashes with police on sunday hours before the communist 
party announced it would permit alternative political movements 
sack five members of the 13member ruling politburo and reshuffle 
the government 
the engineer said the new partys guiding committee would meet 
in coming days to choose a leader and that it intended to contest 
parliamentary elections scheduled in february 
we want to go ahead without blood absolutely without blood 
all will be solved by speaking and by discussion the man said 
the moves by albanias communist leadership came after daily 
student protests they appeared to signal a major defeat for 
communist hardliners in europes last bastion of stalinist rule 
albania a nation of 31 million that opened its borders 
slightly this year after decades of isolationism under the late 
enver hoxha would be the last country in europe to introduce a 
multiparty system 
one student died as a resultof injuries received when 
clubwielding police battled the students in the city of tirana 
during the weekend yugoslavias tanjug news agency said the 
report from the albanian capital citing an unidentified informant 
was monitored in vienna 
diplomats could not confirm the casualty report 
a student rally late tuesday ended with a decision by student 
leaders to found our own democratic party the austria press 
agency said citing an unidentified source in tirana 
demonstrations by thousands of students that began on sunday and 
have led to clashes with police have been the most serious since 
july when thousands of people took refuge in foreign embassies 
until were allowed to emigrate 
elections scheduled for feb 10 are seen as a test of the 
governments willingness to live up to pledges of gradual reform 
and of the peoples ability to exercise a measure of political 
freedom after decades of authoritarian rule 
some observers believed the politburo reshuffle and the call for 
the creation of independent parties amounted to a defeat of the 
hardliners led by nexhmie hoxha 69 widow of hoxha 
the communist party central committee also scheduled a party 
congress for june 1991 and a national party meeting on dec 26 to 
define the electoral platform of the party and endorse the list of 
its candidates for deputies to the peoples assembly 
the belgrade yugoslavia daily newspaper politika said students 
slogans tuesday included we want freedom and we demand 
democratic changes no violence or arrests were reported tuesday 
according to state radio tirana alia told the students he later 
met that top national leaders had followed the protests and from 
the beginning had expressed themselves in favor of dialogue 
among other demands students have sought more heat and light 
for their dormitories a severe drought has curbed supplies of 
power which comes mostly from hydroelectric plants 
alia has conceded that albanias economy is on the brink of a 
state of emergency

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
had an unprecedented meeting today with angolas anticommunist 
rebel leader jonas savimbi and discussed ways of ending angolas 
15year civil war 
the foreign minister has assured us of their desire to help 
the angolans achieve peace stability and democracy savimbi said 
after their 45minute meeting at the soviet embassy 
shevardnadze said that if there is a ceasefire it would be 
easier for us to address the possibility of a cutoff of arms the 
soviets have been providing arms to the leftist government in 
angola for more than a decade while savimbis forces have received 
us weaponry since 1986 
as shevardandze and savimbi met secretary of state james a 
baker iii was holding talks with angolan foreign minister pedro de 
castro van dunem 
shevardnadze described the flurry of diplomatic activity as 
being part of an interesting process aimed at bringing the 
angolan conflict to a peaceful conclusion 
savimbi made his appearance at the embassy shortly after van 
dunem conferred for about 45 minutes with shevardnadze 
the two meetings represented the most dramatic evidence yet of 
moscow and washington setting aside differences over angola to 
promote national reconciliation in the african country 
we are trying to do what we can to help bring the parties 
closer together so the next round of negotiations set for january 
in lisbon will be successful a state department official said 
tuesday 
savimbi is the leader of the unita rebel group that has been 
fighting angolas sovietbacked army for 15 years of the major 
third world civil conflicts nonehas dragged on longer than the 
one in angola 
the war has killed 350000 people the angolan government 
estimates 
the devastation of war has been compounded by drought that has 
affected a huge area of the southern part of angola a united 
nationssponsored relief effort began earlier this fall 
the soviets have spent billions of dollars in weaponry over the 
years in efforts to defeat savimbis forces the angolan army has 
received backing from cuban troops virtually since the start of the 
conflict although the last of the cuban contingent is scheduled to 
leave angola by next july under a 2yearold agreement 
shevardnadze announced the meeting as he was winding up talks 
tuesday in houston with baker 
a joint sovietamerican statement issued late tuesday said the 
session would include discussion of such issues as a ceasefire 
free participation of unita and other parties in angolas political 
process and the convening of free and fair elections with 
monitoring by neutral observers 
also on the agenda was the termination of deliveries of all 
lethal material to angola upon agreement on a ceasefire 
the negotiating environment for the january peace talks in 
lisbon seemed to brighten last weekend when angolas ruling mpla 
party agreed to a multiparty system 
ussoviet tensions over angola date back to 1975 when the 
leftist mpla faction took power following the end of portuguese 
colonial rule when south africa intervened cuba sent forces to 
defend the fledgling government 
the ford administration responded with a covert aid program for 
savimbi but congress prohibited all us military involvement the 
ban was lifted under president reagan and savimbi has received 
us support since 1986 
in late october congress approved legislation that would halt 
the 60 million aid program to the rebels if the angolan government 
agrees to a free election and the soviets halt arms deliveries to 
government forces

saddam hussein on wednesday replaced his aging defense minister 
with a battle hero and ordered building owners to install bomb 
shelters but the iraqi leader also met with an arab emissary to 
discuss ways to avoid war 
western analysts questioned why saddam hussein would change 
defense ministers now and speculated that the move indicated 
opposition within the military to saddams refusal to leave kuwait 
the iraqi announcement came as the evacuation of western 
captives neared completion 
twenty irish nationals three canadians and two italians flew 
from baghad to amman jordan on wednesday and americans were 
heading home from london and frankfurt germany where they flew on 
tuesday a final us evacuation flight from baghdad was set for 
thursday 
at the united nations diplomats said the foreign ministers of 
the united states britain france and the soviet union had agreed 
to meet in europe within a month to again demand iraqs full 
withdrawal from the emirate it seized aug 2 
the chief allies in the antiiraq coalition also intend to 
assure iraq that it will not face attack if it leaves kuwait before 
the jan 15 deadline set by the un security council the 
diplomats said on condition of anonymity 
in baghdad state radio said saddam fired gen abdeljaber 
khalil shanshal as defense minister he was replaced by maj gen 
saadi toma abbas a hero of the 198088 war with iran 
abbas who is in his 50s was credited as the strategist behind 
the defense of the southern port city of basra during that war 
using formidable defensive lines the iraqis who have an estimated 
450000 troops in and around kuwait have built a similar defense 
around the emirate 
abbas was the inspectorgeneral of the armed forces and a former 
deputy chief of staff the radio said 
the radio quoting a decree from saddam said shanshal 70 was 
retiring because of his age but military analysts questioned the 
timing behind the the firing which came a month after saddam 
sacked his military chief of staff 
this would tend to underline that there is opposition to his 
strategy of holding onto kuwait said paul rogers a defense 
analyst at englands bradford university and an expert of middle 
east military affairs 
the appointment of abbas could mean that saddam is less than 
ready to compromise on kuwait rogers said 
in a related development iraqs ruling baath party newspaper 
althawra said civil defense authorities have instructed all 
owners of buildings with two or more floors to convert their 
basements into shelters it ordered the owners to post signs 
informing people where to take cover 
under iraqi law landlords can be fined or imprisoned for 
failing to build the shelters and prepare them to receive people in 
time of war 
saddam however also talked peace on wednesday meeting with 
algerian president chadli bendjedid arab officials say bendjedid 
is trying to bring saudi arabia and iraq together to negotiate a 
settlement to the persian gulf crisis 
an arab diplomat in jordan speaking on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday that saudi officials have assured bendjedid they would

mounting discontent and a ruined economy 
are forcing reform in albania europes last bastion of stalinism 
where leaders are buying time by making surprising concessions 
three days of student protest in the albanian capital tirana 
prompted the startling decision tuesday by the ruling communists to 
permit other political movements five members of the 13member 
ruling politburo also were dropped and government changes promised 
the decisions came just before president ramiz alia head of 
state and of the ruling albanian labor party met a group of the 
striking students urging them to return to class and to work 
peacefully within the law for the reforms they seek 
students on wednesday announced formation of the countrys first 
noncommunist party the democratic party of albania to the cheers 
of crowds in the capital a witness reported 
albania has a turbulent history for centuries it was dominated 
by italian or ottoman turkish rulers and it gained true 
independence only after world war ii under the stalinist enver 
hoxha 
alia who took over when hoxha died in 1985 appears to be 
trying to contain an explosion of popular anger with swift 
political maneuvering and timely concessions 
in july he defused the most serious crisis to date allowing 
thousands of albanians jammed into foreign embassies in tirana to 
emigrate and reshuffling the leadership to offer the public 
scapegoats to blame for political repression and economic misery 
wage increases also were promised but albanians say they have 
not materialized 
but this afforded only temporary respite from the leaders basic 
dilemma how to make the changes needed to get the economy going 
while retaining control and avoiding open rebellion 
at a communist party meeting last month premier adil carcani 
painted a picture of catastrophe in the economy alia bluntly told 
workers on nov 29 that the economy is on the brink of a state of 
emergency 
the drought has severely curbed electric supplies mainly 
generated from hydroelectric stations in the countrys rugged 
mountains and affected crops grown on the fertile coatal plains 
the students protest that brought this weeks historic changes 
reportedly began with demands for more heat and light in their 
wintry tirana dormitories 
alia has attempted to ease food shortages particularly of meat 
by allowing private shops that sell at two or three times the state 
prices he has also promised imports of food and other items but 
lacks the necessary hard currency to carry out the pledge 
isolated for decades albania is also seeking foreign 
investment as alia himself warned the students tuesday that wont 
come if there is political instability 
but there is much cause for discontent in towns most homes are 
in slumlike threestory apartment blocks factories are outdated 
and extremely dilapidated in the countryside children trudge 
miles to school while women tend fields with primitive picks and 
hoes 
most albanians seem to express their disgust with this state of 
affairs by working less and less ignoring the leaderships many 
appeals to toil for economic improvement 
but a leadership steeped in decades of authoritarian rule is 
finding it hard to adjust to the new changes 
it remains to be seen whether any new political parties will be 
allowed to contest scheduled parliamentary elections in february 
the communists have made no mention of giving up their 
constitutional monopoly on power 
also a population unused to democracy might find it difficult 
to organize any opposition to the communists who have dominated 
public life since taking power in 1944 
students were a powerful force behind many of eastern europes 
revolutions last year and are among the few groups in albania who 
have the courage and unity to challenge the communists 
with the highest birth rate in europe albania is a country of 
young people about 75 percent of its 32 million people are under 
40 they learn about the outside world from television broadcasts 
from neighboring yugoslavia greece and italy and from the 
albanianlanguage service of voice of america 
this contact with the outside world and the reforms made this 
year have emboldened the young who do not have the deeply 
instilled fear of those who survived hoxhas harsh rule

faced with too many stray dogs and 
cats san mateo county officials have tentatively approved the 
nations first law that requires nearly all pets to be neutered to 
prevent unplanned litters 
the ordinance approved tuesday night would impose a moratorium 
on all breeding by private dog and cat owners for six months 
beginning in july 
after jan 1 1992 only dogs and cats owned by professional and 
hobbyist breeders who hold special permits would be allowed to 
reproduce all other cats and dogs in unincorporated areas of the 
county 15 miles south of san francisco would have to be neutered 
were very very pleased we definitely made history tonight 
and we hope others will follow suit around the country said 
sherry richert spokeswoman for the peninsula humane society 
supervisor tom nolan who wrote the ordinance agreed we took 
an historic first step toward solving the animal overpopulation 
problem 
nolan introduced the measure in october after learning the 
humane society kills 10000 strays each year 
if approved on final reading next tuesday the ordinance will 
become law setting up a committee to set the specific rules and 
fees for licensing professional and hobby breeders violators would 
be fined 500 
angry pet owners including professional and amateur breeders 
have threatened to sue if the law passes 
its going to be heavily litigated predicted mark rudy a 
lawyer representing local dog breeders 
our canine defense fund has 350000 in it and we will use 
it said bettyanne stenmark a member of responsible dog 
breeders of san mateo county 
a breeding moratorium is blackmail added j alan stern 
spokesman for the american kennel club he urged the board to seek 
other means of solving the problem and called for more education 
and tougher leash laws 
the board approved the ban 41 after a fourhour hearing that 
drew breeders from as far away as washington dc among those who 
spoke in favor of the measure was singer grace slick of the 
jefferson starship an animal rights activist who lives in marin 
county north of san francisco 
were users the human race one of the things we use the most 
are the animals slick said 
outside one of about 50 demonstrators against the ordinance 
carried a sign reading if the humane society had been in 
hollywood there would be no lassie

i want to thank you for our common effort thanks to which we 
achieved the greatest honor he spoke at a solidarity national 
commission meeting 
when he becomes president he said there will be big changes 
an earthquake but he pledged they will be peaceful 
solidarity spearheaded changes that led to the toppling of 
polands communist government and helped bring about peaceful 
revolutions elsewhere in eastern europe 
walesa urged the union to be active in free parliamentary 
elections this spring and to build a base to support his 
presidency through the transition to a capitalist economy and a 
european democracy 
there will be a great attack of the tyminskis walesa said 
referring to his rival who had won support from members of the 
former communist party we should be prepared so there will be no 
counterrevolution that could topple the president 
the national commission decided that union vice chairmen lech 
klaczynski and stefan jurczak will run solidarity until an 
emergency congress can be held perhaps as soon as next month to 
elect a new chairman 
the congress also likely will decide whether to form a political 
wing of solidarity or to confine itself to traditional union work 
representing workers in negotiations 
the union leadership passed a resolution thanking walesa 
solidaritys only chairman since its founding during shipyard 
strikes in august 1980 as the soviet blocs first legal free trade

reporters afterward 
he said walesa pledged to tend and care for the jewish 
tradition which was destroyed during the nazi holocaust and to 
provide for proper remembering and commemoration of the jewish 
warsaw ghetto uprising in 1943 
walesas campaign was dogged by accusations of antisemitism 
charges he vociferously denied 
tyminskis departure for canada followed an agreement with 
prosecutors who wanted to guarantee he would return to answer 
charges that at a campaign rally last month he slandered 
mazowiecki by accusing him of economic mismanagement and selling 
off state assets too cheaply 
the candidate was allowed to go after posting bond two senators 
and the election commissioner vouched for tyminski saying he 
should be allowed to spend christmas with his children in canada 
tyminski was seen off by 50 supporters chanting poland is 
with you i am of poland answered the candidate before

both firsttime home buyers and moveup buyers 
may find it somewhat more difficult to obtain a mortgage under rule 
changes announced wednesday by a major governmentsponsored 
purchaser of loans 
the federal home loan mortgage corp known as freddie mac said 
it would phase out its purchases of lowdocumentation mortgages and 
of adjustablerate mortgages with less than a 10 percent 
downpayment 
purchases of those types of loans both considered somewhat 
riskier than standard mortgages will be eliminated entirely after 
march 31 
in a lowdocumentation or nodocumentation loan the lender in 
order to speed the loan approval waives some of the usual proof 
demanded of the borrowers financial condition sometimes including 
income and employment verification 
typically socalled nodoc or lowdoc mortgages are used by 
people with substantial equity in a home they are selling and who 
want to get fast approval on a mortgage for a new home 
lowdownpayment adjustablerate mortgages are most popular with 
renters who barely have enough money to buy a home 
the federal national mortgage association fannie mae which 
announced two months ago that it was tightening its 
lowdocumentation loan program lauded freddie macs decision as 
a prudent and positive step 
both will continue to purchase alternativedocumentation 
mortgages in which a borrowers financial standing is verified with 
more easily obtainable documents such as paychecks stubs 
freddie mac estimates about 25 percent of the loans it is 
purchasing this year will be lowdocumentation mortgages it said 9 
percent of the adjustablerate loans in its portfolio are 
lowdownpayment mortgages 
james nelson president of the mortgage bankers association of 
america a trade group conceded that the changes will lengthen the 
loan processing time for some moveup buyers and pinch some 
firsttime home buyers but he said they were desirable because of 
the deterioration of the economy nationally and of home prices in 
some areas 
its a sound move given the times we are in he said 
fannie mae and freddie mac are congressionally chartered but 
stockholderowned companies they finance about one quarter of the 
nations singlefamily home sales by buying loans from banks and 
other lenders they retain some and repackage others into 
securities for resale to investors 
during the past year both companies have come under pressure 
from the treasury department to tighten their procedures although 
both have only limited government backing most investors assume 
they would be bailed out by the government if they got into 
trouble 
fannie mae continues to buy lowdownpayment adjustablerate 
mortgages it said it has not had a default problem with the loans 
because it purchases only from established lenders with a proven 
track record 
fannie mae senior vice president robert engelstad refused to 
disclose how many such loans the agency buys or the default rate

atampt and mci agreed wednesday to settle 
lawsuits that charged false advertising and customer theft and 
proposed new federal standards to prevent consumers from being 
switched from one longdistance company to another against their 
will 
american telephone amp telegraph co and mci communications corp 
which had sued one another over their multimilliondollar ad 
campaigns agreed to settle the suits out of court along with an 
atampt suit against mci and its telemarketing agent that alleged 
false and deceptive sales practices 
terms of the agreement were not disclosed 
mci spokeswoman pam small said company officials were bound by 
the agreement not to comment on the settlement 
but lest anyone think the two arch rivals were going to 
discontinue their allout scrap for new customers she said were 
still competitors 
and atampt spokesman herb linnen said his company will continue 
to pursue customers and try to retain existing ones with the same 
resourcefulness and aggressiveness we have pursued in the past 
that has included negative ad campaigns in which customers 
are shown getting fed up with sales pitches from mci or skits in 
which they declare competing longdistance companies should put 
their claims of lower prices and better service in writing 
but linnen said atampt wanted to get beyond the recent legal 
squabbling which he said is really not good for either atampt or 
mci or for the customer 
as part of the agreement the two companies agreed to propose to 
the federal communications commission industrywide standards to 
help prevent unauthorized switching of customers by longdistance 
companies 
state and federal authorities and local phone companies have 
received tens of thousands of complaints about unauthorized 
switching 
the proposed standards would permit switches only by one of the 
following means 
a customerinitiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to 
which the customer is switching 
independent thirdparty confirmation 
signed letter of authorization 
a call placed by the customer to their local or longdistance 
telephone company 
atampt which had claimed it was losing customers because of 
unauthorized switching by mci and its telemarketing agent had 
asked the fcc in january to require a customers written 
authorization before a switch could be made current rules require 
only that a longdistance company be able to present if demanded 
by a local phone company written authorization from a customer 
linnen said atampt still considered written preauthorization the 
best method but since the fcc has not acted atampt thought the 
compromise was better than waiting for the perfect solution that 
might never arrive 
the two companies along with us sprint have been locked in a 
fierce battle for customers atampt and mci or their agents have 
been placing calls to millions of phone users each month trying to 
get them to switch their longdistance service 
since the breakup of the old bell system in 1984 atampts share 
of the longdistance market has fallen to below 70 percent mci 
the nations second largest longdistance carrier now has about 15 
percent of the market 
mci had sued atampt in us district court in washington on oct 
10 1989 alleging false and deceptive advertising practices atampt 
countersued on oct 26 
on jan 10 this year atampt sued mci and its telemarketing agent 
in newark nj federal court alleging false and deceptive 
telemarketing practices 
both sides denied any wrongdoing and no dollar amounts were 
specified in the suits

germany and japan on wednesday disputed a 
us accusation that they have delivered barely onefifth of the 
aid they promised to back us military operations in the persian 
gulf 
chancellor helmut kohls chief spokesman hans klein said 
germany has already made available well over half of the 224 
billion it promised the defense ministry said the aid made 
available includes 109 billion in military equipment and 
transport 
some of the military supplies are waiting at german ports for 
delivery to the middle east said a defense ministry spokesman 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
klein said germany does not know the basis for these 
calculations the pentagons in any event they do not correspond 
with facts 
a japanese foreign ministry official said that of 4 billion 
pledged for the military effort and to support arab states affected 
by the gulf crisis 600 million has been spent 
the process for disbursing another 600 million in emergency 
loans for jordan and turkey will be completed very soon said 
another ministry official it is not the case that the japanese 
government is delaying disbursement he said 
both japanese officials spoke on condition of anonymity under 
normal briefing rules 
on tuesday pentagon spokesman pete williams said japan had 
delivered only 426 million in cash and material support and 
germany only 337 million 
neither japan nor germany has sent armed forces to the gulf 
citing constitutional restrictions 
of the six countries that offered the largest contributions to 
operation desert shield at its outset in august only kuwait has 
given all that it promised williams said 
he declined to comment on the reasons for the delayed 
contributions from other allies pledges totaling more than 65 
billion were made for calendar year 1990 
the spokesman said the united states plans to ask an undisclosed 
number of allied nations to increase their contributions for 1991 
he said he did not know how much money would be sought or when the 
requests would be made 
us sources said monday that desert shield may cost 30 billion 
in 1991 the pentagons original cost estimate was 15 billion but 
that was before president bush ordered huge reinforcements to the 
gulf on nov 8

parents who say their children thrived there are fighting the plan 
heres something that works people care about that school

the plan to temporarily close the alexandria village school 
school superintendent george corrette suggested the temporary

school board meeting monday

fewer than 300 people 
former alexandria school board member fletcher dewolf said a 
piece of history would be lost with the school eleven other 
oneroom schoolhouses in alexandria from the precivil war era have 
been turned into summer cottages he said

if they were transferred to the more impersonal environment of the 
larger regional elementary schools 
community involvement singles out the schoolhouse said lori 
benson who teaches its 17 first and secondgraders 
parents drop in daily to help with projects such as making 
applesauce and potting spider plants she said 
even in the face of rising property taxes several people at the 
board meeting said they would be willing to pay more to keep the 
school open 
a lot of the parents went here their grandparents went 
here said benson who has taught in the 800member community for 
two years its a very small community they love and support 
their oneroom schoolhouse

thousands of albanians chanting 
democracy democracy on wednesday hailed the foundation of the 
tiny stalinist countrys first noncommunist political party 
albanians reached by telephone said thousands of people surged 
into university square in tirana albanias capital to support 
students who won unprecedented concessions from the communist 
leadership in several days of protests 
the developments appeared to herald the end of oneparty rule 
not only in the balkan nation but in all of europe albania a 
country of just over 3 million has been the last on the continent 
to cling to oneparty communist rule 
president ramiz alia addressed the nation late wednesday and 
asked for calm 
he called on the political and patriotic conscience of you all 
to avoid mistakes which could have consequences for the entire 
country his taped radio message was monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp in london 
alia and his communist leadership declared tuesday that they 
would allow formation of noncommunist parties in albania which 
was isolated for decades by its hardline rulers 
the crowds cheered wildly wednesday as students and others 
announced formation of the democratic party of albania according 
to a tirana engineer reached by telephone from vienna 
zamira koleze a reporter for albanias official radio said 
students would try to register the party thursday at the ministry 
of justice 
the huge peaceful crowd chanted demcoracy democracy we 
want albania to be like europe and we want democratic 
albania the engineer said he spoke on condition of anonymity 
there was also a cheer for alia for allowing alternative 
political parties the engineer said 
an editor for the official ata news agency said those who 
attended the rally filled a big field as well as nearby hillsides 
and the staircases of a student residence 
it was without disorder completely regular koleze said 
it all went well when it was over everyone returned to their 
homes 
estimatesof the number of people who rallied ranged from 10000 
to 100000 
alia who has been seeking to slowly introduce moderate reforms 
succeeded tuesday in ousting five hardline members of the 
13member ruling politburo of the communist party he called on 
premier adil carcani to reshuffle the government as well 
the communist party formally called the albanian labor party 
decided to hold a national meeting dec 26 the meeting is to work 
out the partys electoral platform but it could also make more 
leadership changes 
the engineer said the new opposition partys guiding committee 
would meet soon to choose a leader he said the party intended to 
contest parliamentary elections scheduled for feb 10 
but it was not immediately clear whether the communists would 
allow the party to take part 
last month the legislature adopted a new election law 
permitting more than one candidate but officials said then that

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
extended the hand of reconciliation wednesday to the angolan 
anticommunist rebel leader whose forces have been at war with the 
sovietbacked government in angola for 15 years 
the foreign minister has assured us of their desire to help 
the angolans achieve peace stability and democracy insurgent 
leader jonas savimbi said after an unprecedented 45minute meeting 
with shevardnadze at the soviet embassy 
the most important thing is that all the big powers understand 
they can cooperate to find peace and stability of our country 
shevardnadze said if the mpla government and the unita rebels 
are able to reach a ceasefire agreement then it would be easier 
for us to address the possibility of a cutoff of arms 
the soviets have been a generous arms supplier of the mpla 
government since 1975 the united states has been aiding savimbis 
forces for the past four years 
the bush administrations rationale for continuing to arm unita 
is that the leftist government would otherwise have less incentive 
to negotiate a settlement 
the end of the cold war generally has had little impact on the 
series of regional conflicts spawned during the era of 
sovietamerican hostility 
for some time though the momentum has been on the side of a 
political settlement in angola as opposed to a military victory by 
either side that perception was underscored when savimbi ascended 
to the second floor of the soviet embassy wednesday for his meeting 
with shevardnadze passing below a large portrait of lenin while en 
route 
almost simultaneously secretary of state james a baker iii was 
meeting with angolan foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem 
the idea of a savimbishervardnadze meeting was first broached 
privately by baker when he met here with savimbi in early october 
to make sure van dunem could arrive on time for the hastily 
arranged talks the bush administration took the unusual step of 
allowing the angolan aircraft in which he flew here to land at 
nearby andrews air force base md sources close to van dunem 
said he went straight to the soviet embassy for a meeting with 
shevardnadze 
after his talks with baker van dunem said progress is being 
made towards an agreement which can lead to a ceasefire 
wednesdays discussions will be followed up on thursday with a 
fiveparty meeting involving representatives of the two angolan 
factions the united states the soviet union and portugal the 
former colonial power which has been mediating the conflict 
portugals chief mediator jose manuel durao barroso told 
reporters in the angolan capital of luanda on tuesday that a 
ceasefire agreement could be in place by march a stumbling block 
is the timing of an election once a cease fire is reached 
angolan president jose eduardo dos santos said recently he 
believes an election could be held within three years of a 
ceasefire but savimbi in a written statement issued after his 
meeting with shevardnadze said he told the soviet diplomat that a 
long delay would risk the collapse of the truce 
dos santos has said he believes that an extended delay is 
required because roads have to be cleared of mines and problems 
involving voter registration

the nation should raise its educational sights 
to reach world class standards president bush said wednesday 
american kids already rank too low compared to our chief 
industrial competitors bush said at an awards ceremony for the 
jobs for americas graduates program americas schools must and 
will aspire to worldclass standards 
he said schools have been stifled with requirements and red 
tape lets give our schools something teachers and principals 
dont have enough of authority 
bush invoked a catchword empowerment which is emerging 
among some officials as an administration theme for achieving 
better educational performance 
using the empowerment notion by allowing parents to decide what 
schools their children should attend is the fundamental reform 
that drives forward all the others in education bush said 
parental choice involves a variety of methods to allow parents 
to send their children to public schools outside their 
neighborhoods 
weve got to raise our sights for our students for our 
schools bush said 
jobs for americas graduates is a 19state program that helps 
place high school graduates in job training programs the 
organization is funded privately with matching funds from the job 
training partnership act and with state funds 
as vice president bush was a founding member of the board of 
directors 
he said the program has helped lowincome young people who might 
otherwise have had little career success

the federal election commission said wednesday 
that two fundraising committees for former house speaker jim 
wright accepted an illegal contribution from a texas businessmen 
later imprisoned in connection with the savings and loan scandal 
fec spokesman scott moxley said wrights principal fundraising 
committee and his leadership political action committee have agreed 
to pay penalties totaling 1500 to settle the case 
at issue was wrights use of a chartered airplane that 
crisscrossed texas between june 30 and july 2 1985 to promote a 
cowtown jamboree in fort worth the fundraiser sought 1 
million for wrights principal campaign committee the wright 
appreciation committee and his leadership pac the majority 
congress committee 
wright a fort worth democrat who was house majority leader at 
the time was on his way to haiti wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment a spokesman said 
under the conciliation agreement the two committees 
acknowledged they accepted an illegal contribution from the owner 
of the plane kenneth c hood and that they failed to disclose the 
receipt of the contribution the committees also acknowledged a 
violation stemming from the way they repaid hood for the use of the 
plane 46 months later moxley said 
wright repaid hood 8050 in april 1989 in the midst of a house 
ethics committee investigation that led to his resignation a month 
later at the time wright said the failure to pay the bill was an 
oversight 
hood had purchased the plane from sunbelt savings association a 
failed thrift in dallas through a 13 million loan from sunbelt 
hood owed sunbelt savings 90 million by the end of 1986 the fec 
said 
hood told the fec that edwin mcbirney then owner of sunbelt 
savings association said wright needed the airplane and that 
mcbirney promised that he and thomas m gaubert owner of another 
sampl would pay for the trip 
after the flight hood said mcbirney and gaubert told him that 
it would be a positive gesture to absorb some of the costs 
moxley said hood then billed them 8050 twothirds of the actual 
cost moxley said 
gaubert told the fec he was merely a passenger on the flight and 
was not connected to the campaign committee or to hood moxley 
said mcbirney denied he pressured hood to let wright use the jet 
gaubert whose sampl was closed by state regulators in 1987 had 
persuaded wright to intervene with federal regulators on behalf of 
the irvingbased thrift independent american savings association 
fecs general counsel had recommended that the commission find 
wright violated the law because he was on the airplane but the fec 
found no reason to believe that was the case the commission also 
said it had no reason to believe mcbirney or gaubert paid for any 
costs of the flight 
the commission however said it found reason to believe hood 
made excess illegal contributions to wright 
hood was sentenced feb 15 1990 to two years in prison and 
fined 50000 for making false statements to a federally insured 
institution sunbelt savings he also was sentenced to five years 
probation and fined another 50000 for conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service 
mcbirney was indicted in july on 17 counts alleging bank fraud 
misappropiation of funds false entries and making false 
statements to regulators

secretary of state james a baker iii 
hopes the soviet british french and chinese foreign ministers 
will join him in europe this month to demand again that iraq 
withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 diplomats said wednesday 
the foreign ministers would also assure iraq that it wont be 
attacked if iraqi troops leave kuwait by that date the diplomats 
said on condition of anonymity 
the ministerial meeting by the five permanent security council 
members would be intended to abolish any impression that iraq could 
retain two islands that control access to the shattalarab 
waterway or part of an oilfield straddling the iraqkuwait border 
baker has said however that when the emir of kuwaits 
government is restored to power iraq and kuwait could then 
negotiate any economic and territorial disputes between them 
diplomats said the permanent security council members dont want 
saddam hussein to feel that the usled multinational force in the 
persian gulf is determined to attack iraq whether it obeys the 
council or not 
saddam would have no motive to withdraw if he believed attack is 
inevitable they said 
the foreign ministers would meet in europe after iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz meets president bush in washington this month 
but before baker goes to baghdad for talks with saddam the 
diplomats said 
baer has been waiting for word from baghdad on a date to see 
saddam since he turned down jan 12 because it was too close to the 
unordered jan 15 deadline for withdrawal of iraqi troops 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who is in 
washington for talks with baker and bush said tuesday that it is 
very important that a goodwill grace period that expires on jan 15 
is taken up by a very active diplomatic and political effort 
shevardnadze said we pin much hope on the coming contacts 
the united states britain france and the soviet union agree 
in principle that their foreign ministers should meet in europe 
with chinas foreign minister to send a message to baghdad 
diplomats said 
chinas willingness to participate is in question because 
beijing opposes using military force to drive iraq from kuwait 
china abstained when the security council voted 122 on nov 29 
to adopt a resolution authorizing un members to use all necessary 
means including military force to liberate kuwait unless iraq 
withdraws by jan 15

president slobodan milosevic and his 
renamed communist party crushed all opposition in firstround 
balloting in serbia yugoslavias largest republic according to 
official results released wednesday 
milosevic the hardline leader of the former serbian communist 
party carried 65 percent of the vote caslav ignjatovic the head 
of the serbian electoral commission told reporters 
that was enough to be reelected to serbias powerful presidency 
outright his leading challenger vuk draskovic of the serbian 
renewal movement won only 164 percent 
milosevics socialist party the renamed communist party 
crushed all opposition in the firstround vote sunday capturing 87 
of the 250 parliamentary seats in the republics first multiparty 
election since 1938 the results showed 
runoff elections will take place in 152 electoral districts 
where no candidates won a majority twenty opposition parties on 
wednesday announced they would form a coalition to oppose 
milosevics socialist party in the second round dec 23 
milosevic captured 65 percent of the vote a 4to1 triumph 
over his nearest challenger draskovic according to the serbian 
electoral commission 
his party won 458 percent of the parliamentary vote the 
serbian renewal movement won 157 percent and independent 
candidates 9 percent more than 20 other parties took smaller 
percentages of the vote 
the runoffs are not expected to substantially alter the 
overwhelming victory of the socialists 
the sweeping victory along with a similar communist victory in 
the neighboring republic of montenegro may push yugoslavias 
fragile federation one step closer to disintegration 
milosevics win threatens to deepen the rift between serbia and 
westernminded republics of croatia and slovenia 
while serbia is holding its runoff elections slovenia will be 
voting in a plebiscite on independence from yugoslavia 
the slovenian daily nezavisni dnevnik ascribed the socialist 
victory primarily to the fact that the authority had the power to 
introduce a veritable media occupation of serbia 
the socialists victory in serbia was marred by a boycott in 
kosovo province which is dominated by ethnic albanians 
elections there will have to be repeated in 30 of 34 districts 
in which less than half of the voters participated 
communist authorities in serbia dissolved kosovos parliament 
and government and shut down influential albanianlanguage media 
after parliament tried to proclaim kosovo a republic earlier this 
year 
the serbian leaders said they had to take control to prevent 
kosovo from seceding from serbia and yugoslavia to join neighboring 
albania and to protect the nonalbanian population 
in runoff balloting the boycott will be ineffective because a 
simple majority of the voters who cast ballots will be enough to 
elect deputies

saddam hussein has dismissed his aging 
defense minister and replaced him with a battlehardened commander 
who was a hero of the war with iran iraqs official media reported 
wedneday 
it was the second major shuffle in iraqs high command in a 
month 
baghdad radio quoting a presidential decree said the 
70yearold defense minister gen abdeljabbar khalil shanshal 
was retiring because of his age he held the post for just over a 
year 
the radio said the new defense minister is maj gen saadi tuma 
abbas the inspectorgeneral of the armed forces and a former 
deputy chief of staff 
abbas who is in his fifties was a hero of the 198088 war with 
iran he commanded the defense of basra against the iranians whose 
attacking armies came within a few miles of the southern port city 
he was the strategist behind the formidable defensive lines 
built to protect basra from iranian human wave assaults the 
iraqis who have an estimated 450000 troops in and around kuwait 
have built similar fortifications around kuwait 
abbas later commanded troops involved in heavy fighting with the 
iranians in the southern iraq theater the main battleground in 
that conflict 
shanshals dismissal comes just over a month before the un 
security councils jan 15 deadline for him to quit kuwait or face 
a possible military assault 
some analysts said that by appointing abbas saddam was 
underscoring readiness to go to war 
us officials have reported a steady buildup of iraqi forces in 
kuwait and southern iraq in recent weeks they estimate there are 
now more than 500000 troops half saddams army in the kuwait 
theater 
by midjanuary the iraqis will face a 650000strong usled 
multinational force with formidable firepower in the region 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in cyprus quoted 
saddam as telling shanshal in a letter that it had been agreed 
earlier that your assumption of this post would not exceed two 
years and would not be less than one year 
shanshal was named a minister of state for military affairs the 
post he held before he was appointed defense minister analysts 
said the post carries no authority or influence 
it may be that shanshal supported negotiations and supported a 
position that represented too much of an adjustment in saddams 
attitude for him to be able to accept said don kerr an analyst 
with londons international institute for strategic studies 
the implication is that hes making sure that all those 
involved in military decisionmaking will toe the line said paul 
rogers a defense analyst at englands bradford university and an 
expert of middle east military affairs 
appointing an officer of abbas caliber could mean that saddam 
is less than ready to compromise on kuwait rogers said in a 
telephone interview 
saddam dismissed his chief of staff lt gen nazir alkhazraji 
nov8 in a surprise shuffle 
analysts said at the time it indicated dissent within the upper 
echelons of the army over the aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the 
risk of a showdown with the usled multinational force 
us officials said khazraji who had been one of saddams inner 
circle of military advisers was apparently sacked for opposing 
saddams strategy 
syrian newspapers and arab sources later reported that khazraji 
and seven other senior officers were executed but there was no 
independent confirmation of that and no official word in baghdad 
khazraji was replaced by gen hussein rashid deputy chief of 
staff for operations and commander of the elite republican guards 
divisions 
he is a hardliner and comes from takrit saddams hometown 
north of baghdad the iraqi leader has filled key positions with 
relatives and others from takrit

about 3500 americans were trapped by 
iraqs invasion of kuwait but most of those wanting to leave had 
already made their way out by the time saddam hussein agreed last 
week to free all foreigners 
by wednesday four days after the mass releases of westerners 
began under saddams decree the state department said only a few 
americans were known to be awaiting evacuation from iraq 
the final american chartered flight is scheduled to leave early 
thursday with about 15 americans from iraq expected aboard 
including the last remaining captive who served as a human 
shield at a strategic site us officials said 
since iraq invaded kuwait the us government has evacuated 
2520 american citizens and their family members on 13 chartered 
flights the department said 
about 510 american citizens most of them children with dual 
citizenship have opted to remain in kuwait and iraq boucher said 
iraq sealed its borders aug 9 a week after its lightning 
takeover of kuwait the border closing came the same day the first 
american troops landed in saudi arabia to defend the kingdom 
against any further iraqi aggression 
in the early days of the crisis an undetermined number of 
americans managed to escape many by driving across the the desert 
to remote border crossings 
early on foreign governments were reluctant to refer to the 
trapped foreigners as hostages fearing that would inflame the 
situation at a time when their release might still be arranged 
but iraqi troops began rounding up westerners and it became 
clear that saddam intended to try to use them to force concessions 
from western governments forming a coalition against him 
on aug 20 fears for the safety of trapped westerners were 
heightened when iraq said some of the captives were being scattered 
at strategic sites around the country to serve as human shields 
against attack 
the first large group of americans allowed to leave consisted of 
52 wives and children of diplomats at the american embassy in 
kuwait they were permitted to cross overland into turkey on aug 
26 but were forced to leave husbands and fathers behind 
on aug 28 denounced by governments around the world for his 
hostageholding saddam said all foreign women and children would 
be free to leave us officials chartered flights to ferry them 
out 
the first uschartered jet to evacuate americans and other 
westerners left baghdad on sept 1 for london and washington 
by the time the tenth american charter left on nov 18 us 
diplomats estimated 2300 to 2400 americans had managed to leave 
iraq and kuwait 
after the series of uschartered flights americans continued 
to trickle out of iraq some got out on regularly scheduled flights 
to jordan others departed on planes chartered by other governments 
and still others on flights arranged by various dignitaries who 
traveled to iraq to bargain for hostages 
the private hostagefreeing missions caused some dissent within 
the antiiraq alliance the us government saw saddams piecemeal 
release of the hostages as a bid to divide the coalition 
on nov 18 iraq offered to release all the hostages in batches 
over a threemonth period extending from christmas to march 25 if 
nothing happened to mar the atmosphere of peace that was seen 
by us officials as an effort by saddam to drag out the process 
during a likely time frame for any attack 
saddam also said hostages relatives could come for 
christmastime visits and suggested that those who traveled to iraq 
might be allowed to bring loved ones home with them that prompted 
some relatives to make the trip to baghdad against state 
department advice 
last thursday with the numbers of hostages dwindling daily 
saddam decided to release all foreigners his rubberstamp 
parliament endorsed the decision on friday 
former us treasury secretary john connally flew out of iraq 
last saturday with 21 former american hostages they were the first 
to leave in the wake of saddams decision although their release 
was arranged prior to it 
on sunday the evacuation began in earnest a uschartered 
iraqi airways jet took 174 americans and 149 other westerners to 
frankfurt fourteen other americans left baghdad on tuesday on a 
british charter to london and on an american charter to frankfurt

president bush today announced plans to meet 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow feb 1113 and 
said he hopes the two will be able to sign a treaty slashing 
longrange nuclear weapons 
bush also said he was making the soviets eligible for credits 
totaling 1 billion to buy us agricultural products ranging from 
grain to cheese 
the soviet union faces tough times bush said at a rose 
garden appearance also attended by soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii 
the twin announcements provided a fresh reminder of how much 
ussoviet relations have progressed in a few years from grim 
superpower rivals to partners in the effort to force iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait and negotiate reductions in nuclear weapons 
shevardnadze hailed bushs comments as a very important 
statement and said he looked forward to seeing bush and gorbachev 
sign the arms control treaty which has been years in negotiations 
he said he also looked forward to agreements covering trade 
science technology and investments 
the arms control treaty would reduce the most powerful and 
dangerous nuclear weapons in both countries arsenals by about 30 
percent 
bush granted the soviets a temporary waiver of legislation that 
has linked expanded ussoviet trade to liberalized soviet 
immigration policy 
bush said he welcomed the generally excellent progress of 
the past year during which the soviets have permitted tens of 
thousands of jews to emigrate to israel 
but he added i still look forward to the passage of a soviet 
immigration law 
bush departed the rose garden without taking questions from 
reporters 
baker told reporters that some highly technical issues remain to 
be settled before the arms control treaty can be signed but he 
expressed hope the obstacles could be cleared in time for the 
february summit 
baker and shevardnadze met monday and tuesday in houston to 
discuss the arms treaty food aid and other issues affecting their 
two countries 
the two nations have already begun to eliminate short and 
mediumrange nuclear weapons and a treaty slashing nonnuclear 
forces in europe was signed at a ceremony last month in paris 
baker said the main issues still to be resolved on a longrange 
treaty involve verification 
a february bushgorbachev summit would be the fifth meeting 
between the two presidents in a little more than a year the two 
men held their first summit last december in malta and have since 
met in washington helsinki and paris 
bush met with his cabinet earlier today to put the finishing 
touches on the aid package 
shevardnadze said he knew that it was not easy for the president 
to waive the legislation im sure everyone in the soviet union 
will welcome and appreciate that decision he said

three of the miniature porkers were to be among the menagerie in 
the biosphere ii project scheduled to begin in march there was a 
possibility that one of the critters might become dinner for the 
closed environments human tenants 
theyre domestic pets theyve never been raised or used for 
food in this country said ingrid henze 32 of los angeles a 
pig owner who protested 
fear not their ribs have been spared 
the portly potbellied porcus has been removed from the larder 
the ossabaw swine a feral pygmy breed found in georgia will 
forage in its stead 
the pigs were to join about 3800 other plant and animal species 
and a crew of four men and four women in march on a twoyear stay 
in a 3acre sealed compound like a giant greenhouse 
the biospheres areas of desert ocean marshes savannah and 
rain forest make it the most comprehensive effort to duplicate 
earths environment as a possible prototype for space living 
its environments plus an intensive agriculture area and housing 
for the humans will be sealed and all air water and wastes will 
be recycled 
pigs are needed because they are extremely efficient recyclers 
capable of rapidly converting to fertilizer roughages such as the 
stems of broccoli plants that other animals will not touch 
sort of like a quick compost machine said biosphere 
spokeswoman kathleen dyhr 
and in a closed environment smallness counts 
potbellied pigs weigh 50 to 150 pounds about the size of the 
georgia pig some varieties of swine raised for food weigh up to 
1000 pounds 
a proposal to substitute the georgia pig as more appropriate for 
the biospheres needs had been under review for about the last nine 
months independently of the pig people ms dyhr said 
she said biosphere ii received four or five complaints but she 
declined to say if they caused the switch she noted that several 
animal species including types of deer chicken and goat have 
been changed during the planning 
and in any case said kayla mull these are not good pork 
chops these are lardhogs they make fat mrs mull has bred 
potbellied pigs since 1985 through creatures of comfort in norco 
near los angeles 
the wild georgia pigs accustomed to the warm and humid climate 
in biosphere ii also will be more adaptable to eating greens ms 
dyhr said their role as ham will be secondary though they are 
more suitable for meat production than the potbellied pigs she 
added 
another factor against the potbellied variety ms dyhr said 
was that theyre expensive 
their popularity as pets means a healthy neutered male tamed 
and vaccinated can cost 1500 to 2500 and breeding stock at 
least 5000 said kiyoko hancock she operates the international 
gold star registry service publishes pig tale times and breeds 
potbellied pigs in pescadero calif south of san francisco 
the pets also known as chinese potbellied pigs are indigenous 
to southeast asia mrs hancock said virtually all the animals in 
the united states stem from potbellieds sent from vietnam to the 
east berlin zoo in the 1950s twelve sows and four boars were 
imported from germany into canada around 1985 with offspring 
brought into this country she said 
mrs mull put the potbellied pig population at between 6000 and 
10000 multiplying like mice 
ms henze and her boyfriend have had their porcine pal named 
forbes for more than a year she had wanted a pet more 
sophisticated and interesting than a dog without smell barking 
shedding or fleas 
and weve never been happier she said hes small hes 
clean hes quiet hes basically a housepig hes housebroken 
hes a very sophisticated intelligent animal very interesting 
said mrs mull visualize a dog that never smells bad never 
has to have a bath that will sleep on the bed all night without 
waking you up barking at the sound of a fire engine

here is the text of president bushs remarks 
wednesday on aid to the soviet union and plans for a feb 1113 
summit in moscow to sign a strategic arms reduction treaty or 
start 
 
i have just had an opportunity to discuss with foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze a number of issues of ussoviet relations 
including cooperation in the persian gulf and im pleased with 
the great progress weve made on start and hopeful that well be 
ready to sign a treaty at a summit in moscow on feb 11 through 13 
we also talked at length about the situation in the soviet union 
and the response of the united states to the economic problems 
there i asked minister shevardnadze to convey to president 
mikhail gorbachev my desire to respond both to the shortterm 
needs of the soviet union and to contribute to fundamental economic 
reform ive long supported perestroika and continue to 
we discussed frankly the relationship of economic change in the 
soviet union to the critical task of democratization and i 
reiterated our strong desire to see both political and economic 
reform continue because they are inextricably linked i outlined 
specific and important steps that were willing to take in support 
of reform and after consulting closely with secretary of 
agriculture clayton yeutter as well as secretaries nicholas 
brady of treasury and james a baker of state i told 
minister shevardnadze that i am prepared to respond to a soviet 
request for credit guarantees for purchase of agricultural 
commodities through a waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment while 
ive taken this step i still look forward to a passage of the 
soviet immigration law codifying the generally excellent practices 
of the past year and this then will permit us to make further 
progress toward the normalization of the ussoviet economic 
relationship 
in addition we have proposed to the soviets a special technical 
assistance project to help in assessing their food distribution 
problem and to support market reforms 
i will also authorize a joint publicprivate medical assistance 
effort to help the soviet union cope with immediate shortages of 
pharmaceuticals and basic medical supplies 
in the longer term only steps that the soviet union itself 
takes can assure the economic health there thus to promote 
fundamental economic reform i will propose that the world bank and 
the imf international monetary fund work out with the soviet 
union a special association to give the ussr access to the 
considerable financial and economic expertise of those 
institutions 
i have asked secretary of the treasury nick brady as us 
governor of both institutions to pursue this proposal with them 
and also without other allies whom im sure will be in accord 
as ive said before i want perestroika to succeed the soviet 
union is facing tough times difficult times but i believe that 
this is a good reason to act now in order to help the soviet union 
stay the course of democratization and to undertake market reforms 
the united states has an interest in a soviet union able to play a 
role as a full and prosperous member of the international community 
of states and im hopeful that these initiatives will further that 
goal

investigators found a broken emergency release in 
the tail of a northwest airlines dc9 in which eight people died 
after it collided with another plane on a runway federal officials 
said wednesday 
a flight attendant and a passenger tried to escape through the 
hatch but the two died after the release jammed and trapped them 
inside the detroit news reported wednesday citing an unidentified 
source 
a boeing 727 was racing toward takeoff at detroit metropolitan 
airport on dec 3 when it struck the taxiing dc9 which had turned 
in front of it the northwest 727s right wing clipped the dc9 
behind the copilots seat and knocked an engine off the dc9 the 
ensuing fire moved quickly through the dc9 which had 39 
passengers and four crew members aboard 
the 145 passengers and eight crew on the 727 escaped injury 
investigators have found after extensive testing that the 
interior tail cone release mechanism failed to separate the tail 
cone and deploy the emergency slide national transportation 
safety board member john lauber said 
the interior release handle was found partially raised from 
its stowed position during the safety boards initial examination 
investigators inspected the interior release handle and have found 
the stem of the handle broken 
the source told the newspaper that investigators determined the 
flight attendant and the passenger made it through one emergency 
hatch to a catwalk in the planes tail cone and one of them pulled 
a red handle designed to pop off the tail cone and release a slide 
alan pollock an ntsb spokesman said the board was only 
reporting the broken handle and wouldnt speculate on whether the 
flight attendant or passenger had pulled it we cant get into 
that kind of analysis at this time he said 
the ntsb did not interpret the findings and neither can 
northwest the airline said in a statement spokesman doug miller 
said airline officials wouldnt elaborate 
the airline checked the tailcone release mechanisms on its 139 
dc9s sunday night and monday said spokesman bob gibbons from 
northwest headquarters in eagan minn 
the unidentified investigator told the news the bodies of flight 
attendant heidi joost 43 of dearborn and kingsley brown 30 of 
pittsburgh were found a few feet from the tail cone release lever 
autopsies showed joost died of soot and smoke inhalation and 
brown died of head injuries along with soot and smoke inhalation 
christy clapp a northwest spokeswoman said the red handle in 
the tail cone section pulls cables that release four latches 
holding the cone 
the cone is springloaded and designed to pop away from the 
aircraft clapp said she said an inflatable slide automatically 
deploys from the tail hatch 5 feet above the ground allowing 
people to escape 
cheri quinn an offduty northwest flight attendant who was on 
the dc9 said a similar chute at the planes left front exit 
failed to open and passengers were forced to jump or were lowered 
to the ground the chute at the front right side of the plane 
opened properly

a heartstopping lurch shattered windows and 
plunged the cars into darkness as train lights went out then the 
passengers had to make their way above ground through thick gritty 
smoke from a diesel fire 
others were trapped below ground and had to wait for crews to 
pull them from the wreckage 
it was a commuter nightmare come to life wednesday when an 
amtrak train derailed and smashed into a massachusetts bay 
transportation authority train at a back bay station injuring 264 
people 
jeffrey weitzenkorn who travels daily on the train from his 
hometown of stoughton had been reading the newspaper and was 
getting ready to move out of his chair when the amtrak train hit 
there was a big bang and i got thrown to the floor i went 
into a fetal position to protect myself said weitzenkorn who 
suffered bruises on his face lost his glasses and hurt his knee 
joe povoas a passenger on the commuter train said that 
immediately after the crash one fellow passenger said lets 
everybody keep calm and go out of the exits calmly 
people filed out the open car doors and began groping for an 
exit through the smoke 
you just dont have a concept of when youre going to get 
fresh air said povoas 35 who has used the train for seven 
years 
finally passengers found stairs leading out of the station 
it was like a chimney the smoke was just flowing up the 
stairway he said 
lt mike walsh a firefighter who arrived at the scene two 
minutes after the first alarm said there were no signs of panic 
there was an eerie calm said walsh whose face was black 
with soot 
walsh like other firefighters said he gave his oxygen mask 
away to victims i dont even know where it is now he said 
fire lt jack joyce brought breathing equipment for two amtrak 
engineers and waited with them for more help to arrive while other 
firefighters kept flames at bay outside the car they were 
totally dazed and completely out of it joyce said adding that 
they suffered head injuries 
the trains were so mangled that joyce said he had no idea what 
part of the train the engineers were trapped in all we were 
doing was crawling into holes he said 
at the point of impact the trains were indistinguishable from 
one another smashed and twisted together like a coathanger 
walsh said 
the crash took out concrete and steel support columns in the 
train tunnel and buckled the road above one set of railroad 
tracks was tangled and pushed several feet up against a wall a 
diesel leak left the station smelling like a fuel tank 
one car was carrying mail and dieselsoaked christmas catalogs 
were strewn around the site of the crash

the food and drug administration said 
wednesday it will soon impose minimum quality standards for medical 
gloves worn by health care workers to protect themselves agaist 
aids and other diseases 
the federal centers for disease control in atlanta recommends 
that physicians dentists and other health care workers wear 
protective rubber or plastic gloves 
under current fda regulations manufacturers of medical gloves 
conduct their own testing the fda had no standard it could 
enforce 
new regulations published in wednesdays federal register and 
scheduled to go into effect in 90 days will standardize the 
testing and define the failure rates the agency said 
it said gloves that do not meet the standards will be seized if 
necessary to keep them off the market 
as part of the new testing the agency said randomly selected 
samples of gloves will be examined for tears holes and any foreign 
matter embedded in the gloves the gloves will also be filled with 
about a quart of water and checked for leaks 
sale for medical uses will be forbidden for batches of gloves if 
leaks are found in more than 25 per 1000 for surgeons gloves and 
40 per 1000 for patientexamination gloves surgeons gloves were 
given a stricter standard because they are in contact with a 
patients blood and other bodily fluids for a longer period of time 
than those used in examining patients 
the centers for disease control knows of 20 published cases in 
which a health care worker has been infected with the aids virus on 
the job 
most of these were believed to have been accidental needle 
pricks but at least four were believed to have been infected when 
chapped or scratched skin was exposed to the virus

portauprince haiti ap the selfproclaimed head of the 
tonton macoute militia vowed on wednesday to prevent a leftist 
roman catholic priest from becoming haitis president 
haitis first democratic national elections since independence 
are scheduled for sunday the rev jeanbertrand aristide who is 
adored by the caribbean countrys impoverished masses is widely 
viewed as the frontrunner 
the 37yearold aristide who was ousted from his order for 
political activism was denounced by tonton macoute chief roger 
lafontant who called him a menace and an ultracommunist 
we will do everything to prevent this danger my country will 
never be delivered to communism said lafontant who himself was 
barred from contesting the election 
aristide is an advocate of liberation theology which holds that 
the roman catholic church should help the poor better their lives 
through political action 
lafontant said he was not calling for violence by his forces 
but said there is always something bad that can happen 
we will do our best to prevent it he said 
aristide advised of the remarks said lafontant has a right 
to say whatever he wants but he said the law has to be 
followed 
lafontant told reporters he would ask the police and army to 
increase security for the balloting more than 600 international 
observers including former president jimmy carter and 
representatives from the united nations and organization of 
american states will monitor the vote 
lafontant who was one of 11 candidates disqualified from 
participating in the election for technical reasons by the 
independent electoral board fled haiti after the overthrow of 
jeanclaude baby doc duvalier 
lafontant returned to haiti in july to run for president a 
warrant for his arrest accusing him of crimes committed during the 
duvalier years has never been served 
lafontant speaking to reporters at the fortresslike 
headquarters of his union for national reconciliation party said 
he was proud to be chief of the militia that violently enforced 
the duvalier dictatorship for 29 years 
i am leading the duvalierists im the chief ill never deny 
im a duvalierist he said 
lafontant blamed aristide for last weeks grenade and gun attack 
that killed seven people and wounded 50 others as an aristide 
campaign rally was breaking up 
aristide blamed the attack on lafontant and urged the army to 
arrest him 
he should be on trial aristide told reporters 
but lafontant boasted no one can arrest me 
the capital of portauprince was calm wednesday although many 
city residents were heading for the interior to avoid possible 
violence during the elections 
at least 34 voters were killed at the polls in portauprince by 
armybacked thugs during the 1987 elections the electoral council 
was pushed aside by the army which controlled the national 
elections in january of 1988 
haiti has been wracked by political violence since jeanclaude 
duvaliers departure which ended nearly three decades of a brutal 
family reign begun by his father francois papa doc duvalier

sinatra 
the place itself leaned toward being a roadhouse and thats 
where he sinatra started out playing in little places in new 
jersey it just seemed to fit the bill bove said 
bove holds a combination my way anniversarychristmassinatra

business bove expected several hundred people to celebrate francis 
alberts 75th birthday their way

john gotti whose acquittals gained him the 
reputation of the untouchable don was charged wednesday with 
ordering his mafia boss slain so he could take over the nations 
most powerful mob organization 
gotti was charged in a federal racketeering indictment with 
ordering four murders including that of reputed gambino crime 
family head paul castellano and with conspiring to kill a fifth 
person 
the 11count indictment also accused gotti of gambling 
loansharking obstruction of justice and tax evasion 
gotti was arrested tuesday night as were three other reputed 
crime figures including the son of the late mafia boss of bosses 
carlo gambino 
prosecutors called gotti a danger to the community and said they 
would seek to have him held without bail 
if convicted the man also known as the dapper don for his 
expensive suits would face life in prison without parole 
gotti pleaded innocent at his arraignment wednesday he was 
ordered held without bail 
gotti and his two top associates underboss frank frankie 
loc locascio and adviser salvatore sammy bull gravano were 
arrested at gottis manhattan hangout the ravenite social club in 
little italy 
thomas gambino an alleged family capo or captain was 
picked up about the same time when he left the garment district 
office of his trucking company said james m fox head of the 
fbis new york office 
gambino locascio and gravano also pleaded innocent gambino was 
released wednesday on a 500000 personal recognizance bond 
locascio and gravano were jailed without bail a hearing on 
possible bail for gotti and the two other defendants was set for 
monday 
to my knowledge this is the first time that we have taken 
down the entire hierarchy of an organizedcrime family the boss 
the underboss the consigliere counselor said fox 
federal officials say gotti took over the leadership of the 
gambino crime family with the dec 16 1985 assassination of 
castellano on the street outside a manhattan steak house a 
bodyguard also was killed 
law enforcers believe castellano was shot by three gunmen 
anthony rampino john carneglia and gottis younger brother gene a 
lawenforcement source said on the condition on anonymity the 
three who have not been charged in the slaying are in jail on 
unrelated charges 
gotti who allegedly headed a crew of gambino soldiers 
reportedly had castellano gunned down because of big pauls 
rule that any member or associate of the gambino family who was 
found to be involved in narcotics trafficking would be murdered 
at the time of the killing castellano himself was on trial on 
racketeering charges 
law enforcement officials say the organizations sources of 
income include drug dealing gambling extortion loan sharking 
union control airport ripoffs and domination of new york citys 
garment district 
gottis lawyer bruce cutler maintained his client was the 
innocent victim of a prosecution vendetta 
gotti has beaten three government cases since 1986 
its the same kind of crap that we dealt with in 1986 and 
1987 the same kind of mafia madness nonsense that starts with a 
twoweek blitz in the newspapers i know its a vendetta its 
happened three times if thats not a vendetta i dont know what 
is cutler said 
cutler maintains the 50yearold gotti is a salesman for a 
plumbing company and for a company that sells zippers and hangers 
to the fashion industry 
his real job is boss of the most powerful crime family in this 
country thats his real job and the real source of his income 
said us attorney andrew j maloney hes a murderer hes not a 
folk hero 
gotti has been indicted three times in recent years on a variety 
of state and federal crimes but prosecutors have been unable to 
convict him 
the previous state cases against gotti were an assault in queens 
and an assault and conspiracy trial in manhattan neither of which 
was considered a very strong case the federal case was prepared 
before gottis alleged ascension to mob boss although the 
acquittal came after the castellano slaying 
maloney told reporters it would be different this time he said 
the evidence against gotti includes eyewitnesses and secretly 
recorded conversations between gotti and his minions 
gotti locascio 58 and gravano 45 each are charged under 
federal racketeering statutes with murder gambling loansharking 
obstruction of justice and other crimes 
gambino 61 is accused of gambling and loansharking 
if convicted gravano also faces life imprisonment without 
parole locascio faces up to 65 years and gambino a maximum of 40 
years

prosecutors in the latest trial of 
suspended navajo chairman peter macdonald and his codefendant son 
moved wednesday to force the son to testify against his father 
special prosecutor robert rothstein submitted a motion to 
dismiss the conspiracy charge against peter rocky macdonald jr 
and a separate motion that would require him to testify under 
immunity 
opening statements were presented tuesday in the trial of the 
two on charges stemming from the tribes 1987 purchase of the big 
boquillas ranch for 334 million hours after it had been sold to a 
third party for 2625 million 
in another development wednesday tribal judge robert yazzie 
granted a prosecution motion and dismissed electionfraud charges 
against suspended vice chairman johnny thompson in exchange for his 
testimony against macdonald in the big boquillas trial and an 
upcoming one on electionfraud charges 
in the big boquillas trial the elder macdonald is charged with 
single counts of bribery fraud and conspiracy and 10 ethics 
violations his son an unemployed lawyer from san jose calif 
faces a single conspiracy count 
after the motions aimed at the younger macdonald yazzie granted 
a continuance in the trial until thursday in order to give defense 
attorneys time to research immunity laws 
macdonald was suspended by the tribal council now known as the 
navajo nation council on feb 17 1989 after a us senate 
committee heard testimony from rocky macdonald and others that the 
elder macdonald accepted cash payments and other favors from people 
doing business with the tribe 
thomas hoidal an assistant federal public defender who said he 
has been appointed by the us district court in phoenix to 
represent rocky macdonald appeared in tribal court and expressed 
concerns as to whether testimony by his client in tribal court 
could be used against him in federal court 
rothstein said assistant us attorney wallace kleindieist has 
agreed to present a letter saying his office will honor a tribal 
courts grant of immunity and not use that testimony to prosecute 
rocky macdonald in federal court 
a federal grand jury in phoenix has been investigating matters 
related to the macdonald administration though neither macdonald 
nor his son have been charged in federal court 
asked later by a reporter whether rocky macdonald was prepared 
to testify against his father hoidal replied well see 
other attorneys declined to comment 
the macdonalds were convicted on oct 17 in tribal court of 
bribery conspiracy and ethics violations that trial involved 
allegations that the elder macdonald took bribes and kickbacks from 
businessmen operating on the reservation 
the elder macdonald is also to stand trial jan 16 on election 
fraud charges 
thompson had faced more than 60 counts in that case stemming 
from the tribes 1986 election 
but thompsons legal advocate daniel deschinny said he was 
totally unaware of what was happening with the big boquillas ranch 
and the election of 1986

the bush administration on wednesday accused 
iraq of blocking any agreement to schedule talks more than a few 
days before a un deadline for withdrawing iraqi troops from 
kuwait 
meanwhile a uschartered plane was expected to leave baghdad 
iraq early thursday with 15 americans aboard the last official 
flight out for the foreseeable future state department spokesman 
richard boucher said no decision had been made on whether five 
american diplomats at the us embassy in kuwait would be aboard 
boucher said the iraqi government was refusing to budge from its 
proposal to have secretary of state james baker iii visit baghdad 
on jan 12 
the united states has rejected that date saying it is too close 
to jan 15 the un security council has voted to authorize force 
if the iraqis have not quit kuwait by then 
president bush proposed a diplomatic exchange including a 
white house meeting with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz as a 
lastditch effort to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
and iraq accepted the idea 
however boucher said we have offered 15 dates and iraq has 
offered none iraq continues to block agreement on dates 
iraq has suggested that its foreign minister come to washington 
to see bush on dec 17 boucher said the united states would not 
accept that date unless a date had been fixed for bakers trip to 
iraq 
joseph wilson the us charge daffaires in baghdad has been 
discussing dates with nizar hamdoon iraqs deputy foreign 
minister boucher said hamdoon talked with wilson most recently on 
wednesday by telephone 
the iraqis had no new proposals boucher said 
baker noted that we have said that we would be willing to go 
to baghdad for a meeting on any one of the 15 days between dec 20 
and jan 3 because we think these meetings are important and 
because we are serious about them 
meantime boucher said no final decision had been made on 
whether the five american diplomats at the us embassy in kuwait 
would leave on thursdays flight 
an estimated 15 evacuees from baghdad were planning to be aboard 
the plane including one man who was held as a human shield at 
a strategic site in iraq 
the kuwait embassy staff will be allowed to leave when they have 
determined finally that no americans who want to get out of the 
area are left boucher said 
all told about 188 americans have been flown out of iraq and 
kuwait the past few days he said they include 70 people who were 
in hiding 86 human shields held at strategic sites in iraq and 
32 private citizens who were at the us embassies in kuwait or 
iraq 
some 500 americans mostly children apparently will stay if 
americans want to leave kuwait in the future they will be able to 
fly by commercial iraqi carrier to iraq and then on to jordan 
boucher said 
the spokesman said the former hostages are providing information 
to us officials 
were obviously talking to the people coming out he said 
weve talked to them during the course of the trip and once they 
get back here 
were most interested in what they might know about other 
americans he said 
on capitol hill a former reagan administration official told 
the senate foreign relations committee that any war that breaks out 
would be seen in the middle east as a us war against iraq and 
added that the perception could be even worse 
a number of americans are concerned that we may end up in this 
whole affair on the wrong side of history defending emirs and 
kings said richard murphy who was assistant secretary of state 
for the near east 
across the capitol a former army chief of staff gen edward c 
meyer 
said that if bush decides to give sanctions a year to 18 months 
to work a presidential mobilization of up to one million men and 
women in the ready reserves would be necessary 
you cant do it with active forces agreed rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee

a commission has been chosen to enforce a 
presidential order to crack down on pornography the soviet culture 
minister said wednesday but he promised it wont be a new 
inquisition 
president mikhail s gorbachev this month ordered culture 
minister nikolai gubenko to form the committee to protect public 
morality from pornography 
gubenko said the committee consists of 30 people and includes 
chiefs of creative unions state committees public organizations 
representatives of religious movements and prominent cultural 
figures the tass news agency reported 
he said it will begin work after its membership is completed 
next week 
in his order gorbachev cited public concern about the spread of 
erotic photos and videos as well as pseudomedical literature 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness and a new law on 
the press has virtually ended censorship allowed democratic debate 
to flower and let many new people into the publishing business but 
many soviets find offensive some of the new private publishers 
choice of material 
softcore erotica has been flourishing in the traditionally 
puritan soviet union 
pinupstyle posters and calendrs of naked women are sold openly 
near the entrances of many moscow subway stations sometimes tacked 
up in full view of commuters sex manuals are sold on city streets 
popular movies such as little vera and interdevochka 
intergirl have featured some nudity and explicit scenes although 
they were comparatively mild by western standards soviet 
television also broadcasts movies from other countries that are 
somewhat more explicit than those shown on american tv 
tass headlined its story on the commissions meeting wednesday 
soviet union prepares to clamp down on sleaze 
its report said the emancipation of public morals and the 
freedom of commercial activities have had a negative impact on the 
moral health of soviet society 
it is necessary to stop the squall of pornography 
pseudomedical literature erotic films and propaganda of violence 
and cruelty 
the agency said the commission will study the experience of 
countries such as denmark sweden france the united states and 
germany in fighting pornography 
in order to solve this problem we wont resort to tough 
measures for instance like in china tass quoted gubenko as 
saying china this year launched a widespread campaign that meted 
out harsh penalties for those convicted of disseminating 
pornography 
we have no plan to launch a new inquisition here he said 
gubenko told soviet tv that commission priorities will be to 
work out mechanisms to regulate processes in the framework of 
culturally traditional and religious coloring of various 
territories of our country 
asked if the commission will focus on barring certain materials 
gubenko replied not at all otherwise we would cut our own 
throat as far as the freedom of information is concerned 
an adult person who has access to all kinds of information 
its their personal affair he said we are talking about the 
younger generation which we must protect from the danger of 
destroying its psyche 
gubenko said the soviet parliament and the president not his 
commission probably would be the final authority

a harvard divinity professors antisemitic remarks in an 
israeli newspaper contributed to his dismissal as chief editor of 
the dead sea scrolls project his colleagues said wednesday 
but others said john strugnell was removed last week because of 
longstanding problems managing the projects scholars who still 
havent published up to 45 percent of the scrolls nearly four 
decades after they were discovered 
the scholars voted to dismiss strugnell last week one month 
after appointing a coeditor to share his duties said eugene 
ulrich a member of the editing team and a university of notre dame 
theology professor 
the main reason for the removal was his health ulrich said 
but ulrich acknowledged wednesday that strugnells antijewish 
remarks in an interview with haaretz a tel aviv newspaper all 
the more confirmed that the decision was a correct one 
strugnell a roman catholic was quoted in the interview as 
saying i think that judaism is a racist religion it is a 
religion for a race just like hinduism something very primitive 
what i would call folklore 
he said judaism was a folk religion its not a higher 
religion 
he suggested that all jews abandon their beliefs and convert to 
christianity 
the interview which appeared in hebrew on nov 9 and will 
appear next month in the englishlanguage biblical archaeology 
review also quotes strugnell as saying of judaism its a 
horrible religion its a christian heresy and we deal with our 
heretics in different ways 
asked if his views affected his work on the scrolls which trace 
the evolution of modern judaism strugnell said i dont when 
im working on a qumran area where scrolls were found text think 
how stupid and wrong the jews were im concerned with trying to 
find out what a document is saying in its context 
strugnell insisted he had nothing against jews saying i dont 
love or hate jews more than i love or hate anybody else 
the new york times on wednesday quoted frank moore cross 
another harvard scholar working on the scrolls as saying the 
interview certainly contributed to strugnells dismissal 
ulrich who was appointed as one of three editors to replace 
strugnell called the remarks highly and inflammatorily 
antisemitic 
but ulrich also said he doesnt believe strugnell meant what he 
said 
i have known john for 20 years and ive never heard him say 
anything like that ulrich said 
strugnell 60 who has been editor since 1987 has been 
unavailable for comment harvard spokesman peter costa said he was 
in an unidentified hospital for treatment of an undisclosed 
illness 
ulrich however said strugnell told him sunday he does not 
see it as all over and done with 
the dead sea scrolls were discovered by bedouin shepherds in 
1947 in a cave in what is now the israelioccupied west bank they 
contain some of the earliest known biblical texts including copies 
of the old testament dating to the second and third century bc 
they are kept at the rockefeller museum in jerusalem 
scholars say the 800 scrolls shed light on the life of the 
essenes an ancient sect of jews as well as the roots of early 
christianity 
strugnell has been criticized for the scholars slow pace in 
publishing the scrolls some of which were found in fragments as 
small as a dime 
its been very clear for awhile that john has not been moving 
quickly enough said new york university professor larry 
schiffman a dead sea scrolls scholar who is not on the editing 
team 
schiffman said wednesday poor management was the real reason 
behind strugnells dismissal although the antijewish remarks 
didnt help 
hershel shanks editor of biblical archaeology review dismissed 
the explanation that strugnell was fired for health problems 
you dont fire a man because hes ill shanks said its 
because they dont want to be associated with an antisemite

a congressionally mandated study panel is 
preparing to recommend nationwide testing of 3yearolds and 
6yearolds an education department official said wednesday 
critics said the tests might not be reliable or useful for the 
younger children 
the special study panel on education indicators concluded two 
days of meetings in bethesda md after developing a draft report 
said john ralph study director 
the panel formed a year ago to suggest to congress how to 
update indicators that are used to measure education quality 
operates within the national center for education statistics part 
of the education department 
the most controversial item under consideration by the 19member 
group is the proposal to assess a sampling of 6yearolds to 
determine how prepared they are to enter school and to assess 
3yearolds so educators can identify and measure things that put 
them at risk of failure in school 
the proposal was first reported by the trade publication 
education daily 
the group will meet again early next year to refine its report 
before submitting it to congress in may 
were extremely concerned about the plan for a nationwide 
assessment of 3yearolds said barbara willer of the national 
association for the education of young children 
the study group she said appears to be unaware of the problems 
of testing young children she said the items they want to assess 
are virtually impossible to assess all of these are emerging 
areas for testing in 3yearolds and to test them doesnt seem 
to be a wise use of money 
roy truby executive director of the governing board of the 
national assessment of educational progress said i dont know 
of any real good assessments or valid tests for 3yearolds that 
can be given to large samples of students 
the sampling approach suggested by the study group is similar to 
that used by the national assessment popularly called the 
nations report card because it measures what students know in 
grades four eight and 12 and what skills they possess 
society can undertake early preventive measures that minimize 
the deficits these children might carry with them into their 
subsequent educational experiences said the study groups draft 
report 
the early testing can help determine the sources of 
educational inequities near their roots rather than after children 
have already spent time in elementary school 
separate information may also be useful for the subgroups of 
children that differ in the number of parents living in the 
household maternal education levels preschoolkindergarten 
experiences and geographic regions said the report 
it said testing of 3yearolds and 6yearolds must measure 
reading and mathematics skills such as pattern recognition 
vocabulary knowledge of concepts such as far and near and motor 
skills attitudes and social behavior

president bush is gambling that a new treaty 
with the soviet union will be ready for signing when he goes to 
moscow in february for a summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev 
after eight years of negotiations and several crash efforts the 
treaty to slice longrange nuclear bombers missilesand submarines 
on both sides by about 30 percent remains elusive 
bush had made completion of the treaty a precondition for going 
to moscow and yet he set feb 1113 as the date to meet with 
gorbachev with the accord still incomplete 
a senior us official said the president had never ruled out 
setting a date before the treaty was done asked if it would be 
ready by the time he saw gorbachev the official who insisted on 
anonymity said 
nobody can be certain things can always come up the 
assumption is we have made progress and are very hopeful we will 
have a treaty to sign there are no guarantees 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze tackled some of the remaining 
issues at a twoday meeting in houston that ended tuesday night 
we made some very good progress in houston baker said 
wednesday there are still some issues that remain 
they are mostly technical baker said he singled out the 
monitoring of solid rocket and missile assembly facilities 
others include a soviet demand to inspect us b2 bomber plants 
and how much information from missile flight tests will be 
exchanged 
in recent weeks some other nagging issues were resolved these 
include some kinds of restrictions to be imposed on soviet ss18 
missile tests and leeway for the united states to divert some 
trident submarine technology to britain 
even after all the problems are resolved it will take about 
three weeks to put the provisions in treaty language in english 
and in russian 
initially bush hoped the treaty would be ready by january 
by scheduling the summit for february he not only leaves more 
room for the details to be worked out it also means the president 
will not be in moscow when the crisis in the persian gulf could 
reach the boiling point 
the un security council at the urging of the administration 
has set jan 15 as the deadline for iraq to quit kuwait or risk 
war 
gorbachev has supported the resolution threatening force as well 
as a trade embargo and other sanctions aimed at president saddam 
hussein and yet the soviet leader has sought to stress seeking a 
diplomatic way out of the dispute over iraqs seizure of kuwait

fortythree of 53 pilot whales that 
ran aground on a cape cod beach died but scientists took solace 
wednesday from the few they managed to save 
eight of the whales that were discovered beached tuesday on 
squaw island peninsula were returned to the sea two were taken to 
the new england aquarium in boston 
of 315 whales previously stranded on area beaches over the past 
10 years only three are known to have survived and successfully 
returned to sea 
scientists began dissecting the carcasses of the dead whales 
hauled to a secluded corner of the town dump but held out little 
hope that they might explain the mysterious occasional tendency of 
the whales to beach themselves 
were not really building toward the ultimate answer said 
greg early associate curator for animal care at the new england 
aquarium and coordinator of the rescue effort 
blood from the 43 whales many of which were put to death to end 
their misery will be checked for contamination that might have 
caused the whales to become disoriented biologists said previous 
examinations of beached whales have provided few clues 
they theorize that whales may be disoriented by the gentle 
slopes of sandy beaches or by extreme high tides like those that 
battered cape cod last week or that diseased male guide whales 
lead the rest to shore or the whales which are descended from 
landbased creatures may follow their instincts when in danger and 
head inland 
the mass beaching was the first in three years on cape cod the 
biggest earlier beaching was of 97 whales in eastham in 1984 
the three whales known to have survived were taken to the new 
england aquarium and stabilized before being released 
predicting that the high tides and full moon of last week might 
disorient some whales and cause a stranding experts called an 
alert over the weekend and moved their research boat from its berth 
less than a mile from squaw island to sesuit on cape cods bay 
side 
the research boat is equipped to play the sounds of whales 
feeding underwater to try to lure the animals away from shore but 
the boat was positioned exactly opposite of where the stranding 
ultimately happened 
we were half right dave wiley cocoordinator of the cape 
cod stranding network said wednesday 
three other pilot whales were stranded on cape cod on tuesday 
and wednesday in unrelated incidents only one survived

education secretary lauro cavazos the 
nations first hispanicamerican cabinet member resigned without 
explanation wednesday and a white house source said he had been 
fired 
the source who insisted on anonymity said chief of staff john 
h sununu personally told cavazos about the firing tuesday 
in his two years as education secretary cavazos was best known 
for promoting the idea of allowing parents to decide where to send 
their children to school he also advocated bilingual education 
but another official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said cavazos was seen as lacking dynamism and not making enough 
progress in education an area bush designated as a high priority 
for his administration 
a white house source said cavazos was out of town and had let it 
be known he would not be back not even for the kind of personal 
departure appearance that bush made with the other top officials 
who have left his administration 
other administration sources said cavazos 63 had tired of 
criticism from the white house and elsewhere 
cavazos himself gave neither a reason for his resignation nor 
details about his future plans said education department 
spokeswoman etta fielek 
the resignation was announced at a cabinet meeting which 
cavazos didnt attend 
fielek said cavazos didnt attend the meeting because hes not 
very good at farewells and he thought this is the most comfortable 
way to do it 
cavazos is the third major administration official to resign 
since october labor secretary elizabeth dole quit to join the 
american red cross and william bennett head of the office of 
national drug control policy stepped down and later was named head 
of the republican national committee 
basically it would be hard to tell what would have been 
different if we hadnt had a secretary of education at all during 
this period of time said longtime critic albert shanker 
president of the american federation of teachers i hope they 
dont keep the position vacant for another three years 
but keith geiger president of the national education 
association said cavazos proved to be a decent man with the 
interest of americas children at heart 
the resignation is effective saturday with deputy education 
secretary ted sanders serving as acting head of the department 
sources said that sanders has been lobbying for cavazos 
position also considered to be possible successors are lynne 
cheney chairman of the national endowment for the humanities 
former new jersey gov thomas kean rep patricia saiki a former 
schoolteacher who lost her november bid to unseat sen daniel 
akaka dhawaii and rep lynn martin who also has been mentioned 
as a possible successor to mrs dole 
cavazos whose father was a cattle foreman at the king ranch in 
texas earned a bachelors degree in zoology and a masters degree 
in cytology at texas technological college which later became 
texas tech university he received a doctorate in physiology from 
iowa state university in 1954 
cavazos was president of texas tech when he became the first 
hispanic cabinet official in the waning days of the reagan 
administration bush kept him in the job 
for more than two years and under two presidents you have 
distinguished yourself through your devotion to improving the 
education of our nations children bush said in a letter 
accepting cavazos resignation 
cavazos said in his letter that he was proud of the 
contributions he made in expanding choice in education promoting 
the executive order on excellence in education for hispanic 
americans and raising awareness of the growing diversity of 
americas student population 
cavazos was a far less controversial secretary of education than 
bennett his predecessor who warred with teacher unions and was an 
acerbic critic of americas universities 
cavazos made peace with the national education association and 
other leading groups in the education establishment 
but antonio rigual president of the hispanic association of 
colleges and universities said it was widely known that the 
administration wasnt supportive of cavazos because he just 
wasnt fitting the mold that the administration wanted to head the 
education department 
rep william d ford dmich incoming chairman of the house 
committee on education and labor said he had remarkably little 
contact with cavazos but sen orrin hatch of utah ranking 
republican on the senate education and labor committee said 
cavazos brought increased visibility to the importance of 
education for all americans 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate subcommittee 
on education arts and humanities said cavazos commitment to 
educational opportunities for minorities and the poor has been 
without question 
cavazos was only the fourth person to be secretary of education 
the post was created when education was elevated to cabinet status 
in 1980 during the carter administration

john a betti the pentagons top procurement 
official who was roundly criticized last week in an internal report 
on mismanagement in a 50 billion stealth aircraft program said 
wednesday he was resigning 
betti a former ford motor co executive who had been 
undersecretary of defense for acquisition for 16 months said in 
his letter of resignation he would leave effective dec 31 so he 
would not be covered by new ethics laws next year that impose 
tougher postemployment restrictions on former government 
officials 
in his letter of resignation betti made no mention of the 
unfolding story of mismanagement in the development of the navys 
a12 attack plane 
speaking privately two pentagon officials said betti had 
intended to leave soon anyway but the timing of his announcement 
was connected to the recent revelations about the a12 being 
developed by mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
one of the two said defense secretary dick cheneys plans to 
slash the responsibilities of the job also led betti to quit 
a navy admiral was forced to retire last week and two other 
officers were reassigned after disclosure that they had failed to 
pass word up the chain of command about cost increases and schedule 
delays in the a12 
the a12 called the avenger is a radarevading stealth 
plane supposed to replace the elderly a6 aboard carriers starting 
in 1995 
bettis office referred calls to a defense department 
spokeswoman who said she had no information on whether betti 
already had lined up a new job 
in a written statement betti said he believed he had 
considerably improved the pentagons oftcriticized purchasing 
system but he also said substantive lasting improvements in 
defense acquisition will not occur overnight 
rather it will be a long slow and arduous process requiring 
patience and constancy of purpose 
cheney in a letter accepting the resignation also made no 
mention of the a12 controversy and told betti your dedicated and 
successful efforts to strengthen the acquisition process have 
been instrumental in maintaining a strong national defense 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said bettis resignation shows how resistant the 
pentagon is to change aspin said the job was created by congress 
to buy weapons that work on time and at cost but was soon to 
be vacant for the third time in four years 
rep john conyers jr dmich chairman of the government 
operations committee said the resignation would not put an end 
to the cozy oldboys network at the pentagon where problems are 
swept under the rug while airplanes crash and contractors reap 
unearned billions 
the a12 development program is now a year behind schedule and 
20 percent over the planned 47 billion cost 
defense department inspector general susan j crawford said in a 
report last week that word of the problems didnt reach cheney and 
other top pentagon officials in large part because the contractors 
had control over the work done by government inspectors 
but she also said betti had been informed of some of the 
problems by a deputy but failed to report the conclusions reached 
by his own staff regarding the a12 
mr betti relied on general assurances which he invited from 
the contractor and prior navy assurances that the a12 development 
contract would be completed within ceiling costs crawfords 
report said we find mr bettis failure especially troublesome 
in view of a prior warning 
the a12 controversy was not the first time betti has faced 
criticism for his offices policies 
in july betti faced hostile questioning from a members of a 
congressional panel who demanded he accept a justice department 
recommendation that northrop corp be barred from pentagon business 
for its criminal fraud conviction on charges it faked tests 
involving nuclear cruise missiles 
betti rejected the demands but admitted he had never reviewed 
evidence from several federal investigations of northrops conduct 
in the same testimony he also acknowledged he was not aware the 
military had repeatedly waived contract requirements for cruise 
missiles even after allegations of misconduct arose and a federal 
prosecutor warned that such waivers could harm the governments 
case against northrop 
you dont know what your managers are doing your managers 
dont know what northrop is doing your costs are going up and you 
have criminal investigations going on committee chairman rep 
john dingell dmich said at the july hearing i am worried 
that no one knows what is going on

already grappling with debt and 
governmental problems this beleaguered town of 1650 is under 
federal investigation of its sewage plant that could lead to 
indictment 
obviously the whole town cant be put in jail town attorney 
eugene e waldron said tuesday but this could result in 
substantial penalties on the town 
zolfo springs received the latest bad news monday night when 
waldron told other town officials he had been summoned to a 
preindictment conference in tampa 
waldron said he expects to be informed at the friday conference 
of possible charges the town faces in connection with its lone 
sewer plant he believes the hamlet could be indicted as a 
corporation the charges would be based on intentional 
environmental violations at the plant waldron said 
certainly we deny it waldron said 
he wouldnt comment on whether treated sewage was flowing into a 
nearby river as state inspectors have claimed 
problems at the plant have prompted the town about 70 miles 
southeast of tampa to ban new residential or commercial 
construction since 1989 the plant cant handle the extra sewage 
engineers say 
the 32 million plant built with federal farmers home 
administration grants and loans began operation in 1987 within a 
year the us department of agriculture began looking into its 
operation 
florida department of environmental regulation inspectors have 
said they discovered that treated sewage discharge from the plant 
was flowing into a tributary of the peace river the discharge was 
supposed to be absorbed into soil at the site 
steve thompson one of the state inspectors said last week he 
had appeared before a federal grand jury in tampa to answer 
questions about the plant bob peters who was on the zolfo springs 
town council at the time the plant was being built also said he 
testified before the panel 
assistant us attorney robert munk would not comment federal 
law prohibits his discussing grand jury matters 
cost overruns from the plant were a major reason the town ran 
out of money last year and was forced to declare a financial 
emergency the mayor and most of the town council resigned in the 
wake of the problems and novembers municipal election had to be 
delayed because not enough candidates had signed up to run

the us army has signed a pact with 
soviet scientists to develop a vaccine to combat hemorrhagic fever 
a deadly disease found in asia the soviet union and elsewhere the 
military said wednesday 
it is the first agreement of its kind between army medical 
researchers and a soviet scientific agency 
army scientists have developed a vaccine that they believe will 
work against hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome under the 
agreement soviet scientists will work with them to refine the 
vaccine and test it on thousands of volunteers 
this kind of collaboration is another confirmation of the 
openness that is developing and the willingness to draw closer 
together on scientific matters and other things said col thomas 
monath chief of virology at the us army medical research 
institute of infectious diseases 
the fort detrick institute is the armys lead laboratory in 
medical defense against biological weapons but hemorrhagic fever 
is not considered a biological warfare threat monath said the 
army would use the vaccine to protect soldiers deployed in parts of 
the world where the disease is prevalent 
the world health organization estimates that 100000 to 500000 
cases of the disease occur each year the disease is a major health 
problem in the soviet union asia and scandinavia monath said 
significant outbreaks have been reported in parts of eastern 
europe 
thousands of us soldiers contracted the disease during the 
korean war fewer american soldiers die of it today but the 
potential for losses exists if troops are deployed in areas where 
the disease is widespread monath said 
in 1987 18 us marines contracted the disease in korea two 
died 
hemorrhagic fever produces flulike symptoms and low blood 
pressure in its most serious stages the disease causes kidney 
problems and internal bleeding in the brain lungs and digestive 
system 
the disease is spread by rodents monath said it is found in 
airborne dust contaminated by rodent urine 
fort detrick researchers will work with about 10 scientists at 
the institute of poliomyelitis and viral encephalitides the 
institute is part of the academy of medical sciences a government 
agency for medical research in moscow 
tests to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective 
will be conducted on rats and monkeys at fort detrick for at least 
six months monath said after that the vaccine will be tested on 
up to 12 human volunteers at fort detrick he said it will then be 
tested in bashkiria siberia where most cases in the soviet union 
are found 
researchers at fort detrick plan to travel to the soviet union 
next spring to prepare for trials using placebos and the vaccine 
the trials will involve as many as several thousand volunteers 
testing in the soviet union could begin as early as 1992 monath 
said

parliament gave the government the 
green light on wednesday to apply to join the european community 
next year under a timetable that could make sweden a member by 
1995 
the move increased pressure in norway and finland to join too 
only as a member can our country fully participate and have an 
influence on the ec cooperation the parliamentary majority said 
in a statement a swedish membership in the ec while still 
keeping swedens policy of neutrality is in accordance with our 
countrys national interests 
present members of the worlds biggest trading bloc are belgium 
denmark france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands britain spain and portugal spain and portugal the 
last additions joied in 1986 
ec commission president jacques delors says the bloc will not 
expand before 1993 by then the existing members are to have 
completed consolidating their economies into a single market 
norway has to move together with sweden in its european 
policies jan p syse norways conservative leader and former 
prime minister said in reaction to wednesdays news 
an ec with sweden as a member will move scandinavias center 
of gravity into europe 
syses coalition government fell apart in october in a dispute 
over negotiations with the ec 
finnish foreign minister pertti paasio said the question of 
finnish membership may become a more central issue in next 
years election campaigns i think the pressures to join have 
been increasing all the while 
the social democrats who control swedens minority government 
were supported on the motion by the moderate and liberal parties 
which have formed a coalition to try to win next years elections 
the center party changed its previous position and voted for the ec 
application 
the environment party and the left party formerly the 
communists voted against the vote in the 349seat riksdag was 287 
for ec membership 40 against and 22 abstentions 
it looks as if the application will come next year said 
lars vargo spokesman for the foreign affairs committee which 
drafted the plan 
the ec takes no official position on prospective members until 
they apply but the nordic countries with their welldeveloped 
modern economies have the impression their applications would be 
looked upon favorably

the un general assembly on wednesday 
unanimously endorsed a ban on mining in antarctica and said it 
wanted a role in any decisions on protecting the frozen continent 
a resolution adopted 980 with 7 abstentions expresses 
regret that the un secretarygeneral had not been invited to 
meetings of the antarctic treaty nations considering such 
environmental measures 
the united states soviet union france australia and new 
zealand were among a number of nations that said they were not 
participating in the vote decisions on antarctica have 
historically resided within the antarctic treaty signatory group 
twelve of the 39 antarctic treaty nations particularly france 
new zealand and australia are seeking to designate antarctica a 
vast nature preserve or world park 
no commercial mining or oil exploration is being conducted in 
the southernmost continent but a ban on future activity is 
considered a key to the plan 
the treaty nations recently met in chile to discuss how to 
implement a ban on commercial mining in antarctica which is 
believed to contain large quantities of minerals beneath its 
surface 
the un resolution said issues on antarctica should be brought 
before a un summit on the environment scheduled in june 1992 in 
rio de janeiro brazil 
environmentalists say at least several of the 26 antarctic 
treaty nations with decisionmaking power generally resist moves to 
yield any of their authority to the united nations or world 
community 
bruce manheim of the environmental defense fund in washington 
noted that rising fears about possible exploitation of the 
continent recent oil spills and burgeoning tourism have led the 
world community to call for a greater voice in the process

the german maker of an antidepressant that 
was sold worldwide said wednesday it will plead guilty to charges 
it waited too long to notify us regulators the drug killed two 
patients in europe 
hoechst ag marketed the drug nomifensine in the united states 
under the name merital and voluntarily pulled it from shelves in 
1986 
the companys us subsidiary hoechstroussel pharmaceuticals 
inc in somerville was not charged a spokeswoman there said the 
german company intended to plead guilty to the charges and pay the 
maximum fine of 202000 a court date has not been set 
the charges were filed wednesday in us district court in 
newark against hoechst ag and its former research director rainer 
zapf 
the case marks the first time a foreign drug maker has been 
prosecuted for failing to inform the food and drug administration 
of adverse drug reactions that occurred outside the united states 
said us attorney michael chertoff 
more than 14 million people in 96 countries used the 
antidepressant between its introduction in the early 1970s until 
it was approved for use in the united states in december 1984 the 
company said hoechst began marketing the drug in the united states 
in july 1985 
charges were filed because hoechst waited until 1986 to inform 
the fda of a 1984 nomifensinerelated death in france and a 1981 
death in italy authorities said 
accurate and timely reports of serious drug complications 
irrespective of where in the world those reactions occur are 
critical to millions of americans who rely on the food and drug 
administration to help ensure that prescribed medications are safe 
and effective chertoff said in a statement 
hoechst pulled the drug after it noticed an increase in 
hemolytic anemia a potentially fatal form of leukemia in which the 
red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body are destroyed 
faster than the body can replace them 
the two patients in europe died from hemolytic anemia associated 
with the drug court papers showed 
andrea stine a spokeswoman for both the parent company and the 
us subsidiary said she did not know how widely the drug was used 
in the united states she said the company recorded 5 million in 
us sales from the antidepressant but she did not know what it 
cost 
rick blumber an attorney for the fda said hoechst acted 
properly when it reported another death associated with the drug in 
europe in april 1985 he said the antidepressant was relabeled as 
a result of that fatality to warn that the drug could cause 
hemolytic anemia

believes it was the first killing inside a boston school the 
previous homicide record was 135 in 1973 
allens classmate robert l reynolds 18 pleaded innocent to 
murder charges wednesday and was held without bond 
educators said the most difficult part for students may be 
coming to grips with an act of violence in a place they considered 
safe 
the schools have been perceived in the city as a haven and up 
to now they have been said michael contompasis headmaster at 
boston latin high school the young people have by and large 
felt comfortable leaving behind the stresses of the streets and 
neighborhoods

systemwide campaign aimed at preventing such violence and 
administrators at boston high school said students will face 
steppedup security when they return thursday 
the campaign will focus on how young people can resolve their 
problems without resorting to violence said schools spokesman 
larry w faison

begin with a moment of silence wednesday mcdonough also asked 
teachers to discuss the implications of the tragedy with the 
systems 57000 students 
at boston high where classes were canceled wednesday 
administrators held a daylong program to prepare teachers to deal 
with their returning classes

that normally comes with this kind of incident said headmaster 
thomas hennessey 
teachers were instructed to acknowledge the incident with 
students dispel rumors and tell them its okay to have strong 
feelings about it he said most important you get back to the 
normal routine as quickly as possible 
but that may be difficult when school officials use handheld 
metal detectors to frisk students as they enter the building 
thursday 
due to the nature of the tragedy were going to have some 
extraordinary precautions hennessey said 
faison said the antiviolence campaign must show students ways 
other than violence and drugs to deal with anger or despair 
we have to show them a way out he said 
in addition young people must be made to understand the 
longlasting impact of violent acts he said 
of two young people yesterday one is dead and the others 
life is actually destroyed he said we want to make sure they 
understand that this is the end result when you use violence

the federal railroad administration also sent a team of 
inspectors and administered mandatory alcohol and drug tests to the 
crew the results will not be available for several days 
glynn would not comment on recorders taken from the cabins of 
both trains which have been turned over to ntsb investigators the 
speed of the amtrak train will be determined by analyzing cabin 
data 
the crash left parts of the two trains twisted like a coat 
hanger said fire lt mike walsh who arrived at the scene two 
minutes after the first alarm 
there was an eerie calm walsh said he said he and other 
firefighters gave their oxygen masks to victims 
the commuter train which originated in stoughton south of 
boston was sitting on an adjacent track running in the same 
direction as the night owl when it was hit toward the rear at 
around 830 am said nancy sterling gleason a transit authority 
spokeswoman 
the night owl which left washington at 1030 pm tuesday 
apparently derailed on a curve and went into the side of the other 
train said clifford black a spokesman for amtrak in washington 
two engines two passenger cars and two baggage cars on the 
night owl derailed and smashed into the parked train hitting the 
engine that was in the rear of the commuter train 
the amtrak train jackknifed hit the ceiling tunnel and broke 
concrete and steel support pillars said john harrison acting fire 
commissioner 
we were sitting on the train and the next thing crash bang 
boom passenger kathy simons said just before she was carried 
away on a stretcher to an ambulance i ended up on the floor with 
a seat on top of me 
a nearly identical crash occurred at the same station between an 
amtrak train and a commuter train in 1987 the ntsb determined that 
crash was caused by an improperly designed signal system with 
human error considered a secondary factor 
transit authority spokesman jim ball said that signal system was 
repaired shortly after the accident 
but for phyllis laorenza the crash brought frightening memories 
of the 1987 crash which she also experienced as a passenger on a 
commuter train 
the first thing i thought of was no i cant believe this is 
happening to me again laorenza said it was very scary 
officials said the train station would be out of service through 
the weekend while the wreckage was cleared away

parched by four years of drought southern 
california cities and water agencies face stricter conservation 
measures including mandatory rationing and hefty fines for those 
who fail to comply 
efforts to conserve dwindling water supplies accompany a growing 
fear that winter precipitation wont be enough to stave off a 
devastating fifth year of drought 
wednesday the city councils intergovernmental committee 
approved a proposal to seek statewide water rationing patterned 
after the citys own conservation ordinance the measure must be 
approved by the full council where it is expected to pass easily 
council president john ferraro said 
the board of the metropolitan water district southern 
californias largest water supplier serving about 15 million 
people imposed a strict mandatory rationing plan tuesday on its 
client cities and agencies 
the district serves los angeles orange san diego riverside 
san bernardino and ventura counties 
both actions point to a growing realization that the region is 
running out of water rapidly and that voluntary conservation 
measures may not be enough 
what if next year the drought should continue asked 
metropolitan water district spokesman bob gomperz what weve 
done is weve drawn down reservoir sources of water and now were 
down to the bare bones 
in seeking statewide water rationing los angeles risks 
aggravating a longstanding conflict with northern california over 
water rights 
the rift has grown in recent months as residents of several 
northern california cities including san francisco and san jose 
have been ordered to conserve water 
anytime we start talking about this statewide legislation in 
southern california northern californians think were trying to 
steal their water ferraro said weve got to be careful 
sponsoring legislation because thats so sensitive 
as the shortage develops i think theyll be more receptive 
he said 
no bill has been drafted yet 
under the districts rationing plan water agencies and cities 
must achieve reductions equal to a 5 percent cut in residential use 
and a 20 percent reduction in agricultural use violators will be 
charged triple the usual price for each acrefoot of water over the 
limit an acrefoot is about 326000 gallons 
the district left it to local entities to determine how to 
accomplish the reduction goals 
following the districts action mayor tom bradley said the city 
will look at imposing similar mandatory conservation measures but 
a decision likely will be delayed until february when officials 
can better assess the effect of winter precipitation 
since early this year the city has relied on voluntary 
conservation to achieve a 10 percent reduction in consumption the 
program is part of a conservation plan that calls for restrictions 
that become increasingly strict as they are phased in 
in phase 2 the 10 percent reduction becomes compulsory and 
violators are assessed substantial fines phase 5 the plans final 
segment requires a 25 percent reduction in water use 
san diego another large southern california water consumer has 
no immediate plans to impose mandatory rationing on residents said 
paul downey spokesman for mayor maureen oconnor 
he said water use had been cut voluntarily 107 percent between 
june and september indicating no need for mandatory restrictions 
stanley sprague general manager for the municipal water 
district of orange county said voluntary cutbacks had reduced 
water use by 8 percent during the past year 
he did not expect local water agencies to move to mandatory 
measures 
very few water agencies in the county have mandatory 
ordinances in place he said even if they wanted to go 
mandatory theyd have to go through the whole ordinance procedure 
that can take two to four months

while deposed panamanian dictator manuel 
noriega claims poverty from his miami prison cell a newspaper 
reported wednesday he and his family had quite a penchant for 
plastic money 
the fallen general amassed a fortune of 315 million and 
charged nearly 280000 from 1986 to 1988 usa today reported 
the newspaper said it had obtained noriegas visa credit card 
accounts and many of his previously undisclosed bank records 
records indicate during that time that the noriega family ran up 
charges to almost 280000 mostly at establishments like christian 
dior and valentinos in paris and harvey nichols in london 
princess dis favorite luxury department store 
in miami where the family spent more than 38000 the focus 
was on family and household needs frequently at sprawling dadeland 
mall south of miami typical among the flurry of charges were toys 
r us baker shoes docktor pet center linens n things and jc 
penney 
one miami charge made by noriegas wife felicidad in 1987 was 
for 1642 at a christmas place 
noriega claims he is now destitute unable to pay his lawyers in 
his drug conspiracy case 
federal prosecutors have frozen 21 million in noriegas funds 
in 27 bank accounts his lawyers are threatening to pull out of the 
case and the judge has said he will appoint a public defender 
frank rubino noriegas lawyer doesnt deny his client may have 
once controlled hundreds of millions of dollars but he adds i 
dont believe today he has the ability to get one penny if he did 
im sure he would pay his lawyers so we could go on with the 
case i mean he is really upset 
the general is now a prisoner of war receiving a monthly 
federal stipend of 59 and care packages from the red cross while 
held at the federal metropolitan correctional center outside of 
miami 
meanwhile in a 65 billion civil lawsuit the panamanian 
government says noriega looted his nation of at least 300 million 
through corrupt military and government officials it also claims 
noriega shifted funds to personal accounts from panamas casinos 
lotteries ports and immigration offices

a publication of the chinas peoples 
liberation army has called for a 150 percent increase in defense 
spending over the next decade 
such an increase could substantially strengthen the army at a 
time when some asian neighbors have been worrying that beijing 
might seek to settle territorial disputes with its neighbors by 
force 
the call came in the may edition of a chinese military magazine 
military economic research which is generally restricted to the 
military and the communist party a copy was obtained by the 
associated press in hong kong 
in the report writer li yuansheng an officer in the logistics 
department of the chengdu military region argued that chinas army 
has lived in debt for a long time 
li said increasing the armys budget to 155 billion by the 
year 2000 from 1990s figure of 616 billion would be both 
appropriate and feasible 
the jump would mean an increase of 150 percent in a military 
budget that grew only 30 percent between 1980 and 1989 
the world has not yet ushered in an era of peace and 
prosperity li wrote and chinas security is still subjected 
to actual and potential military threats from some of the 
peripheral countries 
the magazine is published by the armys academy of iilitary 
economics its think tank for defense spending a western military 
official said the report appeared to reflect the current thinking 
of policymakers 
professor ngok lee an expert in the chinese military at the 
university of hong kong said such a spending increase would appear 
to be an attempt by china to assert what it sees as its traditional 
influence in asia 
ministers from all asean states are scared like hell he 
said referring to the association of southeast asian nations 
grouping of thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the 
philippines and brunei 
lee said he believed the army had the political capital to 
obtain a 150 percent budget increase especially given the crucial 
role it played in suppressing a movement for democracy on june 4 
1989 
he said several other developments point to the potential for a 
more ambitious china during the next decade 
over the last two years chinas military has fundamentally 
revised its force doctrine called peoples war from a 
defensive strategy to an offensive one following improved ties 
with its longtime no 1 enemy the soviet union 
the key element of the new doctrine is called local war 
founded on the concept that china will be the aggressor in warfare 
conducted within limited space time and means for limited 
objectives 
secondly the army is believed to have recently obtained 
inflight refueling technology for its jet fighters which would 
allow the army to project force hundreds of miles outside chinas 
borders 
western military officers and press reports say china has 
received the technology from iran which obtained it from the 
united states when washington enjoyed good relations with tehran 
additionally chinas military has been training 
rapiddeployment forces called fist battalions since 1988 in 
october 600 paratroopers conducted a mock attack on an island in 
the south china sea according to chinas official liberation army 
daily 
troop cuts are also helping china fashion a professional 
fighting force since 1985 the army has demobilized 700000 troops 
25 percent of its total military strength in a move away from a 
peasant army 
china has border disputes with india vietnam and the soviet 
union it fought a brief victorious border war with india in 1962 
and almost fought again in 1987 in 1979 it attacked vietnam in a 
failed attempt to teach hanoi a lesson for invading cambodia 
then a chinese client state 
one flashpoint has been identified as the spratly archipelago a 
group of islands 600 nautical miles south of chinas hainan 
province believed to be rich in oil deposits and minerals 
china malaysia the philippines and taiwan have all made claims 
on the territory 
in march 1988 the chinese navy sank one vietnamese military 
vessel and damaged two others during a skirmish near the islands

the opposition social democrats 
scored big gains in parliamentary elections wednesday but 
conservative prime minister poul schlueter said he will try to stay 
on by expanding his centerright minority government 
i will seek to build the broadest possible foundation for a 
nonsocialist government he said 
schlueter who has headed successive centerright coalitions 
since 1982 said final results showed a continued nonsocialist 
majority of 91 seats in the 179seat folketing or parliament 
with all ballots counted the social democrats had gained 14 
seats for a total of 69 
social democratic party leader svend auken demanded that 
schlueter resign saying now is the time for a change of 
government and a new majority in danish politics 
but schlueter said he will invite two small centrist parties 
the center democrats and the christian peoples party to join his 
coalition of conservatives liberals and social liberals which 
dropped one seat for a total of 66 
we must discuss the threeparty coalition tomorrow thursday 
but its clear there is a nonsocialist majority he said 
if formed it would control 89 seats in parliament one shy of 
a majority 
the social democrats success was largely at the expense of the 
allied socialist peoples party which slipped from 24 to 15 seats 
it was uncertain if the social liberals who dropped three of 
their 10 seats would stay in the government 
economy minister niels helveg petersen the social liberal 
leader said the party would support schlueters efforts to head a 
new government in any case 
the center democrats and christian peoples party took part in a 
roundtable discussion among party leaders after returns were in 
but declined to say if they would accept schlueters offer to join 
a new coalition 
foreign minister uffe ellemannjensens liberals gained seven 
seats for a total of 29 while schlueters conservatives dropped 
from 35 seats to 30 
the center democrats held their nine seats and the christian 
peoples party kept its four 
thirteen parties fielded candidates but only the eight that sat 
in the outgoing parliament secured the 2 percent of the vote needed 
to be represented 
schlueter called the election on nov 22 when the social 
democrats blocked parliamentary passage of the governments finance 
bill 
voter turnout from among the 39 million registered voters was 
828 prcent compared with 857 in the 1988 ballot it was 
denmarks fourth parliamentary election in six years

a judge has ruled the federal fair housing law 
cannot be applied to insurers rejecting two of five charges 
against an insurance company accused of discriminating against 
black homeowners in milwaukee 
us district court judge stadtmueller on tuesday dismissed two 
of five claims in a class action lawsuit against american family 
mutual insurance co by the naacp 
lawyers for eight black homeowners including milwaukee alderman 
marvin pratt and the national association for the advancement of 
colored people said the decision will be appealed 
the naacp has said it is attempting to apply the federal law 
guaranteeing fair access to housing to providers of homeowners 
insurance because homeowners who cannot get such insurance are 
unable to buy homes 
the case is significant because it addresses a problem that 
has substantial adverse impact on housing in the cities across the 
nation said william lynch a lawyer for the plaintiffs 
the us justice departments civil rights division and the 
national fair housing alliance a washingtonbased advocacy group 
have filed briefs in support of the lawsuit 
the lawsuit claims american family discriminates in a practice 
known as redlining in which insurers instruct agents to avoid 
selling policies in areas with more than 25 percent black 
population 
the lawsuit includes a memo the naacp alleges was written by a 
american family supervisor instructing an insurance agent to stop 
writing those blacks it also alleges the insurer failed to hire 
and retain black agents did not locate offices in black 
neighborhoods and offered blacks less advantageous policies 
than whites 
the two claims dismissed against the company were that 
individuals need court action against the company because state law 
doesnt allow them to take direct action against insurers and that 
it is unlawful for insurers to discriminate against homeowners 
based on location of house 
in dismissing those claims stadtmueller said any discriminatory 
practices by insurance companies could not be considered in 
violation of the us fair housing act 
stadtmueller cited a 1984 decision that said the fair housing 
act enforced by the department of housing and urban development 
was not aimed at insurance agencies 
john powell aclu national legal director disagreed with the 
judge saying other court decisions since 1984 apply the fair 
housing act in lawsuits against insurance companies 
im fairly confident the 7th circuit court of appeals will 
overturn his decision because theyve already spoken and ruled 
fair housing statutes apply to insurance companies he said 
the insurance companys attorney tom shriner said he expected 
the judge to dismiss the two counts because congress and the 
state legislature pass the laws judges dont 
felmers chaney president of milwaukees naacp said he was not 
surprised by the ruling but said the judge should have interpreted 
the fair housing act differently 
i remember back in the days before the civil right laws were 
put into effect if congress didnt rule the courts had to act 
chaney said

the premiers of north and south korea 
met in closed session thursday to seek common ground for easing 45 
years of confrontation but a vacant place at the table symbolized 
their gap 
prime ministers yon hyong muk of communist north and kang 
younghoon of capitalist south shook hands and chatted briefly 
before taking their places with official delegates on either side 
of a large rectangular table in a hotel ballroom 
both sides need to exchange frank opinions kang said 
even if there are differences in various matters we must solve 
them one by one 
the talks are the third round since september in the 
highestlevel meetings between the koreas since the peninsula was 
divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed the north koreans 
return home friday 
the vacant place belongs to kim jonghwie an official south 
korean delegate and special presidential aide for diplomacy and 
national security 
kim was traveling to moscow thursday with south korean president 
roh taewoo for a summit meeting with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev north korea has bitterly criticized the trip 
north korea said wednesday that its relations with seoul could 
not improve unless south korea stops what the north called its 
flunkylike diplomacy of soliciting foreign influence to help ease 
tensions on the peninsula 
roh said he would ask gorbachev for help in ending cold war 
tensions in korea and to pressure the totalitarian northern regime 
to open up its society 
at wednesdays twohour opening session both sides offered 
proposals that were little changed in substance from past talks 
the talks showed how big and wide are the valleys of distrust 
between the two sides said limb dongwon a delegate and 
spokesman for the south 
while talks were going on about a dozen north korean reporters 
slipped away from their official guides and explored seoul by taxi 
and subway 
south korea lodged a protest with the north korean delegation 
thursday which said the impromptu trips would stop

even the ghost of jack benny couldnt save 
ebenezer scrooge on wednesday when a judge refused to clear the 
name of the miserly main character of a christmas carol 
the tongueincheek ruling by municipal judge george choppelas 
came at the court of historical review and appeals a mock court 
that met to decide if the name of the character created by charles 
dickens should continue to be synonymous with greed and avarice 
in the past the court has ruled on such weighty questions as 
the existence of santa claus or if chicken soup deserved to be 
considered jewish penicillin yes on both the court found 
the puns during the courts 65th session moved fast with 
little dickens and youve been scrooged bringing moans from 
100 or so spectators 
scrooge dressed in black and wearing a top hat pleaded his 
case saying he had been sorely hurt by an early early love 
scrooge portrayed by retired drama teacher e wyman spalding 
claimed his mentor jacob marley should be blamed 
it was marley marley he told the judge marley was the 
real scrooge 
the miser was defended by frank winston who said the world 
actually owed a debt to eb insisting that comedian jack 
bennys tightwad image was inspired by the scrooge character 
even the names were familiar the lawyer said benny and 
ebenezer get it 
eb was always a grand guy winston said 
the references to benny led choppelas to try an impression of 
the late comedian 
im thinking im thinking he said at one point a slight 
benny tone in his voice 
prosecutor angela alioto said scrooge deserved his bad name 
despite his change of heart at the end of the novel turned into a 
popular christmas movie 
those nightmares would scare the hell out of anybody she 
said you cant change with a fourhour period of being nice 
scrooge also drew the fire of noah griffin a san francisco 
examiner columnist who wrote a poem for the event one stanza read 
but tears from scrooge were mean and vile 
befitting but the crocodile 
his socalled heartfelt transformation 
was nothing but media manipulation

the security council on wednesday 
postponed a vote on a resolution endorsing a mideast peace 
conference until after soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
meets plo chairman yasser arafat 
the deputy soviet ambassador valentin lozinskiy asked the 
delay in light of negotiations on the political level which have 
been recently occurring and to give the council more time to 
reach consensus 
the united states and eight other members voted to postpone 
four voted against france and china abstained the meeting was 
postponed until monday 
shevardnadze who was in washington on wednesday meeting 
separately with israeli premier yitzhak shamir and president bush 
will meet arafat on friday in ankara turkey said diplomats 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
plo officials confirmed shevardnadze would be meeting arafat 
but declined to provide details 
shevardnadze will pressure arafat to distance his palestine 
liberation organization from iraq which has been championing the 
palestinian homeland issue since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the delay will give the united states and the nonaligned 
nations on the security council more time to try to work out a 
compromise on the resolution on the israelioccupied territories 
the united states has been struggling to remove from a security 
council resolution language endorsing a mideast peace conference 
fearing it would look like a concession to iraq 
rumors circulated that the paragraph endorsing the conference 
would be taken out of the resolution at americas insistence and 
put in a separate nonbinding statement from the council 
president 
however the yemeni ambassador who also is a cosponsor of the 
resolution said that has been a suggestion but we have not 
moved an inch 
when us ambassador thomas r pickering was asked if any 
understanding had been reached he replied not that i know of 
the situation became more complicated wednesday when france 
announced it could not support any resolution that did not contain 
the call for a peace conference france did not indicate whether it 
would cast a veto however 
a vote on the resolution has been put off six times in a week 
israel the traditional us ally in the middle east strongly 
opposes any international peace conference that would encompass the 
issue of palestinians in occupied lands 
the israelis say they will not accept any imposed settlement 
and fear a peace conference would force them into a 
landforpeace deal with their arab neighbors they want 
bilateral talks with their arab adversaries 
the united states has been caught in a diplomatic bind 
us officials say they must veto the resolution if it endorses 
the peace conference because it gives the appearance of linking 
that issue with the persian gulf crisis 
iraqi president saddam hussein says he will withdraw from kuwait 
only in the context of a comprehensive middle east peace conference 
that would address all problems in the region 
but us officials fear a veto could weaken support from arab 
nations that joined the coalition against iraq following its 
invasion

the census bureau has found at least 750000 
people it missed during the april 1 national head count officials 
said wednesday 
at this point we feel we have done a very thorough census 
said barbara everitt bryant census director 
more than 6000 local governments have filed challenges saying 
the census was inaccurate they include all of the 51 largest 
cities 
virtually everybodys count will go up bryant said 
new york mayor david dinkins and william althaus mayor of york 
pa scheduled a meeting with commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
to discuss correcting the count in major cities the mayors 
represent the us conference of mayors 
bryant and michael darby under secretary of commerce for 
economic affairs said the newly counted people were found through 
five programs designed to check the census accuracy 
the census bureau compared its count against parole and 
probation records asked people to come forward if they were 
missed sent workers to recanvass some households that mailed in 
forms to check the accuracy of the forms sent canvassers to count 
people in households that had not mailed a form back and checked 
vacant and uninhabitable housing to see if someone lived there 
after all 
officials refused to say exactly how many people had been added 
since the april 1 count they would say only how many people or 
households had been checked under the programs and what percentage 
had produced additions to the census 
bryant said the bureau checked 12 million parole and probation 
records and found 34 percent should be aded to the initial count 
thats about 408000 people 
most parolees and probationers are men in their 20s and 30s the 
bureau said 
the bureaus were you counted program asked people to 
contact the bureau if they thought they hadnt been counted nearly 
166000 responses produced additions to the census count according 
to bryants figures some responses may have added more than one 
person 
also 
workers found at least 125000 missed households through 
recanvassing 
nearly 46000 households thought to be vacant were found to 
have residents 
workers found people living in nearly 9000 houses that were 
thought to be uninhabitable 
the newly counted people will be added to the preliminary us 
population count of 2458 million 
census numbers are used to determine how many representatives a 
state sends to congress and how federal aid is divided among the

a 22yearold ranchers son confessed 
wednesday that he killed famed rainforest activist chico mendes 
bringing a surprising end to the opening session of the murder 
trial 
darci alves pereira stunned a packed courtroom by admitting he 
shot mendes on dec 22 1988 shortly after dark outside his home 
in this remote amazon town near bolivias border 2650 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
pereiras confession came minutes after he had twice denied 
shooting mendes who was one of brazils most outspoken critics of 
development of the amazon basin mendes case has reached such 
proportions that film producers and authors have besieged his widow 
with competing offers to tell his story 
pereira whose father also is charged with plotting the murder 
of the noted ecologist faces a 12 to 30year sentence sentencing 
is expected on thursday 
the trial had drawn worldwide attention as a test of brazils 
commitment to protecting its rainforests against encroachment and 
to meting out equal justice for rich and poor 
mendes who defended the rainforest from landowners and ranchers 
who wanted to cut it down to develop the fragile amazonian basin 
has become a symbol of brazils impoverished 
ilzamar mendes widow of chico mendes was sitting in the 
gallery when the confession occurred she clapped her hands in 
surprise 
he confessed she asked incredulously its hard to 
believe 
she added hes probably doing it to protect his father 
pereiras father rancher darly alves da silva also is on trial 
on charges of planning the shooting he pleaded innocent 
mendes had repeatedly told police that da silva was plotting to 
kill him after rubber tappers prevented the rancher from clearing 
a tract of rainforest 
the trial began at 9 am a boy picked the names of seven jurors 
out of a hat containing 21 slips of paper with local residents 
names written on them 
outside two dozen state police in army camouflage pants and 
bulletproof vests stood guard with submachine guns and pistols 
officials feared violence between rubber tappers and gunmen 
reportedly hired by ranchers 
the 240 officials politicians family members and journalists 
allowed in were frisked before entering the 36by48foot 
courtroom 
four state troopers led in the defendants who sat staring down 
as the charges were read 
da silva 54 wearing an unbuttoned blue shirt slacks and thick 
glasses was called to the bench he denied accusations he plotted 
mendes death and had ordered his son to carry it out 
then pereira approached the bench and also denied the murder 
charge against him he claimed he was in another town when mendes 
was killed 
the short muscular pereira was shown evidence found by police 
near where mendes killer hid a 16gauge shotgun a black nylon 
raincoat a burlap sack two bottles and cigrette cartons asked 
if he recognized the items pereira shook his head 
then as bailiffs were leading pereira from the courtoom judge 
adair longhini leaned over the bench and asked again if the 
defendant committed the crime 
pereira paused stared at longhini and said i confess 
what said the judge you killed chico mendes 
i shot him yes pereira said 
there was turmoil among the 240 observers packed into the tiny 
wooden courtroom longhini called for order 
speaking softly and slowly pereira recounted in chilling detail 
how he carried out the murder 
on the afternoon of the killing pereira said he picked up a 
shotgun loaded with one cartridge at his fathers parana ranch 7 
miles outside xapuri and rode his motorcycle into town with the 
intention of killing 
i was alone he said no one else was involved 
pereira said he waited for nightfall and then walked along the 
acre river that runs behind mendes house shortly before 7 pm he 
crept into mendes yard through an open gate and waited 
ten minutes later he said mendes emerged from the back door 
reportedly to go to a shack in the rear of the yard to go to the 
bathroom 
i saw his face in the light of the lamp he held pereira 
said i raised the gun and squeezed the trigger i did not see 
him fall i was already walking back along the river 
he did not say why he reversed his plea of innocence 
however marcio thomaz bastos chief lawyer for the prosecution 
said the confession was a planned maneuver to spare his father 
darci is being an obedient son bastos said during a break 
his father told him to kill and he killed now he told darci to 
lie and hes lying to protect his father 
bastos hopes to convict the elder rancher on the strength of 
testimony from a 15yearold boy who worked on da silvas ranch 
the boy will reportedly testify da silva threw a party the night 
after the killing in celebration 
defense lawyer ruben lopes torres said he was completely 
surprised by the confession 
until the moment he confessed i didnt think he committed the 
crime said torres darcis decision to say i killed chico 
mendes was completely his own 
pereira and his father who also faces prison terms of 12 to 30 
years are not eligible for bail because both face charges for 
other killings 
ilzamar mendes in a yellow tshirt stamped with chico mendes 
face concluded we believed in justice 
the town had a festive atmosphere after hearing the news people 
celebrating with glasses of rumlike cachaca in the towns 
treelined streets

theres a oneword diagnosis for the 
headache issue politicians cant seem to shake and the word is 
taxes that chronic problem is worsened by voter suspicion that 49 
cents of every tax dollar goes to waste 
pollsters and republican political consultants warned gop 
governors here that the budget and tax dilemma most states face is 
likely to deepen before the next elections they urged the 
executives to start dealing with it early to ease the sting before 
the 1992 campaign season 
theres no place for a governor to hide said richard 
wirthlin who conducts polls for the white house he said the 
governors should shape clear strategies for handling the budget 
squeeze and the tax issue and tell their constituents about it 
wirthlin said a poll his organization conducted in september 
found that the average american believes that local state and 
federal governments waste 49 cents of every dollar taxpayers send 
them 
eightytwo percent of the people think government wastes the 
money it gets wirthlin said 
thats a presumption as a governor that youve got to take on 
and take on very directly he told the republican governors 
conference this week 
the peril in taxes hardly came as a surprise to the governors 
fourteen states switched party control in gubernatorial elections 
this year in almost every case when incumbents or their parties 
lost taxes were a factor 
surveys by wirthlin after the nov 6 elections showed that among 
people who made their choice on the basis of a single issue 9 
percent said the issue was taxes only 1 percent of singleissue 
voters were swayed by taxes in the prior election 
neal newhouse an analyst with the wirthlin organization said 
that when the question before the voters is whether or not to 
increase taxes republicans hold the advantage but when it 
becomes what taxes ought to be raised the edge shifts to 
democrats 
congressional democrats succeeded in shaping the issue of 
federal taxes into a debate about fairness accusing the bush 
administration of seeking tax breaks for the rich 
when its tax versus no tax republicans win newhouse said 
but that may not be the question in the next two years with the 
economy slipping state revenues declining and no help in sight 
from a strapped federal government indeed the governors 
complained that washington is increasing the burden on their 
treasuries with laws that mandate state spending 
they say wheres the money coming from vice president 
dan quayle said after conferring with the governors 
winding up their conference on tuesday the gop governors said 
they want president bush to know that they are frustrated about 
program mandates they blame on congress and want him to do 
something 
gov carroll a campbell of south carolina their new chairman 
said federal requirements that force state spending on health care 
and the like are taking money away from education and other vital 
programs and governors are frustrated by it 
our message to the president is please stop it use your 
veto said gov tommy thompson of wisconsin 
federally mandated spending is a longstanding complaint of 
governors in both parties it irks them more in a time of strained 
budgets when some of them may be forced to seek tax increases 
despite the political peril 
when you get into the tax issue be sure you know which taxes 
are supported and which are not wirthlin told the governors 
because that is in fact very dangerous ground 
linda divall president of american viewpoint inc said 
governors should cover that territory as early in the election 
cycle as they can explaining to constituents as they do so 
and do it again and again and again she said the tax 
issue is still incredibly strong 
 
editors note walter r mears vice president and columnist 
for the associated press has reported on washington and national 
politics for more than 25 years

checking up on an organization that has been a 
persistent and cutting critic the presbyterian church usa 
found that many members seem to appreciate the onslaughts 
this has been somewhat of a stunner for church leaders but in 
the denominations open operating style it laid the matter all out 
plainly 
responses ran nearly 3to1 in support of the dissenting 
organization the presbyterian lay committee said the rev james 
v johnson jr chairman of a special committee set up to look into 
the groups ways 
it would be accurate to say that the special committee has 
been very surprised by the breadth and depth of support for the 
group he added 
the presbyterian lay committee based in springfield pa 
consists of an 18member board of directors which puts out a 
bimonthly newspaper the presbyterian layman it reports a 
circulation of 400000 and regularly assails church policies and 
programs 
charging that the denomination supports leftist and socialist 
causes and views the editor j robert campbell said the church 
should stay out of politics and stick to its unique mission 
that is the proclamation of the gospel and making of disciples 
he said in a telephone interview 
he said the church findings mean the denominational leaders 
have refused to listen to people out across the church theres a 
tremendous gap between what the denominational leaders think and 
what the people in the pews think 
victor jameson editor of the denominations monthly 
presbyterian survey based in louisville ky interprets the 
findings quite differently 
our people have a kind of feeling that everybody should have 
their say even if they dont like whats said and even if its 
wrong and ought not to be said he said 
the special committee set up by the churchs 1989 governing 
assembly to check into relationships with the presbyterian lay 
committee solicited responses from the churchatlarge 
sixty percent of about 200 responses considered the criticizing 
group a valuable voice of dissent in the church even though it 
tends to overdo it johnson said 
he said 10 percent supported the paper without reservation and 
30 percent considered it harmful to the church johnson said the 
committee also received more than 6000 preprinted forms 
distributed by the critical group that supported it 
in testimony to johnsons committee elected national assembly 
representatives serving in five program areas charged the lay 
committees paper with errors misstatements and personal attacks 
the 3 millionmember denominations representative assembly 
repeatedly has objected to the groups fundraising methods and 
charged journalistic excesses and unauthorized use of church 
mailing lists 
editor campbell said his group supplied material to john s 
tomkins a presbyterian layman and author of an article in the 
current readers digest sharply critical of his denomination and 
some other protestant bodies 
also credited as a source for the article is the 
washingtonbased institute on religion and democracy a backer of 
conservative causes 
like the critical presbyterian lay organization tomkins charges 
that bureaucrats have taken over the denominations and that a wide 
gulf exists between the bureaucrats and average parishioners 
the rev s david stoner of louisville executive director of 
the presbyterian general assembly council said both the institute 
on religion and democracy and the dissenting presbyterian group 
have strongly political agendas of their own 
he said tomkins has a right and duty to state where he thinks 
the institutional church has erred but those disagreeing have a 
similar duty to clarify the facts 
rebutting the contention that bureaucrats have taken over the 
denominations and are out of touch with church members stoner 
cites the presbyterians democratic processes he said members 
elect their representatives who choose their leaders and said staff 
are hired using carefully set guidelines 
he also challenged tomkins implication that mainline churches 
are losing many members to conservative churches 
scientific surveys conducted in recent years indicate that 
very few former members of mainline churches have left to join 
conservative churches he said most members who leave are lost 
not to conservatism but to nonaffiliation with any church 
the special presbyterian committee set up to consult with the 
dissenting group and discuss its asserted refusal to comply with 
denominational guidelines for special organizations is to make its 
final report to the 1991 assembly in june 
johnson said some things his committee learned so far are 
there is a widespread feeling in the church that the 
criticizing group performs a useful function as a dissenting 
voice but many who see its value have questioned its 
journalistic tactics 
there is a compelling need for the church to work for 
reconciliation among various factions in the church who do not 
trust and are afraid of each other

its not like nancy drew or the hardy boys 
theyre detectives they chase bad guys and drive cars 
the girls in the baby sitters club books mostly just have 
trouble with neighborhood snobs bullies or maybe parents 
author ann m martins characters seven distinctly different 
girls who form a babysitting cooperative are like friends to 
11yearold lynette kirkman and other admirers of the series which 
has put into print 41 million books over the last four years 
the books are about being a normal kid today said lynette 
of bristol pa they talk about real life and things 
being a kid today can be tough parents get divorced and 
sometimes they marry other people then you have two families or 
maybe you move or a grandparent dies or your father loses his 
job it gets complicated 
so when youre having problems with your parents or theres 
something you dont understand it helps to have a friend around 
said megan brown 13 of indianapolis 
into each story are integrated situations that reflect life as 
it really is lived across america and that includes elements such 
as stepfamilies working mothers death adoption and friends or 
relatives with disabilities 
the girls also encounter all sorts of smaller prepubescent woes 
in each monthly addition to the 43book series 
and if i can believe what the kids write to me they are 
responding to the realism kids will write and say i really 
enjoy your books because i can identify with the characters 
martin said 
martin 35 who lives in new york city with a cat named mouse 
plays it straight with her mostly 8 to 12yearold readers she 
doesnt talk down to them or gloss over difficult topics 
more kids today have been exposed to divorce or moved 
around a lot they start watching television at an earlier age and 
watch things that are more sophisticated than what we watched at an 
early age she said 
jean feiwel editorial director at scholastic inc came up with 
the series idea about five years ago melding young girls dual 
passion for books about clubs and books about babysitting 
the formula was an instant hit that has topped chain store 
bestseller lists of childrens books 90 percent of the time since 
the first title appeared in august 1986 two home videos also are 
on the market 
its one of the most successful series for children ever 
said diane roback childrens book editor at publishers weekly 
and i dont see any signs of its popularity diminishing 
meanwhile the imaginary town of stoneybrook conn has become 
a preteens fictional mecca the place where the baby sitters club 
meets three times a week to accept clients phone calls and review 
sticky situations 
like in no 10 well maybe not no 10 but in one of the 
books one of the kids they babysit for gets a hand stuck down the 
drain in the bathroom tub offers 8yearold marian walsh of 
watertown conn 
my favorite one is boycrazy tacey where she goes 
babysitting at the beach and gets crushes on all the boys says 
11yearold melonie marnien of bristol pa that was really 
funny 
a lot of girls like stacey the best in fact in a baby sitters 
club super special contest 27000 fans cast their votes for the 
sophisticated clotheshorse who moved to connecticut from new york 
city 
but others prefer claudia slightly insecure and artistic dawn 
an excalifornian who shuns junk food kristy the bossy club 
president based on one of martins close childhood friends mary 
anne a shy and responsible girl based on the author herself 
mallory a wouldbe childrens books author from a big family or 
jessica an outgoing black ballet dancer 
i just love them so much because you think these girls 
could be you in a few years enthused marian who hopes to start 
babysitting when she gets a little older youd never think of 
pippy longstocking as a baby sitter 
adds marians 10yearold neighbor carla oliva theyre not 
just books to read for enjoyment they teach you a lot of things 
like how life is different for different people and how to get 
along with each other 
although martin weaves serious themes into her books she 
chooses not to address such weighty topics as sexual or substance 
abuse of any kind 
its not that the issues shouldnt be dealt with the author 
said 
i think there are a lot of girls who would benefit from 
reading about them but there are also firstgraders out there 
who are reading these books and those subjects are too heavy for 
them she said 
so martin sticks to more manageable problems including the 
perennial trials of youth 
questions about their selfesteem their selfworth how 
important is it to be pretty to be popular all sorts of things 
that we worried about when we were younger i dont think those 
things ever change

wowee the fox network tonight is showing a 
special about marilyn monroe marilyn somethings got to give 
now the bad news it may be to documentaries what ishtar was to 
film comedies 
oh sure its daring not many marilyn monroe documentaries 
for example would put on the screen a slide identifying an 
interviewee as monroes psychiatrists daughter 
not many either would come right out and say the late actress 
was said to be having an affair with president john f kennedy 
and not many would disclose that the troubled actress said to 
have committed suicide in 1962 often was absent from what proved 
her last movie and one morning she nearly fainted under a 
hairdryer and had to go home 
but then this report on her sad last months and the film the 
neverfinished somethings got to give is the very first 
documentary by fox entertainment news and must do something to 
stand out 
fen is foxs new showbiz news unit it has vowed to do far more 
than puff pieces we should believe them because they say it is so 
tonights grand opening includes the famous scenes of monroe 
cavorting nude no bare bosoms are sighted in a soundstage 
swimming pool at 20th century fox studios 
the show is written and narrated by henry schipper who is very 
earnest and carries on as if chronicling important stuff which is 
refreshing in this era of tv reporters who smile a lot 
a former print reporter of entertainment news he has a new 
book due out soon bridge over troubled water an inside history 
of the grammy awards 
schipper appears to be a fan of monroe who would be 64 now had 
she not died at 36 and made it kind of impossible to press on 
his thesis is that she wasnt a drugwracked wreck as is 
commonly thought when fired from give after eight weeks of 
filming she even was quietly rehired later he reports so nyah 
nyah nyah 
early on he discloses that she had her personal demons but as 
accompanying clips of her screen tests show she also was working 
hard as an actress and lighting up the screen as only she could 
to the very end marilyn monroe had a beauty and a sensual 
glow that no other actress could touch 
schipper gets a seconding motion from a film editor who worked 
on give a lighthearted sex comedy says the editor she was 
like a goddess she looked absolutely beautiful 
moving right along schipper also interviews various others who 
worked on the film up to and including the producer 
but perhaps the shows main value such as it is is the footage 
from give that had been thought destroyed 
the er historic shots of a mostly happy radiant monroe 
include her with two kids who played her children theyre 
interviewed too and with jess a poodle hired for the film jess 
keeps forgetting to bark on cue 
the offscreen dog trainer is heard to snap jess speak 
speak jess speak 
it is a high moment in the show better even than the 
nudemonroe swimming scenes which seem quite modest now but wowed 
em in 62 
she was said to have had a cold when she did the scene but was 
a trouper schipper says asserting that although her four hours 
in the pool had aggravated her virus marilyn continued to work 
and work well 
the other highlights in the show include schippers report that 
monroes absences from give its ensuing budget overruns and 
the studios bloated cleopatra caused stern measures to be 
taken at fox 
not only were other productions stopped but the watering of 
lawns on the lot was halted and the studio commissary was gasp 
shut down 
despite such fascinating reportage foxs monroe special just 
doesnt turn up anything scandalous or even exciting 
schipper tries hard by golly but when he concludes that the 
poor lady was a scapegoat for hollywoods dying studio system 
and was not an assemblyline star well 
better he had devoted the entire hour to insights about the 
actress from monroes psychiatrists daughter

first they bought a piece of property now as 
fears of joblessness spread homeowners are being urged to buy some 
peace of mind 
more and more lenders have been trying to sell coverage to 
homeowners that promises to pay monthly mortgage bills in the event 
of a job loss 
the new insurance pitch appearing in glossy brochures recently 
mailed out by banks to prospective and current homeowners is one 
of the latest leading indicators of todays rising unemployment 
the labor department reported last week that the nations 
jobless rate shot up to a threeyear high of 59 percent in 
november 
were getting swamped now with requests from all over for the 
coverage said richard t harris president of morgard inc of 
st davids which is one of the largest insurance agencies offering 
this sort of coverage 
roughly 40 banks and mortgage companies recently began marketing 
the new insurance he said including chase manhattan corp 
shearson lehman bros mortgage division and california federal 
savings loan 
for years banks have offered consumers the chance to buy 
insurance that covered the minimum balance on their monthly credit 
card bills in the event of unemployment death or disability 
banks say the new mortgage coverage is good for them as well as 
mortgage holders protecting the banks monthly loan payments and 
guarding a homeowners most valuable asset against foreclosure 
but consumer groups who have vigorously criticized credit card 
insurance as a highprofit product that costs consumers too much 
say that homeowners should approach the new mortgage insurance with 
similar caution 
we found that various forms of mortgage insurance are priced 
extremely high and are one of the primary methods banks are making 
their profits said peggy miller of the washingtonbased consumer 
federation of america 
miller said the group had not yet studied the new unemployment 
insurance offerings but she added prospective homeowners are 
particularly vulnerable to buying insurance without shopping around 
because they are extremely worried about getting a mortgage 
morgard said it graduates rates according to the occupation and 
geographic location of the policy holder its insurance is 
underwritten by large insurance firms including montgomery ward 
insurance co 
using monthly reports from the us labor department morgard 
deems some occupations and locations riskier than others in terms 
of their jobloss potential and raises rates accordingly harris 
said 
morgards average national rate is 3 percent of a homeowners 
monthly mortgage payment he said for a homeowner with a monthly 
payment of 1000 that would mean an insurance premium of around 
30 a month 
however some consumer groups said the window through which 
policy holders can collect seemed narrow for example the 
insurance doesnt begin paying benefits until 31 days after the 
homeowner becomes unemployed or the second mortgage payment 
if the homeowner becomes unemployed within 90 days following the 
inception of coverage benefits are limited to a refund of 
premiums after the second year of coverage the 90day cap is 
eliminated 
coverage also is limited to a year of monthly payments and a 
maximum of 2500 
considering the payback its a fairly high premium said 
robert hunter president of national insurance consumer 
organization he said that it made sense for homeowners who are 
very high risk for losing your job and are not going to get laid 
off too soon but maybe some day 
harris expects 5 percent to 8 percent of chases roughly 200000 
mortgage holders to sign up for the insurance initial mailings 
went out to 30000 chase customers on dec 1 
harris said the banks profit on the premium was minimal with 
commissions averaging 5 percent to 10 percent of the premium and 
usually covering only the banks cost of adminstering the 
insurance

lena olin was a tomboy she didnt want to be 
pretty she cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses she 
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties 
she changed once she turned 13 no one whos seen the 
unbearable lightness of being and enemies a love story would 
question that but watch those films the way she uncorks a wine 
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between olin and other 
women and youll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than 
a bowler hat 
and she hasnt stopped looking for new ways to bring that 
quality into her professional life as a swedish actress shes 
been compared to garbo but when olin speaks of tackling classic 
roles its not only camille thats on her mind 
one of my first stage parts was in a comedy called able 
drugger an english comedy olin dressed in jeans and a simple 
white blouse recalled in a recent interview i played a man and 
i enjoyed that i very much would like to play a man id like to 
do hamlet 
hamlet is a tragic male incapable of making up his mind but 
olin might be too tough as the danish prince her characters 
sabina in the unbearable lightness of being and masha in 
enemies a love story are erotic cynics intelligent 
complex highly sexual painfully selfaware 
theres something otherwordly about them theyre objects of 
desire yet very much alone they make their own rules fair play no 
longer matters theyve been hurt too often 
sabina is an avantgarde artist living in czechoslovakia during 
the 1968 uprising a free spirit in an oppressed country the 
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem 
pornographic masha for which olin received an academy award 
nomination for best supporting actress is an embittered holocaust 
survivor a force of life but an even stronger force of death 
in havana her new film olin plays roberta duran a swede 
trapped in a casablancalike love triangle torn between 
american playboygambler robert redford and cuban revolutionary 
raul julia roberta or bobbi as shes called is somewhat softer 
than masha or sabina shes more passive easier to manipulate and 
for olin an easier person to like 
sabinas so bored with life so fed up with life olin said 
and mashas so distraught she was hard to live with i like to 
be able to close the door to the studio but its very difficult 
with some characters i also felt very vulnerable when i did bobbi 
i wanted to be good when i did bobbi and i kept that with me 
masha was very hard to come back to every night to sleep with 
every night you touch areas in yourself that i dont think are 
very healthy to touch 
olin 35 was born in stockholm her parents were actors her 
father stij olin appearing in ingmar bergmans classic the 
seventh seal but they divorced when she was little and for all 
her all spirit she remembered herself as selfconscious and 
insecure more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside 
world 
i was a weird child and i still see things differently she 
recalled in a soft voice smiling shyly i always remember very 
strange things i have a capacity to walk in an apartment where 
there are boxes and papers and someone will say excuse the boxes 
and papers and ill say oh i didnt see that i think i 
concentrate on other things small things that can be revealing 
acting was the perfect way to express herself and at age 20 
olin entered the royal dramatic theater school joining bergmans 
famed company of players on stage she starred in the plays of 
shakespeare strindberg and chekhov and she also worked with 
bergman on films appearing in after the rehearsal and fanny 
and alexander 
olin sees nothing peculiar or silly about her tomboy roots it 
was a phase to build upon rather than outgrow a yearning to be in 
touch with all sides of herself a rebellion against the rules that 
men and women are supposed to obey that went beyond mere 
roleplaying 
if i ever had a daughter id bring her up the same way 
encourage her to do what i did said olin a single mother whose 
son august is named after strindberg 
i think its important for everyone to stay open not to be 
afraid and if you push that way i think that makes a difference 
for an actor the great thing about marlin brando hes very macho 
and all of that but theres a huge woman in there as well

victor bisio doesnt consider himself a fanatic 
about music even if he does own some 10000 albums and 2500 
compact discs 
but when he buys cds he expects them to live up to their 
original slogan perfect sound forever no pops no hisses 
no scratches music that brings you right in the studio 
thats why bisios massive collection includes a credit slip 
good for three albums from columbia records the slip arrived last 
summer a few months after he had purchased cds of barbra 
streisands first three records 
there had been mention from columbia that they couldnt find 
the original tapes but they put out the cds anyway said bisio a 
recording engineer who lives in encino calif they were are the 
worst sounding cds i ever heard they were screechy and distorted 
when she hit the high notes it just shattered your speakers 
compact discs arrived in the mid1980s and pushed lps out of 
stores since then bisio and other collectors have spent long 
hours comparing notes and keeping the pressure on record companies 
phil cohen a florida collector who owns over 6000 records 
bought the cd of jimi hendrixs electric ladyland three times 
before he found a satisfactory copy background noise made some 
tracks on james taylors sweet baby james virtually 
unlistenable for another collector 
collectors blame cd problems on laziness and greed insisting 
records made from inferior tapes were rushed onto the market and 
that songs were shortened or eliminated to fit albums on single 
discs the record companies admit mistakes but say some problems 
were unavoidable in switching from lps to cds 
in the beginning at least for the people who were asked to 
handle it it took a little bit more understanding of technology 
than to just say pull this tape and have it mastered said 
bill levinson director of catalog development at polygram records 
we had a handful of records eric claptons 461 ocean 
boulevard that were just not done from correct tapes the 461 
record was bad enough that we put out a new one and i told people 
in the press that we had done it 
among the worst cds 
fleetwood macs rumours a multiplatinum record originally 
released in the mid1970s it was pressed by warner bros records a 
decade later from an old production tape and the result was a 
muffled badly distorted cd a dramatically improved version was 
later released 
the jefferson airplanes after bathing at baxters was 
released in such poor condition that rca records apologized 
remastered the tape and offered an exchange 
collectors also had complaints about albums by elton john simon 
and garfunkel boz scaggs jimmy buffett carly simon and yes 
harry chapins verities and balderdash come without the booklet 
of photos and lyrics that was included on the lp gordon 
lightfoots gords gold was minus a song available on the lp 
there are some companies where no one in the music department 
makes the decision levinson said someone at the managerial 
desk says these next six ones are for reissue because the 
computer says these are the ones to go maybe theyre good maybe 
theyre not 
artists are beginning to take an active interest john arrias 
streisands personal engineer put together remastered versions of 
her first three records which have not yet been released 
guitarist jimmy page was so unhappy with the condition of several 
led zeppelin cds released by atlantic records he went back to the 
studio and helped produce a box set the bee gees consulted with 
polygram on a recent anthology which collectors say is very good 
and columbia which received the most criticism from collectors 
started columbialegacy records this year legacy has already put 
out wellreceived box sets of blues great robert johnson and the 
byrds made with the assistance of former band member roger 
mcguinn 
rich bauer product manager of catalog reissues at legacy said 
he hoped the problems were behind them 
when you try to put together a package from a record thats 
2025 years old it can be difficult to do everything as well as it 
can be done he said there are some records that havent come 
out such as the first two jeff beck records because of problems 
finding the original tapes 
polygram one of the first companies to set up its own domestic 
plant for producing cds received the most praise from collectors 
rhino records is also well regarded especially since its an 
independent label and needs permission from other companies to 
acquire master tapes 
we put out a compilation of hits of the 1970s and it was 
difficult explained gary stewart vice president of aampr artist 
and repertoire at rhino major labels are very professional 
good to deal with but for independent sources we have a hard time 
tracking them down and making deals especially companies no longer 
in the music business 
cds are digitally mastered as opposed to analog for lps a 
concept first tested in france in the 1920s digital is thought to 
produce a cleaner sound with less noise and distortion than 
analog 
digital recordings also known as pcm or pulse code modulation 
were first demonstrated in the late 60s and became available to 
the general public in 1972 when denon released the mozart hunting 
suite by the smetana quartet 
pcm recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until 
the 80s when they were issued in the form of a 5inch compact 
disc developed by sony and philips 
collectors have few complaints about new albums but records 
made more than 10 years ago create problems companies may have a 
hard time tracking down the original master and end up using a 
second or thirdgeneration tape also technology has advanced so 
rapidly that recreating sounds produced on old equipment can 
require drastic measures 
i recently completed several classical records released in the 
1950s and 1960s said dennis drake polygrams vice president of 
studio and technical operations to transfer this catalog to cd 
we had to reconstruct the original machines a tube tape recorder 
and tube console these machines playing back the masters gave us 
the exact sound of the original recordings 
collectors hope the worst is over 
pete howard publisher and editor of international cd exchange 
ice a monthly newsletter that reviews compact discs notes that 
letters he receives these days deal more with minor compliants 
song length lyrics etc 
still hard feelings remain collectors have asked record 
companies to drop the price of cds not made from the original 
masters and to label discs to inform the customer whether theyve 
been remastered from an earlier version 
but the sticker could mean different things said polygrams 
levinson the implication of remastering could mean the previous 
one was no good or the previous one might have been good and 
youre making it better 
i also wouldnt want to have to put it in the artwork all the 
time it costs more to do that than to do remastering its a 
tough issue of balancing information and consumer needs sometimes 
the consumer thinks he deserves more than we can give

episcopalians are caught up in agonizing debate 
over plans to hold their 1991 national convention in arizona now 
that the states voters have rejected a holiday honoring martin 
luther king jr 
even if the site remains the same as now seems likely leaders 
say it will be a different sort of convention shorn of celebrative 
frills and highlighting racial justice 
the debate has become so emotionally strained that the episcopal 
churchs presiding bishop the most rev edmond lee browning has 
called a special executive council meeting for jan 5 to consider 
ways to trim down the affair 
after weeks of debate contentious conference calls and 
consultations with church members especially blacks browning said 
he was convinced the church must adhere to its scheduled meeting 
place in phoenix july 1020 
i believe that this rougher road is the one that the church is 
meant to walk he said he has authority to determine the site 
with advice and consent of the executive council of the 25 
millionmember denomination 
the convention wont be business as usual browning said 
suggesting that it could be shortened and modified and also that it 
could offer a powerful witness in arizona to racial equality 
at his invitation south africas anglican archbishop the rev 
desmond tutu widely honored for his struggles against racism 
agreed to lead a rally to open the convention 
brownings comments havent quieted the arguing although the 
denomination has avoided a racial split whites and blacks are on 
both sides of the debate 
twelve of the 99 domestic episcopal dioceses and scores of 
local congregations have formally urged that the triennial 
governing convention either be canceled or held somewhere else 
warnings have come that some elected representatives might 
refuse to take part if the meeting stays in phoenix the 
washington dc diocesan council for example recommended its 
representatives not participate if its in arizona 
in urging another site the diocese of atlanta the birthplace 
of king offered to play host to the convention which usually 
draws more than 10000 church people 
the furor broke out after arizona voters in a nov 6 referendum 
narrowly defeated a proposed state holiday honoring the slain civil 
rights leader 
although months of advance planning already had been made for 
the episcopalians onceinthreeyears convention calls quickly 
arose for a switch in plans 
holding the convention in phoenix and the economic benefits 
associated with it would be an inappropriate witness to the 
churchs stand for racial equality the new york diocesan council 
declared 
ohio became a virtual intrastate battleground the ohio diocesan 
convention based in cleveland called for a new site but the 
southern ohio diocese based in cincinnati urged sticking with 
phoenix 
southern ohio bishop herbert thompson a black said that it was 
important to go to phoenix to show support for racial equality and 
that it would be costly and irresponsible to abandon numerous 
contracts made for the convention 
he said pulling out would imply abandoning arizona blacks and 
we need to stand with them at this time to overcome this 
injustice and prejudice 
but ohios suffragan bishop arthur williams jr also black 
said he didnt see how the convention could help much since we 
will spend most of the 20 days in an airconditioned hall or 
eating and sleeping 
ohio bishop james r moodey a white said some money might have 
to be paid to cancel advance guarantees but moral leadership 
not money should guide our decision 
other diocesan bodies calling for moving the meeting included 
the rio grande diocese based in albuquerque nm which includes 
southwestern texas and the new england province which has seven 
dioceses 
many secular and some auxiliary episcopal organizations scrapped 
plans for arizona meetings after the defeat of the king holiday 
the commissioner of the national football league said he will 
recommend the 1993 super bowl be moved from phoenix 
we do not have that choice browning said we are in this 
for the long haul we cannot turn our backs on the injustices done 
to minorities 
he said many arizonans have worked hard to overcome prejudice 
and need support he urged that we stand with them and together 
make a vigorous witness to the dignity of all gods people 
browning said the churchs executive council would discuss ways 
to scale down the convention rather than move it during the special 
meeting next month in elizabeth nj but that question conceivably 
could be opened by the 40member council 
several church leaders who have met with browning have suggested 
the convention should make an economic witness such as 
particularly patronizing minorityowned businesses

the monthly us catholic said that 76 percent of 
readers responding to a survey would welcome female priests in 
their parishes and that a third believe that perpetuating the 
maleonly priesthood is sinful 
the magazine which is published by the claretian order said 
the results were based on responses from 274 of the 1300 readers 
to whom questionnaires were mailed a majority of the respondents 
were women 
sixtynine percent said they thought that if jesus were living 
today in the united states he would ordain women 
if women were admitted to the roman catholic priesthood 50 
percent of those responding said they would encourage their 
daughters to become priests but 68 percent said they saw little 
hope in their lifetime of women being allowed in that role 
 
new haven conn ap the knights of columbus says the 
108yearold roman catholic fraternal and charitable organization 
has enrolled its 1500000th member michael j march of 
antigonish nova scotia 
 
nashville tenn ap the southern baptist executive committee 
has elected a new vice president for public relations for 
distinctly promotional purposes separating that job from news 
services 
the post previously was seen strictly as a newsreporting task 
prior to the firing earlier this year of the top journalists of 
baptist press at the behest of new fundamentalist leaders 
our convention at this time needs to hear about good and 
positive things that are occuring within the convention said the 
executive committees chairman sam w pace of antlers okla 
in naming mark t coppenger an indiana state baptist leader to 
the new post pace said that we feel this is more of a public 
relations responsibility than a press responsibility 
 
washington ap nearly 2000 ministers of the united church of 
christ signed a newspaper advertisement calling on president bush 
to refrain from war with iraq 
the fullpage ad which appeared in the washington post on dec 
11 said 
mr president do not go to war with iraq we call on you 
to work through the united nations and with other nations for a 
just and peaceful solution of this crisis 
it is our prayer that war can be avoided that the lives of 
thousands of innocent people can be spared and that a just peace 
will prevail in the middle east 
 
rye ny ap the union of american hebrew congregations says 
using force against iraq would be an acceptable moral option 
after other means of resolving the middle east crisis had been 
considered and explored 
the 200member policymaking board of trustees of the union 
representing reform judaism said using force would be acceptable 
to eliminate iraqs nuclear capabilities and to free invaded kuwait 
if peaceful means did not work 
 
richmond va ap members of the discovery united methodist 
church have produced a christmas video that portrays the story of 
the birth of jesus and also the history of santa claus 
many people just dont realize the connection between santa 
claus and the birth of christ said the rev jim lavender the 
churchs pastor we want to bridge that gap between religious and 
secular philosophies and let people know that indeed two 
historical legends are intertwined 
church members wrote produced and acted in the 30minute video 
using help from a richmondbased production company the video has 
a cast of 70 people 30 sheep 4 camels and a donkey

the daihatsu charade is a practical car that has special appeal 
for budgetminded households environmentalists qualityconscious 
consumers and anyone who frets over the safety of small cars 
built by the 83yearold japanese manufacturer daihatsu motor 
co the charade is a relative newcomer to the united states it 
arrived in the 1988 model year and sales thus far have totaled only 
about 36500 
the little car has gained attention in a short time however 
the charade is among the most fuelefficient cars sold in the 
united states which admirers say makes it both economical and 
cleaner than many competitors the consumer group public citizen 
named it one of the top environmentally sensitive vehicles in the 
country on the basis of fuel economy 
in october the automotive marketing research firm jd power 
and associates reported that the charade received more owner 
recommendations per vehicle than any other nameplate except acura 
in powers 1990 customer satisfaction survey 
and last year the charade ranked top in its class in 
crashworthiness tests by the national highway traffic safety 
administration 
the car protects its owners wallets pretty well too the base 
price of 6597 is less than half that of the average car and fuel 
economy in mixed cityhighway driving is over 40 miles per gallon 
the thriftiness is squeezed out of a threecylinder 1liter 
engine that develops only 53 horsepower pickup suffers with an 
engine that small and daihatsu should consider a tachometer to 
help drivers make their way through the fivespeed manual 
transmission 
the 1990 hatchback offered for testing got good marks for 
maneuverability however thanks to its small size 1449 inches 
long and rack and pinion steering 
the exterior was simple a 3door hatchback design similar to 
the ford festiva and dodge colt there wasnt even molding on the 
sides of the charade body but fit and finish were admirable 
the interior was spartan and fairly loud from engine and road 
noise though without rattles there were no side map pockets on 
the doors but there was a coin holder beneath the parking brake 
lever and the rear seat was fairly well cushioned another nice 
touch the ventilation fan did a good job of moving air around 
inside 
rear legroom was surprisingly good when the front seats were 
moved up a ways though my knees touched the seatbacks when they 
were moved all the way back on their tracks and reclined slightly 
daihatsu says there is 318 inches of rear legroom in the car 
nearly equal to the 319 inches in the new toyota tercel which is 
nearly 17 inches longer on the outside 
there was a handy rear tray to help cover items stowed in the 
hatchback area rear carpeting in the hatchback area was thin and 
had a tendency to bunch up behind the rear seat the seat by the 
way folds down for additional cargo space 
the car meets its goal of providing basic transportation and is 
a worthy competitor in the crowded subcompact field which includes 
the tercel starting at 6488 the nissan sentra starting at 
7999 and the honda civic starting at more than 6600 
daihatsu says on average its buyers are about 30 have some 
college education and an annual household income of between 25000 
and 40000 
the 235 daihatsu dealers in 22 states are still selling 1990 
models the company says it does not expect 1991 models to arrive 
in showrooms until february prices of the 1991 models have not 
been announced 
consumer reports did not have an owner trouble report for the 
charade

thomas nast elevated american political 
cartooning out of the realm of whimsy in the late 19th century 
shocking the public with his scathing portrayals of politicians and 
other public figures 
his drawings were credited with electing one presidential 
candidate and blamed for contributing to the death of another 
he held new york citys political machine up to ridicule across 
the nation and he left us several enduring symbols the 
starsandstripessuited uncle sam the democratic party donkey 
the republican elephant the tammany hall tiger and the rotund 
redjowled image of santa claus 
in the 150th year since his birth nast and his work are the 
subjects of renewed interest his christmas scenes are becoming 
more popular a biography is nearing completion and his 
sesquicentennial is being celebrated in major exhibitions in 
morristown his longtime residence and landau germany his 
birthplace 
he was indisputably the father of american political 
cartooning he really defined the art form as we know it said 
richard samuel west author of a 1988 biography of cartoonist 
joseph keppler a nast contemporary 
west said nast transformed the droll genteel world of political 
cartooning that existed in pre1860 america 
nast came along and said this politician is like the devil 
he is evil he is stealing your money and it shocked people 
said west he was dogmatic he was angry and he cared deeply 
about what was happening in the country 
an example was nasts tammany tiger representing the new york 
political machine of tammany hall often seen attacking the values 
of american society 
draper hill an editorial cartoonist with the detroit news who 
is writing a nast biography said nasts style was influenced by 
german french and english cartooning such as using animals and 
shakespearean references and his own political convictions 
he had a sense of integrity and independence from editorial 
policy that was nonexistent at the time said hill 
nast left landau for new york at age 6 and was drawing 
illustrations for city publications by his late teens he launched 
his career in 1860 by covering the campaign of italian patriot 
guiseppe garibaldi for illustrated publications in london and 
paris 
he reached his peak in the 1870s drawing for harpers weekly 
the nations most widely read magazine his work was prodigious 
more than 8000 drawings for his career 
he turned new york city political power william marcy boss 
tweed into a metaphor for corruption often depicting him as a 
bulging sack of money 
he did generous portrayals of civil war hero ulysses s grant 
who credited nast with helping him win the presidency in 1868 
some people felt nast went too far in his attack on publisher 
horace greeley a 1872 candidate for president against grant 
nasts lengthy assault on the candidate included illustrations 
of greeley defiling lincoln and eating his own words one drawing 
showed greeleys white hat and coat on a pole stormtossed and 
labeled something that will blow over 
greeley lost overwhelmingly and died soon after the election 
there were claims that nast contributed mightily to the rigors of 
greeleys campaign according to hill 
jim borgman a nationally syndicated editorial cartoonist for 
the cincinnati enquirer said nast may have exercised too much 
power 
nast could paint the world the way he saw it and a lot of 
people did not have a counterbalance i dont want to have that 
kind of responsibility borgman said 
he added that cartoonists today often eschew backing a cause in 
favor of lampooning just about everything 
herb block a washington post cartoonist who favors the nast 
approach agrees 
a lot of cartoonists today are doing just a kind of a gag 
cartoon without having any policy angle block said 
he said one of his nastinspired drawings showed caspar 
weinberger former us defense secretary with a 640 toilet seat 
around his neck symbolizing waste in the military 
the biggest nast displays this year have been in landau and 
morristown where the macculloch hall museum has a large permanent 
collection on display 
the landau museum has more than 2000 harpers weeklies said 
nicole van aanholt organizer of nast exhibitions there she said 
another major exhibit is planned for bonn germany in december 
nearly a dozen nast political drawings also can be seen at the

the long list of photography books this year 
ranges from the 13th collection of photojournalism by lifes alfred 
eisenstaedt now 91 to the very edge of the photography as art 
debate with the works of the 29yearold starn twins 
in between there are many familiar names with elegies to 
western photographer ansel adams to photographer and filmmaker 
paul strand and to robert mapplethorpe 
but 1990 also reflected an increasing awareness for the work of 
women and of conceptual photographers 
women photographers harry n abrams 65 provides a full 
survey of women photographers they include pioneers such as julia 
margaret cameron and gertrude kasebier and emerging work such as 
the startlig documentary shots from central america of susan 
meiselas and the conceptual art of jan groover 
lisette model university of chicago press 3596 is among 
the best of the books on individual photographers it is the 
catalog for an exhibit that opened in ottawa this fall the first 
major retrospective on one of this centurys most innovative 
photographers and effective teachers whose pupils included such 
luminaries as diane arbus the text which takes great pains to 
demystify model an often intentionally baffling pesonality is as 
enjoyable as the photographs of the odd assortment of characters on 
whom she focused her camera 
cindy shermans untitled stills rizzoli 3750 is a 
collection of her works from the 1970s when she made a tremendous 
splash with her concept of photographing herself in hollywoodstyle 
poses she has since moved on to other things but her stills 
remain a provocative case study in postmodern art well treated in 
the lucid introductory essay by philosopher arthur danto 
lucia moholy florence henri and other women get fair notice in 
photography at the bauhaus mit press 75 it is a sweeping 
work with elaborate essays and about 450 photographs covering every 
phase of the exciting and important experimental art movement of 
the 20s and early 30s with biographies on all of the artists 
of the place books the best are of historic interest and are by 
women including photographing montana 18941928 alfred 
knopf 60 a look at the old west through the eyes of evelyn 
cameron a britisher to the manor born who fell for the big sky 
country during a visit and decided to stay 
published last year but on a slow journey to bookshelves is 
eudora welty photographs university of mississippi press 
50 offering scenes from the south by a writer who has been one 
of its most distinctive chroniclers for 50 years her photography 
has especially strong documentary value because of her penchant 
even as far back as the 30s to focus so often on ordinary 
citizens 
also noteworthy both for content and as a look at a good 
personal collection of photographs is nancy hathaways native 
american portraits 18621918 chronicle books 1695 these 
portraits riveting as a sad chronicle of the indians during their 
demise is from new york attorney kurt koeglers collection 
werner bischof bulfinch press 65 is a testament to the 
swiss photojournalist who died young in 1954 the book includes his 
famous life photo essay on famine in india and work from china 
japan and indochina it also includes his wellwritten 
correspondences telling of a young photographers battle to 
maintain integrity while feeding a world market hungry for shots of 
exotic suffering 
bischofs appearance seems so timely given the continued current 
attention to sebastiao salgado whose work in south america hints 
at the kinds of shots bischof and others who worked for robert capa 
in the 1940s might have taken salgados an uncertain grace 
aperture 60 is largely made up of powerful scenes of 
deprivation 
gentler is ansel adams the american wilderness it is 
published by bulfinch with 146 pages and 107 duotones in 
impressive large format that give his vistas more the scope they 
deserve but at 100 it is an expensive look 
equally costly is the fine retrospective on paul strand put out 
by aperture and the national gallery of art which catalogs a show 
that opened at the national gallery this month and travels over the 
next two years to chicago st louis houston new york san 
francisco and london 
strand always a reluctant printer of his own works teamed with 
richard benson to produce a project of prints completed as he lay 
dying at his home in france it must have been painful for him but 
given the paucity of his prints that were extant the project made 
for both a fine show on the centenary of strands birth and an 
important archive 
robert mapplethorpes flowers bulfinch 50 might be the 
final chapter for some time in the career of the man who drew wider 
attention to photography in a shorter time than almost anyone 
before him the photographs are lovely in their technical 
production and in their startling sensuality as his friend patti 
smith indicates in her introduction mapplethorpe was the lily and 
the orchid but also their sinister shadow 
the most pleasingly different approaches are an anglers

mounting discontent and a ruined economy 
are forcing reform in albania europes last bastion of stalinism 
where leaders are buying time by making surprising concessions 
three days of student protest in the albanian capital tirana 
prompted the startling decision tuesday by the ruling communists to 
permit other political movements five members of the 13member 
ruling politburo also were dropped and government changes promised 
the decisions came just before president ramiz alia head of 
state and of the ruling albanian labor party met a group of the 
striking students urging them to return to class and to work 
peacefully within the law for the reforms they seek 
the students said they would hold more rallies and start their 
own party 
albania has a turbulent history for centuries it was dominated 
by italian or ottoman turkish rulers and it gained true 
independence only after world war ii under the stalinist enver 
hoxha 
alia who took over when hoxha died in 1985 appears to be 
trying to contain an explosion of popular anger with swift 
political maneuvering and timely concessions 
in july he defused the most serious crisis to date allowing 
thousands of albanians jammed into foreign embassies in tirana to 
emigrate and reshuffling the leadership to offer the public 
scapegoats to blame for political repression and economic misery 
wage increases also were promised but albanians say they have 
not materialized 
but this afforded only temporary respite from the leaders basic 
dilemma how to make the changes needed to get the economy going 
while retaining control and avoiding open rebellion 
at a communist party meeting last month premier adil carcani 
painted a picture of catastrophe in the economy alia bluntly told 
workers on nov 29 that the economy is on the brink of a state of 
emergency 
the drought has severely curbed electric supplies mainly 
generated from hydroelectric stations in the countrys rugged 
mountains and affected crops grown on the fertile coastal plains 
the students protest that brought this weeks historic changes 
reportedly began with demands for more heat and light in their 
wintry tirana dormitories 
alia has attempted to ease food shortages particularly of meat 
by allowing private shops that sell at two or three times the state 
prices he has also promised imports of food and other items but 
lacks the necessary hard currency to carry out the pledge 
isolated for decades albania is also seeking foreign 
investment as alia himself warned the students tuesday that wont 
come if there is political instability 
but there is much cause for discontent in towns most homes are 
in slumlike threestory apartment blocks factories are outdated 
and extremely dilapidated in the countryside children trudge 
miles to school while women tend fields with primitive picks and 
hoes 
most albanians seem to express their disgust with this state of 
affairs by working less and less ignoring the leaderships many 
appeals to toil for economic improvement 
but a leadership steeped in decades of authoritarian rule is 
finding it hard to adjust to the new changes 
it remains to be seen whether any new political parties will be 
allowed to contest scheduled parliamentary elections in february 
the communists have made no mention of giving up their 
constitutional monopoly on power 
also a population unused to democracy might find it difficult 
to organize any opposition to the communists who have dominated 
public life since taking power in 1944 
students were a powerful force behind many of eastern europes 
revolutions last year and are among the few groups in albania who 
have the courage and unity to challenge the communists 
with the highest birth rate in europe albania is a country of 
young people about 75 percent of its 32 million people are under 
40 they learn about the outside world from television broadcasts 
from neighboring yugoslavia greece and italy and from the 
albanianlanguage service of voice of america 
this contact with the outside world and the reforms made this 
year have emboldened the young who do not have the deeply 
instilled fear of those who survived hoxhas harsh rule

joyce burditt has bumped off 72 people by one 
devious means or another and she has no regrets 
miss burditt admits to having a good time as she confines her 
bent for murder to the scripts of abcs father dowling 
mysteries and the nbc legal drama matlock she is a 
coproducer on each series 
its difficult to think of all those murders she said 
but its such fun i have no regrets whatsoever its wonderful 
when we have our story meetings and come up with interesting ways 
to do away with people can we hang someone no we hanged someone 
last year what kind of poison kills instantly the only murder 
that made me uneasy was on matlock the victim was in a bathtub 
and someone threw a hair dryer into the tub 
although shes an experienced writer miss burditt said she 
found it difficult to adapt to the mystery format 
id written two books and several movies but until i started 
on father dowling and matlock id never plotted a killing that 
had to be solved she said it was a whole new way of thinking 
and writing for me you have to come up with a murder that will 
interest people 
you have to let the audience know what father dowling knows 
and what sister steve knows i work out the premise of the story 
and the beginning it has to be in a setting that will involve your 
character then i skip to the end 
the acts in between will take you through all the twists and 
turns to the solution the murder mystery tends to be formulaic 
you start out with dowling you have to connect the victim or the 
killer to him there must be some personal relationship the clues 
have to be there for everyone to see 
at the time of the interview she was working on a political 
assassination story for father dowling 
its a real puzzle miss burditt said it takes you in one 
direction and then another dowling is the friend of a black 
baptist minister and we open in his church with gospel music the 
target is a candidate for district attorney if we do it right the 
audience will think the target is one candidate while its really 
the other 
we also have another murder that of a young black musician 
the ministers grandson is a suspect the suspects father is a 
police captain and he disapproves of him playing in a jazz club 
so its a generational story and a chase to prevent the 
assassination 
miss burditt had worked as a program executive at abc and had 
been vice president for comedy development at nbc at abc she had 
formed a relationship with fred silverman who was then president 
of abc entertainment and now is an executive producer of father 
dowling and matlock 
she was asked to join the writing staff of matlock after 
writing a movie for silvermans company then the writers guild 
went on strike and she had to wait six months to start work 
i was working on matlock but i would see the dailies on 
father dowling miss burditt said i loved the relation 
between the priest and the nun im catholic and went to parochial 
schools for 12 years so that gives me a good foundation to work 
on 
the requirements for each show are different father dowling 
is more of a traditional mystery dowling and sister steve played 
by tom bosley and tracy nelson solve murders as amateur 
detectives matlock is in the tradition of perry mason 
andy griffith stars as a defense attorney who must prove his client 
innocent 
although each show uses freelance writers they rely heavily on 
a staff of producers who perform double duty as writers because of 
the time pressures of getting out a weekly show 
miss burditt also is the author of two books the cracker 
factory which was made into a movie with natalie wood in 1979 
and triplets she wrote the movie under the influence 
which starred andy griffith 
the cracker factory was based on miss burditts recovery 
from alcoholism 
it takes place in a psychiatric ward in a cleveland 
hospital she said i was treated there for alcoholism because 
at that time they didnt regard it as a disease that was 23 years 
ago and that was when i had my last drink

this is the first in an occasional series 
examining the changing family 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on mondays it was meatloaf with string beans and a baked 
potato the ritual evening meal usually served around 630 or so 
was alive with laughter and the inevitable family squabbles 
the arguments generally were settled before the dinner hour 
rolled around again what lingered were memories of the corny 
jokes a little parental wisdom perhaps the brief quiet after 
grace was said 
dinner time in america conjures images of the hearth the nest 
family members gather around the table to share their lives and 
perhaps learn a little from one another 
thats the snapshot we hold its the way families are supposed 
to be but the idyll of regular warm togetherness at the table 
often doesnt work out 
the nuclear family of yesteryear has in many cases splintered 
today more than half of mothers hold down jobs outside the home 
kids too are busier than ever with afterschool sports and other 
activities 
all too often the dinner hour is fast food inhaled in front of 
the television set instead of around a table set with silverware 
and napkins 
yet recent polls have shown the vast majority of americans make 
an effort to dine together regularly parents recognize that 
mealtime often is the only real chance family members have to get 
involved in each others lives 
we are all caught between reality and the expectation of 
leave it to beaver where everyone sits around the table and 
makes chirpy conversation said susan ginsberg editor of work amp 
family life newsletter 
the reality is that we are all so busy that we find it hard to 
sit down together said ginsberg who also directs work and 
family programs at bank street college in new york we have less 
time than we did 25 years ago 
but most parents believe dining together should be a priority 
it encourages openness helps kids develop conversational skills 
strengthens the family unit 
the goal of dinner time is not to sit silently and eat said 
thomas weisner an anthropologist at the university of 
californialos angeles the goal is to share knowledge and 
information reaffirm cultural values 
weisner and eleanor ochs a linguist and colleague at ucla 
spent three years studying videotapes of mealtimes in 20 los 
angeles households struggling to preserve the dinner hour amid 
modern lifes competing demands 
the most important thing that we found was that regardless of 
socieconomics or the dinner arrangements all the families used the 
time to talk about problems and problemsolving ochs said 
its a nice scenario the image of loving parents brothers and 
sisters participating in each others lives 
but dont despair if dinner table conversation at your house 
tends more toward complaints about undercooked spaghetti and 
sibling taunts and blowups over grades chores or next years 
family vacation destination 
we all have this fantasy about the perfect dinner said 
ellen galinsky of the families and work institute of new york 
then you sit down and nobody likes the food or people fight 
 
you feel really rotten because you think that at other 
peoples houses theyre having discussions about the election or 
coming recession or some other meaningful topic said galinsky 
who conducts parenting seminars 
the fact is family dinner hours dont always make for erudite 
conversation sometimes they are raucous or downright rocky but 
thats all right the experts say what counts is the act of 
sitting down of setting time aside 
june and tom darlings seven children know that their memories 
differ but all hold close the chaos that was dinner time at their 
home the almosta ranch in southern michigan 
having rituals is important said the familys 71yearold 
matriarch ours was a big round table with two extra leaves it 
could easily sit 10 and we all knew when daddy got home it was 
time to gather round 
the darling childrens lives have veered far from that 1950s 
tableau they now are adults with kids of their own and like much 
of america they struggle to keep family tradition alive despite 
lifes complications 
we need to make choices here said janice darling one of 
five daughters who all went on to become mothers we need to 
sacrifice a few things so we have a little calm in our lives time 
to enjoy each other

theyve come to cherish a whole childhoods worth of dinners 
shared around a solid maple table near an open kitchen hearth but 
tom and june darlings seven kids have branched out in seven 
directions making new traditions for themselves in their own 
homes 
theirs are the dinner tables of today 
the eldest nancy darling hutchinson of houston with her 
husband raised three sons who are starting families of their own 
the youngest tom and michael run the family hardware store in 
marshall mich they make it home for dinner pretty much every 
night the way their father did 
in between are the four middle daughters who like so many 
parents across america are carving new traditions from a family 
legacy 
heres a glimpse of how the darlings dinner time ritual has 
evolved 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
janice darlings variety store is nestled among the twinkling 
lights and garlands that festoon main street all of marshall 
mich seems to be in the oldfashioned holiday spirit 
its the time of year when janice feels slightly nostalgic a 
little mournful for old times like dinner with her parents and six 
brothers and sisters gathered round 
its also the time of year the single mother keeps her shop open 
seven days a week instead of the usual six the time of year when 
life is even more frenetic than usual 
dinner is the first thing to go said janice 44 who is 
struggling to adapt the 1950s traditions she and her siblings knew 
growing up to the realities of todays changeable world 
theres just no time she said i would like to be home 
around 530 and have dinner all ready turn off the tv and just sit 
and talk just chat i miss that 
but janices 15yearold daughter jennifer needs to be at band 
practice she plays clarinet or swim team shes got a great 
freestyle stroke or the library a book report is due 
and janice who works 70hour weeks needs to get back to 
darling amp daughter the dime store she runs for her father 
dinner is generally a fastfood affair hamburgers pizza or 
takeout chicken wolfed down in front of the evening news or most 
often en route somewhere 
we have our mealtime in the car thats our time together 
janice said you spill stuff down your front but no matter what 
were still getting in touch 
janice and her daughter have traditions theyre just not 
traditional traditions their rituals are tailored to a single mom 
and daughter whose lives and needs cant be scripted 
dinner time at my house it very unruly it makes me feel bad 
that we dont have enough time to sit and listen to each other 
janice said it cant be but i long for the days when you sat on 
the front porch rocking and watching your neighbors walk by

on just about any evening youll find gail darling morgan her 
husband and three children gathered for dinner at their twostory 
home in west palm beach fla 
they use cloth napkins and placemats the atmosphere generally 
is calm and the discussions a bit civilized it probably wont 
last 
her kids will be teenagers in a few short years 
but right now my kids are still young said gail 39 
theres a six or sevenyear period where theyre accepting of 
whatever is put in front of them before they become 
sophisticated and busy 
already gails elder two kids by a previous marriage are 
beginning to participate in sports and join afterschool clubs 
so far we definitely make it together for one meal a day 
gail said i really think that its an important time for us and 
its something i want to continue 
it helps that gails job managing a dental office is only part 
time and that her husband photographer red morgan works out of 
their florida home 
i have the luxury of being here and having time to prepare 
things gail said but im already beginning to use the 
microwave a whole lot more and i feel guilty about that 
the phone is always ringing their 1yearold baby needs 
diapering and the refrigerator forever needs stocking thats where 
the best of old traditions crops up everyone pitches in 
a recent study of us families found that the female head 
prepared dinner in 85 percent of households set the table in 65 
percent and cleared the dishes in 68 percent 
preserving the tradition of dinner together requires a joint 
effort the idealized portrait of mother with an apron and warm 
cookies perpetually at the ready just doesnt apply for a lot of 
families these days shes more likely to be carrying a briefcase 
my daughter sets the table at our house its part of the 
occasion gail said its the only time of day we can talk 
about what happened at school whatever is going on its the time 
of day when everyone is present and seated and maybe listening

jane darling duell and her husband bob remember simpler times 
the days when dinner hour fell like clockwork no negotiation 
but those days are long gone with three teenagers 
participating in seven sports between them the duells have learned 
that flexibility is the only way any peace can be kept at their 
home in goshen ind 
its just not leave it to beaver anymore there are very few 
families where dinner is served at 530 and everyone sits down at 
the table said jane a high school french teacher and janice 
darlings twin sister 
they do their best to dine together but the logistics are a bit 
daunting to get around scheduling conflicts that cut into family 
dinner time the duells have worked out other ways of sharing each 
others lives 
sometimes the kids do their homework at a table in the living 
room sidebyside with jane as she grades her students papers or 
the family holds a meeting before everyone turns in for the night 
its the best way we know to handle the situation said bob 
duell who as principal of goshen high school also looks after 
other peoples teenagers 
the roles and expectations today are so confused he said 
used to be that kids knew a meal was going to be cooked and 
everybody was going to be there now kids dont even know if anyone 
will be home 
the duells dont want their kids to feel that way every chance 
they get they establish an hour at which their kids are expected 
home for dinner 
its an excellent chance for the family to get together and 
communicate bob said 
and communicate they do usually in loud voices dinner is 
nothing fancy but theres time to ask how the kids are doing in 
chemistry tell funny stories hear how things went at football 
practice or swim team or soccer softball chorus student 
government 
my calendar looks like president bushs jane said but 
whether its the traditional route or not time together is a 
priority and you have to work to get that time to be a 
family

by the time ann darling perryman finishes the hourlong commute 
from her new york office home to suburbia her husband has dinner 
on the stove 
its not a traditional arrangement but its a system that 
works 
and probably the only way we were going to commit to 
dinner as a ritual said ann director of publications at lehman 
college cooking was never one of my claims 
james perryman figured that out about the time the couple had 
their daughter 15 years ago 
he finally said ann prisoners are eating better than i am 
the second eldest darling daughter recalled and he took over 
the cooking i havent been to a supermarket in 10 years 
anns husband a freelance writer has over the years learned 
how to turn out a decent salmon loaf and a table conducive to 
conversation 
it means a lot to him said ann 49 and i think its 
terrific dinner time is the time when we sort of do our audit we 
talk about current events what happened on the subway 
things in our daily lives 
this is a modern family an unconventional family ann has 
sometimes been critical of the way she and her six brothers and 
sisters grew up in michigan 
but in the end she says i guess my parents did something 
ok 
they provided a big round table where dinner hour was regular 
and a game of hearts often followed after the dishes were cleared 
they provided a sense of the family as a unit a sense of 
security in an unpredictable world 
i remember my father used to shout when i was tipping back 
in my chair hed also say that we couldnt get through a meal 
without somebody spilling their milk ann remembered 
we had a big family a noisy family she said but i 
think youve got to sit down together if youre never in the same 
place at the same time thats a loss 
and the dinner table well thats not the only way of doing 
it its just a nice way of doing it

the memo from executive producer john sacret 
young to the cast and crew of abcs china beach was cheerfully 
glum if such a thing is possible 
in all this i sometimes wonder why we struggle but im 
attaching two letters we received yesterday they make it all 
worthwhile it said 
the acclaimed creator of one of televisions most innovative 
shows now knows firsthand the ultimate rule of iconoclastic tv 
making 
fan mail rave reviews loyal audiences emmy awards and just 
plain talent are not enough a television show lives by the ac 
nielsen co ratings and dies by the ratings 
china beach still has a pulse but its in a coma nbcs 
parenthood another highly acclaimed but littlewatched 
program is likewise in limbo 
their predicament is nothing new in the world of television 
where quality and success quite often are mutually exclusive 
what is new is the lengths to which some producers will go to 
pressure a network into standing by a dismally rated but 
qualityminded show 
in the face of threatened cancellation people like young and 
andrew susskind of parenthood are talking back to networks that 
have the power to make them and their staffs eligible for 
unemployment 
i think theyre caught in real shortterm thinking right 
now susskind said of nbc theyre no 1 but their lead is 
shrinking im not sure they have the same kind of confidence they 
had when they were no 3 and shooting for no 1 which was to give 
quality shows a chance 
the sad part is that overall abc has supported the show the 
way you support someone you love and then shoot off another limb 
young said of china beach 
the fox broadcasting co gave probably the biggest chance of any 
network to its highest quality series 
the tracey ullman show which spawned the simpsons won 
fox its first emmy and ran for four seasons was often the 
leastwatched show on television still fox never yanked it it 
ended this year only after ullman quit 
we loved the show said fox entertainment group president 
peter chernin we had enormous respect and admiration for the 
people who were doing it 
nbc will not say if parenthood will be canceled but it has 
not aired since nov 19 and its last two original episodes are not 
on the primetime schedule 
theyve said its very iffy right now said susskind the 
president of imagine television which produces the show im 
doing what i can to at least let people know that the show is in 
trouble 
what susskind is doing is a calculated effort to place pressure 
on nbc by calling television critics who gave parenthood 
favorable reviews and making himself available for interviews 
susskind is upping the cancellation games ante 
of some 30plus new shows this season parenthood stood out 
for several reasons it was produced by the television division of 
ron howards highly successful imagine films it was a takeoff 
from the popular feature film of the same name and it featured an 
ensemble cast that included ed begley jr st elsewhere 
jayne atkinson a year in the life and william windom my 
world and welcome to it 
it also got great reviews 
it didnt however get great ratings a fact that susskind 
blames in part on its time period of 8 pm saturdays 
susskind wants nbc to move the show and stick with it just a 
little longer given the research weve done any time period is 
better than the one were in he said nbc executives declined 
comment 
changing time periods is a common network maneuver for 
resuscitating dying shows in most cases though it only prolongs 
the inevitable 
young knows this well china beach has changed time slots 
two times in two years marked for cancellation last season the 
awardwinning vietnam war series was saved at the last minute only 
to be moved to the kissofdeath time period of 9 pm saturdays 
up against nbcs formidable golden girls 
there it has languished dropping to the bottom third of the 
nielsen rankings 
last month abc announced china beach would be placed on 
hiatus after the dec 15 episode and return at an undisclosed date 
to finish its season run 
asked if he thought the series would return for another new 
season young replied i think its a possibility but not a 
great likelihood 
young asserts that china beach did quite well in its 
original time period of 10 pm wednesdays but when abc moved it 
to mondays and then to saturdays viewers couldnt keep up he 
said abc executives declined comment 
young countered the networks latest china beach 
announcement by faxing a copy of his acerbic internal memo to the 
countrys largest news organizations 
young and susskinds approaches are high profile but no one 
waged a more public campaign to save his show than barney 
rosenzweig the executive producer of cagney amp lacey 
indeed rosenzweig may have elevated network pressure to an art 
form 
the year was 1983 and rosenzweig was making television history 
by producing a cop show starring two women who did not jiggle have 
big hair or wear bikinis in the line of duty 
cagney and lacey were tough smart sometimes grumpy sometimes 
selfdestructive cops cbs citing poor ratings canceled the show 
after two seasons 
rosenzweig out of a job and his marriage hit an emotional and 
professional low with nothing better to do he answered all 2000 
fan letters protesting the shows cancellation 
i said it was my perception that no one in power at the 
network was reading their mail rosenzweig recalled i 
suggested that they write to their local newspapers on the theory 
that the network executives might not read their mail but they do 
read their newspapers

nominations four were for cagney amp lacey 
a month later the network called to say it had made a mistake 
cagney amp lacey was reinstated 
that had never happened in the history of modern television 
and its never happened again rosenzweig said 
now the executive producer of cbs the trials of rosie 
oneill featuring former cagney amp lacey costar sharon 
gless rosenzweig said he didnt know if his approach would have 
the same impact in todays television market 
i think now it lacks the juice that it had when it was all 
sort of happening spontaneously he said 
so what should a network do in the evercompetitive fight for 
viewers who now can choose from cable independent stations and 
home video rentals 
if youre doing something qualitative let it stay on 
rosenzweig said dont pull the trigger give that show a chance 
to connect leave it on for at least a season

for some agriculture department analysts with 
good memories old textbooks or both there are some disturbing 
similarities between whats been going on since about 1981 and the 
boomthatbusted era of the 1920s and 30s 
current speculation about whether the united states is already 
in an economic recession hasnt boosted holiday spirits either 
but john kitchen and gregory gajewski of the departments 
economic research service think a recession will be mild by 
historical standards unless a few things go completely haywire 
kitchen and gajewski writing in the current issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine say their prediction is based on 
things staying relatively stable no war in the mideast and no big 
hammering by other problems 
while there is the potential for a mild recession and a slim 
chance for a severe downturn the outlook is for continued mediocre 
growth in the economy over the next year the report said 
the nations economy was said to be especially weak in the 
final quarter of 1990 and probably will be fairly weak through 
the first half of 1991 before reviving 
a number of worrisome items confront agricultural economists 
not the least of which is the stalled uruguay round of trade talks 
that was recently recessed in geneva because of disputes over 
limiting commodity price supports and export subsidies 
whether the talks will resume in the weeks or months ahead on 
any kind of harmonious note remains to be seen 
the persian gulf crisis also has had an effect on domestic 
energy prices and federal spending on maintaining the large us 
military presence in that region 
kitchen and gajewski said the uncertainties over gatt and the 
persian gulf along with a relatively tight monetary policy by 
the federal reserve the past several months are big factors 
putting it all together has led some analysts to draw parallels 
with the late 1920s and early 1930s 
the us economy grew strongly in the late 20s but then 
faltered leading to financial failures and in retrospect policy 
mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s 
according to the report some of the policies undertaken during 
the crisis period of 193032 included higher income tax rates 
heightened protectionism through increased tariffs and a 
restrictive monetary policy by the fed 
lowerincome earners saw their tax rates rise sixfold to 
eightfold and higher income earners saw their rates double or 
triple the report said similarly tariff rates were raised 
sharply the average rate jumped from 38 percent in 1925 to 59 
percent in 1932 
further the federal reserves tight money policy of the early 
1930s and the contraction of the money supply by onethird during 
192933 are welldocumented in 1929 there were more than 25000 
banks by 1933 fewer than 15000 were left 
the report said that in 1921 and again in 1981 there was a 
crumbling of expectations that farm income would continue growing 
farmland values fell 26 percent in 192128 and 48 percent during 
198188 
prices received by farmers in the 1920s and the 1980s declined 
relative to prices paid for goods needed to produce crops and 
livestock 
income was essentially the same in 1929 as in 1919 the 
report said likewise for income in 1989 compared with 1979 it 
plunged early in each period and then recovered by the end of each 
decade 
but agriculture moved down with the rest of the us economy 
during the 192933 plunge the report said all key indicators 
slipped sharply including farmland values prices of commodities 
prices paid by farmers and exports 
despite some of the parallels the report said that upon closer 
examination todays policy shifts and instabilities are not 
nearly as severe as those of 60 years ago 
while the recent federal budget package reduces the 
expansionary nature of fiscal policy the package certainly is not 
excessively restrictive the report said most individuals 
income tax rates will not change 
the budget package agreed to by congress and the bush 
administration calls cuts of nearly 500 billion including 135 
billion from usda programs over the next five years 
also the spending cuts are largely either cuts from planned 
growth in expenditures or planned cuts from a year earlier that 
depend on future economic growth the report said 
specifically the planned spending cuts could be eased 
significantly if the economy performs worse than some fairly 
optimistic assumptions spelled out in the package 
the analysis also said consumer confidence in banks although 
down recently is higher than in the late 1920s and early 1930s in 
part because of federal deposit insurance which didnt exist then 
back then banks held off from making loans to keep cash on 
hand thus reassuring depositors the report said but with 
fewer loans many companies contracted or went out of business 
finally it said downward spiral in trade protectionism on a 
scale of the 1930s does not appear likely 
even if protectionist policies increase the worlds economies 
probably would evolve into competing freetrade areas so trade 
would not contract as much as it did in the 1930s

researchers discovered the gene responsible for the illness 
often mistakenly called elephant mans disease but known correctly 
as neurofibromatosis they then made the surprising finding that 
the gene was a genetic cancer switch suggesting that 
neurofibromatosis was related to cancer 
the tumors associated with neurofibromatosis may be a kind of 
halfway point between normal tissue and cancer tissue the finding 
promises to speed research toward both a cure for neurofibromatosis 
and an understanding and possible new treatments for cancers of the

for the first time in the brief tragic history of 
aids the news was not all bad in 1990 
no one found a cure for the disease nor was there yet a vaccine 
to prevent it and certainly aids still spread and killed 
but the unremitting gloom parted a bit scientists spoke of 
hope of real possibilities just over the medical horizon the goal 
was to keep healthy people from getting infected and to keep those 
who were infected from falling ill 
in 1990 it became more clear that such aims are realistic 
controlling aids should be possible 
among the milestones of 1990 
during the first half of the year in the united states fewer 
deaths from aids were reported than during the last half of 1989 
it was the first such decline since recordkeeping began in 1981 
and probably results from treatment with the medicine azt 
the epidemic clearly tapered off among homosexual men who 
account for almost twothirds of aids cases in the united states 
repeated experiments showed that vaccines can prevent aids in 
chimps and monkeys 
dozens of new aids drugs were in development and two of them 
ddi and ddc moved well along in human testing 
of course the year also had its share of gloomy aids 
developments 
worldwide the disease still spread rapidly an estimated 8 
million people are infected 5 million of them in africa where in 
some cities 20 percent of adults carry the aids virus unlike in 
the united states aids in africa spreads mainly through 
heterosexual intercourse facilitated by untreated venereal 
disease 
ryan white the indianapolis boy who became a national symbol 
of the fight against aids died of the disease so did the designer 
halston female impersonator craig russell and an estimated 20000 
other americans 
the us centers for disease control warned that aids is 
becoming increasingly common among women in 1991 it will be the 
fifth leading cause of death for women of childbearing age 
between october 1989 and october 1990 43000 new aids cases 
were reported in the united states during that period a year ago 
there were 35000 new cases 
while the disease tapered off in 1990 among gay men 
heterosexual transmission of aids is ominously on the rise the 
numbers are still small 2667 new us cases in 1990 most of 
those who got aids this way were black and hispanic women infected 
through sex with male drug addicts 
our expectation is that even though the majority of cases 
continue to be in white gay men increasingly aids will become a 
disease of poor black and hispanic people particularly iv drug 
abusers their sex partners and their children said dr harold 
jaffe of the centers for disease control 
farthest along among new aids drugs is ddi being used 
experimentally by more than 15000 people bristolmyers squibb 
plans to ask for us food and drug administration approval to sell 
it early in 1991 hoffmanla roche will decide early next year 
whether its ready to seek fda approval for its new aids drug ddc 
six vaccines are now in human testing as ways to prevent 
infection with the aids virus and six are being tried in an effort 
to delay disease in people who already carry the virus 
there is an upbeat tone said dr wayne koff chief of 
federal aids vaccine research there is a lot of work ahead but 
just the idea that a number of different approaches are protecting 
in the animals is a good sign it really comes down to what are the 
best approaches and how fast can we do it

alan weigel shrugs off the notion he is an adventurer but few 
would find his workplace anything but a dangerous other world where 
few have been or would want to go 
the navy lieutenant commander and his twoman crew took the 
minisubmarine sea cliff into the inky darkness 2 miles down in 
the pacific in september to retrieve the lost cargo hatch from a 
united airlines boeing 747 
i wouldnt really consider myself an explorer said weigel 
34 i see what we do is really neat but i very rarely question 
that we are going to succeed 
the feat was among accomplishments that confirmed the spirit of 
adventure was alive and well in 1990 a year in which the quest for 
knowledge took explorers to the polar ice caps unnamed mountains 
rainforests outer space and the ocean floor 
some of the ventures were arduous sea cliff dove eight times to 
find the jetliner door the crew spent up to 18 hours per dive in 
cramped quarters they sat in chilly darkness lit only by 
phosphorescent sea life and the glow of instruments it took five 
hours alone to ascend the 14100 feet to the surface 
retrieval of the airliners hatch will allow investigators to 
determine why it blew off the jumbo jet at 22000 feet sweeping 
nine passengers to their deaths in 1989 
we have made dives where the conditions were more difficult 
weigel said the marvel of this came when youre all done and 
realize how remarkable it was to find it 
while the navy mens extraordinary endeavor got relatively 
little fanfare some of 1990s other adventure stories received 
worldwide coverage 
television cameras were waiting in march when an international 
team led by will steger of ely minn and jeanlouis etienne of 
france completed a sevenmonth 3741mile trek by dogsled across 
frozen antarctica 
the group braved temperatures of 53 degrees below zero and a 
twomonth storm with winds of up to 50 mph steger accomplished a 
similar feat at the north pole in 1986 
in the arctic this year norwegian scientists joined with 
soviets to explore a northery route for ships traveling between 
europe and asia back on land the united nations sponsored 
international scholars tracing the travels of 13thcentury explorer 
marco polo and under the sea us and mexican divers explored the 
us navy brig somers which sank off veracruz in the 
mexicanamerican war 
the relics of war excited explorers elsewhere as well 
divers viewed the wreck of the civil war ironclad monitor off 
the north carolina coast for example and a team of americans 
lowered themselves 250 feet into the greenland icecap to a world 
war ii bomber that crashlanded 48 years ago and has since been 
buried in the rising ice 
two sunken warships from the war of 1812 gave us and canadian 
schoolchildren a chance to be explorers in their own classrooms 
live video images were transmitted via satellite from a robot 
submarine cruising wrecks of the merchant schooners hamilton and 
scourge lying at the bottom of lake ontario 
robert ballard leader of the expedition that found the titanic 
at the bottom of the atlantic narrated as the camera showed 
cannons railings and an intricately carved figurehead four lucky 
students got to operate the sub via satellite link 
ballard said the projects goal was to interest youngsters in 
science and exploration 
the scientist has been portrayed in the media as a social 
misfit he said projects like these show science is done by 
people with the right stuff that its fun and cool 
but much of the years exploration went unheralded eileen 
harsch manager of the explorers club the new york institution 
founded in 1906 says noteworthy expeditions went to the arctic 
mount everest the south china sea egypts valley of the kings and 
elsewhere 
the club funds research projects by high school and college 
students as well as by 40 young scientists in 1990 it also lends 
its prestige and its redwhiteandblue flag with compass logo to 
scores of other undertakings 
one such expedition went to ellesmere island in the canadian 
arctic where many barren glacierchoked mountains have never 
borne a human footprint among the explorers was dr george van b 
cochran an ossining ny orthopedist and explorers club board 
member who first traveled to ellesmere in the 1970s 
cochran describes 24 hours of daylight in which the mountains 
dramatically change their look as a low sun circles around them in 
the sky 
its a beautiful area he said its a good feeling to 
know that youre the only people who have been here 
with plenty of places left on earth to explore cochran said he 
had no doubt exploration will always be a part of human nature 
it is the basic instinct to explore he said you can 
suppress it but its always there

jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis bon jovi 
one person believed 1990 would bring wedding bells for tattooed 
new jersey rocker jon bon jovi and the former first lady irene 
hughes one of 10 top psychics assembled by the national enquirer 
in december 1989 to peer into the year ahead 
a visit to the delphic optometrist appears in order judging 
from the sights irene and her fellow seers saw coming in the 365 
days now ending 
in the shocker marriage of the year jackie onassis will tie 
the knot with young rock star jon bon jovi opined hughes 
described by the enquirer as the chicago seer who has helped 
oolve numerous crimes 
hughes also incorrectly predicted that a barroom brawl over 
another mans wife would lead to bryant gumbels departure from the 
today show she offered no similar prognostication for joe 
garagiola who has both joined and left the morning news show in 
the past 12 months or the rumoredtobegone deborah norville 
not to be outdone new york psychic john monti who reportedly 
foresaw the 1981 shooting of president reagan offered this take 
on the kennedy clan for 1990 
ted kennedy will suffer a mental breakdown and become 
convinced he is his dead brother john his exwife joan will rush 
to his side to nurse him back to health rekindling their lost 
love monti warned 
ted of course is well and remains a thorn in george bushs 
side 
for all his problems the president did dodge one bullet 
actually something much much bigger than a bullet in the past 
year 
a meteorite will plow into the white house rose garden 
predicted maria graciette who eerily forecast the manson family 
murders the first family will be put in peril by levels of 
radiation emitted by it 
such myopic looks into the future were not limited to the pages 
of the enquirer both the wellknown syndicated astrologist jeanne 
dixon and the obscure cable tvs psychic windowwasher morris 
fonte were a little off base this year 
for president bush 1990 will be a year of vindication his 
policies at home and abroad will pay off big dixon wrote 
instead bush was locked in a bitter budget battle with congress 
and dispatched us troops to the middle east two moves that led 
to his approval rating hitting its lowest ebb since his arrival at 
the white house 
fontes flubs were a bit more enjoyable madonna marries a 
prominent rocker around november he said giulianis 
gubernatorial bid will rattle mario cuomos skeletons 
end of the year update madonna single rudolph giuliani never 
a gubernatorial candidate cuomo quietly elected to a third term 
in addition to the jackie bon jovi prediction the enquirer went 
out on a limb with this celebrity romance talkshowhost love 
between arsenio hall and oprah winfrey dont tell steadman 
oprahs oftmentioned beau 
the arseniooprah union was to be professional not just 
personal said clarisa bernhardt who specializes in divining 
earthquakes they will team up onscreen as a singingandcomedy 
duo remaking one of the old bob hopebing crosby road movies 
the road to syndication doesnt matter didnt happen 
chill out bob stop turning over in that grave bing 
as for the rest of the decade well dont worry if you never 
see the 21st century the enquirer team of 10 also offered these 
prophecies for the next nine years 
for space reasons the ones already proven wrong ie mike 
tyson heavyweight champ until 1998 liz taylor marrying the late 
malcolm forbes will be deleted but the future still holds 
telly savalas will be hospitalized when he sucks on a poisoned 
lollypop given to him by a crazed fan 
pee wee herman will bulk up his body through weightlifting 
grow a clark gablestyle moustache and emerge as a movie leading 
man with serious performances that will have critics raving

the new owners of mexicos phone system have 
promised to double the size of the company within six years 
a consortium including st louisbased southwestern bell france 
cable amp radio and mexicos grupo carso conglomerate is buying a 
controlling interest in telefonos de mexico the stateowned 
telephone company for 176 billion 
grupo carso is the lead partner and will run the newly 
privatized telmex 
we promise the investment and effort necessary to grow 
rapidly 12 percent a year a rate that means the size of the 
company will double in six years grupo carso president carlos 
slim said tuesday 
he said the number of public telephones would be quadrupled in 
four years and every village with at least 500 residents would have 
access to a telephone by 1994 
the emphasis he said will be on expanding and modernizing the 
service by investing at the most intense rhythm possible 
digital equipment mobile telephones better support services 
for major clients and decentralization are top priority he said 
but it will take time he warned to give mexico a truly modern 
efficient telephone system 
one must have patience he said 
slim also said the new owners will do their utmost to avoid 
reducing personnel and instead train them for new jobs that 
modernization will demand 
telmex which now provides only about 5 million lines to this 
nation of more than 80 million people has 50000 people on its 
payroll 
union opposition to the privatization eased somewhat after the 
government agreed to provide 325 million in financing so the 
employees can buy stock representing 44 percent of telmex 
in addition the government plans to sell telmex stock on the 
mexican and international stock exchanges 
slim said the resources experience and technical expertise of 
southwestern bell and france cable amp radio will be important to 
telmexs success 
even though the foreign partners will not play a role in 
administering telmex they will have a decisionmaking role 
the privatization of telmex is a centerpiece of president carlos 
salinas de gortaris campaign to modernize mexicos economy and

products 
we try not to let the everyday drudgery of business 
bookkeeping bring us down on our creativity the main thing here is 
to have fun and create sandlin said 
blankenship 34 and sandlin 39 started talking toys when they 
met in church two years ago blankenship asked sandlin a 
commercial artist to design a package for a stuffed dog hed 
created 
sandlin then started pitching toy ideas of his own and last year 
they formed yapco toy co named for that first stuffed dog yappie 
the yuppie pup 
the pair who now operate out of a small office in bedford 
first achieved success with kidsflex which hospitals have 
purchased to help develop the eyehand coordination of therapy 
patients 
the toy is a crescentshaped tube filled with water and a rubber 
ball grips at both ends of the tube are squeezed to move the ball 
from one side to the other 
the toy is the lead product for yapco which is projecting more 
than 15 million in sales next year blankenship and sandlin said 
they are negotiating with a japanese company to distribute kidsflex 
there 
to finance more creations blankenship and sandlin started 
helping other inventors launch theirs this year they created 
toyquest inc to provide other toy creators advice and help with 
packaging patenting and making a prototype 
toyquest can develop simple toys like card games for as little 
as 5000 sandlin said more sophisticated toys such as 
electronics items may take an investment 10 times that size 
initial inquiries are free 
we found ourselves in a situation where we go to toy companies 
with an idea and theyd basically laugh you right out sandlin 
said 
we saw a market out there friends of ours who had ideas good 
ideas from good people out there thats what we wanted to tap into 
and hopefully make part of the yapco line that would help us and 
help them too 
inventors have the option of joining yapcos toy line and many 
have blankenship and sandlin and more than 30 of their clients 
will unveil abot 50 products at the new york toy fair the 
industrys showcase event in february 
its pretty exciting once youve had an idea and you see it 
being exhibited in one of these shows its pretty spectacular 
blankenship said 
gary and dorian really bring a quality agenda with toyquest 
said dale brandon a clevelandbased toy consultant theres 
plenty of room for champions to come along in this industry 
brandon who founded a specialized toy retail chain is one of 
26 people whom blankenship and sandlin turned to for advice and 
guidance he believes the toy industry has suffered by squeezing 
out creative inventors such as them 
were still propped up by teenage mutant ninja turtles and 
sedentary video games brandon said 
about 30 percent of the sales by toy giant mattel inc are items 
that come from idea submissions outside of the company said mattel 
spokeswoman donna gibbs in los angeles 
mattels magic nursery doll was an inventors idea and has 
become one of the companys topselling items this holiday ms 
gibbs said 
theres a stable of inventors that we stay pretty much in 
constant contact with ms gibbs said those inventors usually 
have previous experience in the toy industry though she said 
in addition to yappie and kidsflex yapco has developed a series 
of stuffed cats built around cruising charlie who looks like a 
gaudy tourist several educational products some board games and a 
few gag items 
yapco already sells some of the items in specialty stores in 
california and texas

a judges order consolidating nearly 70000 
claims against eaglepicher industries inc is a first and by no 
means guaranteed step in resolving the nations biggest product 
liability problem legal experts say 
lawyers for victims said they will appeal the move by us 
district judge jack b weinstein which they claim would lead to a 
settlement that shortchanges workers suffering from lung cancer 
and other diseases 
attorneys for other companies with large asbestos liabilities 
plan to wait for the eaglepicher case to develop before seeking 
class action status and experts warned that eaglepichers claims 
represented just a fraction of a crowded legal docket 
it is unprecedented innovative and one way to attack the 
problem but it does not represent a solution said drew berry a 
newark nj lawyer who represents several defendant companies 
for instance one hitch in a global settlement is that nearly 
all of the 100000 asbestos claims clogging state and federal 
courts name several companies whose products were used at a work 
place 
therefore resolution of claims against eaglepicher would 
represent only partial settlement of a victims demands lawsuits 
would remain on court dockets until claims against all defendants 
were resolved 
nonetheless weinstein got an important legal boost tuesday when 
a federal bankruptcy judge in cincinnati dismissed a motion to 
throw eaglepicher into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings that 
could have suspended all action in the case 
the motion was a lastminute attempt by victims lawyers to stop 
weinstein from declaring the class action which consolidates all 
present and future claims against eaglepicher for settlement 
in addition to declaring the class weinstein suspended all 
asbestos litigation involving eaglepicher but ordered the company 
to begin paying 45 million to victims who already have settled 
their cases 
a proposed settlement plan calls for creating a trust estimated 
at 625 million over 20 years to pay eaglepicher claimants 
victims representatives complained it offers too little money few 
safeguards and allows the company to pay its bills but not settle 
claims 
under the plan asbestos victims are the last in line to 
receive awards for compensation for their illnesses and deaths 
said heather maurer executive director of the 18000member 
asbetos victims of america 
plaintiffs lawyers said they would challenge the class action in 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals on numerous legal grounds 
they said weinstein lacked jurisdiction appointed lawyers unfit to 
represent their clients and supported a plan that would 
shortchange victims 
also unresolved is whether weinstein can usurp jurisidiction 
from cases now in state courts in addition no method of payment 
has been established which both victim and company lawyers would 
be likely to fight 
we believe the judge does not have the power to do what he is 
purporting to do said fred baron a dallas lawyer for several 
thousand victims who said attorneys would mount a frontal 
attack on weinsteins order 
the battle over eaglepicher could shape the future of what is 
by far the biggest product liability problem ever to confront the 
us legal system cases clog state and federal courts nationwide 
and new claims are being filed daily 
asbestos was used widely in insulation boilers automobile 
brake linings and other products illness from inhaling asbestos 
fibers often takes decades to appear and cases have been mounting 
since the early 1970s 
weinstein favors mass settlements to save the time enormous 
cost and damage to companies reputations in bankruptcy 
proceedings but he is charting new waters and some companies with 
large asbestos liabilities said they were not eager to plunge in 
were very interested in what the judge is doing we have some 
question about whether he can pull it off said john obrien 
associate general counsel of keene corp which is struggling to 
cope with about 70000 lawsuits stemming from insulation products 
made by a subsidiary for more than 50 years 
more than a dozen companies already have filed for bankruptcy 
court protection because of their asbestos liabilites including 
celotex corp and national gypsum co in the last six weeks 
to declare a class action companies must demonstrate their 
funds are so limited that they cannot meet claims and continue 
normal operations eaglepicher said it faces bankruptcy soon 
without a resolution

a prominent trade group predicts the nation will 
dip into a recession next year but says export growth and a strong 
dollar will brighten the economy by next summer 
the national association of purchasing management issued its 
semiannual economic forecast tuesday it matches the views of many 
financial analysts who say the economy has entered or soon will 
slip into a recession 
the only difference i have with them is my recession has 
already started said edward j campbell senior economist with 
the investment firm brown brothers harriman amp co 
the trade group which is composed of purchasing managers at 
manufacturing companies nationwide reported its members were 
extremely pessimistic about the economy for the first half of 
1991 the association conducts regular research on the economy 
including a monthly survey of its members 
although pessimistic about a recession in 1991 purchasers 
expect a recovery to begin in the later half of the year fueled by 
continued relatively strong growth in exports and a declining trend 
in inflation said robert j bretz chairman of the associations 
business survey committee 
overall economic growth will be 22 percent next year with 
costs for wages and benefits rising 42 percent the report 
predicted 
the association also dramatically cut its forecast for capital 
spending in 1990 in may it predicted an 81 percent increase in 
capital spending this year now it has reduced the growth estimate 
to 14 percent 
the groups purchasing managers index for november first 
reported last week stood at 413 percent its lowest point in 
eight years the index developed in conjuction with the us 
commerce department gauges production employment new orders 
vendor performance and inventory 
companies surveyed also reported they are operating at only 82 
percent of their normal capacity down from 85 percent a year ago 
mild inflation is forecast despite the recent runup in oil 
prices spurred by the persian gulf crisis 
it sounds like a pretty good and standard forecast for next 
year said mike penzer senior economist for bank of america in 
san francisco 
penzer agreed with the groups prediction of export growth and a 
stronger dollar next year but economist lacy hunt disagreed with 
the associations forecast that the economy will expand through 
enhanced trade 
exports are not going to be the panacea that we hoped for 
said hunt chief us economist with the hong kong bank group inc 
in new york 
the softening economies in japan and germany mean there will be 
a smaller pie in which to generate these exports he added 
several analysts agreed with the associations prediction of a 
shortlived recession giulio martini economist for the investment 
firm sanford c bernstein amp co inc said prospects for a faster 
economic rebound are enhanced because businesses arent burdened 
with large inventories overbuilt inventories accelerate the shock 
of a recession he said 
the 40th semiannual forecast is consistent with the 
associations earlier predictions of economic hard times in its 
report last week the group said the economy continued to decline 
for the fifth consecutive month leading to a drop in new orders 
and declines in production and employment

bank earnings are headed down and wont 
reverse course until the economy emerges from its slump analysts 
say 
the federal deposit insurance corp said tuesday that the 
nations 12399 commercial banks earned 375 billion in the 
julyseptember quarter down 29 percent from 54 billion in the 
econd quarter banks earned 63 billion in the first three months 
of the year 
fdic chairman l william seidman blamed the deterioration on a 
rise in sour real estate loans particularly in the northeast he 
described the outlook for the final three months of the year as 
bleak and declined to predict when bank earnings would recover 
the problem will drag on just as long as the economy is in 
whatever its in now seidman said i wont say the rword 
he said referring to the bush administrations reluctance to 
describe the economic downturn as a recession 
economist paul getman of regional financial associates in west 
chester pa said i wish i could say its going to get better 
but its going to get worse before it gets better 
seidman warned that banks problems are translating into 
mounting strain on the government insurance fund protecting bank 
deposits 
he raised his estimate of the fdic funds 1990 loss from 3 
billion to 4 billion or more and said it was becoming 
increasingly clear that banks will have to inject more money 
into the fund 
the loss would leave only 9 billion to protect 2 trillion in 
deposits 
were probably under more pressure in the banking system than 
we have been at any time since the 1930s said economist david 
jones of aubrey g lanston amp co id look for continued strains 
on the system in general 
jones said the health of the economy and of banking are 
deteriorating in a vicious circle slumping economic conditions 
create loan losses for banks that causes banks to cut back 
lending which fuels the economic slump 
still 89 percent of commercial banks made money in the third 
quarter the profitability of small banks those with less than 
100 million in assets suffered only slightly but problems in 
larger institutions in the east dragged down the industry totals 
banks posted losses in the district of columbia and eight 
states arizona connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new 
hampshire new jersey and new york 
delinquent real estate loans in which borrowers are three 
months or more behind on their payments rose 129 percent to 313 
billion in the third quarter 
the real estate delinquency rate was highest in rhode island 
1466 percent followed by arizona massachusetts connecticut 
texas oklahoma new hampshire louisiana new york the district 
of columbia new jersey new mexico and colorado 
however the rate was headed down in the southwestern states and 
up in the east 
getman noted that recent weakness in west coast real estate 
markets has yet to surface in bank data the other shoe has yet 
to drop and the other shoe is california he said 
consumer loan delinquencies also are rising they were up 104 
percent to 14 billion in the third quarter getman predicted that 
as the recession progresses credit card delinquencies will emerge 
as the next big area of concern to bankers 
for the first time the fdic issued a report on the 479 savings 
banks it supervises these statechartered institutions a hybrid 
of a commercial bank and a savings institution are located 
primarily in the northeast and concentrate on real estate lending 
even more than commercial banks 
they lost 771 million during the third quarter during the 
first nine months of the year 35 percent of the savings banks lost 
money and as a whole lost 12 billion compared with 20 million 
in earnings during the same period of 1989 
however they remain well capitalized on average their owners 
investment represented 702 percent of the savings banks assets 
capital acts as a cushion between losses and the insurance fund

a boeing co plan for handling alcohol and other 
drug abuse has been implemented over vehement objections by the 
aerospace giants largest union 
under the policy put in effect tuesday boeings approximately 
150000 us employees from janitors to executives may be tested 
after onthejob accidents or when company officials find a 
reasonable suspicion that an employee used drugs 
there are sufficient checks and balances built into the 
testing portion of our policy so that it cant be applied 
arbitrarily or capriciously said russ young of boeing 
employees found to have prohibited substances in their system 
could enter a treatment program after the first offense but would 
face dismissal for a second offense employees who voluntarily 
entered the treatment program would be allowed a second chance 
in the past boeing officials say employees caught with or 
using drugs on company property were fired 
i think the workers are going to be astonished as i am that 
the company would implement an agreement that the membership 
doesnt want said tom baker president of international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers district lodge 751 
they believe that they should be able to test by any reliable 
source any source that they consider reliable whatever that 
means baker said adding the union thinks that could lead to 
abuse by management 
members of the union which represents about 40000 boeing 
workers in and around seattle and another 10000 in portland ore 
and wichita kan voted 86 percent last month to reject the plan 
sought by boeing 
baker said then the plan would foster a policestate 
mentality 
we are presently in discussion with our legal counsel to see 
what appropriate legal action we should take whether that be 
through the courts or whether that be through unfair labor practice 
charges filed with the national labor relations board baker 
said 
in negotiations during august september and october union 
leaders sought unsuccessfully to impose greater limits on testing 
and gain greater assurances of confidentiality under a plan 
administered by both the union and boeing 
a second boeing union the seattle professional engineering 
employees association agreed in september to accept the companys 
plan the association represents about 27000 boeing engineers and 
other professional workers

billionaire investor marvin davis revealed 
that he is a major stockholder of first interstate bancorp and 
urged the company to cut overhead or consider a buyout by another 
banking firm 
in a surprise letter tuesday davis expressed dissatisfaction 
with first interstate management 
along with other first interstate stockholders we have watched 
with distress first interstates deteriorating financial condition 
and results of operation over the past few months davis wrote 
this is an ideal time for the first interstate board to either 
achieve the operating economies which are long overdue or to 
consider a sale of the bank to another banking institution 
first interstate is struggling to rebuild itself after massive 
problems at its arizona and texas banks contributed to a 1245 
million loss last year 
first interstates stock traded as high as 48 per share during 
the past year but recently has fallen to about half that level 
the stock rose 37 cents to close at 2512 a share tuesday in new 
york stock exchange trading 
davis wrote to chairman and chief executive edward m carson 
who replaced the fiery joseph j pinola as head of the company last 
year 
weve seen davis letter and we do take his concerns 
seriously as we do with all shareholder concerns said ken 
preston a first interstate spokesman 
but were also encouraged by the progress weve made so far 
for the first nine months preston said under our new 
management team weve returned to profitability this year 
davis revealed that his family interests own a significant 
amount of first interstate stock he didnt say how much 
although investors are required to reveal their stakes to the 
securities and exchange commission when they acquire more than 5 
percent 
he noted in his letter that john neff portfolio manager of the 
windsor mutual fund has said the fund might join other big 
shareholders in pressuring first interstate to put itself on the 
block 
however neff made his suggestion in a letter eight months ago 
when talk of consolidation in the banking industry was rife and 
first interstates major problems seemed more immediate 
this is hardly an ideal time to sell a bank or parts of a 
bank neff said tuesday

the persian gulf crisis should be viewed as a 
decisive event in energy history and its outcome will change 
the dynamics of the oil industry an annual oil and gas study says 
significant changes have occurred in world oil fundamentals 
that will have profound and lasting effects after the conclusion of 
the current gulf crisis victor burk managing director of oil 
and gas industry services for arthur andersen amp co said tuesday 
daniel yergin president of massachusettsbased cambridge energy 
research associates said he believed the crisis will lead to an 
emphasis on energy security and diversification of supply sources 
plus give a new kick to exploration and production around the 
world 
the comments came as cambridge and the houston office of arthur 
andersen released their annual survey of world oil trends 
the survey found the financial considerations of the persian 
gulf crisis to be substantial for opec 
in 1986 for example opec earnings fell to 77 billion this 
year the trends survey estimated opec earnings could top 160 
billion 
the effect of the higher prices however also has been to cut 
demand somewhat 
by november demand had fallen because of higher prices and 
economic downturn the survey showed the world oil market was 
in balance but a very precarious balance with no margin for 
error 
yergin said a war in the persian gulf would send oil prices 
soaring but he believed the jump would be shortterm 
the annual survey showed world oil consumption in 1989 reached 
record highs while us consumption was at its highest level in 10 
years 
at the same time nonopec oil production was declining for the 
first time since 1973 with two major oil producers the united 
states and the soviet union both posting production drops that 
are expected to continue 
yergin referred to the united states and the soviet union as the 
two sick men of world oil 
in the united states production has declined by 2 million 
barrels a day from 1986 to summer of 1990 
the loss of that output is a greater volume than kuwait was 
producing before the gulf crisis began yergin said in other 
words the fall in us production is as though a major oil 
exporting country has been obliterated or snuffed out 
yergin said the effects were momentous both in the united states 
and overseas because the decline upset the global balance in oil 
production 
in this country theres been a hazy fog where people have not 
recognized the significance of the seriousness of this drop he 
said 
the result according to the survey was us oil imports rose 
from 44 million barrels a day in 1985 to 77 million a day in 
first half of 1990 
in the soviet union the sweeping fundamental changes and the 
fall of communism in eastern europe are having effects on the 
energy industry worldwide as well because of reduced production and 
export of soviet oil yergin said 
but he said the changes in the soviet union also meant 
opportunities for oil companies 
here is a door that was slammed shut 70 years ago he said 
that door has been abruptly opened the problem they oil 
companies face is who to deal with the question is whos in 
charge here 
yergin said the threat of an economic recession also hangs over 
the industry

a us district court ordered quasar co to pay 
nearly 25 million to three former employees charging 
discrimination on the basis of age and nationality officials said 
quasar also must pay court costs and attorney fees making the 
total judgment greater than 3 million said attorney norman 
berger who represents the plaintiffs the exact total of those 
fees was not available late tuesday 
quasar was found guilty of violating both the civil rights act 
of 1964 and the age discrimination in employment act according to 
berger 
this is the first case were aware of that after a trial a 
japanese company has been found guilty of this type of 
discrimination berger said 
the company said it disagreed with the ruling and intended to 
appeal 
quasar based in suburban elk grove village handles sales and 
distribution of consumer electronics and employees about 50 people 
the company is a division of the japaneseowned matsushita electric 
corp of america 
quasar officials said they were disappointed in the cases 
outcome 
we are fully confident of the merits of our position and 
believe the court has made substantial errors in both law and in 
fact said quasar spokesman john monaco reading an official 
statement of course we intend to appeal the decision and firmly 
believe that ultimately our position in this case will be upheld 
the plaintiffs john fortino carl meyers and f william schulz 
were fired from their management positions during quasars 1986 
company restructuring and 50 percent work force reduction berger 
said 
before the companys reorganization quasar had 89 managerial 
employees after the restructuring the staff was cut to 23 berger 
said of that total 14 were americans and nine were japanese he 
said 
the evidence showed that quasar had full knowledge of the laws 
which prohibit discrimination and yet it tried to circumvent these 
laws berger said the court found that quasar would not have 
fired any of our clients but for their national origin 
in a 1988 ruling a jury awarded 19 million to the plaintiffs 
in settlement of the age discrimination lawsuit all three were 
over 50 at the time of their dismissal the three were told that 
their jobs were being eliminated but their functions were 
reassigned to younger people berger said 
us district judge james alesia upheld the jurys 1988 decision 
in posttrial motions and assessed additional fines in the 
nationality discrimination case friday

with its longtime chairman gone the future 
of occidental petroleum corps dividend is in question and the 
company may sell some assets analysts say 
armand hammers death at 92 on monday sparked a surge of 
activity on wall street where occidental stock was the most 
actively traded stock tuesday on the new york stock exchange it 
rose 187 to 2262 per share in heavy trading tuesday on the new 
york stock exchange a gain of 9 percent 
some analysts said the 250 per share annual dividend appears 
in jeopardy 
several said an outsider may borrow heavily to buy occidental 
then profit by selling off its pieces oil and gas chemicals 
natural gas pipelines coal beef and pork processing a less 
likely scenario had occidental management buying the company 
but the economic downturn combined with dried up junk bond and 
bank lending for takeovers has made a buyout seem less likely for 
occidental the 16th largest us industrial company with about 20 
billion in annual sales 
occidental itself may now sell some of its holdings to reduce 
its staggering 8 billion debt one possible sale would be a 5 
percent interest in the company that makes arm amp hammer baking 
soda which people mistakenly thought hammer founded 
ray r irani occidentals president and chief operating 
officer immediately succeeded hammer as chairman and chief 
executive he declined tuesday to discuss occidentals future 
warren shimmerlik an independent energy analyst said under 
iranis management occidental will likely undergo a major 
philosophical change and significant restructuring 
hammers style prevented a rationalization that would be 
beneficial to the company shimmerlik said noting hammer 
preferred to position occidental as an incomeproducing stock 
rather than a growth company 
there didnt seem to be any real momentum in the company 
eugene nowak vice president and director of the energy group at 
dean witter reynolds inc said he expects occidental to take a 
very hard look at all the assets the company will move from an 
entrepreneurial concern to professional management 
nowak said occidental was an unlikely takeover candidate 
the company has been left in very strong hands he said 
the star of occidentals operations will continue to be foreign 
energy exploration and production 
alan gaines president of energy stock specialist gaines 
berland inc took a bleaker perspective 
this is not a growth company gaines said and i dont 
think theyre saleable 
he said occidentals dividend was in immediate jeopardy 
the death of hammer portends a dividend reduction gaines 
said i think the company has very poor fundamentals and i dont 
think the dividend can be maintained it was imprudent to begin 
with 
he said hammer is the one who controlled the banks and the 
directors were beholden to him gaines said some banks may be 
unwilling to support what gaines feels is an excessive dividend and 
may call on occidental to improve its balance sheet 
gaines said the company is highly leveraged with a dividend 
payment of 800 million annually and crippling interest expense 
thats 21 billion out the door before taxes gone gaines 
said and what buyer is going to assume 8 billion in debt its 
an overleveraged petrochemical company who wants it

some 2000 companies in former east germany will 
be able to keep their export markets in the soviet union and other 
east european countries under measures announced wednesday 
exports to the rublebased trading bloc were economic mainstays 
of east germany before it united with west germany in october but 
the conversion to the west german mark threatens to put an end to 
such business depriving wobbly economies in the east of their 
traditional source of modern equipment 
german economists say hundreds of thousands of jobs in eastern 
germany depend on continuation of exports to the east 
officials of the treuhandanstalt the trust agency charged with 
disposing of most of the former stateowned assets of east germany 
said the governmentbacked hermes export insurance agency will 
support under certain conditions new contracts that companies in 
eastern germany are able to make with soviet or other east european 
customers 
the contracts must be in hard currency and the treuhand will 
have to verify that the german companies are making progress toward 
the efficiency standards of the freemarket economy wolfram 
krause the treuhands finance director told a news conference 
many companies in former east germany that the treuhand hopes to 
privatize face a deadline of jan 1 to convert longterm contracts 
from the inconvertible soviet ruble into hard currency 
the german government is backing 108 billion worth of such 
rubledenominated eastbound exports in 1990 krause said that 
support expires at the end of this year but the new export 
insurance will help to continue the valuable direction of business 
the companies will be more attractive to purchasers he said 
adding we know that this is the time to sell 
what makes eastern germany so attractive for investment is 
this is the only country in the world where you have two directions 
of the economy said treuhand spokesman thomas schneider west 
germany has the western direction and east germany has the eastern 
direction if you are looking for a new market it will be in the 
east 
eastern german companies will only be attractive in the future 
if they retain their markets in the east he said and the export 
insurance measure was one way to support such business 
the soviet union is an especially important customer for 
concerns in eastern germany he said showing treuhand statistics 
that gave the soviets 80 percent of the production of excavators 
cranes and rail equipment 70 percent of production of fishing 
vessels and 60 percent of eastern germanys electronics output

the european community commission said 
wednesday it had extended for two years its controls over state 
subsidies to the beleaguered auto industry in the ecs 12 member 
states 
the commissions authority to bar large state awards to car 
manufacturers is crucial to ensure that a climate of normal and 
fair competition prevails as the industry approaches an uncertain 
future the commission said in a statement 
the commissions 2yearold framework says all state subsidies 
exceeding 12 million european currency units or 164 million 
must be approved by the ecs executive commission 
the commission said it fears that current intense competition in 
the ec auto industry could push some member states into approving 
huge subsidies if the commissions powers to curb state aids were 
ended 
separately the ec allowed france to fund 40 percent of a 240 
million research project between car makers renault and peugeot for 
fuelefficient automobiles with cleanburning engines 
the commission said it approved french aid of about 97 million 
for the eightyear project which will involve several research 
organizations and focus on cleanburning engines development of a 
new twostroke engine and electric and gaspowered vehicles 
the commission said the framework on member subsidies was vital 
in preparing for a unified motor vehicle market once the trade bloc 
unifies after 1992 
it said clamping down on huge state subsidies was the best 
guarantee that the industry will be able to improve its 
competitiveness on world markets 
ec demand for cars in 1990 and 1991 is expected to decline 
before returning to a longerterm annual growth of 1 percent a 
year the commission said 
it said the uneertain outlook for the industry as a whole adds 
to the case for vigilance in the control of state aids

delta air lines has fired a new salvo in the 
battle for business fliers announcing a bonus ticket program for 
frequent fliers 
delta said tuesday it will award a free ticket to any member of 
its frequent flier club who completes eight segments on coach 
fares between dec 15 and march 15 the program also gives 
passengers a choice of firstclass upgrades rather than free trips 
two round trips with a change of planes each way would provide 
eight segments if the flights were nonstop or onestop with no 
plane change it would take four round trips to qualify 
the bonus was announced five days after rival eastern airlines 
made a similar move the eastern program offers a weekend ticket 
for 91 to anyone who makes a single round trip at a corporate 
rate fare during december or january 
bonus tickets for eastern which is trying to survive by gaining 
business fliers at deltas expense are redeemable from jan 3 
through june 18 deltas are good for travel between may 15 and 
dec 31 of 1991 
delta spokesman neil monroe said this morning that the latest 
promotion comes at a time when sluggish demand for air travel and 
higher fuel costs are hurting the air travel industry but he said 
the freebies should not harm the bottom line at delta because most 
passengers are expected to opt for the firstclass upgrades 
that costs delta virtually nothing he said 
delta will limit the number of seats available on each flight 
for passengers who choose the free travel monroe said

the recession the nations auto industry 
slipped into this year likely will continue in 1991 when car and 
truck sales are expected to dip by 5 percent ford motor cos 
president said today 
in a yearend briefing with reporters philip benton estimated 
automakers would sell 142 million cars and trucks this year in the 
united states 
beyond that there remains considerable uncertainty he 
said adding ford estimates us industry sales of 135 million 
vehicles in 1991 he said a soft us economy consumer caution and 
the continuing middle east crisis lend to the industrys 
uncertainty 
general motors corp ford and chrysler corp all expect to lose 
money in the fourth quarter which would be the first quarter since 
mid1981 that all the big three posted losses 
the relative weakness is in north america benton said 
this is basically a north american problem 
ford counts on north america for a large portion of its profits 
to offset such overseas troubles as weak vehicle demand in britain 
and spain an economic crisis in brazil and three european labor 
strikes 
benton said he expects substantial improvement overseas 
especially in europe but looks for north america to continue to 
have a difficult year in 91 
profits are under enormous pressure in north america and they 
started out from an abysmal level 
on other matters benton said 
fords dividend of 75 cents a share appears safe for now 
however because of the econoimc and mideast uncertainty you 
cant say the dividend is secure 
ford will cut an unspecified number of whitecollar jobs beyond 
the normal 5 percent attrition rate to trim costs he said a 1 to 
2percent cut is probable fords 1989 annual report said 66900 of 
its 175100 workers were salaried 
product development into the mid1990s is on track the 92 
push is going to be very heavy in trucks 
ford is moving cautiously into eastern europe giving priority 
to establishing dealers parts and service networks for cars 
brought into the region from western europe i dont see us in 
the near term with any assembly plants

attorneys general in six states have filed suit against the gmac 
mortgage corp accusing the lender of overcharging consumers by 
millions of dollars in excessive escrow payments 
the action seeks to bar the detroitbased lender from building 
big cushions into escrow accounts and to force gmac to recalculate 
the way it determines escrow payments gmac holds about 400000 
mortgages nationwide 
attorneys general from california iowa massachusetts 
minnesota new york and texas filed suit tuesday in federal court 
in manhattan 
the six states acted because the federal government has not 
enforced its own laws against the practice new york state attorney 
general robert abrams said 
abrams said that if the suit succeeds homeowners could receive 
millions of dollars in refunds 
officials from gmac corp declined immediately to comment on the 
suit 
in april the attorneys general released a study critical of 
mortgage lenders practice of requiring excess funds in escrow 
accounts 
when we released the report of the illegal escrow practices of 
gmac and other lenders we urged the federal government to enforce 
its own statutory limits on escrow payments so far it has taken 
no action thus prompting suits like this one at great cost to 
the states abrams said 
that study said consumers were being overcharged 2 billion to 
4 billion by the nations mortgage lenders 
lenders maintain escrow accounts to make payments for propertyttaxes 
insurance and other items that borrowers must pay extra 
money in escrow accounts hurts consumers but is a bonanza for 
lenders who regulators say get to use the funds for free or by 
paying a very low rate of interest on it 
about twothirds of the nations home mortgages involve escrow 
accounts 
federal law limits lenders to keeping a twomonth cushion in 
escrow or enough money to make payments for two months the 
cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if 
the consumer is late making a monthly payment 
our report estimated that the excess cushion averages about 
150 per homeowner iowa attorney general tom miller said that 
means we think lenders are holding several billion dollars that 
should be in the hands of their customers 
the report called on housing and urban development secretary 
jack kemp to tighten enforcement of the law the attorneys general 
said inaction by hud led them to file the suit 
the twoyear study focused on big lenders who operate 
nationwide a survey of four of the largest citibank gmac 
mortgage corp fleet mortgage corp and lomas financial group 
indicated that lenders may be holding excessive and illegal 
cushions in more than 70 percent of escrow accounts

american telephone amp telegraph co and mci 
communications corp said today they had reached an outofcourt 
settlement on lawsuits and countersuits that had alleged theft of 
customers and false advertising 
terms of the settlement were not disclosed 
as part of the agreement the two companies agreed to propose 
adoption by the federal communications commission of industrywide 
standards to protect consumers from being switched to other 
longdistance companies against their will 
the proposed standards would permit longdistance carriers to 
switch a customers service only by one of the following means 
a customerinitiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to 
which the customer is switching 
independent thirdparty confirmation 
signed letter of authorization 
a call placed by the customer to their local or longdistance 
telephone company 
the two companies along with us sprint have been locked in a 
fierce battle for customers atampt and mci or their agents have 
been placing calls to millions of phone users each month trying to 
get them to switch their longdistance service 
state and federal authorities and local phone companies have 
received tens of thousands of complaints about unauthorized 
switching 
since the breakup of the old bell system in 1984 atampts share 
of the longdistance market has eroded to below 70 percent mci 
the nations second largest longdistance carrier now has about 15 
percent of the market 
atampt which had claimed it was losing customers because of 
unauthorized switching by mci and its telemarketing agent had 
asked the fcc to require a customers written authorization before 
a change could be made 
mci spokeswoman pam small said officials were bound by the 
agreement not to comment further on the settlement 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company wanted to get 
beyond the squabbling which he said is really not good for 
either atampt or mci or for the customer but he emphasized that 
atampt will continue to pursue customers and try to retain existing 
ones with the same resourcefulness and aggressiveness we have 
pursued in the past 
mci had sued atampt in us district court in washington on oct 
10 1989 alleging false and deceptive advertising practices atampt 
countersued on oct 26 
on jan 10 this year atampt sued mci and its telemarketing agent 
in newark nj federal court alleging false and deceptive 
telemarketing practices 
both sides denied any wrongdoing and no dollar amounts were 
specified in the suits

the prescription drug industry today defended 
itself against accusations that it is driving up drug prices by 
squandering millions of dollars on lavish and unnecessary gifts and 
trips for doctors 
drug companies representatives are a crucial link to physicians 
and their practice of offering symposia and conferences provide 
important information to physicians the head of the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers association told the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
to develop the knowledge necessary medical practitioners must 
have prompt reliable and detailed information regarding products 
and the diseases they treat gerald mossinghoff said 
the entity in the best position to provide indepth 
information is the company that develops the new drug he said 
mossinghoff also defended the use of gifts of nominal value 
which he said help remind physicians of the name of a particular 
product 
dr daniel johnson a louisiana radiologist and an american 
medical association official told the panel that while some 
questionable promotional practices still exist in the drug 
industry physicians have taken steps to identify unethical 
behavior and steer clear of it 
both the ama and the pharmaceutical manufacturers last week 
adopted ethical guidelines on the issue he said 
asked specifically about expensepaid conferences for 
physicians johnson said there should be no accepting of money 
directly or indirectly by physicians 
but witnesses who testified before the panel tuesday cited 
example after example of drug companies offering everything from 
frequentflyer miles to outright cash to physicians in exchange for 
prescribing a companys product 
drug companies have institutionalized deception said david 
c jones a former public relations official for cibageigy corp 
and abbott laboratories 
the price of prescription drugs is determined by what the 
market will bear he said pain suffering and desperation will 
support a high price 
sen edward kennedy dmass the committee chairman said his 
staff had determined that the pharmaceutical industry spends more 
than 5 billion a year on promoting drug products in the united 
states 
much of the spending is legitimate but some is not and is 
contributing to the rise in drug prices that has outpaced 
inflation he said 
companies spent 85 million in 1988 on symposiums often held in 
plush resorts with expenses paid for both physician and spouse 
kennedy said in some cases physician are paid honoraria for 
attending 
doctors who accept lavish industry gifts are jeopardizing 
their objectivity and compromising the trust of their patients 
kennedy said 
four drug companies were asked by kennedy to testify but all 
four cibageigy abbott laboratories hoffmanlaroche and 
wyethayerst declined 
a spokesperson for cibageigy said the company declined to 
testify unless two other companies also agreed at senate hearings 
in 1973 the company was the only one to testify and ended up 
getting blamed for the sins of the industry 
abbott laboratories said it declined because it has complied 
with kennedys request for written background material on the 
companys educational and promotional practices said spokesman jed 
weiner 
hoffmanlaroche spokeswoman nancy mattison said her company 
declined because it was unable to get specific enough information 
about the questions the senators would be asking 
wyethayerst spokeswoman audrey ashby said the company had 
already provided the committee fully and promptly all the 
information that was requested

the official november job report was one of the 
bleakest in many years further documenting the process by which 
elements of a sliding economy reinforce each other and lead to 
recession 
depicted graphically it would look like a rube goldberg 
contraption in which one action generates another and another and 
another the end result being nothing produced but a waste of time 
energy and capital 
in terms of a sliding economy you might begin with big debts 
and tight money which lead to lower consumer and business 
spending which produces lower profits income strains and layoffs 
forcing further spending cuts 
viewed in that sense the consequences of the terrible november 
job report become clear fewer workers working fewer hours means 
less money for retailers who cut their orders to wholesalers and 
wholesalers who cut jobs and spending 
there was almost no good news in the report delivered by janet 
norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
in her own words 
employment declined sharply and the declines were widespread 
throughout both the goods and the service sectors of the economy 
the unemployment rate rose from 57 percent to 59 percent the 
rate is now more than 05 percent higher than it was in the first 
half of the year 
the number of payroll jobs declined sharply for the second 
month in a row a reduction of 265000 jobs in november followed a 
loss of 180000 in october we have not had consecutive job losses 
of this magnitude since the end of 1982 
threequarers of the november reduction occurred in the 
already weak manufacturing industry nearly 800000 factory jobs 
have been dropped since january 1989 
even servicesector jobs were affected jobs in retail trades 
fell by 70000 wholesale trade employment fell sharply and as 
has been well publicized big losses occurred in the real estate 
and finance industries 
the one piece of news that might be construed as positive really 
wasnt employment in the health services industry rose by 80000 
jobs bringing to more than 600000 the number of jobs added in 
that category within a year 
why isnt that good news for those who found employment it was 
of course good news but for the rest of us it was ominous health 
service spending has been out of control for years each year it 
consumes more of the gross national product each year its 
inflation rate exceeds that of the general economy 
how can the deterioration be changed in the old days you primed 
the pump with government spending but government already is 
spending too much because of that an unusually large role falls 
to the federal reserve 
the fed can do its part in a number of ways such as easing 
credit restraints putting more money into the economy and allowing 
interest rates to fall 
so far it hasnt done a great deal in that respect in the 
past chairman alan greenspan has espoused a goal of zero 
inflation and inflation for the current quarter might be 6 percent 
not terribly bad but not zero 
greenspan is one of the most dedicated antiinflationists ever 
to sit as fed chairman he has sound reasons for fearing it 
considering the amount of debt already existing the dollars value 
and the fragile financial system 
but that november jobless report not just the increases in 
joblessness but the speeding up of the process might force him to 
forgo the pursuit of zero inflation and get more americans back to 
work

billion of its own stock and disclosed that it lost 55 million 
from its coverage of major league baseball this year

company president and chief executive laurence a tisch for the 
additional post of chairman succeeding william s paley who died 
on oct 26 
the company said it would repurchase up to 105 million shares 
of its common stock at 190 per share a significant premium over 
recent prices 
cbs stock has been hit hard recently by the networks disclosure 
that it would report a loss for the fourth quarter and lower 
earnings in 1991 the loss would be its first for any quarter 
excluding a restated loss in the fourth quarter of 1986 cbs has 
been hit hard by losses on sports programming and weakening ad 
revenue 
as part of the buyback cbs said the paley estate which 
controls an 8 percent stake and loews corp the tischcontrolled 
company that holds a 249 percent interest in cbs would tender 
their shares 
a portion of their stakes would be repurchased but their 
relative holdings of cbs common stock would not change the estate

obligations 
the announcement boosted the price of cbs stock which was up 
425 a share to 17412 in midday trading on the new york stock 
exchange the stock recently traded below 160 a share 
this offer will provide cbs shareholders with the opportunity 
to receive a premium over recent market prices of cbs shares for a 
significant portion of their shares while retaining a substantial 
equity investment in the company tisch said in a statement 
tisch said that after the buyback cbs still will have 800 
million in cash and securities to finance currnt operations

shares and the outlook for 1991 cbs expected to reduce its common 
stock quarterly dividend below the currrent 110 a share 
cbs for the first time disclosed an aftertax operating loss of 
55 million for the 1990 fourth quarter and the year from its 
expensive contract for baseball programming the network was hurt 
by weak advertising and the cincinnati reds fourgame sweep over 
the oakland athletics

fourthquarter earnings to pay for anticipated losses over the 
course of its fouryear 106 billion major league baseball 
contract

octoberdecember quarter estimates on its baseball losses for 1990 
had been reported at under 100 million the network earned 601 
million or 233 a share in the same 1989 period 
other factors cited by the network for the losses included lower 
advertising revenue because of the economic downturn increased 
news costs covering the middle east crisis and reduced demand for 
advertising at its television and radio stations 
the company last month also announced that it would cut payments 
to television network affiliates next year for carrying its 
programs by 20 percent a move expected to save the company about 
30 million in 1991 cbs also has laid off workers to cut costs 
cbs said the stock buyback offer would begin in the next several 
days and expire on jan 21 if the offer is fully subscribed cbs

great western financial corp bowed 
out of the stagnant real estate brokerage business wednesday 
saying it would close its great western real estate subsidiary 
the shutdown combined with layoffs announced last month at the 
real estate company puts 1506 people out of work 241 staff 
members and 1265 real estate agents who had contracted to work for 
great western full time 
little effect was expected on the parent compnys financial 
statement according to great western financial whose biggest 
subsidiary is great western bank the nations secondlargest 
savings and loan 
the real estate company was a tiny fragment of great westerns 
business the beverly hillsbased parent company had 38 billion 
in revenues in 1989 the yorba lindabased realty subsidiary had 
just 50 million in gross sales commissions 
there has been a host of recent layoffs and cutbacks at real 
estate companies throughout california where the market has slowed 
drastically in the past year after several years of booming sales 
and soaring prices 
no attempt was made to find a buyer for the great western real 
estate unit spokesman steve hawkins said he said employees of 
some field offices had inquired about taking over those offices 
in november great western real estate laid off its newhome 
sales force in yorba linda 
great western financial is generally regarded as healthy but has 
had big losses recently on commercial real estate loans in the 
northeast 
great western said the real estate unit never consistently met 
profit objectives since it was acquired in 1983 hawkins described 
the closure as part of great westerns attempts to refocus on its 
core businesses of mortgage lending and retail banking 
hawkins said the company would complete all transactions in 
escrow before shutting down so that customers would not be 
affected

hollis harris built a reputation in the airline 
industry as an easygoing executive with an optimistic cheerleading 
management style 
when he left delta air lines inc in august after 36 years 
harris seemed to be just what continental airlines inc needed 
someone with the financial savvy to keep the carrier afloat and an 
exuberant personality to encourage dispirited employees 
it may sound a little corny but i say continental team 
lets go get them he told employees when he was introduced as 
chairmanelect 
but harris will have to use all those spirited traits and more 
if hes to see continental through chapter 11 federal bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the nations fifthlargest carrier filed for protection from 
creditors earlier this month citing soaring fuel costs and 
mounting interest payments on its 62 billion debt it was 
continentals second bankrutpcy filing 
harris predecessor frank lorenzo built continental through a 
series of mergers and acquisitions over nearly two decades but he 
incurred the wrath of union workers during the first reorganization 
in 1983 when he insinuated greedy unions were hurting the company 
harris has painstakenly tried to avoid such confrontations 
our 37000 employees have earned a reputation for working hard 
and smart while providing american travelers with the services they 
need he remarked following the companys bankruptcy filing 
announcement 
harris still commuting from his home in georgia was 
unavailable for an interview continental officials said 
harris has said he sees his role as part of a leadership 
continuum for the company and believes his job is to make the 
airline run more smoothly lorenzos role he said was building 
the airline 
in the 80s people were concentrating more on growing now 
the focus is on competing with service he said 
in four months the 58yearold harris has endeared himself to 
his employees 
mr harris is a very positive peopleoriented person which is 
something we havent known a lot of around continental for 
awhile said pilot robert finley it seems like a breath of 
fresh air to see a man like him in that job 
if anyone can pull us through these difficult times where 
fuel costs are skyrocketing and all costs are elevating at an 
enormous rate while the fares are still being depressed and the 
fare wars are going on i think mr harris is the guy who can do 
it 
friends and associates had equally kind words 
hes a very likeable person i cant remember anybody saying 
anything unkind about him said clara bailey who graduated high 
school with harris in 1949 in carrollton ga about 55 miles west 
of atlanta 
ms bailey who keeps in touch with harris and his wife fellow 
carrollton native joyce harris said the continental leader has 
always been a private person who cared about others 
the son of the rev cl harris a retired methodist minister 
harris excelled in school but ms bailey said he never flaunted 
his achievements 
he was one of the most intelligent people in the class but he 
was also the most unassuming she said 
harris holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from 
the georgia institute of technology the father of two sons and a 
daughter he gained a reputation in atlanta for his involvement in 
several community projects including the boy scouts of america 
harris was instrumental in setting up a fundraising system for 
the council that provided about 200000 for the group last year 
alone 
harris remains active in other civic activities he serves on 
the advisory council of the national multiple sclerosis society and 
was past chairman of the american institute of aeronautics and 
astronautics among others 
harris joined delta in 1954 as a transportation agent in the 
marketing division and later became an aircraft engineer 
eventually rising to head of that department he subsequently 
served in key management roles in the facilities department 
inflight service passenger service and operations 
harris was named president of delta in 1987 and was responsible 
for all marketing operations technical operations and personnel 
functions 
he was very much liked here said one former employee who 
asked not to be named and his hometown and georgia were very 
proud of him im sure houston and texas will be as well

homers jewelry store sits in the heart of bostons downtown 
shopping district and like the holiday seasons of years past the 
aisles are crammed with people who peer into glass cases and try on 
gold bracelets 
but this scene does not sparkle like it normally would for store 
manager donald cohen 
after 108 years in business homers is holding one last sale 
before closing its doors becoming another casualty of hard times 
in new england 
this is the only place i ever worked said cohen 55 who 
first came to the shop as an errand boy in 1950 its going to be 
quite different after 40 years getting up each day and coming to 
work here 
homers is a virtual landmark in boston but its fate is not so 
unique the massachusetts economy sinking into recession for more 
than a year has forced thousands of people out of work 
that gave may retailers a dim outlook for this christmas 
season jewelers find it is difficult to sell gold and diamonds to 
people keeping a close eye on their wallets 
we have so many people coming in talking about relatives 
losing their jobs said cohen its more important that they 
have food on their table 
with business declining homers owners decided to close down 
now rather than watch the shop sink further

for iowa farm wife debbie hardersen spending 60 on a blouse 
and skirt is unusually extravagant 
but the clothes were on sale and times are good if not great 
for farmers so she bought the outfit for herself on a shopping 
spree recently during the iowa farm bureau convention 
i didnt feel too badly buying it hardersen said 
ive spent 350 here and im not done yet she said 
christmas is a time i do like to splurge 
theres no scrimping or pinching pennies this year 
iowa manufacturers such as winnebago industries inc and deere amp 
co may be laying off workers this fall as sales slump but the 
farm economy is on the mend from the freefall of the 1980s 
hardersen 36 went to the convention with her husband don 41 
their two children stayed at their home outside the eastern iowa 
community of anamosa where the couple farms 600 acres and raises 
hogs and cattle 
cattle prices were at alltime highs during convention week and 
hog prices remained comfortably above the breakeven point while 
corn and soybean prices have been slumping the crop was good and 
cheap feed grains reduce the expense of raising livestock 
overall the mood out in the country is much more 
optimistic debbie hardersen says

in aerospace and construction have put the brakes on spending 
so many people have gone there that burbank police have assigned 
29 officers to handle the traffic jams that followed the stores 3 
million advertising campaign 
things got so bad that cars on the burbank boulevard offramp 
backed up on the golden state freeway police finally implored the 
state transportation department to put a sign on the freeway 
directing drivers to another exit

and about 200 at ikea the store features assembleityourself 
furniture and offers amenities such as supervised childcare and

every year artisans from all over the northeast flock to the 
annual holiday crafts fair at columbia university in new york to 
sell their pottery jewelry quilts and clothing but this year 
the market for crafts like that for goods sold by more 
traditional retailers is in a slump 
cherry schacher has been selling patchwork goods at the fair for 
10 years but this year she sold more placemats and pillows than 
500 quilts 
it is off a bit she said of her sales but after having had 
a slow year ms schacher came into manhattan expecting business to 
be down from the robust sales she enjoyed at past fairs 
like many artisans ms schacher depends on her handiwork for a 
large portion of her income however she and her husband who live 
in upstate ballston spa ny also make their living by playing in 
a country band several nights a week the music business helps make 
up for a drop in crafts sales 
alan goldfarb a glassblower from burlington vt also expected 
his business to be down at the fair but he was pleasantly 
surprised 
goldfarbs goblets and glass fish range from 1250 to 350 in 
price and he came prepared with more lowerpriced than higherend 
pieces yet by the end of his three days at the fair goldfarb had 
his highest sales total ever for the new york show 
he also found that the new works he displayed sold very well 
we were taking a chance he said but if you follow 
your heart it works

been shopping for something else lately a job 
at 26 ryan is among the young adults coping with unemployment 
during the economic slump in massachusetts ryan lost his job at a

this may be the season of austerity in giftgiving but thank 
your lucky stars is selling what some might consider a frivolity 
astrological gift certificates 
the company a careeroriented astrological firm based in 
suburban atlanta is selling certificates for its services which 
range from a personalized astrological profile for 1995 to a 
businessfriendship compatibility report for 2995 to a fullscale 
consultation for 80 
many retailers have reported consumers are looking for practical 
gifts this season like flannel shirts and sweaters but thank your 
lucky stars is confident theres a market for its services 
our astrological practice if this is not an oxymoron is a 
very conservative astrological practice said sandy keefe a 
partner in the firm 
ms keefe who also runs a standard personnel firm out of the 
same office also offers starguided suggestions for holiday gift 
giving 
but all people do not fare equally under ms keefes 
astrological gift guide 
for example because a leo yearns for appreciation and 
recognition it is suggested that season tickets to the theater or 
gold jewelry would make a fine present 
a sagittarius on the other hand wants to find out more about 
the world an atlas is advised as an appropriate gift 
its enough to make someone lie about their birthday

a delaware judge wednesday awarded approximately 
110 million to about 1000 former shell oil co stockholders who 
relinquished 1 million shares in a merger deal five years ago 
the shareholders most of whom are present or former shell 
employees were awarded 7120 per share for their stock by vice 
chancellor maurice hartnett iii in delaware 
houstonbased shell oil co became a wholly owned subsidiary of 
the giant royal dutchshell group of cos on june 7 1985 
completing a 57 billion merger 
as part of the merger the shareholders were given the option of 
accepting 60 per share or seeking a court appraisal of stock 
value said houston attorney lee godfrey lead counsel for the 
shareholders 
the shareholders who received the 7120 had sought the court 
appraisal rather than the 60pershare offer the judge also 
awarded interest to the shareholders on the 7120 price at 10 
percent interest from june 1985 increasing the amount to about 
110 per share 
our contention all along was that shells foreignowned parent 
paid far too little in the 1985 cashout merger said lee 
godfrey lead counsel for the 1000 shareholders 
plaintiffs attorneys maintained the fair value was 89 per 
share while experts for shell said the value was 55 a share 
shell officials can appeal the decision issued wednesday but 
company officials would not discuss their plans 
we dont have a comment at this time our attorneys are still 
studying the document said shell spokeswoman eydie pengelly 
last month hartnett awarded some 20000 other former shell 
stockholders an additional 2 per share for 15 million shares 
relinquished in the same merger deal those shareholders were given 
58 per share plus 2 a share for giving up their right of 
appraisals 
that award followed a june 1990 court finding of disclosure 
violations in materials shell distributed to shareholders 
describing their options in the buyout 
hartnett ruled last june that the material mailed to 
shareholders failed to disclose the existence of oil and gas 
reserves having a value of approximately 1 billion 
plaintiffs attorneys still are seeking interest on the 
2pershare award and attorneys fees

the federal governments inaction against mortgage lenders with 
excessive amounts held in escrow forced legal action against the 
gmac mortgage corp attorneys general in six states said 
wednesday 
attorneys general in iowa california massachusetts minnesota 
new york and texas filed the suit wednesday in us district court 
for the southern district of new york 
gmac mortgage corp of detroit and several of its subsidiaries 
routinely hold in these mortgage accounts more funds than either 
federal law or the homeowners mortgage contracts allow the 
lawsuit alleges 
the suit would bar gmacs illegal practice of requiring excess 
money to be held in homeowners mortgage escrow accounts 
massachusetts attorney general james m shannon said in a statement 
wednesday 
gmac will take appropriate action to defend against the 
allegations in the suit said rick gillespie a gmac vice president 
in elkins park pa 
gmac mortgage corp is confident it has been and remains in 
full compliance with federal and state laws and industry practices 
and that these practices are fair to each consumer and our 
company gillespie said he said the corporation voluntarily gave 
information to the attorneys general to aid their research gmac 
has about 400000 residential mortgages nationwide 
escrow accounts are kept by lending institutions to make 
payments for property taxes insurance and other items that 
borrowers must pay extra money in escrow is a bonanza for lenders 
because they can use the money for free or pay only a low rate of 
interest on it 
about twothirds of the nations home mortgages involve escrow 
accounts 
federal law limits lenders to keeping a twomonth cushion in 
escrow or enough money to make payments for two months the 
cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if 
the consumer is late making a monthly payment 
in april the attorneys general issued a report critical of the 
practice of requiring excess money in the accounts they asked 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp to tighten 
enforcement of the escrow law 
when we released the report of the illegal escrow practices of 
gmac and other lenders we urged the federal government to enforce 
its own statutory limits on escrow payments so far it has taken 
no action thus prompting suits like the one filed today at great 
cost to the states new york attorney general robert abrams said 
our report estimated that the excess cushion averages about 
150 per homeowner iowa attorney general thomas miller said 
that means we think lenders are holding several billion dollars 
that should be in the hands of their customers 
the twoyear study said consumers were being overcharged 2 
billion to 4 billion by the nations mortgage lenders 
the study focused on big lenders who operate nationwide a 
survey of four of the largest citibank gmac mortgage corp 
fleet mortgage corp and lomas financial group indicated that 
lenders may be holding excessive and illegal cushions in more than 
70 percent of escrow accounts 
bob brammer an administrative assistant in the iowa attorney 
generals office said inquiries still are being made into escrow 
practices of the other lenders 
we dont contemplate any lawsuits regarding them in the 
immediate future brammer said 
massachusetts assistant attorney general ernest sarason who 
handled the suit for shannon said the states have been studying 
the issue for more than two years 
the reason that we filed the suit is that we were very 
concerned about mortgage companies not complying with federal law 
limiting the amount of mortgage escrow sarason said

opec will continue pumping oil at high 
levels to offset crude losses caused by the persian gulf crisis 
officials said late wednesday 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said the 13 
nations of the organization of petroleum exporting countries would 
sign a statement thursday endorsing continued increased production 
he said in an interview that they also would promise to reduce 
their output to levels set in late july once the gulf crisis has 
ended 
in august after iraq invaded kuwait the cartel temporarily 
suspended its quota system to permit higher pumping by nations with 
spare capacity 
we will continue with the august agreement ginandjar said 
we are reaffirming everything said gabonese oil minister 
jean ping 
the august accord was put together so that heavyweight saudi 
arabia and other producing nations could make up for lost iraqi and 
kuwaiti crude 
about 4 million barrels of oil a day have been pulled from the 
market because of international sanctions imposed after iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
ginandjar said that when the gulf troubles subside the cartel 
would reimpose the output caps in force in late july under that 
accord all 13 nations agreed to hold production to 225 million 
barrels a day in an effort to reach a target of 21 dollars a 
barrel 
the cartels current production is pegged at around 23 million 
barrels a day saudi arabia the worlds largest crude exporter is 
close to pumping 85 million barrels a day sources have said its 
quota under the july accord was 54 million barrels 
other members pumping above their previous levels are venezuela 
nigeria the united arab emirates iran and libya 
the ministers who agreed to meet again in early march made 
their decisions during five hours of formal and informal talks on 
the opening day of their winter strategy session 
it was the first time since the invasion that all 13 
oilproducing representatives have been represented iraq and libya 
did not attend the meeting at which the cartels quota system was 
suspended 
no sparks were reported between iraq and kuwait seated next to 
each other in the conference rooms alphabetical arrangement 
ramzi salman abdul hussain director of iraqs state oil 
marketing organization said little but he told reporters that 
iraq could increase its crude production to strong levels as soon 
as we want 
none of the facilities are damaged he said 
iraq is estimated to be producing a mere 400000 barrels a day 
compared to earlier levels of more than 3 million barrels 
rasheed salem alameeri the oil minister for kuwaits 
governmentinexile also insisted his country could get its oil 
industry back to former levels quickly with a peaceful resolution 
he said iraqi invaders have done extensive damage to our oil 
industry but we have plans to reconstruct it in a short 
time 
earlier in the day opec president sadek boussena opened the 
strategy session by criticizing oilconsuming nations for failing 
to do much to ease the oil crunch 
instead of tapping crude in their inventories he said the rich 
nations appeared to have added oil to their storage tanks in case 
of a worsening of gulf troubles 
as a result he said opec has been forced into extreme levels 
of output 
this is clearly an illcontrived move boussena the 
algerian mines minister told his counterparts 
if such an escalation does not occur and as we all hope an 
early peaceful solution is found to the crisis then the world 
will be awash with oil he said 
he warned that opec would be faced with another decade of 
turmoil like the rollercoaster 1980s 
nobody in our organization wants a repetition of that era of 
rampant instability said boussena 
the cartel has been in disarray since the gulf crisis after the 
invasion ministers agreed to lift their production caps to offset 
the loss of crude from iraq and kuwait 
the result has been a flood of oil on the market and sharp 
swings in prices 
prices for light sweet crude peaked in october at 41 a barrel 
they since have skidded to under 30 a barrel on hints of peace in 
the middle east and worries about an oil glut 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel 
was 2625 a barrel monday well above its target price of 21 a 
barrel set in july 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher wednesday on the 
chicago board of trade in anticipation of the granting of export 
credits to the soviet union 
on other markets silver plunged while gold gained livestock 
and pork futures were mixed and energy futures fell 
grain and soybean futures opened lower in reaction to the 
release tuesday of the us agriculture departments supply and 
demand report said gerald zusel an analyst with edampf man 
international futures inc 
the market rallied later in the morning after sen bob dole 
rkan said immediate action was needed to extend 3 billion in 
credits to the soviet union 
doles request was considered bullish because the market has 
been speculating the export initiative would be around 15 
billion 
we mainly had a lot of speculative buying in anticipation the 
government will announce a big credit package zusel said 
after the close of trading president bush announced a waiver of 
trade restrictions on the soviet union and granted credit 
guarantees 
secretary of state james baker said the amount of credits would 
be between 500 million and 1 billion significantly less than 
what dole asked for and what a us agriculture department official 
last week told congress could be made available 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in december at 255 a bushel corn was cent lower 
to 1 cent higher with december at 227 a bushel oats were cent 
to 1 cents lower with december at 110 a bushel soybeans were 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with january at 596 a bushel 
silver prices fell on the new yorks commodity exchange amid 
fund and technical selling 
willian oneill an analyst with merrill lynch futures inc 
said silver is following a trend downward that was established at 
the beginning of the year 
silver is functioning as an industrial metal rather than as a 
precious metal oneill said that places silver in a weak 
position investment demand is sluggish to nonexistent and with 
the economy not expected to do well into next year the industrial 
side does not look all that positive either 
gold prices gained during wednesdays trading 
gold benefited from continued uncertainty in the persian gulf 
and the failure of the united states and iraq to agree on a date 
for a meeting of their diplomats oneill said 
gold was 70 cents to 180 higher with february at 37350 a 
troy ounce silver was 41 cents to 49 cents lower with december 
at 4026 a troy ounce 
energy futures were lower on the new york mercantile exchange 
with the weakness in the heating oil market the main feature of 
trading 
the market has become aware that there is too much heating oil 
out there said jim ritterbusch an analyst with painewebber inc 
in chicago we are not having the kind of december we had last 
year temperatures are warmer than normal and they are expected 
remain that way for a time 
the energy market tended to shrug off the meeting in vienna of 
13 ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
ritterbusch said the ministers decided late wednesday to continue 
current levels of crude output 
light sweet crude was 101 to 122 lower with january at 
2535 a barrel heating oil was 236 cents to 311 cents lower 
with january at 7463 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 223 
cents to 230 cents lower with january at 6449 cents a gallon 
natural gas was 08 cent lower to 005 cent higher with january at 
2204 per thousand cubic feet 
livestock and pork futures were mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
live cattle were 33 cent lower to 13 cent higher with december 
at 8885 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 30 
cent higher with january at 8872 cents a pound live hogs were 
unchanged to 25 cent higher with december at 4985 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 35 cent lower to 27 cent higher with 
february at 6692 cents a pound

trying to rediscover a recipe for success digital 
equipment corp has shuffled some of its top executives while the 
computer maker tries to cut costs by about 1 billion 
also looming on the horizon are possible layoffs which would be 
the first in digitals 33year history 
for months digital has been seeking ways to cut costs to cope 
with a slump in computer sales mark steinkrauss director of 
investor relations for the maynardbased company said digital is 
trying to reduce its expenses by about 1 billion though the 
figure is only a rough target 
in this economic environment one has to assume a low level of 
profitability steinkrauss said wednesday 
the costcutting steps have included slashing the payroll 
through voluntary means and consolidating operations 
digital which employs about 123500 people worldwide and had 
revenues of 129 billion in its last fiscal year is trying to 
eliminate 5000 to 6000 employees this fiscal year 
so far the worlds secondlargest computer maker has avoided 
layoffs by using a voluntary severance program 
nikki richardson a digital spokeswoman said wednesday about 
600 people have left the company under the recent severance 
program which is set to expire dec 31 she said many employees 
will wait until the last minute to make a decision whether to take 
the severance package 
digitals stock rose 237 a share wednesday to close at 57 in 
new york stock exchange trading 
the work force reduction program is going slowly said barry 
willman an analyst at the new york investment firm sanford c 
bernstein amp co 
digital likely will make a decision in january whether to extend 
the severance program or take the more forceful step of layoffs 
richardson said 
we will look at it in conjunction with the business climate 
she said adding that layoffs may be a possibility 
digital president kenneth olsen has refused to rule out layoffs 
digital posted its firstever quarterly loss earlier this year 
and its earnings for the quarter ended sept 30 plunged 83 percent 
while revenues dipped 1 percent 
in the wake of these results digital has decided to restructure 
part of its senior management 
david grainger who was vice president of digitals us sales 
and service organization will now head a newly created group 
overseeing the companys worldwide network of distributors and 
resellers who tailor products to individual customers 
digital may have let some opportunities slip by in this 
area steinkrauss said adding that the company will look at new 
ways to distribute its products 
donald p zereski formerly vice president for customer service 
is taking over responsibility for digitals us business under a 
structure that will reduce bureaucracy in sales steinkrauss said 
russell a gullotti who headed digitals corporate consulting 
services will also assume customer service duties 
in another recent switch bill hanson who oversaw manufacturing 
operations assumed worldwide responsibility for the flow of 
materials and other asset management robert palmer who headed 
semiconductor operations became vice president of manufacturing 
cliff friedman an analyst with bear stearns amp co said these 
management moves signal another change at digital where john 
smith the senior vice president for operations is gaining more 
authority to make the necessary steps 
smith appears to be taking over more daytoday responsibility 
for running digital from olsen who cofounded the computer maker 
analysts say 
like other computer companies digital has suffered from an 
industrywide downturn in sales in recent years digital also has 
seen sales slip in its minicomputer line its mainstay products as 
customers switch to increasingly powerful personal computers for 
some uses analysts say

is this town big enough for two oil futures 
markets 
now that the persian gulf crisis has made crude oil a hot 
commodity the new york mercantile exchange may be in for some 
competition 
the neighboring commodity exchange which shares the same 
trading floor with the merc has discussed a deal with londons 
international petroleum exchange that could lead to crude oil 
trading on the comex officials said wednesday 
the mercantile exchange currently the worlds largest market 
for crude futures hasnt faced any competition in this country 
since the chicago board of trade gave up oil trading a few years 
ago 
oil experts say breaking into the oil market would be difficult 
for any newcomer 
there is a rule of thumb that only one contract in the same 
commodity would succeed in any given time zone said peter 
beutel an oil analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in 
hoboken nj 
the comex located with other new york futures exchanges in the 
world trade center in lower manhattan deals primarily in precious 
metals 
weve been considering agreements with many exchanges and now 
were talking with the ipe about joint trading benefits 
commodity exchange president david a halperin said in a statement 
a comex official who would speak only on condition of anonymity 
said crude futures were part of the discussions but the official 
was not sure what the plans entailed 
the official was not sure how soon an offering might be made 
assuming the comex and london can strike a deal a phone call 
placed to ipes new york office was not immediately returned 
crude oil has been the sexy futures contract in recent 
months since the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august sent oil 
prices swinging wildly said christian gohler an oil broker with 
merrill lynch energy futures the bustle of trading at the 
mercantile exchange oil pit has contrasted sharply with relatively 
weak demand for metals 
if the comex offered sweet crude oil contracts it would compete 
directly with the mercantile exchange but the comex might offer 
contracts in sour crude which could put it a step ahead of the 
mercantile exchange which is now considering a sour crude 
contract 
sweet crude has a low sulfur content and is most desirable for 
refining sour crude has more sulfur and is more difficult to 
refine 
the two new york futures markets have failed in past discussions 
to reach agreement on a merger ipe was also once talking with the 
mercantile exchange about a trading agreement but those talks fell 
through 
oil traders said the emergence of a crude contract on the 
commodity exchange could stir bad blood between the exchanges the 
mercantile exchange said it would not fear any competition 
we think were the best at what we do so were ready to take 
on any comers said robert r davis senior vice president at the 
mercantile exchange 
analysts who follow oil futures pricing doubt that the comex 
would be successful in offering a contract that competed with the 
mercantile exchanges light sweet crude futures 
generally there is just room for one market for each commodity 
because the big players tend to gravitate to the place where the 
volume is greatest and they can get the best deals beutel said 
at the time the mercantile exchange first offered its futures 
contracts for light sweet crude in 1983 the chicago board of trade 
began offering contracts for louisiana light sweet crude but those 
sales were soon abandoned traders said 
but beutel said an oil contract that could be traded in both 
london and new york would create advantages for the biggest oil 
trading companies that maintain offices in both cities 
the fact that you could enter a position in london and remove 
it in new york would come close to that 24hour trading that some 
people want he said it would put local traders and smaller 
companies at a disadvantage he said because they would have a 
harder time keeping abreast of trading for so many hours each day 
london oil traders can now deal in futures of brent blend a 
north sea oil oil futures are also available on the singapore 
international monetary exchange but its contracts for dubai crude 
oil are not widely traded analysts said

the dollar drifted lower against foreign 
currencies wednesday in what traders said was one of the quietest

days few external influences 
a lot of people are already sidelined for the holidays we had 
absolutely no indicators come out today said gabriele schmitt

sterling strengthened to 19502 in new york from late tuesdays 
19380 and in london the pound rose to 19435 from 19400 late

iraq would withdraw its troops from kuwait before the jan 15 
deadline imposed in a resolution passed last month by the united 
nations the rumor later proved to be untrue 
the resolution permits the use of military force against iraq if 
the country remains in occupied kuwait beyond the midjanuary 
deadline 
people are pretty happy to stay square and not really get 
involved that much said renato strauss currency trader at bank 
julius baer amp co i had one of the lowest volume days of the 
year

1968 company spokesman james dunlap said de castro was not 
available for comment 
data generals stock closed unchanged wednesday at 437 a 
share in new york stock exchange trading 
ronald l skates data generals president and chief executive 
officer praised de castro as an industry legend 
he also commended richman for leading the westborobased 
companys sales and marketing efforts saying richman deserved much 
of the credit for data generals rapid rise in the market for 
midrange minicomputers 
that market has fallen on hard times data general has not 
enjoyed a profitable year since 1985 when its employment peaked at 
17700 since then the company has suffered a string of losses 
and employment has shrunk to around 9500 
analysts say data general has responded with some strong 
products particularly its aviion workstations but the 
minicomputer slump has continued to act as a drag on earnings 
hampering the companys repeated efforts to turn a profit 
data general faces the added strain of lower profit margins as 
it puts more focus on open computer systems or those that 
adhere to industry standards because the market is more 
competitive open systems are less profitable than the proprietary 
machines that fueled much of the the companys growth 
data general lost 139 million in its most recent fiscal year 
revenues were 122 billion compared with 131 billion the year 
before 
barry willman an analyst at the new york investment firm 
sanford c bernstein amp co said de castro had been assigning 
increasing responsibility to skates who assumed his present title 
last year 
willman described de castro as a visionary industrialist 
but sonny monosson president of monosson technology 
enterprises a boston firm that monitors hightech industries said 
he believed data general would gain from de castros departure 
really he was a hindrance to development monosson said 
he was a strongminded guy 
de castro served as president from 1968 until he was named 
chairman of the board and chief scientist in november 1989 
the company said both de castro and richman would not seek 
reelection to the board of directors but richman will continue to 
serve as executive vice president for the asiapacific region until 
he retires

merchants along the countrys 
northern border are floating on a tide of canadian dollars 
watching sales figures swell at a time when shopping elsewhere in 
the united states is slumping 
canadians have been traveling by car and bus from as far as 100 
miles away this year to snap up goods that sell in the united 
states for as low as half their cost back home 
as a result stores all along the border that reported record 
sales last year when retailing nationwide was stagnant say 
business is even better this christmas 
bob bowen merchandising manager of a kmart corp store outside 
niagara falls ny said sales were up 15 percent over last year 
and last year was a banner year too he said 
down the road stores at the factory outlet mall have been 
reporting sales increases of anywhere from 5 percent to more than 
10 percent over last year said pat doyle the malls marketing 
manager she said up to 90 percent of the malls customers are 
canadian 
parking lots at the kmart and the mall were filled wednesday 
with cars bearing ontario license plates and chartered buses from 
canada were parked at the front 
but seven miles away at a kmart in niagara falls ontario only 
three cashiers were on duty and the store was noticeably quiet 
you buffalo people are killing us said merchandising 
manager dan gimpel theres not a heck of a lot we can do people 
are convinced theres bargains over there and they go over 
richard delisle assistant district manager of canada customs in 
niagara falls ontario said the number of people paying duties on 
goods purchased in the united states between april and october the 
most recent figures available jumped 75 percent from last years 
record high 
each year were looking at increases to unprecedented 
levels delisle said 
the story is the same in border towns across the country in 
bellingham wash 45 miles south of vancouver business at the 
bellis fair mall is up slightly thanks to the canadians said 
marketing director wendy ripley 
people are always amazed to see our parking lot and all the 
canadian cars in it she said 
in northern new york motels are full of shoppers from as far 
away as ottawa and montreal and threehour delays have been 
reported on the international bridges 
a recent study estimated that sault ste marie ontario 
businesses lose 140 million a year in sales to stores in much 
smaller sault ste marie mich the study by ernst amp young in 
toronto estimated the loss nationwide at 2 billion 
shopping by canadians has surged even though canada officially 
is in a recession bern rotman spokesman for the new york state 
department of economic development said the hard times in canada 
might actually spur more crossborder shopping 
as the expendible income gets smaller in canada if thats 
the case it may very well be that the bargain thats had in the 
united states is even more a siren song he said 
the price differences on many everyday items are staggering an 
eightpack of batteries for example costs 397 in the united 
states but 685 in canada a roll of color slide film that would 
be less than 10 in new york is 1459 in ontario canadians pay 
the equivalent of 216 a gallon for selfserve unleaded gas while 
those in buffalo pay 143 
a canadian kmart could probably come over here and buy power 
tools cheaper off my counter than they could from their distributor 
in canada said thomas reddy general manager of the niagara 
falls ny kmart 
pam clarkin said she drives 65 miles roundtrip from her home in 
grassie ontario to do her weekly grocery shopping in niagara 
falls 
usually at home i pay about 120 for a weeks worth of 
groceries clarkin said here i can get it for about 70 
brian kellett a 19yearold student at the university of 
toronto said his fellow students make the 90mile drive to niagara 
falls as often as every two weeks to stock up on cheap booze and 
cigarettes 
everybody comes down they buy like a big jug of schnapps or 
something he said 
last year niagara falls ny residents grumbled about the 
traffic and litter problems they blamed on the canadians merchants 
said they had heard fewer complaints this year and speculated that 
american shoppers have simply learned to put up with the crowds 
they stay off the roads or go to amherst 15 miles south 
where its not so bad said bill hench manager of a wallet works 
store at the outlet mall

mgmpathe communications co said 
wednesday it will delay paying interest for nearly a month on 400 
million in debt incurred in the mgmua communications co buyout 
delaying the payments will not put mgmpathe into default on the 
debt because a 30day grace period on payments is permitted 
but moodys investors service inc one of the big debtrating 
companies immediately raised a red flag announcing it was 
downgrading some mgmpathe debt ratings

a german manufacturer of an antidepressant 
drug that was sold worldwide said wednesday it will plead guilty to 
charges that it waited too long to notify us regulators that the 
medication killed two patients in europe 
hoechst ag marketed the drug nomifensine in the united states 
under the name merital and voluntarily pulled it from shelves in 
1986 
the charges were filed wednesday in us district court in 
newark against hoechst and its former research director rainer 
zapf who will not be extradited to the united states prosecutors 
said 
the companys us subsidiary hoechstroussel pharmaceuticals 
inc based in somerville was not charged 
a court date for the plea has not been set 
us attorney michael chertoff said the case marked the first 
time a foreign drug maker has been prosecuted for failing to inform 
the us food and drug administration of adverse drug reactions 
that occurred outside the united states 
more than 14 million people in 96 countries used the 
antidepressant from its introduction in the early 1970s to its 
approval for use in the united states in december 1984 the company 
said hoechst began marketing the drug in the united states in july 
1985 
charges were filed because hoechst waited until 1986 to inform 
the fda of a 1984 nomifensinerelated death in france and a 1981 
death in italy authorities said 
hoechst pulled the drug from the market after it noticed an 
increase in hemolytic anemia in certain users a potentially fatal 
form of leukemia the two patients in europe died from hemolytic 
anemia associated with the drug according to court papers 
andrea stine a spokeswoman for the company said she did not 
know how widely the drug was used in the united states she said 
hoechst recorded 5 million in us sales from the antidepressant 
fda attorney rick blumber said hoechst acted properly when it 
reported another death associated with the drug in europe in april 
1985 he said the antidepressant was relabeled as a result of that 
fatality

multimedia inc said wednesday strength in its 
cable television and entertainment businesses has more than offset 
the adverse impact of a soft advertising market on its newspaper 
and broadcasting businesses 
chairman and chief executive walter bartlett said the companys 
revenue and income from continuing operations should be higher this 
year than in 1989 and show improvement again in 1991 
bartletts upbeat review of the greenville scbased media 
companys prospects at the 18th annual painewebber media outlook 
conference contrasted with a number of gloomy industry forecasts 
expressed earlier this week 
multimedia will be up this year and will be up again next 
year he told the securities analysts 
robert e hamby jr treasurer and chief financial officer said 
the company should meet analysts earnings forecasts of 380 to 
390 a share this year excluding a previouslydisclosed writeoff 
of 25 cents a share 
the company earned 311 a share in 1989 
multimedia owns 14 daily and 43 nondaily newspapers including 
papers in greenville sc asheville nc and montgomery ala 
four tv stations and eight radio stations it has applied for 
federal communications commission approval of the purchase of a 51 
percent interest in a fifth tv station 
bartlett said the slump in retail advertising has kept pressure 
on growth in newspaper and broadcasting revenue which may continue 
into next year until the economy improves 
but he said this has been outweighed by improved results in its 
cable tv system operations which claim 347000 subscribers and in 
entertainment operations which include production of the 
syndicated daily talk shows donahue and sally jessy raphael 
the chairman said he expects to boost ad rates at its newspapers 
by 6 percent to 7 percent next year and by 5 percent to 6 percent 
in cable tv 
bartlett said the company has 375 million available for 
acquisitions but said it is in no rush to spend it he said the 
company recently passed up a chance to buy a television station 
offered at eight times its annual cash flow 
we are pleased to have the money in our hip pocket if 
opportunities arise he said

the first major florida indictments growing out of 
the savings and loan crisis charged wednesday that bank officers 
funded illegal campaign contributions and diverted 38 million in 
deposits to cover losses on speculative investments 
had there been a mask and gun involved we almost could have 
called this bank robbery said fbi agent william gavin 
three exofficers of the failed fort lauderdalebased 
commonwealth savings and loan and an investment broke were named 
in two indictments carrying potential prison sentences of 15 to 256 
years 
prosecutors charge the former executives acts were a 
significant reason for commonwealths failure in july 1989 after 
the thrift absorbed a 33 million loss the sampl remains under the 
control of the resolution trust corp 
depositors were largely protected against losses by federal 
regulations but taxpayers will be stuck with commonwealth debts 
these individuals defraud the american public these 
individuals defraud the investors and the bank these individuals 
defraud the taxpayers in this kind of behavior us attorney 
dexter lehtinen said in announcing the indictments the taxpaying 
public is having to cover a horrendous loss 
the indictments charge that money set aside by a catholic 
charity a construction union and other institutional investors was 
diverted from the purchase of certificates of deposit to secret 
accounts used to conceal losses on trades controlled by 
extreasurer jason chapnick 
the accounts were credited with fake interest payments to lull 
depositors into the belief that their investments were prospering 
prosecutors said 
bogus monthly brokeragehouse statements 11 million in 
unrecorded treasury bill sales fake letters of credit and false 
reports to independent auditors were part of the scheme to keep 
anyone from discovering the diversions the indictment charged 
the criminal investigation was prompted by reports from 
commonwealth and regulators before the thrift failed said 
lehtinen who called sampl fraud the largest crisis that the 
country faces 
chapnick brother of commonwealth chairman barry chapnick also 
was accused of converting 15 million to his personal use 
including 700000 to repay personal debts a taxperjury charge 
covers his federal income tax returns 
barry chapnick is mentioned in the indictment as the one who 
selected the candidates for political contributions but he was not 
charged in the indictment itself lehtinen cautioned against making 
much of the omission because the investigation is continuing 
the probe was led by two prosecutors hired specifically to root 
out sampl fraud under federal bailout legislation lehtinen said 
the additional staff is concentrating primarily on commonwealth 
and on miamis failed centrust savings which has not yet been 
charged 
the scope of savings and loan fraud in south florida in 
general and the inability to staff the investigations here and 
nationwide properly does impede some of the investigations 
lehtinen said 
the expanded staff has been assigned to centrust commonwealth 
and a few other known investigations leaving many other 
investigations in the district extremely short of either fbi or 
us attorney manpower but not centrust or commonwealth 
the fraud conspiracy indictment named jason chapnick 42 of 
fort lauderdale former vice president and treasurer kenneth 
fletcher 41 of davie expresident of commonwealths securities 
trading subsidiary commvest and investment broker herbert leslie 
kalbach 46 of fort lauderdale 
felix adams 41 of bushnell former executive vice president 
and assistant secretary was accused in a separate indictment of 
misapplying commonwealth funds on the political donations employee 
contributions allegedly were reimbursed by commonwealth 
charges and potential sentences are chapnick 52 counts 256 
years in prison 125 million fine fletcher 32 counts 160 
years 8 million fine kalbach three counts 15 years 750000 
fine and adams six counts 30 years 15 million fine 
all four appeared wednesday afternoon before us magistrate 
lurana snow in fort lauderdale where the grand jury issued the 
indictments adams pleaded innocent and arraignments were delayed 
until thursday for chapnick and friday for fletcher and kalbach

oil prices dropped about 1 per barrel on the 
futures market wednesday as opec ministers wrestled with a 
potential glut of crude and demand by us refineries tapered off 
light sweet crude for nextmonth delivery settled at 2535 per 
barrel its lowest level since aug 3 the day after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait contracts for january delivery finished down 
106 later months also traded lower 
despite the latest fall and an overall bearish mood among oil 
traders over the past two weeks crude has seemed unwilling to give 
up a remnant war premium of around 5 a barrel in recent 
sessions on the new york mercantile exchange 
with supply strong and demand weakening oil traders said prices 
would likely have fallen below 20 per barrel recently without the 
lingering threat of a war in the persian gulf but iraqs 
insistence that it will keep oilrich kuwait has kept crude above 
25 per barrel 
the market seems to want to include at least a 5 to 6 
premium while this incredible military standoff occurs said 
thomas p blakeslee an energy analyst at pegasus econometric group 
inc in hoboken nj 
crude staged a brief rally wednesday as traders responded to a 
continued diplomatic stalemate between us and iraqi officials 
over a date when secretary of state james a baker iii should go to 
baghdad to discuss the crisis 
the united states wants the meeting to occur in early january 
but iraq insistson waiting until just before jan 15 the un 
security council has given iraq until that date to either get out 
of kuwait or face a possible military strike 
but the market was more intently focused on the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries meeting in vienna 
opec ministers were warned their gushing crude production could 
lead to an oil glut and falling prices when the gulf crisis ends 
but they appeared reluctant to quickly cut output and lift slipping 
prices 
traders in new york were also put in a bearish mood by the 
weekly american petroleum institute report issued tuesday evening 
which indicated the nations refinery utilization had dropped from 
88 percent of capacity to 83 percent of capacity in the past week 
that means demand for crude oil will be down experts said 
when that many refineries decide to cut runs they dont shift 
those dials every day or every week so its pretty structurally 
bearish said christian gohler an oil broker with merrill lynch 
energy futures 
as crude fell futures prices for refined petroleum products 
also took a dive 
home heating oil dropped 305 cents to 7463 cents a gallon on 
contracts for delivery in january unleaded gasoline fell 230 
cents to 6449 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in january 
natural gas which is not threatened by the possibility of war 
in the middle east dropped 81 cents to 2204 per 1000 cubic

the accounting firm of coopers amp lybrand 
charged by federal regulators with making a faulty audit of a 
failed colorado savings and loan has agreed to tighten its 
auditing procedures the government announced wednesday 
the office of thrift supervision said its settlement with 
coopers amp lybrand was its first major enforcement action against a 
big accounting firm experts have noted that accountants played an 
important role in the 500 billion savings and loan scandal but 
until now regulators have focused their attention mainly on sampl 
operators and directors 
the charges against coopers amp lybrand stemmed from its 1986 
audit of silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
whose board of directors included president bushs son neil the 
collapse of silverado in december 1988 is expected to cost 
taxpayers 1 billion 
the office of thrift supervision had accused coopers amp lybrand 
and arthur l knight who headed the firms team that handled the 
silverado audit of among other things 
accepting an unjustified understatement of silverados 
allowance for loan losses on its 13 billion loan portfolio 
relying on appraisers judgments that were not justified by 
market conditions or by financial statements applying to the 
properties behind the loans 
not following accounting principles 
the loan loss allowance should have been 35 million higher the 
ofice of thrift supervision said 
the auditors did not possess the expertise required to 
properly complete the silverado audit the office asserted in a 
legal brief released with its announcement 
this is a significant case for ots for those who provide 
professional services to insured institutions and for the public 
said timothy ryan director of the office in a written statement 
it says loud and clear that we hold accountants lawyers and 
other professionals accountable for their actions just as we do 
sampl directors and officers 
in its settlement the accounting firm agreed to meet a number 
of auditing requirements over the next five years in addition 
knight agreed not to audit any insured savings institutions 
in todays emotional and supercharged environment coopers amp 
lybrand decided as a prudent business matter not to incur the 
expense aggravation and substantial publicity that would have been 
associated with fighting the office of thrift supervision the 
firms general counsel harris j amhowitz said in a statement of 
his own 
amhowitzs statement indicated that coopers amp lybrand believes 
its silverado audit was not faulty 
during the relevant 198687 period the firm conducted several 
hundred audits of savings institutions with no indication of any 
endemic audit failures the statement said the gaos report to 
congress regarding audits by various accounting firms of failed 
savings assocations expressed no criticism of coopers amp lybrands 
audits 
coopers amp lybrand agreed among other things to ensure that 
employees on sampl audits are competent and to comply with 
accounting principles for those audits 
if coopers amp lybrand had not settled the charges it could have 
been required to participate in a public administrative hearing 
that hearing could have resulted in orders to the firm to do or 
stop doing certain things 
neil bush has been charged with conflict of interest in not 
fully disclosing his business ties with two big silverado 
borrowers the thrift agency is seeking an administrative order 
against bush an oil and gas developer that could lead to barring 
him from the banking and savings industries 
bush 35 has denied any wrongdoing administrative law judge 
daniel j davidson is expected to recommend by jan 2 what 
sanctions if any should be taken against bush 
bush and other former silverado directors as well as the 
thrifts law firm have been charged with negligence in a 200 
million lawsuit filed in september by the federal deposit insurance 
corp

finalized last week will significantly strengthen the balance 
sheet said sidney tassin who works with general partner pickens 
on mesas financial transactions 
mesa has been looking for ways to repay 1 billion in shortterm 
bank debt its cash flow has been hobbled by low natural gas 
prices 
tassin said a broker is looking for buyers for mesas debt 
through a socalled private placement american banker reported 
tuesday that mesa hopes to raise 600 million through the 
placement 
the funds raised would be used to repay mesas bank debt tassin 
said the result would be debt that could be repaid over a longer 
period of time 15 to 20 years he said 
mesa incurred debt through the purchase of natural gas 
properties which are longterm assets repayment of the new debt 
will match with the life of mesas natural gas assets tassin said 
mesa has also eliminated some of its debt through the sale of 
assets 
the partnership last week finalized an agreement to sell about 
13 percent of its reserves to houstonbased seagull energy corp 
the transaction will trim about 350 million from mesas debt its 
completion hinges on seagull obtaining financial commitments 
after the deal is closed which is expected to be early next 
year mesas primary interests will be in the hugoton field of 
southwest kansas the west panhandle field of texas the san juan 
basin of new mexico and in the gulf of mexico 
the private placement and sale to seagull will repay about 950 
million of mesas 1 billion in bank debt 
mesas debt for more than 10 years has been secured by its prize 
properties in the hugoton field 
mesa earlier this year decided not to pay common or preferred 
dividends to partners because of the lower cash flow that left 
pickens who is compensated with 1 percent of mesas cash 
distribution without a regular salary

hilton hotels corp stock shot up 
667 to 4212 a share wednesday on a report that an investor 
group was mulling a 75 per share offer for the hotelgaming 
concern 
trading volume was more than 25 million shares 10 times the 
normal trading for hilton on the new york stock exchange 
a spokesman for the hotelcasino concern said no one had 
approached it about a buyout 
hilton had put itself up for sale and the stock hit an alltime 
high of 11550 in summer 1989 the company took itself off the 
market last march after entertaining offers including some from 
japanese companies that came in lower than expected 
that decision along with weak earnings worries about the 
travel business and the persian gulf crisis sent the stock to as 
low as 27 in recent months 
hilton spokesman james galbraith cited a televised report 
tuesday night by financial commentator dan dorfman as the reason 
for the big jump in hiltons share price dorfman said some 
japanese investors were included in the interested group 
michael mueller an analyst who follows hotel and gaming 
companies for montgomery securities inc in san francisco noted 
that hiltons stock price had been on the rise before the report 
i turned positive on these stocks when the oil prices went 
down and it looked like there might be peace in the gulf mueller 
said 
although the japanese have recently bought such trophy 
properties as the pebble beach golf resorts and mca inc mueller 
said he was skeptical about the chances of getting financing for a 
bid such as described by dorfman in todays tight credit markets 
that would be a 45 billion transaction mueller said it 
would be very tough right now to finance a real estatehotel 
transaction of that kind
