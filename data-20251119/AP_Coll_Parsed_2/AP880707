a threestory department store crowded 
with people seeking shelter from torrential rains collapsed 
thursday killing at least eight people injuring more than 40 and 
trapping others in the rubble authorities said 
it looks real bad cameron county sheriff alex perez said of 
the scene in the downtown area of this city across the rio grande 
from matamoros mexico its a disaster it was just like a bomb 
hit that corner store there 
the roof and front wall of la tienda amigo known as the amigo 
store caved in at about 220 pm cdt emergency crews using 
portable lights continued into the night digging through mounds of 
broken cinderblocks glass twisted steel and merchandise to pull 
out survivors and look for victims 
they thought they heard some voices and thats where theyre 
digging now city spokeswoman pam downing said about 10 pm 
rescuers cut through a wall inside a woolworths store next door 
to reach some of those trapped witnesses said they heard screams 
from the wreckage linens and clothing blown from the store by high 
winds were being used to wrap the wounds of the injured 
police sgt dean poos said shortly after 7 pm that we dont 
really think there are going to be any more live people coming out 
of there 
ambulances and rescue personnel were hampered in reaching the 
scene by floodwaters from the downpour steve fitzgibbons acting 
assistant city manager said some local businesses had volunteered 
frontend loaders and cranes to help 
the national weather service said the collapse could have been 
caused by the weight of the rainwater which dumped more than 2 
inches in less than 30 minutes 
the store was half a block from the international bridge and 
sheriffs lt johnny castillo said that when the storm began a 
large number of mexican nationals were running there to get out 
of the rain the store was packed 
poos said store owner bernard levine told him that when the roof 
collapsed he jumped under a table and all he knows is that when 
everything settled he looked up and there was blue sky above him 
levine said he escaped with three employees and three customers 
poos said six bodies had been removed from the rubble and 
identified and johnny economedes head of one rescue team said 
workers had found two more bodies 
theyve got two steel beams across them and about 20 or 30 
tons of concrete on them economedes said 
poos said eight people were admitted to hospitals and another 34 
were treated at three hospitals in brownsville and nearby san 
benito 
authorities said they could only guess at the number of people 
who might have been trapped inside poos estimated it would be no 
more than 50 and castillo speculated it could be as many as 125 
poos said the dead included a woman who was apparently crushed 
as she sat in a car with mexican license plates in front of the 
building two others were killed as they stood under a canopy in 
front of the store 
all of a sudden i hear a noise kind of like a boom and i was 
looking directly at the store and i see this tancolored 
sandycolored wall that filled the whole front of the store said 
anthony padilla a brownsville herald photographer who was shooting 
weather photos in front of the store when the roof collapsed 
it was coming forward then the windows the entire 
storefront the windows just exploded out he said glass just 
went out people just went like this covered their heads kind of 
ducked down and in the next instant the whole thing just came 
down 
the people i had been looking at were just covered with 
rubble he said adding one womans hand was pinned to a parking 
meter after a steel ibeam collapsed and left her surrounded with 
cinder blocks 
us border patrol officials and other law enforcement agencies 
including mexican authorities assisted in the rescue operation 
an emergency treatment center was set up at a civic center about 
two blocks away and authorities blocked off the area 
a meteorologist with the national weather service in san antonio 
who asked not to be identified said that in the kind of storm that 
hit the area the drops are very large and very heavy and the 
fact that the storm system wasnt moving very fast only about 10 
miles an hour can cause heavy flooding

a federal official warned thursday that two more months of 
drought could close plants along three rivers in alabama florida 
and georgia as temperature records continued to fall and circus 
elephants were taken to a river to cool off in 101degree 
pittsburgh 
one official in droughtstricken ohio warned thursday of likely 
statewide water restrictions low water again kept barges from 
moving on the lower mississippi river and part of the ohio was 
closed 
an official of the minnesota department of natural resources 
said the river dipped closer wednesday to a level that would 
trigger a recommendation to divert water from lakes in northern 
minnesota 
minnesota gov rudy perpich upon returning from washington 
thursday night said he persuaded us agriculture secretary 
richard lyng to allow farmers to donate their hay on conservation 
reserve program land without forfeiting any of their payments 
under it 
this is a very critical time for livestock and dairy farmers 
these people are on the verge of bankruptcy perpich said at the 
minneapolisst paul international airport but it wont work 
unless we get the farmers to donate the hay and the private and 
commercial truckers to donate the transportation ill contribute 
my time and drive one of those trucks 
private crop analyst conrad leslie of the leslie analytical 
organization in chicago said corn yields from irrigated fields of 
nebraska and parts of iowa could be good but some other fields in 
the midwest already are beyond recovery 
this is a disaster under development said leslie were 
in uncharted waters the great difficulty is that we dont know 
what the moisture situation will be a year from now and whether we 
can make a recovery 
rain fell on some dry sections of minnesota but pennsylvania 
officials declared a statewide drought watch thursday triggering 
voluntary reductions in water use and a ban on open fires in state 
parks and forests 
temperatures hit record highs for the date thursday in at least 
28 cities from the great lakes to the east coast including 102 at 
fort wayne ind the national weather service said 
detroits high of 100 degrees toppled a record that had been on 
the books since 1874 when thermometers reached 97 in the normally 
cool mountains of west virginia elkins hit a record 93 the ninth 
record temperature there since june 1 
the temperature at pittsburgh hit a record 101 degrees and four 
elephants from the syria temple shrine circus were taken to the 
allegheny river for a cooling wallow only one of the animals 
natives of hot climates got in and rolled around in the water 
the drought also knocked the steam out of the annual railroad 
journey transporting vintage restored circus wagons to milwaukee 
for the citys circus parade 
officials said thursday that the steam locomotive used to pull 
the train wont make the run this year because of the danger of 
setting trackside fires from sparks 
salt concentrations in mississippi river water climbed higher 
thursday at drinking water intakes of the nearest downriver suburb 
of new orleans and officials of st bernard parish began reserving 
barges to float in fresh water the rivers reduced flow is not 
strong enough to push the dense salt water back into the gulf of 
mexico 
lower plaquemines parish is already bringing fresh water by 
barge to mix with the salty flow at its intakes 30 miles downriver 
from new orleans the salt concentration there is already strong 
enough to taste 
a continuation of the drought for two more months could threaten 
municipal water supplies and close plants along three major rivers 
in alabama florida and georgia lt col garry cooper of the army 
corps of engineers said thursday 
cooper deputy district engineer for the corps mobile district 
addressed a drought management meeting of the 
apalachicolachattahoocheeflint drought management committee made 
up of the corps the three states and other organizations the 
committee announced that navigation on floridas apalachicola river 
would virtually end on july 13 because of low water 
cooper referred to both plants that use water to run turbines 
and generate electricity and those that use water for industrial 
purposes such as rinsing textiles and cooling machinery the lack 
of rain already has forced alabama power to shut down nearly all 
hydroelectric production and have coalburning plants make up the 
difference 
the mississippi river remained closed at black hills miss 
about 20 miles south of natchez miss where water had been as low 
as five feet 
hopefully by this weekend we will have the river open if 
somebody doesnt mess up lc fumbanks chief of navigation for 
the army corps of engineers said in a radiotelephone interview 
from aboard the dredge jadwin 
the jadwin worked south of greenville miss where traffic 
resumed wednesday while another dredge pumped sand from the 
blockage at black hills 
the coast guard decided thursday to close the ohio river at 
mound city ill for 12hour shifts to clear a buildup of sand 
and silt from the channel said coast guard lt jg jim clifton 
he said the affected twomile stretch would be opened for six 
hours friday morning closed for 12 hours then reopened for six 
hours it will just alternate back and forth like that until they 
get it cleared through clifton said adding that he had no 
estimate how long that would take 
traffic on the missouri river is normal although barges are 
carrying lighter loads thanks to reservoirs upstream said paul 
johnston director of public affairs for the army corps of 
engineers at omaha neb 
ohio lt gov paul leonard said thursday that voluntary water 
conservation measures are not working 
most of the cities were checking with regularly indicate the 
program is not paying dividends leonard said in dayton my 
guess is that if the drought continues for another two weeks to 30 
days were going to need statewide mandatory water 
restrictions 
leonard made his remarks before leaving for washington where 
he like perpich and officials from seven states met with lyng 
richard shank director of ohios environmental protection 
agency has asked the states 2500 largest water systems to aim 
for a a minimum 25 percent reduction in water use by all customers 
and some cities have already banned lawn sprinkling 
georgias department of natural resources fined gwinnett and 
cobb counties 75000 each wednesday for taking too much water in 
june and told them they must cut consumption possibly including 
roundtheclock bans on outdoor water use 
up to 15 inches of rain fell on parts of westcentral and 
northern minnesota late wednesday and early thursday somewhat 
easing drought conditions the national weather service said today 
every little bit helps said clay county extension agent 
eddie bernhardson however he added the rains been really 
limited in most areas of the county and high temperatures are 
complicating the situation 
wheat clay countys biggest crop is getting to the point 
where in some areas theyll get 8 to 10 bushels an acre maximum 
compared to a normal average of 40 to 50 bushels he said 
approximately 545 bales of hay from elon college nc arrived 
thursday at shelbyville ky it was a gesture of thanks for the 
2300 tons of hay kentucky farmers sent by train to north carolina 
two years ago said roger nesbitt a spokesman for the kentucky 
department of agriculture 
i gave about 50 bales two years ago now its my turn to 
receive said ol jeffries who farms near shelbyville i 
dont know which way to turn its pitiful

rescuers on thursday night found two 
more survivors of an explosion and towering fire that consumed the 
piper alpha platform and killed up to 166 people in the worlds 
worst oil rig disaster 
the search was suspended for the night to resume at daylight 
friday but authorities said there was little hope of finding 
anyone else alive in the north seas frigid waters 
the piper alpha oil rig 120 miles off scotland is owned by 
occidental petroleum 
a joint statement issued by occidental petroleum spokesman david 
mathys in london and police in aberdeen at 415 am friday 1115 
pm edt thursday said 
in all 230 personnel were involved in the incident this was 
made up of 227 on occidental facilities and three in a small rescue 
boat seventeen bodies have been recovered total survivors to date 
are 64 and 149 are unaccounted for 
those numbers tooks into account body recovered early friday 
mathys said initial confusion as to the number of survivors 
resulted in earlier discrepancies in the figures 
asked whether rescuers had given up hope of finding more 
survivors british energy department minister peter morrison said 
to be honest yes at this stage there is very little hope 
indeed 
the rig owners said the probable cause of the conflagration was 
a gas leak which a survivor said was screaming like a banshee 
seconds before the blast wednesday night 
survivors told of having to choose between trying to survive the 
flames in hopes aid would come and plunging 150 feet into a blanket 
of burning oil that covered water cold enough to kill 
it was a case of fry and die or jump and try said roy 
carey 45 who jumped 
rescue pilots described flames up to 400 feet high the fire 
still flickered nearly 24 hours later 
prime minister margaret thatchers government promised a very 
very deep and farreaching inquiry questions arose about safety 
stadards in the highrisk industry and opposition politicians 
claimed safety was neglected 
occidental petroleum said it believed a gas leak was to blame 
but days or weeks would be needed to determine what caused and 
ignited it occidental said the threequarters of the 649foothigh 
rig was destroyed 
derek ellington a 45yearold rigger said he was in a workshop 
near the control center when he heard the scream of two gas leaks 
almost simultaneously and about 30 seconds later there was the 
first explosion it wiped out the control room and that was it our 
nerve center was gone 
andrew sneddon a university lecturer on offshore engineering in 
aberdeen said we can only assume there was a leak of some sort 
basically you are sitting on top of two highly flammable products 
oil and gas a leak or a spill is a potential hazard it is 
extremely difficult to say what could have set it off 
the number of men still missing and the dim prospects for 
finding them alive seem certain to make the piper alpha explosion 
the worst oil rig disaster surpassing the 123 deaths when the 
alexander l kielland platform capsized in norways north sea 
waters in march 1980 
police said the overwhelming majority of those on the piper 
alpha were scottish but the domestic british news agency press 
association said workers from the united states canada 
continental europe and south africa also were aboard authorities 
said no list of dead would be released until families were notified 
six nato warships led by the us destroyer hayler diverted 
from maneuvers to join a multinational flotilla of rescue vessels 
helicopters crisscrossed the smokefilled skies 
armand hammer chairman of occidental said he would leave 
immediately for aberdeen to oversee care the care of injured 
workers and families of the missing said spokesman roger gillot at 
the companys los angeles headquarters 
survivors were taken to aberdeen royal infirmary and officials 
said 20 were hospitalized most with burns distraught families 
clustered outside waiting for news of loved ones 
parkinson insisted safety standards were strict including 
weeklong government inspections annually he said the piper alpha 
inspection took place two weeks ago 
john prescott of the opposition labor party claimed in 
parliament that rig inspection and maintenance had been reduced in 
recent years too little money was spent on training and health 
and safety legislation did not apply fully to the north sea oil and 
gas industry 
in reply parkinson said serious north sea accidents had fallen 
from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year he added that is too high a 
figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure that 
improvement is maintained 
bob cryer of labor said an explosion on the piper alpha four 
years ago slightly injured four men and claimed the investigators 
report was kept secret parkinsons department said the report was 
not published because investigators found no negligence and did not 
recommend prosecutions 
the disaster wednesday night began at about 930 pm just 
after a 12hour shift had ended and many of the men were in bed 
i was just going to bed and there was a bang said dave 
lambert 38 they came in and said there was a fire and to get 
out the sprinklers were on we could see them but there wasnt 
sufficient volume to put down the fire 
rigger tony sinnett watching from a supply vessel told the 
aberdeen evening express it was like the platform had been hit 
by an atomic bomb there was massive mushrooms and flames shooting 
into the air i just thanked god i wasnt on board

senators are weighing in with their favorite 
candidates for attorney general while the man whos leaving the 
job predicts his successor will not be a clone of anybody else 
president reagan launched his search wednesday for edwin meese 
iiis replacement and one of his first steps in the process was to 
meet with the departing attorney general 
a lightning rod of controversy because of his conservative 
policies and his personal legal problems meese announced tuesday 
he would be gone in a few weeks he declared himself vindicated by 
an 830page report on his official conduct compiled by independent 
counsel james mckay although he acknowledged he had not yet seen 
it 
the report has not been released by a special federal court 
while sources have said the report recommends against a criminal 
indictment its conclusions on meeses ethical conduct remain 
unclear 
while no names of possible successors were volunteered at the 
white house senators made sure that a steady list of possibilities 
kept drifting from capitol hill to the white house 
some lawmakers made telephone calls to administration officials 
others allowed their message to be carried by news reporters all 
agreed that the window for confirmation would be short 
majority democrats control the senate schedule recesses already 
are scheduled during the two national political conventions in july 
and august and congress might adjourn early during the 
presidential campaign 
two members of the senate judiciary committee ranking 
republican strom thurmond and democrat dennis deconcini suggested 
former republican sen paul laxalt of nevada as meeses successor 
laxalt was considered the presidents closest senate ally before 
retiring 
tom loranger a spokesman for laxalt quoted the former senator 
as saying there is absolutely no truth to the rumors about my 
going to the justice department 
laxalts secretary at his washington law office janene assuras 
said her boss was not interested in the job but didnt know 
what he would do if reagan asked 
deconcini of arizona also recommended former house republican 
leader john rhodes from his home state 
thurmond of south carolina also had other suggestions former 
democratic attorney general griffin b bell who served under jimmy 
carter and reagans first attorney general william french smith 
responding to a reporters question thurmond said former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole would make an excellent 
attorney general 
her husband senate minority leader bob dole rkan suggested 
that former white house chief of staff howard h baker jr and 
washington lawyer judith richards hope daughterinlaw of comedian 
bob hope would qualify 
baker resigned as chief of staff effective june 30 to return 
to private law practice in tennessee mrs hopes nomination to 
succeed robert h bork on the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia has not yet been acted upon by the senate 
sen orrin g hatch rutah and a judiciary committee member 
favors acting deputy attorney general harold christensen of salt 
lake city a newcomer to the department christensens confirmation 
hearing for the deputys job is set for july 27 
conservative republican sen steve symms of idaho rcommended 
eugene thomas of boise president of the american bar association 
in 198687 
he doesnt have any scars and has an impeccable record 
symms said 
sen alfonse m damato rny suggested a homestate judge 
sol wachtler chief judge of the new york court of appeals his 
term on the state court expires in january 1999 
justice department spokesman patrick korten said wednesday that 
he believed meese has weighed in on the question of his 
successor 
interviewed on cable news network meese was asked what kind of 
person he thought should succeed him 
i dont think anybody would be a clone of anybody else he 
said but meese said he hoped the person selected is someone who 
subscribes to the principles of ronald reagan and his 
administration 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater conceded that 
administration officials had no contingency plan to find a 
replacement even though meese indicated some time ago he might 
leave before the end of the administration 
we had an attorney general up until yesterday fitzwater 
said we dont compile lists for positions where theyre already 
filled 
fitzwater had said earlier that meese told reagan some time 
ago that he might want to leave before the end of the 
administration the president left the timing up to him 
reagan briefly discussed a successor for meese with white 
house chief of staff kenneth duberstein and general counsel ab 
culvahouse the spokesman said 
if a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time 
meese leaves fitzwater said the administration probably would 
install solicitor general charles fried in the job on an acting 
basis

increases in food prices should remain 
moderate this year despite the drought as the nation begins to draw 
on its large grain reserves says the agriculture departments top 
economist 
the immediate problem is not one of food shortage or food 
price inflation except in certain specific instances but rather 
the problem is one of responding in a compassionate way to the 
losses faced by american farmers assistant secretary of 
agriculture ewen m wilson said wednesday 
appearing before three house subcommittees wilson forecast 
tight supplies of soybeans and oats he also acknowledged that 
while the winter wheat harvest is actually ahead of schedule there 
has been severe damage to spring wheat and much of the corn crop is 
in bad shape 
he said however that south american soybeans will be available 
to meet us needs and added that reserves of wheat and feed grains 
are ample to ensure that americans will not have to endure any 
calamitous food shortage 
the testimony came as capitol hill began to focus more intently 
on food prices with lawmakers saying there was no immediate reason 
to warrant major increases 
rep byron dorgan dnd called on the congressional general 
accounting office to monitor food prices in the next six months he 
expressed concern that food processors and others might engage in 
price gouging 
it simply wouldnt wash with economic reality to cite the 
drought as a reason for a quick runup of food prices he said in 
a statement it would be inexcusable for any company to use the 
drought as a way to make a quick buck 
wilson did say that prolonged drought would send wheat prices 
higher guaranteeing some additional pressure on retail prices of 
bakery products and cereals but not a major increase 
he said however that farmlevel prices account for only 8 
percent of the retail value of cereal and bakery products 
if wheat prices for the entire season average 30 percent above 
last year this alone would translate into a 24 percent rise in 
the retail price of bakery and cereal products wilson said he 
said any increases would be moderate in scale 
wilson said that while no major shortages were in sight there 
could be a squeeze in the supply of some crops 
he also said grazing conditions on june 1 were rated 68 percent 
of ideal and that hay prices are up 22 percent from last year 
but 65 percent of the winter wheat crop which amounts to 
threequarters of all us wheat production already has been 
harvested and progress is well ahead of normal wilson said 
in contrast the spring wheat crop is in bad shape with almost 
twothirds of the crop rated in poor to very poor condition due to 
the drought he said 
wheat reserves at the start of the year totaled 127 billion 
bushels well above the average of the last decade wilson said he 
said that amount plus winter wheat already in the bins from the 
current harvest add up to a 10month supply that includes wheat 
for export he said 
the greatest production loss is in durum wheat which is used 
for pasta he said the condition of hard red spring wheat also is 
generally poor but stocks equal to 80 percent of annual use are 
available he said 
turning to feed grains he said corn is generally in fair 
condition in 10 of the 17 major producing states 25 percent or 
more of the crop is rated poor or very poor he said 
in six of the 11 major sorghumproducing states at least 25 
percent of sorghum acreage is rated poor or very poor he said 
there are no weekly reports on the condition of oats and barley 
wilson said but he noted that more than half the nations barley 
and onethird of its oats come from the grain belt where the 
drought is worst 
nonetheless corn stocks on hand as of sept 1 are projected to 
equal 50 percent of annual use and sorghum stocks 90 percent of 
annual use wilson said corn supply should be ample to prevent any 
serious shortage 
even with a very pessimistic scenario you end up with a 
carryover of a billion bushels he said 
wilson said the soybean crop is generally rated fair to poor in 
11 of the 19 major producing states anywhere from onefourth to 
more than onehalf of the crop is rated poor or worse he said

jesse jackson is calling for a period of 
mourning for the victims of the us missile attack on an iranian 
jetliner and urging the united states to pay reparations to the 
victims families 
he also criticized vice president george bush for statements the 
likely republican nominee made this week in response to the deaths 
of 290 people in the downing of the iranian commercial jet 
i thought it was a bit in bad taste if not downright vulgar 
to be running around on july 4 getting applause lines talking 
about the honor of the navy as if it were in question and not 
expressing the profound sense of humanity that the american people 
have and our sense of sharing the grief of the tragedy jackson 
said at the united nations 
bush expressed his deep regrets on monday as he campaigned 
through the midwest saying obviously as we celebrate our great 
national holiday our hearts go out to the loved ones and families 
of those who were lost and also hearts go out to those kids 
those young americans who are defending freedom halfway around the 
world 
however bush also said he could identify with the captain of 
the navy cruiser who made the decision to fire because he believed 
his ship was in danger and bush said he did not believe us 
policy in the region would change as a result of the incident 
life goes on the vice president said 
jackson who met with arab leaders at the united nations 
emphasized that the downing of the iranian plane was an accident 
an error no one assumes that the navy is without compassion 
that it moved to engage in an act of war 
we should say to iran that we sincerely regret the accident 
occurred that we offer reparations or compensation to the families 
of the victims if they will accept them said jackson repeating 
a call he made over the holiday weekend in the wake of the incident 
at the un jackson met with envoys of the arab league 
including iraq djibouti mauritania sudan libya somalia syria 
yemen saudi arabia oman democratic yemen algeria morocco 
lebanon and qatar 
he repeated his plea for the release of us hostages and all 
other captives in lebanon 
jackson also said he favored a new international naval 
peacekeeping force in the gulf i hope the united nations will 
hav a much more prominent rule in the gulf in the future jackson 
said 
earlier when asked if he had any interest in becoming us 
ambassador to the united nations jackson replied none 
whatsoever

gov michael s dukakis who has been highly 
critical of the reagan adminsitrations deficit spending in his 
democratic presidential campaign has a deficit problem of his own 
two weeks before his certain selection as the democratic 
presidential nominee the massachusetts governor faces a 450 
million deficit on an 11 billion budget in the justended fiscal 
year and has yet to sign a budget for the new one 
and according to a new poll the massachusetts governors 
favorability rating is declining although residents of his home 
state still heavily favor him over republican george bush 
dukakis aides insist that the budget problems will be resolved 
in short order and that the governors homestate popularity will 
rebound 
but the bush campaign is already making the fiscal woes into a 
campaign issue 
it could turn out to be the achilles heel of the dukakis 
presidential campaign said state sen paul cellucci a 
massachusetts coordinator for the bush campaign 
the state governments new fiscal year began last friday and 
dukakis has yet to close a 450 million deficit for last year and 
still must shepherd a 1989 budget to his desk faced with an 
unexpected revenue shortfall the governor is scaling back his 
spending plans and pushing for a package of narrowly targeted tax 
and fee increases 
on wednesday dukakis was forced to ask the legislature for 81 
million in emergency spending authority to avoid having to renege 
on the state payroll and welfare checks the house approved the 
measure 
the putting together of budgets is not a pleasant process to 
watch never has been never will be said john devillars the 
governors deputy chief secretary there is obviously a great 
deal more attention to the process this year in part because of 
unanticipated events that have led to less revenue than expected 
and in part because the chief executive is running for national 
office 
according to a telephone survey last week of 400 likely 
massachusetts voters 56 percent said dukakis has not been an 
effective governor while campaigning for president and 47 percent 
said he should resign now or immediately after the democratic 
convention july 1821 
in addition the governors unfavorable rating has more than 
doubled to 36 percent since a similar poll in january 1987 
before dukakis declared his intention to run his favorable rating 
dropped from 71 percent to 55 percent 
still the survey said dukakis was favored over bush 51 percent 
to 37 percent the poll was conducted for wbztv and the boston 
herald by krc communications 
devillars said dukakis has devoted well over 100 hours in recent 
weeks to the states budget problems while at the same time 
focusing on the selection of a vice presidential running mate but 
he has not dominated the budget process as he has in past years 
based on june tax collections the government is technically 
about 450 million in deficit for fiscal 1988 according to 
legislative leaders dukakis has offered a 20point program to 
close that gap through bookkeeping changes and borrowing but the 
state house has balked at several unpopular features 
dukakis and his legislative allies argue that the deficit was 
the unforseeable result of a downturn in income tax receipts 
combined with 92 million in courtordered corporate tax abatements 
at the same time dukakis has been forced to retreat from the 
12 billion spending goal for fiscal 1989 that he announced in 
january and he has agreed with top democratic lawmakers to reduce 
the spending target 
a conference committee negotiated a compromise late wednesday of 
1175 billion which dukakis is expected to sign next week 
a principal sticking point has been nervousness about revenues 
for the coming year after five years of doubledigit revenue 
growth tax collections fell nearly flat last year nevertheless 
the administration projects a comeback in fiscal 1989 of 12 
percent a figure that many legislators question 
in order to buttress revenues dukakis has turned to taxes he 
recently signed a 40 million tax on cigarettes and more than 200 
million in other new taxes are moving toward his desk 
one would raise personal taxes on the wealthy by bringing the 
state code back into conformance with federal law another would 
end a corporate loophole that allows multistate companies to write 
off their outofstate losses and a third would capture some 24 
million a year in unclaimed bottle deposits that now stay in the 
hands of bottlers 
cellucci blames dukakis for overspending during his second term 
you cant have budgets that rise at twice the rate of 
inflation and add 10000 new state employees and not have a day of 
reckoning this is the day of reckoning that theyre trying to 
postpone until after november

president reagans pollster says ohio sen 
john glenn is far and away the strongest choice for the 
democratic vice presidential nomination 
richard wirthlin more accustomed to giving advice to 
republicans than to democrat michael dukakis told reporters at a 
luncheon wednesday that glenn would help dukakis play the 
patriotic theme in the general election campaign 
he contended the question of the republican vice presidential 
choice was less clear for vice president george bush 
among the prospects he cited were sen bob dole of kansas and 
his wife former transportation secretary elizabeth dole as well 
as gov jim thompson of illinois and former gov richard thornburgh 
of pennsylvania 
wirthlin who has done polling for reagan for more than 20 
years worked for dole during the kansas senators unsuccessful bid 
for the 1988 gop presidential nomination 
he said he thought dole would help bush in the midwest farm belt 
and among blue collar workers but he conceded that doles acerbic 
personality could be damaging if he went on the attack 
wirthlin also said he thought it would be a mistake to have 
president reagan on the stump attacking dukakis 
people do not approve of an incumbent president attacking a 
candidate trying to succeed him he said 
in addition he said reagan is not a good attack candidate 
wirthlin also said the resignation of attorney general edwin 
meese iii doesnt erase the sleaze factor for bush in the fall 
presidential campaign but makes it easier for him to deal with it 
during a luncheon session with reporters wirthlin said only 
about 3 percent of the voters he has surveyed cite ethics in 
government as the most important issue a figure that is no higher 
than a year earlier 
the issue that outstrips all others in importance in the minds 
of voters is drugs said the pollster 
there are now 21 percent who tag drugs as the single most 
important problem facing the nation he said no other issue was 
named by more than 10 percent of people interviewed 
while meese was under investigation by independent counsel james 
mckay bush was peppered with questions about whether he thought 
the attorney general should resign bush aides at one point 
described meese as a liability a description the vice 
president disavowed 
wirthlin said the departure of meese would put the ethics issue 
in a different context and would enable bush to talk about 
ethics without implicitly criticizing ed meese

when the democratic national convention opens 
here this month protesters from animal rights activists to aids 
victims will be on hand to try to grab a bit of the spotlight 
but convention organizers who carefully orchestrate many of the 
events inside the convention hall are also seeking to bring order 
to what could otherwise be a chaotic crush of demonstrations 
the city is supplying a stage across the street from the 
convention site that will serve as a soapbox for a variety of 
causes protesters are being offered twohour time slots over five 
days to air their views 
the city will provide a stage and sound equipment in the lot 
which authorities estimate can hold about 30000 people 
the demonstrators will be within sight and earshot of the 
delegates as they arrive and depart during the gathering july 1518 
however the plan is being challenged in federal court by a 
coalition of groups seeking expanded space for demonstrations a 
decision was possible as early as today 
generally potentially antagonistic groups have not been 
scheduled together although a gay rights group follows a white 
supremacist organization onto the stage one afternoon 
by wednesday 25 of the 40 slots were filled four of them by 
one organization the committee for fair elections at least four 
other groups with ties to that committee also have reserved time 
the group is the vehicle for the independent presidential 
campaign of leonora b fulani who says she will bring 10000 
backers to the convention she has qualified for the ballot in all 
50 states and is eligible for federal matching funds 
demonstrations coinciding with those on the stage supplied by 
the city will be permitted in the parking lot but their organizers 
cannot use powerful sound equipment 
local organizations with demonstration time include a 
neighborhood group that opposes the construction of a domed stadium 
in the neighborhood near the convention site 
the nationalist movement a mississippibased white supremacy 
group has been given a parade permit and a twohour slot on sunday 
afternoon in conjunction with its annual convention 
other groups given protest time in the parking lot include 
the committee on latin america a liberal washingtonbased

michael dukakis resuming his criticism of reagan 
administration ethical standards said the nation regained a 
measure of selfrespect through the resignation of attorney 
general edwin meese iii 
but he said meeses departure does not change the 
administrations record of ethical breaches 
the way to clean up washington is to clean out those people 
who are indifferent to breaches of the public trust and the public 
laws the democratic presidential nomineetobe told a friendly 
audience of greek americans on wednesday 
yesterday we lost an attorney general but we gained a measure 
of selfrespect he said 
dukakis the massachusetts governor was spending most of today 
in his statehouse office before heading west for three days of 
campaigning awaiting his review was a proposed fiscal 1989 budget 
compromise worked out wednesday evening by legislators 
passage of that plan would help dukakis at home where budget 
problems have prompted questions about his ability to govern while 
seeking the white house it would also make life easier for him on 
the campaign trail where he has used competent fiscal management 
as a selling point 
dukakis ended his day wednesday with a speech to the greek 
orthodox ecumenical congress the presumed republican nominee vice 
president george bush was to address the same group today 
next year if all goes well were going to have a president 
who will insist that those who accept the privilege of public 
service must understand the meaning of public service dukakis 
told the group if someone in my administration is caught 
breaking the law we wont make excuses for him well prosecute 
him 
before that appearance dukakis met for more than an hour with 20 
national civil rights leaders including naacp executive director 
benjamin hooks national urban league president john jacob the 
rev joseph lowery of the southern christian leadership conference 
and coretta scott king the widow of martin luther king jr 
several participants described the session as positive and more 
substantive than a meeting the same group had recently with bush 
i cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on hooks said 
whether blacks will support dukakis without jesse jackson on the 
ticket is largely up to jackson hooks said 
i think that they basically will follow though some will be 
disappointed will follow his leadership he said 
dukakis began his day by meeting with indiana rep lee hamilton 
the eighth potential running mate to meet facetoface with 
dukakis one of them georgia sen sam nunn took himself out of 
the running 
after a 50minute meeting with dukakis at the statehouse 
hamilton fired back a quick yes when asked if he would accept 
the vice presidential nomination 
hamilton said he had a very relaxed and wideranging 
discussion with dukakis with the main topics being the vice 
presidency and foreign policy 
others being considered for the no 2 spot on the ticket are 
jackson sens albert gore of tennessee john glenn of ohio lloyd 
bentsen of texas and bob graham of florida and rep richard 
gephardt of missouri 
paul brountas dukakis campaign chairman was in washington 
through friday gathering information on the contenders and talking 
with party leaders

hugh hefners former girlfriend has accused 
the playboy founder and celebrity divorce lawyer marvin mitchelson 
of supplying her with enough drugs to make her an addict 
hefner supplied me with almost every drug that i ever took 
in that house he had for about two years carrie leigh 24 told 
the television show entertainment tonight in a twopart 
interview beginning wednesday 
i was addicted to pills painkillers sleeping pills 
quaaludes and he had them under lock and key and he supplied me 
with these pills every day she said 
miss leigh filed a 35 million palimony suit against hefner 
earlier this year claiming he defrauded and deceived her by 
allegedly abandoning promises to support her and father a child 
she later dropped the lawsuit 
as the original palimony suit proved carrie leigh had a very 
vivid imagination and whatever she says should be viewed with a 
certain amount of skepticism hefner said wednesday 
i spent the last three years of the relationship trying to 
curb her abuse of both drugs and alcohol and she very well knows 
it he said of their fiveyear relationship that ended earlier 
this year please remember that i had a stroke in march 1985 that 
dramatically changed the focus of my life it ended my use of all 
recreational drugs 
in wednesdays segment miss leigh accused mitchelson who 
represented her in the palimony lawsuit of also supplying drugs 
and making a pass at her 
at the time when i started the lawsuit i was still addicted 
to some pills and he supplied me with them miss leigh said 
mitchelson who handled divorces of such celebrities as joan 
collins of dynasty is under investigation by the california 
state bar for alleged misconduct 
i completely deny all of the allegations i dont want to 
attack carrie leigh mitchelson told the television program 
she told me during the case i was a wonderful lawyer for the 
last 31 years ive never heard any criticisms like these until 
recently he said ive spent my life defending women not 
attacking them

michael dukakis was finding some relief from a politically 
embarrassing budget crisis in his home state as vice president 
george bush pledged to right a wrong that has been out there for 
many years and appoint a hispanic american to his cabinet 
dukakis the massachusetts governor was spending most of today 
in his statehouse office before heading west for three days of 
campaigning he was preparing to review a proposed fiscal 1989 
state budget compromise 
massachusetts house and senate leaders agreed late wednesday on 
a compromise budget of 1175 billion that would increase state 
spending by about 4 percent 
dukakis was forced to seek emergency spending authority this 
week to keep government functioning massachusetts faces a 450 
million deficit on an 11 billion budget in the justended fiscal 
year 
dukakis has been highly critical of the reagan administrations 
deficit spending and republicans are planning to make political 
hay of his troubles 
it could turn out to be the achilles heel of the dukakis 
presidential campaign said state sen paul cellucci a 
massachusetts coordinator for the bush campaign 
dukakis for his part continued to attack the ethical standards 
of the reagan administration saying the resignation of attorney 
general edwin meese iii does not erase the administrations shoddy 
record 
if someone in my administration is caught breaking the law we 
wont make excuses for him well prosecute him he told a 
friendly audience of greek americans in boston 
bush was traveling to boston tonight to address the same ethnic 
group at a greek orthodox diocesan dinner aides said bush was 
going to talk about the importance of religion 
dukakis was traveling to dallas tonight to address a convention 
of the league of united latin american citizens the same group to 
whom bush promised wednesday he would make a hispanic appointment 
bush said after addressing lulac the largest and oldest 
hispanic american civic group that he would not go around the 
country making the same promise to other special interest groups 
other groups have been represented in the cabinet and 
hispanics have not said bush 
i will be very openminded and broadbased in who i select to 
serve in my cabinet but im addressing myself to righting a wrong 
that has been out there for many years he said 
oscar moran the groups president said bush attracted the 
attention of some voters who already decided on dukakis 
but tony bonilla an influential democrat in the group said it 
was a little patronizing for bush to make such a statement 
after serving eight years in the reagan administration without a 
hispanic in the inner circle 
hispanics are a politically important group especially in key 
battleground states like texas california and florida dukakis 
command of spanish gives him an advantage in competing for votes 
from those groups 
dukakis met for more than an hour wednesday with 20 national 
civil rights leaders including naacp executive director benjamin 
hooks national urban league president john jacob the rev joseph 
lowery of the southern christian leadership conference and coretta 
scott king the widow of martin luther king jr 
i cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on hooks 
said but whether blacks will support dukakis without jesse jackson 
on the ticket is largely up to jackson hooks said 
jackson meanwhile met with arab leaders at the united nations 
afterward he emphasized that the shooting down of an iranian 
passenger jet by a us ship in the persian gulf was an accident 
an error 
jackson called for a period of mourning for the victims of the 
attack and urged the united states to pay reparations to the 
victims families

public television and cable channels are hoping 
to lure away network viewers as the lengthy writers strike wears 
on delaying the fall season for the networks and the debut of new 
series 
i must say i have mixed emotions about the strike because 
i hate to think about all those writers out of work so its 
nothing to jump up and down about on the other hand i think it 
will help us quite a bit said suzanne weil senior vice 
president of national programming and promotion services for the 
public broadcasting service 
the strike which began march 7 has forced the three major 
television networks to delay the traditional fall season when they 
launch new series the guild rejected the most recent management 
offer last month it voted wednesday night on a model contract for 
independent producers results were to be announced this afternoon 
when the strike ends it will take weeks for producers to 
prepare new shows 
nbc is considering buying programs from the british broadcasting 
co or reshooting old tv shows with different actors to avoid 
reruns its the cosby show will continue in production under an 
independent contract and it has the summer olympics in september 
cbs is considering buying bbc shows abc plans to run the first 18 
hours of its 30hour miniseries war and remembrance in november 
instead of february 
pbs is immune from the strike because its programs are produced 
under a separate contract with the guild and it also buys british 
programming 
cable channels that produce firstrun programming are affected 
by the strike though in most cases the effect hasnt been noticed 
yet 
some firstrun cable series such as showtimes brothers 
are at a standstill just like network shows madeforcable movies 
for this fall were already written and will go on as scheduled but 
the strike had delayed development for next year 
in the meantime cable hopes its documentaries musical specials 
and madeforcable movies that go on this fall as scheduled will 
lure over some network viewers 
cable and pbs traditionally pick up viewers during the summer 
when the networks are in reruns and see a possibility of the 
seasonal advantage continuing into the fall 
for the networks the loss of viewers this fall could mean 
increased audience erosion in favor of cable alternatives and 
videocassettes 
i think any time the cable networks can inch away a little 
more viewership some of the viewership will remain on cable in a 
longer term said andy orgel senior vice president of 
programming for the arts amp entertainment network which hopes to 
lure new viewers with sophisticated programming alternatives this 
fall 
at the end of the 198788 television season most major cable 
channels increased viewership hbo for example increased 5 
percent while overall network audience levels dropped 9 percent 
some of the drop is attributed to a change in ac nielsens 
ratings technology but the networks agree there is a decrease in 
network viewing 
public television already staggers its series to attract viewers 
to alternative programming when network shows are repeats for 
instance alive from off center an avantgarde variety series 
starts its new season on pbs next week 
weil said pbs is not concerned about potential competition if 
the networks buy bbc shows she says most americans are unaware 
there is plenty of mediocre british television they dont usually 
see but she said if an infusion of foreign product helps raise the 
level of us television thats fine too 
i never worry about somebody nibbling away at our turf 
because i think we should always be moving ahead she said 
its going to be a long time before the networks get to alive 
from off center

a combination of viewers away from their 
televisions and writers away from their desks handed abc its lowest 
primetime rating ever last week according to figures from the 
ac nielsen co 
the fourth of july weekend is traditionally a period of low 
viewing for the networks but the strike by the writers guild of 
america forced some programs into early reruns and that helped 
lower abcs average to 80 said alan wurtzel vice president for 
marketing and research 
its not only just summer doldrums but also the fact that the 
writers strike has really affected what people are able to see 
he said we went into a rerun mode earlier than we would have 
weve been playing reruns now for an awful long time 
believe me its not a number anybody is happy about its 
just another reason strikes dont benefit anybody 
for the week ending july 3 abc had a rating of 80 nbc won the 
week with an 117 cbs was second with a 96 the lowest previous 
rating for abc was 87 two weeks ago and in july 1985 
the rating is a percentage of the nations estimated 886 
million households with televisions 
nbcs firstrun tv movie nightingales was the toprated show 
of the week and seemingly would have been off to a good start as a 
summer series but there are no more episodes of the aaron 
spellingproduced show because of the strike according to nbc 
the fourmonthlong strike has delayed the networks fall 
season nbc maintains however that the current low viewing levels 
are typical of summer rerun programming and do not reflect effects 
of the strike at least not yet 
as a comparison of how low ratings have fallen the cosby 
show the no 1 show last season had an seasonlong average 
rating of 280 compared to 189 for nightingales the no 1 
show last week 
the rest of the top 10 shows all reruns were night court 
cheers the cosby show a different world la 
law golden girls and alf all nbc whos the boss 
on abc and nbcs the hogan family 
abcs firstrun summer series hothouse premiered to a lowly 
64 rating and was in 60th place 
the lowestrated primetime shows of the week were high 
mountain rangers starspangled celebration hothouse 
sledge hammer cbs summer playhouse charmings special 
hotel spot marks the x macgyver rags to riches

cbs remained in first place in the close news race finishing 
the week ending july 1 with an average rating of 91 and a share of 
20 nbc was second with a rating of 88 and a 20 share abc had an 
84 and 19 share 
the share is a percentage of sets in use

soviet authorities acknowledge that paratroopers 
crushed a protest by thousands of people who shut down a major 
airport in armenia but they deny activists claims that soldiers 
killed as many as five protesters 
the activists pushing for annexation of a predominantly 
armenian region of the neighboring republic of azerbaijan charged 
wednesday that red army troops killed demonstrators at the airport 
in yerevan the armenian capital 
the latest round of protests began monday with a general strike 
and intensified tuesday night with the airport clash officials and 
armenian activists said 
on wednesday the situation did not appear to be stabilizing 
the evening television news program vremya said hundreds of 
thousands of armenians thronged yerevans streets as the strike 
continued 
the government daily izvestia said mass transit was still shut 
down and the situation had worsened since tuesday when 26 
factories and economic agencies in the southern republic were idled 
since february yerevan has been the scene of massive 
demonstrations by armenians demanding annexation of the 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan until now the protests had 
reportedly been peaceful 
on wednesday foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev told a 
news conference the rumors that armenians were killed are 
groundless 
but he acknowledged that soviet troops late tuesday routed about 
2000 people from in and around the zvartnots airport he said 36 
people had to seek medical assistance after the clash 
on wednesday the communist party daily pravda said that during 
a tuesday rally in yerevans theater square someone began calling 
for a blockade of the airport and a large column of people headed 
toward it on foot 
pravda said planes were allowed to land but demonstrators 
grossly disrupted order and prevented them from taking off 
again hundreds of passengers were stranded it said 
vremya said 3000 people took part in the protest and 60 
flights were grounded along with 14000 passengers 
perfilyev said about 400 people occupied the airports terminal 
another 1500 gathered outside according to the official tass news 
agency 
the demonstrators impeded the sale of tickets and the collection 
of luggage entered the landing strip and stopped passengers from 
coming into the terminal perfilyev said 
security troops then moved in to evict the protesters who began 
hurling rocks and bottles and thats when the 36 casualties 
occurred he said 
in moscow armenian activists said witnesses had telephoned them 
from yerevan to say army troops carrying machine guns and backed by 
tanks had begun firing without warning on the protesters 
all of a sudden they started shooting artist kuryun g 
nagapetyan told about 50 people who gathered for a rally outside 
moscows redbrick armenian church they were carrying clubs 
like policemen in the west and they beat people right and left 
three students were killed he said and 37 people reportedly 
were hospitalized 
alexei mananikov an editor of the unofficial moscow journal 
glasnost said at least one man was killed and as many as 40 people 
wounded by soldiers at the airport 
lev g gambaryan another armenian who lives in moscow told 
the rally that two children ages 6 and 10 had also died of 
gunshot wounds 
but he and nagapetyan said it was not certain whether the two 
reported deaths were new or among the three previously reported 
ethnic armenians make up the majority in nagornokarabakh they 
have long been demanding that the mountainous region be transfered 
to armenia 
armenia supports the demand but azerbaijan has rejected it and 
the issue has gone to officials in moscow 
in february rioting in the azerbaijani city of sumgait left 
dead 32 people 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis 
on tuesday newspapers reported that a general strike began in 
yerevan following a large meeting sunday on the citys main square 
the meeting sunday was with delegates who had attended last 
weeks communist party conference in moscow 
apparently dissatisfied with the armenian delegations 
presentation of the nagornokarabakh dispute activists called a 
strike

opposition candidates accused the government 
of fraud in presidential elections wednesday and met jointly with 
federal officials to protest a journalist reported that an 
8yearold boy voted in one town 
there appeared to be little doubt however that carlos salinas 
de gortari of the governing institutional revolutionary party 
would win a sixyear term as president in an unbroken tradition 
dating to 1929 
official returns were not expected before sunday 
salinas de gortaris most visible opponent cuauhtemoc cardenas 
of the leftist coalition national democratic front told a news 
conference the government is intending to have a fraud 
we have begun to receive information nationwide that is not 
favorable for the government party he said before leaving for 
his meeting with manuel j clouthier of the conservative national 
action party and rosario ibarra de piedra of the radical 
revolutionary workers party 
the three scheduled a news conference after their meeting with 
interior secretary manuel bartlett 
i want to tell you that all of these irregular acts all of 
these repeated acts throughout the country have created a 
situation of irregularity cardenas said 
the party in power known as the pri has won every presidential 
election since its founding in 1929 and has controlled the congress 
and governorships in all 31 states 
juan enriquez salinas de gortaris spokesman said in an 
intervew that any incident of fraud has been less than one tenth 
of one percent of polling booths and were very pleased 
this has been a peaceful election in which the vote has been 
respected he said 
this year a clear deterioration of the pris influence was 
evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by cardenas and clouthier 
in addition to president voters will elect 500 members of the 
chamber of deputies to threeyear terms and 64 senators to sixyear 
terms 
all of the countrys nearly 55000 voting places closed by 6 
pm 8 pm edt except for those where people were still lined up 
to vote 
the federal election commission which supervises the balloting 
said it received more than 50 complaints of voting irregularities 
most of them minor from political parties complaints ranged from 
missing ballots to a sailor who tried to vote repeatedly at 
different polls in the port of acapulco 
the most flagrant incidents of purported fraud were reported in 
salinas de gortaris adopted home town of agualeguas about 80 
miles north of monterrey near the us border 
petra hernandez a reporter for the monterrey daily el norte 
said election officials let a lot of people vote for the whole 
family they voted for their wife their kids their mom who 
couldnt come 
she said her paper had a picture of an 8yearold boy who voted 
with his fathers voting card 
although opposition parties by law are allowed to have 
representatives at each polling place ms hernandez said only pri 
representatives were at the towns three precincts 
the president of one precinct also was filling out ballots i 
saw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes she said 
she said that when voters unfamiliar with the process would ask 
the president of the precinct how to vote he said just take 
the ballots and mark where it says pri 
presidents of precincts are appointed by the government and are 
always from pri 
pri officials said they doubted the reports of fraud in 
agualeguas it was a very peaceful vote obviously with a 
preference for salinas said enriquez 
almost all industry and commerce in mexico closed for the day 
traffic on normally bustling city streets was light 
the commission issued no immediate figures on turnout among the 
38 million eligible voters but long lines were reported at polling 
stations in major cities and towns 
outgoing president miguel de la madrid voted at a school across 
from the presidential residence in mexico city his term expires 
dec 1 and under the constitution he cannot be reelected 
de la madrid won 70 percent of the vote in 1982 the victory 
margin was not expected to be as wide for his likely successor 
salinas de gortari 
clouthiers conservative national action party and cardenas 
national democratic front coalition have weakened the pris popular 
support 
clouthier cardenas and ibarra de piedra signed an agreement 
last week to fight fraud and pledged to challenge the results if 
tampering was suspected 
on saturday assassins with shotguns killed francisco xavier 
ovando a longtime cardenas collaborator and strategist in his 
campaign and an ovando aid 
police said tuesday the shootings were not politically 
motivated they said ovando was killed in revenge for fighting 
organized crime while serving as michoacan attorney general when 
cardenas was governor of the state 
cardenas called the slayings a provocation and said it 
showed how far some of the most reactionary sectors within the 
pri will go he did not identify any group 
the 54yearold cardenas ran on a platform of renewed 
nationalism and was aided by the affection mexicans still feel for 
his father the late president lazaro cardenas 
salinas de gortari a 40yearold harvardeducated economist 
was handicapped by having been de la madrids budget director and 
author of his economic austerity program he has pledged to 
modernize the countrys economic and political systems 
clouthier a wealthy 54yearold rancher and businessman from 
northwestern sinaloa state said he would return even more 
stateowned companies to the private sector and ask farmers if they 
want the current system of cooperative farms or private property

a forest fire that consumed more than 4000 acres of timber in 
south dakotas custer state park burned to within 4 miles of mount 
rushmore late wednesday forcing the evacuation of hundreds of 
people over 40 square miles 
the evacuation which involved 600 people earlier wednesday was 
broadened when the fire burned across the parks northern boundary 
wednesday night and entered black hills national forest site of 
the granite memorial to four presidents 
gov george mickelson said it was likely the fire would get 
worse 
it makes you just sick to see the damage thats being done 
he said after touring the area by helicopter 
afternoon winds hampered efforts to douse a 1500acre fire in 
the bridgerteton national forest in wyoming but crews in the 
shoshone national forest to the north were controlling the way a 
1650acre fire was burning 
three other fires in wyoming covered about 1900 acres of 
backcountry in yellowstone national park while firefighters 
battled 850acre blazes in both a utah park and a southern 
california forest 
the three other wyoming fires one of which covered 1800 acres 
in the northwestern corner of the park were set by lightning 
strikes park crews were allowing them to burn because the fires 
were not threatening any structures 
extremely dry conditions in custer state park were contributing 
to the spread of the south dakota fire which authorities believe 
was started by lightning monday night 
firefighters had difficulty building a fire line because the 
blaze was burning in a very steep rocky area fire spokesman jerry 
hagen said planes were dropping fireretardant chemicals once an 
hour but hagen said the fire was nowhere near being contained 
the fire earlier was estimated at 6000 acres but hagen said 
thick smoke made that number faulty and it was revised to 4000 
acres 
about 125 people living around mount rushmore national memorial 
were told to leave their homes late wednesday night as a 
precaution said custer county sheriff vernon sprague 
officials also advised residents of keystone about two miles 
from mount rushmore to go to a red cross shelter in rapid city or 
an armory in custer although keystone only has about 300 
residents officials said up to 2000 people might be in the area 
because its the height of the tourist season 
hagen said the 40squaremile area area evacuated was mainly 
national forest land but added it looks to me like theres some 
private land some homes and some mining claims 
one firefighter was hurt but his injury was not believed 
serious hagen said 
smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air with the plume 
visible in rapid city 25 miles away a haze from the smoke hung 
over a large part of western south dakota and was visible from 
pierre 160 miles away 
all entrances to the park were closed wednesday and 600 people 
were evacuated authorities said no structures had burned but 
buildings were not considered safe 
the fire had been burning toward the northeast but switched to 
the northwest wednesday and was 78 miles south of mount rushmore 
national memorial 
mickelson declared an emergency releasing state resources to 
fight the blaze and planned to view the fire by helicopter said 
his press secretary 
in wyoming gusting winds that spread the fire in the 
bridgerteton forest tuesday built again wednesday afternoon 
threatening crews hopes of containing the blaze by evening said 
forest spokesman fred kingwill 
a volunteer firefighter was taken to the salt lake city burn 
center with serious burns on his hands arms and chest kingwill 
said 
the fire burning in sagebrush juniper and aspen groves near 
the southern end of fremont lake was sparked by fourth of july 
revelers the forest service said 
in the shoshone national forest fire commander tut anderson 
said the fire now is responding to our management as opposed to 
us responding to the fire behavior the blaze was touched off by 
lightning almost two weeks ago 
in utahs zion national park firefighters carved fire lines 
around half a blaze that blackened heavy oak and manzanita brush 
and ponderosa pine officials said 
about 120 firefighters were battling the lightningcaused blaze 
and another 80 were standing by said park superintendent harry 
grafe 
the fire began june 19 and was allowed to burn in a small area 
until sunday when winds up to 60 mph spread the flames said chief 
ranger bob andrew 
winds eased to 10 mph wednesday and andrew said fire bosses 
predicted they would contain the blaze by thursday evening 
no injuries or property damage were reported 
another southern utah fire broke out and consumed about 3000 
acres by late wednesday on bureau of land management and private 
land about 3 miles north of beryl fire dispatcher wayne hunt 
said the cause was undetermined 
about 290 firefighters as well as air tankers battled a brush 
fire in los padres national forest near san luis obispo in southern 
california authorities said 
temperatures were in the 90s humidity was low and moderate 
winds of 5 mph to 15 mph fanned the blaze but no structures were 
threatened said juanita freel a forest spokeswoman 
the cause of the blaze which broke out tuesday afternoon was 
undetermined 
in kentucky state forestry officials responded to 26 fires on 
567 acres tuesday spokesman townley bergmann said at least three

president lee tenghui opened a key 
congress of the ruling nationalist party today with a cautious 
promise of more democratic change and tough talk on rival communist 
china 
the landmark meeting began at a suburban taipei sports stadium 
packed with more than 10000 people 
behind the podium hung three huge portraits of the 94yearold 
partys three previous leaders sun yatsen chiang kaishek and 
his son chiang chingkuo who died in january 
the congress the partys 13th is the first in which delegates 
were not handpicked by top party officials and in which a central 
committee election was not restricted to candidates proposed by the 
party leader 
it comes at a time of increasing political liberalization in 
taiwan a nation slowly emerging from its authoritarian past 
the congress 1209 delegates are expected to elevate a new 
generation of party leaders to replace aging conservatives who came 
from the mainland with chiang kaishek after the communists forced 
the nationalists from mainland china in 1949 
an overhaul of the cabinet also is expected after the congress 
with speculation centering on the fate of 74yearold premier yu 
kuohwa who is viewed as the leading conservative 
lee the acting party chairman since chiangs death said in his 
speech that the nationalists should accelerate the implementation 
of the reforms initiated by late chairman chiang chingkuo with an 
even more active and responsible attitude 
but he cautioned that extremism and violence are the greatest 
enemies of democracy an apparent reference to recent street 
demonstrations for accelerated political change those protests 
have occasionally turned violent 
in his final years chiang chingkuo ended taiwans 38yearold 
martial law tolerated the formation of opposition parties opened 
the door to unofficial contact with rival communist china and 
relaxed controls on the press 
in cautiously pushing more reform lees speech appeared 
tailored to placate both aging nationalist conservatives some of 
whom may step down during the congress and younger party members 
who support more political social and economic liberalization 
winston chang a party delegate described lee as a man of 
tolerance with elements of a good party leader indeed lee is 
expected to be named the partys permanent chairman on friday 
he accepts different opinions and absorbs them said chang 
an illegitimate son of chiang chingkuo who took his mothers 
surname 
lee spent much of his 30minute speech reiterating taiwans 
hardline policy of no official contacts with the chinese communists 
both the nationalists or kuomintang and communists claim to be 
the rightful ruler of mainland china and taiwan 
lee accused beijing of having blind ambition to destroy the 
nationalist government we have no illusions about the chinese 
communist regime and will make no compromise of any kind with 
them 
the nationalists have rejected beijings call for reunification 
under a one country two systems policy in which taiwan could 
retain its capitalist economy 
unofficial contact between the two sides has increased recently 
particularly with chiang chingkuos decision last year to end a 
ban on travel to the mainland to allow family reunions 
indirect trade also has increased and many businessmen are 
seeking permission to invest and trade directly with chinas 1 
billion people 
the future china policy of this nation of about 20 million 
people is expected to be a hot topic at the congress with some 
delegates pushing for increased trade and exchanges

holding enough votes this time to override a 
veto democrats are forcing a second electionyear showdown with 
president reagan over giving workers advance notice of plant 
closings and large layoffs 
on a 7223 vote wednesday the senate passed a bill requiring 
companies to give 60 days notice before shutting down any 
operation or instituting a layoff affecting more than 50 people or 
a third of the work force 
president reagan cited the mandated notices as his primary 
reason for vetoing a massive overhaul of the nations trade laws 
two months ago saying advance notices would reduce us 
competitiveness and stifle new job creation 
but with polls showing more than 80 percent voter support for 
the measure and democrats using the issue to attack the economic 
policies of reagan and vice president george bush 19 republicans 
including seven up for reelection broke with the white house on 
wednesdays vote 
wednesdays vote was the biggest legislative victory for 
organized labor since it helped return the senate to democratic 
control in the 1986 election after republicans held the majority 
the first six years of reagans presidency 
just nine senate republicans supported the mandatory notices a 
year ago when they were made a part of the trade bill and only 10 
broke ranks last month when the senate on a 6137 vote fell five 
votes short of the necessary twothirds for overriding reagans 
veto 
im certain that its going to become law lamented sen 
phil gramm rtexas a leading opponent of the notice bill the 
tragedy is that were doing this all because of politics 
a white house official said after the vote that reagan has not 
stated definitely that he will veto it the official speaking on 
the condition of anonymity said the presidents advisers were 
divided on the issue even though the administration put out a 
statement prior to the vote saying they would urge him to veto it 
i dont know what the presidents going to do when he gets 
this bill said senate minority leader bob dole rkan who 
complained earlier about labor leaders wielding a lot of clout in 
this body 
both supporters and opponents of the legislation raised the 
possibility that reagan might allow the bill to become law after 
the expected house approval without signing it under the 
constitution a president has only 10 working days to veto a bill 
after passage by both houses 
i would hope that the president would see there are sufficient 
votes to override a veto and that will mean that he wont veto 
it said sen howard metzenbaum dohio the bills chief author 
had the measure been law the past two years more than 800000 
workers who were laid off each year in 1986 and 1987 would have 
received advance notices he said 
a 1985 study by the bureau of labor statistics showed that more 
than half the 22 million workers caught up in mass layoffs 
annually received one days notice or less before losing their jobs 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said the 
senatepassed bill will be taken up in the house early next week 
to be followed immediately by house action on a revised trade bill 
that doesnt include the plantclosing notices 
the house has never voted on the plantclosing issue itself but 
its 308113 vote in may to override reagans veto of the trade bill 
is viewed as assuring vetoproof passage there as well 
the aflcio made the layoff notices its top legislative priority 
the past two years and vowed to withdraw its pivotal support for 
any trade legislation desired by major business groups if the 
measure were not included or enacted separately 
aflcio president lane kirkland called wednesdays vote margin 
overwhelming and a welcome message for american workers 
gop opponents won a minor political skirmish along the way they 
stalled the vote for two weeks effectively denying democrats a 
chance to override a reagan veto before the democratic national 
convention in atlanta 
a year ago the mandatory notices were opposed by four democrats 
and 36 republicans the four democrats dale bumpers and david 
pryor of arkansas david boren of oklahoma and fritz hollings of 
south carolina had all switched sides by the time of the vote 
last month on overriding reagans veto 
so had five republicans three of them up for reelection this 
year john chafee of rhode island john danforth of missouri and 
william roth of delaware 
by wednesdays vote another seven republicans switched sides 
david karnes of nebraska nancy kassebaum of kansas bob kasten of 
wisconsin john mccain of arizona alan simpson of wyoming and john 
warner of virginia of that group only karnes is up for election 
this year

outperformed their foreign rivals last year in reducing labor costs 
and making their goods more competitive on world markets 
measured in devalued american dollars labor costs in the united 
states declined 15 percent in 1987 compared with increases of 75 
percent in south korea 77 percent in canada 135 percent in 
japan and 239 percent in west germany the labor department said 
wednesday 
but even before the dramatic devaluation of the dollar against 
major european and asian currencies the united states outperformed 
all but japan in keeping a lid on labor costs 
measured by their own currency the yen japanese manufacturers 
reduced their labor costs by 25 percent excluding france labor 
costs rose for nine other major industrial powers 
clearly theres a definite improvement in out competitiveness 
visavis our trading partners said allen sinai chief economist 
for the boston co a new york consulting house but we still 
have a long way to go to restore the competitiveness we lost over 
the past decade 
the government data showed that labor costs measured in 
american dollars rose an average 33 percent annually from 1979 
through 1985 while falling 23 percent in japan 18 percent in 
korea 48 percent in west germany and 24 percent in great britain 
wage increases in the united states averaging 69 percent 
annually those years also outpaced the gains enjoyed by workers in 
all of the other countries when measured in dollars 
us manufacturers however held hourly wage and benefit 
increases last year to just 13 percent the lowest of any of the 
industrial powers according to the government data 
japan was close with wage and benefit increases averaging 14 
percent but wages rose 4 percent in west germany and 45 percent 
in canada while soaring 82 percent in great britain 
but with civilian unemployment in the united states now hovering 
in the range of 5 percent sinai noted that wage increases have 
been escalating rapidly the past two months 
that suggests that our labor costs are rising at the same time 
that the dollar has quit falling sinai said this year we will 
not repeat the experience of last year 
for one thing he said declines in the industrial sectors of 
japan great britain and west germany have all bottomed out and 
they are begining to enjoy the same rebound in manufacturing that 
the united states has experienced in the past year 
the labor department figures in fact showed that manufacturing 
growth last year was slower in the united states than in canada 
korea italy and great britain 
us productivity improvements at 28 percent also were smaller 
than 4 percent gains of japan france and italy 7 percent increase 
in great britain and nearly 8 percent improvement in norway 
while five of the nine countries had larger 1987 productivity 
increases than the united states only great britain and norway 
exceeded the us rate of improvement over the past two years the 
government said 
however only the united states and canada experienced any 
employment growth in manufacturing last year the us increase was 
only onehalf of 1 percent but it reversed two straight years of 
declines 
factory jobs remained about the same in germany and sweden and 
fell by 1 percent to 25 percent in the other countries 
for france 1987 was the 13th consecutive year of manufacturing 
employment declines and in great britain factory jobs have been 
falling in number for the past 10 years

an energy department report favors building a 
new reactor in south carolina over converting a mothballed one in 
washington state to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials for 
the nations nuclear weapons 
the departments existing production reactors are located at the 
savannah river complex near aiken sc but all of them presently 
are shut down 
the report found that construction of a new heavywater reactor 
at savannah river would result in a plant based on reliable 
technology and located in a setting with years of experience in 
producing and handling tritium a key element in nuclear bombs 
the heavywater reactor appears to have the best chance of 
quickly providing the needed capacity because of existing 
facilities personnel and experiences at savannah river the 
report said 
the report said that while conversion of the mothballed 
washington public power supply system nuclear plant at the hanford 
reservation offered some unique opportunities both legal and 
technical uncertainties presented serious drawbacks 
although the report conceded that conversion of the wppss plant 
may not take as long to complete or cost as much at least 
initially as other options it cited other problems 
there are risks because of the need to demonstrate an adequate 
target technology uncertainties of public acceptance of conversion 
to defense purposes and possible delays because of the legal 
process required to acquire the wppss facility the report said 
the commercial reactor was more than 60 percent complete when 
mothballed in 1982 as wppss the construction arm of public 
utilities in washington state ran into financial difficulties and 
questions were raised about whether the electricity the plant would 
produce would be needed 
the energy research advisory board report was released by 
washington democratic sen brock adams a leading opponent of 
converting the wppss plant and other northwest congressional 
offices 
ive said all along that conversion is the wrong option and 
should not be pursued said adams this report reaches the same 
conclusion 
one of the savannah river production reactors is undergoing 
extensive work to fortify it against earthquakes another has been 
closed for the summer because its discharge is too warm to comply 
with state water quality regulations and the third is undergoing 
routine maintenance

soviet exchange students spending the 
summer at picturesque dartmouth college made their first official 
excursion off campus to a dump a metal recycling operation and a 
trash incinerator 
not exactly the kind of trip you would write home about unless 
you were majoring in environmental studies which they are so the 
garbage bags piles of tires crushed cars and discarded wood were 
just want they wanted to see 
welcome to the city of lebanon landfill dump superintendent 
alfred besaw said wednesday as the students gathered close to hear 
how his operation works 
some took notes others took photos of news photographers taking 
photos of them and one consulted a russianamerican dictionary 
before asking a question about the trash 
the 16 soviet students have been in new hampshire since late 
june part of an exchange in which 16 americans mostly from 
dartmouth spent about six weeks at moscow state university the 
students major in areas including chemistry molecular biology and 
biophysics 
most have completed four years of their fiveyear college 
studies and will likely be scientists teachers and researchers in 
the soviet union which is trying to deal with the same 
environmental problems plaguing the united states water and air 
pollution acid rain hazardous waste and trash disposal 
the outing to the dump and signal environmental systems 
refusetoenergy plant in claremont was the first time the students 
met reporters which meant interviews atop claycovered mounds of 
trash next to cans of discarded copper tubing or next to a garbage 
truck being weighed before dumping its load at the incinerator 
they drove from the hot dusty dump to an adjacent hotter and 
dustier metal recycling area where a shirtless fred janci of janci 
metal and recycling explained his business 
dimitrij kavtaradze a moscow state professor teaching at 
dartmouth this year picked up a horseshoe this is the best 
souvenir from america good luck and asked janci if he could 
keep it 
janci said yes 
after seeing how trash is buried or prepared for reuse it was 
off to the incinerator to learn about another way to dispose of 
refuse burning again taking pictures and notes 
professor burdin konstantin also from moscow state said the 
main purpose of the visit is to learn how the united states deals 
with environmental problems 
the main thing is to see what kinds of problems are in the 
united states and how do you solve these problems konstantin 
said 
the united states he said is on the frontier of dealing 
with environmental problems the american experience he said 
should help soviets struggling with the same problems especially 
with questions of balancing growth with the environment and even 
with citizen opposition to construction projects such as a sewer 
proposal that prompted protest near moscow 
and the exchange experience may help his students understand 
more about america 
we should understand people we should understand problems we 
cannot separate problems and people he said in some ways its 
people diplomacy 
some of the students talked about their first impressions of the 
united states saying they were impressed with the highways and 
friendly people 
they are very friendly people said olga divovich of moscow 
they often smile at us and its very pleasant for us

president roh taewoo today announced 
a sixpoint plan to ease 40 years of bitter confrontation with 
communist north korea and clear the way for peaceful reunification 
of the divided peninsula 
in a nationally televised speech the president called for broad 
trade humanitarian cultural and political contacts with the north 
to normalize relations and end the struggle for supremacy 
i believe we have now come to a historic moment when we should 
be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting peace and 
unification on the korean peninsula roh said 
he called for an end to international rivalry between the two 
koreas in foreign diplomacy saying the two nations should work 
together instead of competing for international backing and trying 
to isolate each other 
we hope to bring an end to counterproductive diplomacy 
characterized by competition and confrontation between the south 
and the north we also hope that representatives of south and 
north korea will contact each other freely in international 
forums he said 
the six points most of which had already been mentioned by roh 
in recent weeks were similar or identical to proposals made by 
other south korean governments since 1972 
rohs proposals did not go as far as a call by president chun 
doohwan for a meeting with north korean president kim il sung in 
1981 that never took place roh said more measures would be taken 
if north korea will positively respond to the measures outlined 
in a separate development the south korean defense ministry 
warned today that the north is inevitably expected to provoke war 
if the opportunity arises and had not given up its plans to 
conquer the south 
a group of newspaper editors were told at a ministry briefing 
that the north continues to mass its forces on the border for a 
possible lightning strike the ministry routinely makes such 
warnings but it was not clear why the briefing was held the same 
day as rohs speech 
south and north korea have no relations and technically remain 
at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the korean 
war in 1953 the border is closed there are no communications or 
transport links and both governments refuse to recognize each other 
the prowestern capitalist south is emerging as a major economic 
power while the communist north is one of the worlds most 
repressive and isolated nations 
there was no immediate response from the north but unification 
is not seen as possible under existing conditions with both koreas 
refusing to abandon their rival political systems 
south koreas main opposition parties which have been pressing 
the government to move ahead on unification cautiously welcomed 
rohs proposal as a forward looking step 
roh said the south would no longer try to stop nations it has 
ties with from trading with the north provided that it does not 
involve military goods 
he also said seoul would help the north establish relations with 
south koreas allies including the united states and japan south 
korea would continue to seek relations with the norths allies 
principally the soviet union and china he said 
south and north korea have been bitter opponents since their 
creations in 1948 after us and soviet troops divided the korean 
peninsula at the end of world war ii 
the communist north invaded the south in 1950 to start the 
korean war 
unification has become a major issue in the south in recent 
months with radical and dissident groups pushing for quick action 
to reunite the peninsula the roh government caught off guard on 
the issue has been trying to recapture the political iniative 
past attempts at improving relations between the two countries 
resulted in a few exchange and cultural visits and talks on a 
variety of issues but the talks always collapsed before making 
substantial progress 
the last talks between the two koreas collapsed in 1986 after 
the north protested joint south koreanus military exercises the 
united states has about 42000 troops in the south under a mutual 
defense treaty

a lawsuit accusing a top defense 
contractor of charging the government for everything from building 
a private plane to typing the bible into a computer could open the 
way for fraud investigations into topsecret projects a watchdog 
group says 
what we have is a little wedge into the black world 
projects so secret they often dont appear on the defense budget 
said dina rasor head of the washingtonbased project on military 
procurement 
it shows you can expose fraud and waste in a black program 
without divulging sensitive information she said 
rasor spoke at a news conference wednesday to unseal the lawsuit 
alleging fraud and overcharging against lockheed missiles amp space 
co the leading defense contractor in californias hightech 
silicon valley 
the lawsuit filed in us district court by a former and a 
current employee claims lockheed workers while waiting months for 
security clearances goofed off ran profitable businesses ran a 
football pool and even built a private plane all at government 
expense 
if proved the charges could result in suspension of defense 
contracts 
the alleged violations at one california plant cost the 
government more than 10 million but that figure could go higher 
the plaintiffs attorney said 
we expect additional people are going to step forward and 
describe additional examples of fraud at lockheed said oakland 
lawyer guy t saperstein 
lockheed the plaintiffs also charged told employees to bill 
various government contracts for 40 hours even if they worked less 
and to charge their time to contracts on which they had not worked 
lockheed denied the accusations 
we very vigorously deny that false claims have been or are 
made or condoned by the company said company spokesman george 
mulhern in fact weve had a very strong program over the past 
several years to make sure all employees know any form of 
mischarging is wrong and can lead to disciplinary action including 
dismissal if warranted 
mulhern said the company would wait until it receives a copy of 
the suit before responding to specific allegations 
but we are also very confident the suit if it goes to 
trial will show the company has not engaged in any improper 
practices he said 
lockheed missiles amp space with 23700 employees in sunnyvale 
develops spacecraft satellite systems and submarinelaunched 
missiles it is a subsidiary of lockheed corp 
the suit was filed under a federal whistleblower law by 
margaret t newsham 45 a former lockheed analyst and martin 
overbeek bloem 34 an engineer who works for the company the 
united states also is a plaintiff 
the law protects whistleblowers from retaliation and allows 
them to keep some of the judgments against companies convicted of 
cheating the government 
the complaint which seeks damages and a jury trial is one of 
the first false claims suits involving a classified black 
project for the national security agency a surveillance branch of 
the defense department 
newsham and bloem who both held security clearances from the 
nsa worked at lockheed on the project from 1981 to 1984 
they allege that a huge amount of time was wasted at 
lockheed in the ice box a period ranging from a year to 18 
months during which employees could not work on sensitive projects 
until they received security clearance 
rather than being given nonclassified work their time was 
wasted saperstein said when the end of the week rolled 
around they billed the united states government for 40 hours for 
no work essentially 
employees allegedly found ways to keep busy including selling 
real estate honey and belt buckles or working on their cars or 
playing computer games 
one senior manager the suit says had lockheed machinists build 
him an airplane and was allowed to retire and take the plane with 
him when the project was discovered 
one lockheed employee wrote out the entire bible onto a 
lockheed computer charging government contracts for his time 
the suit says 
newsham was fired in 1984 she said the company refused to give 
a reason 
the defense contract audit agency substantiated the allegations 
after newsham called a defense department hot line in 1984 
saperstein said reports from the agency which has no enforcement 
power were filed with the suit

blackclad mourners shook fists in anger 
as they marched behind iranian flagdraped coffins vowing to 
avenge the us navys downing of an iran air passenger jet with 
290 people aboard 
the mourners waved banners and shouted revenge revenge and 
down with reagan as 24 of the victims were buried on wednesday 
a team of us military experts meanwhile arrived in bahrain 
and began their inquiry into the attack by questioning senior 
officers of the navy cruiser that fired the fatal missiles us 
sources said 
in iran the manager of the airport where the iran air airbus 
a300 originated was quoted as saying the navy failed to use the 
proper frequency when it issued a warning before firing two 
missiles at the plane 
iran said 200 bodies had been recovered from the persian gulf 
since the uss vincennes destroyed the plane sunday all but 38 of 
those aboard were iranians 
fourteen were buried wednesday in bandar abbas and ten others 
were buried at zahedan in southeastern iran iranian television 
reported 
the television broadcast 15 minutes of scenes from the funerals 
in bandar abbas women clad in black chadors marched behind 
coffins and carried banners some of which read america you 
fight with weapons and we with our belief in god and your defeat 
is imminent 
men waved their fists shouting death to america coffins 
were draped with the green white and red iranian flag 
iran says the vincennes intentionally shot down the airbus over 
the strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf 
the united states says the vincennes fired because the vessels 
combat information center identified the approaching aircraft as an 
f14 fighter on an attack bearing 
the aircraft on a scheduled flight to dubai from bandar abbas 
was shot down while the navy ship was engaged in battle with 
iranian gunboats us officials said 
a sixmember military investigating team arrived from the united 
states late tuesday and began probing the tragedy 
us military sources said the team planned to interview capt 
will c rogers iii skipper of the vincennes and other officers 
present during the crisis 
the bandar abbas airport manager hossein peroussi was quoted 
in todays chicago tribune as saying he was in the control tower 
when the plane left for dubai on sunday 
the situation was quite normal the airplane was right on 
course he was quoted as saying 
the iranian government let more than 100 foreign correspondents 
into iran wednesday to interview airport personnel and view bodies 
of victims 
peroussi was quoted as denying pentagon claims the vincennes 
sent warnings to the plane on both ultrahigh frequency and 
veryhigh frequency radio channels he said the navy uses only uhf 
channels to warn approaching aircraft 
that is useless for the airbus because he is on vhf he 
said we heard the navy every day they did not announce a 
warning on vhf 
peroussi said transponders on the plane emitted signals only 
in a civilian mode not a military mode the pentagon said the 
vincennes received both types of signals from the plane 
a plane carrying the remains of 71 of the victims had to abort 
its takeoff on wednesday when some of the coffins toppled over 
inside the plane the tribune reported it said about 12 western 
reporters were aboard 
the pilot of the c130 braked to a halt just before takeoff the 
newspaper said the plane was en route to tehran it said 
iranian officials showed the bodies of the victims to reporters 
including cutting open one body bag and displaying a woman holding 
a baby in her arms the paper said

a us destroyer aimed its 
weapons at a helicopter chartered by a television news crew after 
two warnings to keep clear apparently were lost in the din of 
persian gulf radio traffic 
the incident occurred wednesday three days after the american 
cruiser vincennes shot down an iran air airbus a300 killing all 
290 people aboard 
the united states says the vincennes which had just finished a 
skirmish with iranian gunboats mistook the jetliner for an iranian 
f14 fighter 
on wednesday the us destroyer john hancock had a routine 
radio exchange with an iranian jet fighter but did not contanct an 
iran air passenger jet flying a few miles away 
an iran air spokesman confirmed the arrival in dubai of flight 
657 on a scheduled flight late wednesday morning from shiraz and 
said it returned to the central iranian city after refueling and 
taking on passengers 
it flew within several miles of the john hancock which was off 
the united arab emirates and in radio contact with many commercial 
aircraft in the dubai air corridor 
monitoring of radio traffic showed dubai air controllers in 
constant touch with an iran air jet as it approached for landing 
but the john hancock made no attempt to establish contact 
john hancock crewmen were however wary of some other aircraft 
including an iranian warplane whose type was unclear in the noisy 
radio chatter 
the john hancock asked politely for its name and intention and 
the iranian pilot responded in english that he was making routine 
daily check flight 
a tense moment came when the destroyer challenged a helicopter 
approaching from the direction of iran through the haze of a 
sandstorm that reduced visibility to a few miles 
its request for identification went unanswered and the john 
hancock assumed a heightened state of readiness ordering other 
aircraft in the area away and locking its weapons on the 
helicopter which approached to within five miles 
radio contact finally was established with the chopper which 
was chartered by an nbc news team 
an officer of the john hancock was heard saying be advised 
sir we did pass two warnings to you the direction of your 
approach and the flight profile you exhibited did cause us to lock 
you up with weapons request you guard this frequency more closely 
in future 
the pilot who has flown the gulf for more than a year replied 
i am on this frequency from the time i leave dubai and never take 
it off i am afraid your transmissions werent heard

droughtstricken midwest saying they hadnt forgotten their 
yankee friends while marijuana growers in ohio dug water pits 
to keep their milliondollar weeds wet 
farmers of legal crops in ohio hoped to receive 1000 bales of 
hay today courtesy of north carolina farmers returning a favor 
paid to them two years ago 
and for the first time in weeks barges were not stalled on the 
droughtshoaled mississppi river 
were glad to show our yankee friends we havent forgotten 
them jim graham north carolinas commissioner of agriculture 
said wednesday after he threw a bale of hay onto a tractortrailer 
this is a good will effort on our part to reciprocate for what 
they did for us two years ago graham said were paying them 
back 
ohio was one of several midwestern states that came to the aid 
of southern farmers during the drought of 1986 this year the 
midwest has been suffering from what has been called the worst 
drought in 50 years 
also on wednesday a livestock truck loaded with about 450 bales 
of hay donated by burlington nc farmers departed for kentucky 
from the piedmont livestock co 
in oklahoma six burlington northern rail cars filled with 172 
tons of donated hay left for south dakota organizer larry jones 
said the hay should arrive july 13 and that more was being shipped 
from mississippi and texas 
wednesday was another scorcher for the midwest where dozens of 
record high temperatures were set according to the national 
weather service international falls minn sometimes called the 
nations icebox tied its alltime record high with 98 degrees 
flint mich reached 101 degrees the second time this year the 
alltime record set on the aug 24 1947 was tied 
in the new orleans area thousands of people bought bottled 
drinking water because the drought has allowed salt water to push 
up the mississippi from the gulf 
i have a dog that refuses to drink it its salty very 
salty shirley ellard said of water drawn at port sulphur about 
midway between the mouth of the river and new orleans 
on the mississippi river the drought has lowered water levels 
forcing barge traffic into the manmade 243milelong 
tennesseetombigbee waterway which ends at mobile 
in kentucky barges and tows were moving through the channel 
near the confluence of the ohio and mississippi rivers 
on the ohio river a us army corps of engineers team surveyed 
the shallow channel in ballard county on wednesday to determine 
whether it should be closed again for dredging said petty officer 
3rd class john moss of the us coast guard 
it may be necessary to close the channel for one or two days 
later this week moss said 
there was no backlog of tow boats and 
barges waiting to pass through the channel near the confluence of 
the ohio and mississippi rivers moss said it marked the first 
time since the channel reopened sunday that the boats did not have 
to wait in line 
meanwhile the drought was showing no favoritism among ohio 
crops wilting corn and soybeans as well as young christmas trees 
and marijuana plants 
the drought killed all 2500 christmas tree seedlings in clinton 
county that don chafin planted this year at his farm in southwest 
ohio 
in nearby ross county sheriff thomas hamman said marijuana 
needs as much water as other crops and growers are going to have 
to water it by hand or create an irrigation system 
the people that grow the milliondollar crop will take a lot 
more care of their plants said mike webb of the ohio attorney 
generals office 
some growers have dug water pits usually lined with plastic 
and haul water from the pits to the illegal plants he said 
authorities arent offering any relief to the pot growers 
however officers began their marijuana eradication program earlier 
than usual this year because of the drought

baby the eightfoot burmese python 
missing for three months has been found much to the shock of a 
new tenant in the apartment that babys owner had vacated 
i guess she opened up the drawer to do something and thereal control 
officer paul ranes said 
wednesday 
ranes answered the call and was greeted by two shaken women 
baby was a bit more calm 
it just looked at me ranes said it didnt do anything 
it took police several hours to track down babys owner molly 
mccoy 
it all began in april shortly after mccoys boyfriend gave her 
the python as an easter gift the snake was given the run of the 
apartment while mccoy arranged to have a 100gallon custom tank 
built for the snake but baby vanished 
animal experts scoured the apartment but they found no trace of 
the 60pound snake they guessed that baby had slithered down the 
toilet or found her way under some cupboards and into the walls 
for days police answered calls from mothers who were afraid to 
let their children outside 
officer mark forsyth said the mothers had little to fear because 
anything larger than a poodle is probably not on a pythons menu 
after a while mccoy gave up baby for lost and moved out of the 
complex in early may 
police said wednesday the python had not eaten in four or five 
months 
mccoy finally retrieved her pet but the reunion was subdued 
mccoy remarked that baby was thin and told reporters that she might

the governing party claimed today that its 
candidate won mexicos presidency despite a computer breakdown at 
election headquarters and opposition charges that the government 
rigged the vote 
neither the federal electoral commission nor any of the parties 
had released any results when jorge de la vega dominguez president 
of the institutional revolutionary party announced a crushing 
legal and incontestable victory for carlos salinas de gortari 
shortly after 130 am the party has ruled mexico since 1929 
moments after the victory claim interior secretary manuel 
bartlett went on national television to reject allegations of vote 
fraud 
a few hours earlier the three leading opposition presidential 
candidates met with federal officials and issued a statement 
accusing the government of rigging the election 
one witness to the voting wednesday said she saw an 8yearold 
boy cast a ballot people were also seen voting for their whole 
families and election workers were said to be stuffing ballot boxes 
the election day that just ended represented a civic awakening 
of the mexican people that the government has quashed by rigging 
the vote the opposition candidates said 
the statement accuses the government of stuffing ballot boxes 
eliminating citizens from voting rolls paying people to vote and 
multiple voting 
it says the irregularities seriously affect the cleanliness of 
todays balloting and could annul the results unless the 
problems are satisfactorily resolved 
rosario ibarra de piedra of the radical revolutionary workers 
party read the statement as fellow candidates cuauhtemoc cardenas 
of the leftist national democratic front and manuel j clouthier of 
the conservative national action party stood by 
most polls closed at 6 pm 8 pm edt wednesday and the 
election commission had said partial returns would be available 
four hours later 
by early today however no results or turnout had been released 
and officials said computer trouble was to blame 
the election wednesday was not only for president voters also 
elected a new 500member chamber of deputies and a 64member senate 
opposition parties were expected to gain in the congress which 
over the last few years has begun to shed its image of being a 
rubberstamp to the executive 
since its founding 1929 mexicos governing party known as the 
pri has won every presidential election and has controlled the 
national congress and the governorships of all 31 states 
but this year a clear deterioration of the pris influence was 
evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by cardenas and clouthier 
in 1982 president miguel de la madrid won 70 percent of the 
vote this year the victory margin was not expected to be as wide 
for salinas de gortari 
de la madrids sixyear term expires dec 1 and under the 
constitution he cannot be reelected 
fraud was reportedly widespread in salinas de gortaris adopted 
home town of agualeguas about 80 miles north of monterrey near the 
us border 
petra hernandez a report an 8yearold boy who voted with 
his fathers voting card 
she said election officials let a lot of people vote for the 
whole family they voted for their wife their kids their mom who 
couldnt come 
the president of one precinct also was filling out ballots i 
saw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes she said 
pri officials denied the reports of fraud in agualeguas 
the campaign has not been without bloodshed 
gunmen on saturday killed francisco xavier ovando a longtime 
cardenas collaborator and strategistion but to ovandos tenure as michoacan 
attorney general 
during that time ovando fought organized crime 
but cardenas called the slayings a provocation 
in recent months clouthiers conservative national action party 
and cardenas leftleaning national democratic front coalition have 
weakened the pris popular support 
for the first time nearly the entire left unified behind one 
candidate the 54yearold cardenas late in the campaign mexican 
socialist party candidate heberto castillo left the race and threw 
cardenas his support

because an important witness 
failed to appear a court today adjourned until next week the trial 
of a lebanese man charged with the 1985 twa hijacking and murder of 
a us navy diver 
less than an hour after the trial of mohammed ali hamadi resumed 
today chief judge heiner mueckenberger recessed the proceedings 
until wednesday 
the trial under heavy security in a specially constructed 
prison courtroom began tuesday 
both of the trials first two sessions have been cut short 
raising prospects the proceedings could extend into next year 
already officials have scheduled court days into december and say 
more could be added 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is on trial for murder and air 
piracy in the june 1985 twa hijacking during the ordeal 39 
americans were held hostage 17 days and us navy diver robert 
stethem of waldorf md was murdered after gunmen forced the 
athens to rome flight to land in beirut 
mueckenberger said he was adjourning the trial because a witness 
who knew hamadi during his previous stay in west germany was unable 
to come to todays session 
the man a social worker originally had been scheduled to 
testify next wednesday but was later asked by the court to appear 
today 
tuesdays opening session was also quickly suspended after 
hamadi refused to participate in the proceedings 
before adjourning today the court heard a document from a court 
in the southern west german state of saarland which convicted 
hamadi of theft and causing bodily injury and gave him a suspended 
ninemonth sentence in 1983 hamadi lived in saarland from 1982 to 
1984 
the document listed hamadis date of birth as june 13 1964 
hamadi also has claimed he was born in 1966 
the issue of age is important because it will determine the 
length of any sentence hamadi receives if convicted the range is 
from 15 years to life 
before hearing evidence on the chrgaes the court must first 
determine whether hamadi should be tried as a juvenile young adult 
or adult under west german law a juvenile is under 18 an adult 
is 21 and older and a young adult is between 18 and 21 
the united states tried unsuccessfully to have hamadi extradited 
to stand trial on its soil 
tuesdays hearing was recessed three times because of various 
legal disputes and hamadis objection to the choice of an 
entepreter 
hamadi in his only statements to the court gave his name and 
asked for a new interpreter and replacement of one of his defense 
lawyers hamadi said the interpreter was not qualified in his 
arabic dialect 
the murdered divers parents richard and pir sons brutal murder was 
read 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
he was found to be carrying liquid explosives 
a duesseldorf court sentenced his older brother abbas ali 
hamadi to 13 years in prison last april for kidnapping two west 
germans in beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for his brother 
one was later released but the second is still being held in 
beirut by a radical shiite group

disasters have been a fixture in the 
north sea since its oil boom began in the 1960s and oilmen regard 
the shallow stormswept waters as among the worlds most hazardous 
petroleum fields 
explosions structural defects on rigs and bad weather all have 
contributed to the regular tragedies that plague the region 
the worst north sea oil field disaster was in 1980 when 137 
crewmen on the accommodation platform alexander i kielland died as 
it capsized in storms in the norwegian ekofisk area most of the 
dead were norwegians 
five years earlier a ruptured pipeline on the same rig caused 
an explosion that killed three men 
the first north sea spill was in april 1977 when at least 58 
million gallons of oil escaped into the sea from the oil rig bravo 
in the ekofisk field run by phillips petroleum 
texas oilman red adair was brought in to cap the fracture it 
took him and his team five attempts to cap the rig but not before 
a slick covered 1500 square miles 
in november 1965 three people died and 11 others were injured 
when an explosion ripped the bottom out of a north sea oil drilling 
barge at teesport near middlesbrough in northeast england 
in december 1965 13 men died when the sea gem rig collapsed and 
sank 
in november 1981 the transworld 58 platform was torn from its 
moorings and drifted for several hours in hurricane winds 
fortyfour men were evacuated but another 20 remained trapped 
aboard the platform for several hours before being rescued there 
were no casualties 
in 1982 one man was killed on the same piper alpha platform 
involved in wednesdays disaster when a walkway collapsed 
in 1984 a fire on the production platform brent bravo killed 
three workers when they were trapped in a shaft 
in 1985 two maintenance workers died in an explosion in the 
semisubmersible rig glomar arctic ii 
last march a total of 40 workers were winched by helicopter 
from two rigs that got into trouble in gales the same night 
another rig drifted off the norwegian coast with 77 men aboard 
last friday an explosion occurred at british petroleums sullom 
voe north sea oil terminal on the shetland islands but no injuries 
were reported 
on tuesday fire broke out on the north sea brent alpha 
platform again no injuries were reported 
the department of energy said a total of 123 fixed 
installations including the piper alpha platform involved in 
wednesday nights disaster are currently in the british sector of 
the north sea oil field 
the department said there are additionally about 40 
semisubmersible rigs and jackup rigs in the british sector 
semisubmersible rigs float and can travel under their own 
power while fourlegged jackup rigs stand on the sea bottom and 
are generally used for exploration in shallower waters

the captain of a panamanianregistered vessel 
carrying more than 72 tons of marijuana stalled a us coast guard 
boarding party as long as possible to destroy records said the 
captain of the coast guard cutter 
the converted oilrig supply ship encounter bay was towed into 
seattle by the coast guard cutter boutwell and placed under tight 
security wednesday the street value of the cargo was estimated by 
the coast guard at 280 million 
the encounter bay seemed to be heading for the strait of juan de 
fuca the entry to puget sound and the main channel to victoria and 
vancouver british columbia said cecil allison captain of the 
boutwell 
the boutwells crew could read the word panama in obscured 
letters and a few hours later those aboard the 378foot cutter 
had permission from the panamanian embassy to board the encounter 
bay allison said 
the encounter bays crew yielded to a boarding party only after 
the boutwell fired machine guns at its rudder and engine room and 
threatened to use cannon fire allison said 
in my opinion he said the encounter bay captain was just 
trying to prolong the engagement so he could destroy all the 
records he could 
it was a very organized operation from the packaging all the 
way through to the control of the ship and the cleaning out of the 
boats records 
allison said they found no records indicating the origin or 
destination of the vessel or who was in charge of the operation 
the 180foot encounter bay was not flying a flag when it was 
spotted late last week about 600 miles offshore 
the owner of the encounter bay was listed as countess shipping 
corp of panama and the 18member crew included three americans 
one from england one from new zealand and 13 from indonesia 
thailand and singapore 
sixteen appeared wednesday before us magistrate john weinberg 
and were advised of their rights and possible charges against them 
and two others were to appear for the same purpose today when a 
thai interpreter would be available 
all are held in custody pending a detention hearing on monday 
when bail if any will be set said deputy clerk karen lamborn 
the magistrate at that time would try to determine whether there 
was probable cause to send the case to a grand jury she said 
if it can be proved the ship was headed for the united states 
crew members could prison terms of a few 
years to life said gary liming us drug enforcement 
administration special agentincharge 
the encounter bays crew was cooperative but not talkative 
allison said he estimated there was 72 tons of highgrade 
marijuana on board in about 8000 bales packed into four large 
shipping containers 
each bale in a blue nylon sack contained eight packets of 
marijuana vacuumsealed in double plastic wrappings

a former secretary to prime minister noboru 
takeshita today joined the list of top political aides who 
reportedly made questionable stock dealings in a scandal spreading 
through the ranks of business and politics 
in related developments the president of japans leading 
economic newspaper and the chairman of the company whose stock was 
involved in the dealings resigned because of the scandal 
takeshita told reporters today that one of his former 
secretaries ihei aoki earned profits by trading the shares of the 
real estate company recruitcosmoined shares from the company then sold 
them 
shortly after it went public in 1986 when takeshita was finance 
minister 
the dealings were not illegal but the revelations were on the 
front pages of almost all japanese newspapers today and critics 
said the case highlights questionable ethics in the links between 
japans politicians and businessmen 
takeshita did not elaborate on the number of shares aoki traded 
or his profits from the deal but acknowledged that the scandal 
would seriously affect the upcoming session of the diet japans 
parliament 
he said he would not take responsibility for his aides action 
the controversy surfaced last month as a bribery case in a local 
government but has entered a new dimension with a series of 
revelations that aides to leaders of the governing liberal 
democratic party profited with recruitcosmos stock 
according to reports in the japanese press recruitcosmos gave 
stock or sold it at an artificially low price to highranking 
politicians in some instances the company reportedly lent money 
to politicians to buy the shares 
when the company went public and the stock price soared the 
politicians were able to reap large profits from a neglible initial 
investment 
it was not clear what if anything the politicians did for 
recruitcosmos in return 
not only politicians are involved in the scandal 
the president of japans leading economic daily nihon keizai 
shimbun resigned wednesday after it was revealed that he ko 
morita had dealt in recruitcosmos shares violating the rules of 
his newspaper 
hiromasa ezoe chairman of recruitcosmos and its parent company 
recruit ltd a giant information service company announced that 
he will resign the two chairmanships 
the president of recruit naotaka ida said ezoe will also 
withdraw from the governments tax commission 
so far the scandal has touched aides to finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone liberal 
democratic party secretary general and former foreign minister 
shintaro abe former defense agency director general koichi kato 
and michio watanabe the former minister of international trade and 
industry 
of them only miyazawa has denied knowing of the stock deals 
while the others said they had become aware their aides had 
received the stock and made profits 
saburo tsukamoto chairman of democratic socialist party the 
third largest opposition party was also found in the list of 
people who gained about 200000 through the transactions 
whether they are politicians or company heads those who have 
responsibilities must behave prudently not to be criticized by the 
general public chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi told a press 
conference today in the only official comment from the government 
on the matter 
critics jumped on the case as an example of loose ethics in 
japanese political life 
politicians want as much money as they can get and 
businessmen always look for connections with politicians said 
shinji otsuki an editorial writer for asahi shimbun a major 
japanese daily 
he said the scandal will fuel public opposition to the tax 
reform package that the takeshita government hopes to get through 
the special diet session later this month 
the japanese public wont tolerate watching politicians earn 
huge profits by taking favors from businessmen in tricky ways very 
close to insider trading otsuki said 
legislation to ban insider trading took effect only in 1987 but 
is not retroactive 
giving politicians stock shares that are 
guaranteed to rise 
the only problem in this case if there is any is that the 
amount of money involved was unusually substantive and people who 
profited by the dealings were in positions where they are not 
supposed to be involved in such actions for ethical reasons he 
said

a blind woman who was removed from an airplane in 
a dispute over seating and safety instructions says she wral rules may 
not prevent other blind people from 
being harassed 
when i walk in an airport i dont know whats going to 
happen but i know that its likely to be demeaning and 
humiliating peggy pinder an officer of the national federation 
of the blind said wednesday at the federations annual meeting 
the us transportation department has proposed nine rules to 
end airline discrimination against disabled people the rules were 
outlined at the conference by matthew scocozza the departments 
assistant secretary for policy 
but ms pinder challenged scocozza saying a clause in one of 
the rules could make it possible for airlines to continue barring 
blind passengers from sitting in emergency exit rows a practice 
the federation has criticized as discriminatory 
under one proposed rule no passenger could be required to sit 
in a certain area of the plane except where required by an faa 
federal aviation administration safety rule scocozza told a 
predominantly blind audience of more than 1000 
scocozza said in a speech to the convention that he agreed with 
the federations position that many blind people are capable of 
sitting in an exit row and handling an emergency situation 
but united airlines spokesman joe hopkins said his airline does 
not seat blind passengers in an exit row because of fears they 
could not assess an emergency situation as well as a sighted person 
lets say theres a fire on the other side of the door a 
blind person wouldnt be able to see that hopkins said 
in april james gashel an officer of the federation was taken 
into custody on a charge of criminal trespass after he refused to 
leave his seat in an emergency exit row of an united flight 
ms pinder said she was removed from a midway airlines plane on 
march 31 and arrested because she refused to move from a seat in 
the smoking section to the front of the plane 
but sandra allen a spokeswoman for midway said ms pinder was 
arrested because she refused to listen to a special safety briefing 
the airline requires for all disabled passengers 
the federations executive director kenneth jernigan told the 
convention that no blind person anywhere in the country can 
board a plane without fear of harassment public humiliation and 
possibly arrest and bodily injury 
scocozza said the departments new rules may help to change that 
situation 
if nothing else its a start thats 30 years too late he 
said

a nuclear weapons test rocked the nevada 
desert today registering 56 on the richter scale and causing a 
swaying motion in highrise buildings here 100 miles from ground 
zero 
john minsch a spokesman for the national earthquake information 
center in golden colo said the reading indicated the test was 
one of the larger ones conducted at the desert site 
the device was detonated 40 miles from mercury a tiny town on 
the nevada test site where soviet nuclear scientists are based 
while preparing for a joint ussoviet test next month 
a controller in the tower at mccarran international airport in 
las vegas said the tower rocked slightly seconds after the blast 
at 805 am 
a telephone switchboard operator at fitzgeralds hotel in 
downtown las vegas said a guest on the 29th floor called to ask why 
she felt ground motion 
and a receptionist at the lionel sawyer law firm atop a 
highrise office building downtown said she felt a dizzy 
swirling feeling at the time of the blast she said a hanging 
plant in the office began swaying 
all three declined to give their names 
motion was recorded on energy department seismographs atop 
several hotelcasinos on the las vegas strip and downtown motion 
was also recorded at scottys castle in death valley calif west 
of the test site 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographsan earthquake or explosion of 35 on the richter scale 
can cause slight damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 
considerable damage 6 severe damage 
the test was delayed five minutes while controllers checked out 
a malfunctioning signal 
energy department spokesman chris west said the test appeared to 
be normal with no indications of any problems west who was in a 
control center 25 miles from ground zero said monitors at the site 
indicated no radiation had escaped the ground 
he said slight ground motion was felt in the control center 
todays test was the eighth conducted this year and the sixth 
conducted with soviet scientists on site 
the soviet scientists arrived earlier this year to begin 
preparing for next months joint verification experiment the 
soviet scientists will monitor a us test in midaugust and us 
scientists will monitor a soviet test a month later 
the experiments are designed to determine the ability of each 
country to monitor the size of the others tests such monitoring 
capabilities are critical in test limitation treaties 
the doe had issued a warning to managers of highrise buildings 
in las vegas not to have workers in precarious positions at the 
time of todays detonation such warnings are issued only when the 
test is near 150 kilotons the upper limits allowable under 
ussoviet treaties 
the nuclear device was buried 2000 feet beneath the surface of 
pahute mesa about 100 miles northwest of las vegas 
the most recent previous test was june 22 when two nuclear 
devices were detonated simultaneously in a rare experiment

gov terry branstad of iowa said today that 
droughtstricken counties no longer will have to get agriculture 
department clearance before approving emergency feed programs for 
livestock producers 
branstad said he was told by agriculture secretary richard e 
lyng that an official announcement would be made soon branstad 
disclosed the action to reporters after meeting with lyng 
the drought counties will not have to make application to 
get approval here in washington for the emergency feed and 
emergency feed assistance program branstad said they can just 
notify usda that they will be providing that assistance on an 
individual farmerby farmer basis 
branstand said that to qualify a farmer will have to show the 
county office of the agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service that he has endured at least a 40 percent loss in normal 
feed stocks 
this is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of 
questions in the country that are hurting the livestock 
producers he said and i think it is a very positive 
development 
under the emergency feed program the usda pays eligible 
livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace 
that which is normally produced on the farm the emergency feed 
assistance program allows the sale of usdaowned grain at reduced 
prices 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate 
as of july 6 the feed programs were approved by usda for 474 
counties in 22 states

a court thursday agreed to hear 
arguments that union carbide corp had scorned indias judicial 
system in the cases stemming from the bhopal gas disaster 
according to a news report 
a twojudge panel of the madhya pradesh high court accepted a 
petition accusing the danbury connbased company of contempt of 
court the press trust of india reported 
a hearing was ordered on the petition but no date was 
announced the news agency said 
union carbide spokesman ed van den amelle said the company had 
no comment since it had not seen the report 
the petition is the latest legal entanglement stemming from the 
1984 bhopal gas disaster in which nearly 3000 people died 
it alleges that union carbide showed contempt for indias court 
system by asking district judge mw deo to excuse himself from 
hearing a 3 billion damage suit filed by india against the 
company the news agency said the company had argued that deo 
showed bias in december when he ordered union carbide to make 
relief payments to gas victims before a final decision had been 
made in the case 
deo rejected union cabides request june 16 
preliminary hearings in the damage case are under way in deos 
court in bhopal the capital of madhya pradesh in central india 
the contempt of court petition was filed last month by madhya 
pradesh advocate general am mathur and accepted thursday by two 
judges in the city of jabalpur 
it names union carbide chairman robert kennedy and two indian 
attorneys 
the government suit stems from the leak of lethal methyl 
isocynate gas from a pesticide plant run by a union carbide 
subsidiary in december 1984 
india has said the gas leak resulted from negligence union 
carbide blames it on sabotage

public school teachers staged 87 strikes in 14 
states in 198788 the same number as the year before a group 
opposed to public employee unions said thursday 
but there were more teachers involved in the 876 walkouts and 
almost three times as many students missed classes the public 
service research foundation said 
it said 66043 teachers went out on strike at some point during 
the school year that just ended and 945793 students missed 
classes 
it said in 198687 there were 87 strikes in a dozen states 
affecting 49546 teachers and 326431 students 
the foundation part of an organization that opposes collective 
bargaining for public employees published the figures in its 
fortnightly newsletter the government union critique 
peter w katsirubas editor of the newsletter said that if a 
school district kept schools open with substitute or nonstriking 
teachers students were not counted as missing classes 
the biggest strike last year was the 19day walkout by 24000 
teachers in chicago affecting 400000 students it was the ninth 
chicago strike in the past 19 years the board of education had 
sought to freeze teachers wages 
katsirubas said he tallied 71 teacher strikes in 198586 and 100 
in 198485 
teacher union leaders contend there are fewer strikes these days 
and many of those that do occur are defensive ones teacher 
salaries have risen faster than inflation for the past seven years 
and the average teacher now earns more than 28000 the highest 
ever in real dollars

vice president george bush says he will not 
promise to put blacks women and other minorities in his cabinet if 
elected president even though he has made that commitment to 
hispanic americans 
i feel strongly there should be an hispanic in a bush 
cabinet the vice president said wednesday after addressing a 
hispanic convention in dallas 
other groups have been represented in the cabinet and 
hispanics have not said bush certain to be the republican 
presidential nominee 
he said his promise to hispanics was a oneshot pledge and that 
he would not go around the country making promises to special 
interest groups 
on capitol hill a group of hispanic house members today 
denounced bushs promise to name a hispanic to his cabinet 
george bush is making a lastditch effort to make up for eight 
years of republican neglect said rep albert bustamante 
dtexas chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus 
rep matthew martinez dcalif said he had no confidence in 
bush making a meaningful appointment saying the problem with the 
current administration is who they name to visible government posts 
they are tokens people who theyre able to manipulate and 
control they do not believe in civil rights he said 
bustamante said likely democratic nominee michael dukakis who 
also has promised to name hispanics to high government posts can 
back up his statement with his record 
today bush invades dukakis backyard to woo an ethnic group 
close to the heart of the massachusetts governor the vice 
president will speak in boston tonight before a greek orthodox 
diocesean dinner aides said he would talk about the importance of 
religion 
underscoring the political importance of hispanics bush spoke 
in dallas before the convention of the league of united latin 
american citizens lulac the largest and oldest hispanic civic 
group 
although bush does not speak spanish he arranged for his son 
jeb to fly in from florida to make a pitch for him jeb bush who 
speaks spanish and is married to a woman from mexico is popular 
with hispanic groups 
pledging to put a hispanic in his cabinet bush said it was 
good to acknowledge that some things are at this point owed 
he said his promise was something i have never made before to 
anyone to any group 
however he said it is time it is time and its long 
overdue and that is a solemn pledge 
dukakis said bushs vow to name a hispanic to the cabinet was 
about a year too late dukakis made the same pledge in june 
1987 to the lulac convention held last year in corpus christi 
texas dukakis was to address the group on thursday followed by 
jesse jackson on friday 
at a news conference bush said he would not make similar 
promises to other groups 
i will be very openminded and broadbased in who i select to 
serve in my cabinet but im addressing myself to righting a wrong 
that has been out there for many years 
asked if he would make a similar promise to asian americans 
bush said id have to go back there and research that out 
oscar moran the hispanic groups president said of bush he 
attracted the attention of some voters who already decided on 
dukakis now they will pay attention to him 
but tony bonilla an influential democrat whom bush singled out 
by name as a person he had tried to recruit for the gop was 
unmoved by the vice presidents promise to put a hispanic in the 
cabinet 
bonilla said it was a little patronizing for bush to make 
such a statement after serving eight years in the reagan 
administration without a hispanic in the inner circle 
the vice president needs to say to the president right now 
we have goofed we have not reciprocated to the hispanic 
community for their support said bonilla a former chairman of 
lulac and the head of the national hispanic leadership conference 
bush said he had discussed the idea of a hispanic in the cabinet 
with president reagan but he added im not president of the 
united states 
his commitment was a measure of the political importance of 
hispanics particularly in key battleground states like texas 
california and florida which have a large spanishspeaking 
population 
since 1980 the number of hispanics in the united states has 
increased 30 percent to 19 million accounting for about 79 
percent of the nations population 
urging hispanics to switch to the republican party bush said 
i think you belong with us and dont let anyone take you or 
your support for granted 
many people in the audience did not applaud an indication they 
were not swayed by his appeal

last years mild el nino a puzzling 
phenomenon in which global weather disruptions follow a warming of 
the pacific was predicted by three different climate models 
according to scientists who hope they can now serve distant warning 
of future recurrences 
looking at the results we feel there is a good chance of 
being able to assess these things as much as a year ahead and over 
time we expect to get better said stephen zebiak of the columbia 
universitys lamontdoherty geological laboratory 
time will show how much value these kinds of models and 
predictions can have until there is a consensus on that we dont 
expect to see governments taking action readily based on them 
although i do think that eventually that will happen zebiak said 
thursday in a telephone interview 
its a new kind of game really a lot of people are still 
quite skeptical about it 
the successful predictions of the 198687 el nino are being 
formally reported in fridays edition of science magazine 
el ninos still not fully understood are events that appear to 
affect weather around the world one that occurred in 198283 
described as the strongest in this century was blamed for an 
estimated 1500 deaths and damage of 2 billion to 8 billion 
worldwide 
the 198687 el nino had much less impact although some unusual 
weather was reported including heavy rains in coastal peru and 
drought in india and the pacific northwest of the united states 
the events are preceded by unusually warm water temperatures in 
the pacific and changes in barometric pressure over that ocean 
zebiak said the climate studies currently show cooler than 
normal pacific ocean temperatures the opposite of an el nino 
for at least the balance of this year these cold events do not 
seem to have the climate impact of the warmer el ninos he added 
el ninos take their name from the spanish word for child a 
reference to the christ child this was coined by peruvian 
fishermen to refer to the recurring phenomenon which sharply 
reduced their fish supply and was often first noticed at christmas 
time 
scientists combining that name with a reference to changes in 
pacific and indian ocean air pressure usually use the term enso 
for el ninosouthern oscillation 
the three different climate models that predicted the 198687 el 
nino were 
the lamontdoherty model developed by mark cane zebiak and 
sean dolan this model uses a computer to calculate changes in the 
ocean and atmosphere and their relations with one another termed 
a dynamic model meaning it uses mathematical formulas to 
calculate changes it predicted the el nino more than a year ahead 
of time 
a model based primarily on changing ocean conditions coupled 
with unusual wind currents developed by james obrien and d 
legler of florida state university this combined dynamic and 
statistical information and can issue predictions a few months in 
advance zebiak explained 
a statistical model using wind patterns and sealevel air 
pressure readings over the pacific and indian oceans which can 
give predictions with lead times of 3 to 9 months this pair or 
related models was developed by timothy barnett and nicholas e 
graham at scripps institute of oceanography in la jolla calif 
in the case of the 198687 el nino all three models wound up 
making the same prediction just at different times zebiak said 
it is interesting that different models which are based on 
quite different kinds of approaches are showing consistency i 
think it is basically encouraging another piece of evidence that 
there really is a robust kind of signal here which we are 
capturing in different ways 
the fact is that these kind of forecasts are a reality now 
they will continue we and the other people are doing it sort of 
routinely now what remains to be assessed is the kind of feeling 
for exactly how reliable they are going to be in the situations 
that nature throws our way zebiak said

the seattle opera is putting off its next 
mounting of richard wagners fouropera ring cycle for at least two 
more years company officials have announced 
der ring des niebelungen a staple of the company since 
1975 wont be revived before 1991 general director speight 
jenkins said wednesday 
instead the seattle opera will mount a production of wagners 
die meistersinger next year and prokofievs war and peace 
in 1990 he said 
he also announced the company balanced its 198788 budget with 
a slight surplus 
jenkins had planned to revive the ring cycle das 
rheingold die walkure siegfried and 
gotterdammerung next summer after a oneyear break in annual 
productions that had made the opera house a mecca for wagner 
devotees from around the world 
the kennedy center in washington dc is in the final stages 
of negotiation to host the deutsche oper berlins production of the 
operas next june in may the metropolitan opera of new york will 
present its new ring 
as a result jenkins said wagner fans would be drawn east next 
year 
in 1990 the san francisco opera plans to revive its highly 
successful 1985 production of the operas 
we will do the ring in 1991 unless a cataclysm strikes me 
or this company jenkins pledged 
the production of the rarely heard war and peace is planned 
in a collaboration with the soviet union in conjunction with the 
goodwill games negotiations for that production have yet to be 
concluded 
an extended absence of the wagnerian retelling of teutonic 
legend wont mean the loss of seattles reputation as a center for 
wagner but the expensive production cant be taken for granted 
either jenkins said 
the ring is not just going to be there like mount rainier 
he said you have to work to earn and fund a ring 
he said it would be twice as expensive to revive the ring cycle 
as to produce meistersinger which is expected to have a budget 
of about 12 million the last new production of the opera in the 
united states was in 1977 
to open its 25th season the company is giving four performances 
this month of satyagraha an account of mohandas gandhis years 
as a young lawyer in south africa by the minimalist composer philip

us ships in the persian gulf are in an 
untenable position and president reagans policy in the region 
needs to be reassessed following the navys downing of an iranian 
airliner with 290 people on board senate democratic leader robert 
byrd said today 
byrd and other members of congress attending a series of 
closeddoor pentagon briefings appear convinced that the captain of 
the uss vincennes acted responsibly in launching the missile that 
destroyed an iranian airliner with 290 people on board 
in a senate floor speech byrd said he is not advocating a us 
withdrawal from the gulf where american ships have operated for 40 
years he added 
its one thing to maintain our presence there but its 
another thing to go day to day in a volatile environment they 
are placed in an untenable position 
he said he had asked defense secretary frank c carlucci on 
wednesday to give us a new assessment of threats to the navy in 
the shallow crowded gulf he said the new review is needed so we 
wont be going from day to day with the likelihood of this 
occurring again 
cia director william webster meanwhile said after a closed 
meeting with the house foreign affairs committee that the united 
states was of course prepared for any iranian reprisals 
declining to be specific he said 
we already have in place a very effective counterintelligence 
strategy around the world and its being utilized the one thing 
you dont do in situations like this is panic and run to put the 
sand trucks up in place 
our government has procedures in place to protect our citizens 
and our officials who would be likely targets and they are being 
utilized 
house speaker jim wright meanwhile called sundays incident 
a very straightforward error of misidentification but said the 
iranian government must assume some serious responsibility for 
this kind of an error because of the attacks by its gunboats on 
the vincennes just before the a300 airbus was shot down 
lawmakers said several factors the skirmish with iranian 
patrol boats electronic data that made the approaching plane 
appear to be military and intelligence information that indicated 
heightened chance of a major attack combined to justify the 
decision of the captain of the uss vincennes to fire two missiles 
at an unseen target 
the ships captain had every reason in the world to feel 
threatened rep ike skelton dmo a member of the house armed 
services committee said after one briefing on wednesday i dont 
think he had any choice but to shoot it down 
every precaution the ships commander could take was taken 
said senate minority leader bob dole rkan noting that radar 
told the ship the approaching plane was descending from about 9000 
feet and gaining speed 
that information was at odds with data gathered by another ship 
in the area the uss john h sides which put the altitude as 
12000 feet and steady that and other conflicts remain to be 
cleared up by a navy investigative team sifting through recorded 
information in the persian gulf 
other unanswered questions included why the airbus 300 passenger 
jet apparently was emitting electronic signatures for both a 
commercial plane and for a military craft 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
he believed the most likely explanation was that the code for a 
military plane was actually emitted by a second aircraft in the 
area but was confused with the signal from the commercial plane by 
the sophisticated gear on board the vincennes an aegisclass 
cruiser 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga said 
he believed it was too early to explain the dual civilian and 
military signals that seemed to be coming from the plane if a 
second plane were involved suffice it to say that the captain 
could not have known that based on the information he had nunn 
said 
little new information emerged from the three house and senate 
briefings by defense secretary frank carlucci and a phalanx of 
subordinates 
the pentagon did back off from its earlier assertion that the 
iranian airliner was flying outside the prescribed commercial air 
corridor conceding that while the plane had deviated from the 
corridors center it had never actully left the designated 
airspace 
several lawmakers also said us forces nervousness had been 
heightened by specific intelligence warnings in the days before 
that a major attack on them was likely over the july fourth weekend 
aspin said intelligence received in the days before the incident 
indicated that two iranian f14s had been moved from a military 
airfield elsewhere in iran to the joint militarycivilian airfield 
at bandar abbas on irans coastline 
aspin also said the electronic signature picked up by the 
vincennes just before the shootdown bore the identical digital code 
that had been associated with f14s flying in the area in the days 
before the incident the failure to identify the jumbo jet shows 
that identifying aircraft electronically remains an art not a 
science he added 
abc news on wednesday quoted military sources as saying iranian 
commercial airliners have been used to carry soldiers from bandar 
abbas the point of origin for iran air flight 655 to the front 
with iraq the sources said troop transports often have carried 
both civilian and military transponders the radaractivated 
devices that broadcast a planes identification signal 
aspin said lawmakers were told the plane was warned to identify 
itself at least a dozen times on both civilian and military 
frequencies beginning within two or three minutes after it took 
off from bandar abbas and before it turned to make a course 
correction heading it toward the vincennes 
in other developments 
lawmakers continued to be generally supportive of the idea of 
paying compensation to families of victims which was being studied 
by administration officials i do not believe it would constitute 
any admission of guilt said sen arlen specter rpa to have 
compensation awarded would be an act of generosity and would be 
very appropriate in this case 
a washington postabc poll published today found that 71 
percent of the respondents believed shooting down the plane was 
justified while 23 percent disagreed the telephone survey of 524 
randomly selected adults in the continental united states was 
conducted tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points 
soviet military staff chief marshal sergei f akhromeyev said 
at a pentagon news conference that he had discussed the incident 
with his us counterpart adm william crowe akhromeyev said he 
had concluded that destruction of the iranian jetliner differed 
from the soviet shootdown of a korean air lines commercial flight 
over the sea of japan in 1983 i would not draw any 
similarities he said

chinas public security minister told the 
nations police chiefs that counterrevolutionary activity 
foreigninstigated sabotage and ordinary crime are increasing it 
was reported thursday 
according to the official china daily newspaper minister wang 
fang warned that sabotage instigated from abroad has been 
intensified recently 
wang did not elaborate and it was not clear whether he was 
referring to sabotage against the chinese government or to last 
months shortlived terrorist threat against americans in beijing 
he urged police to stay on their guard and recommended stiffer 
penalties for lawbreakers china already imposes the death penalty 
for numerous crimes ranging from theft to panda poaching to murder 
wang made his comments to more than 200 public security 
directors at the end of a national conference wednesday 
a day earlier premier li peng told the gathering that public 
security must be tightened to control social upheavals that 
will inevitably result from chinas ongoing economic reforms 
discontent with price increases widening income gaps between 
poor and rich and student pressure for political freedom to match 
the new economic freedom all have contributed to growing tensions 
in chinese society 
peasant raids on fertilizer warehouses shortlived strikes over 
wages and other illegal and sometimes violent protests that would 
have been unheard of a decade ago have become more frequent 
three large illegal protests are known to have occured in 
beijing in june 
about 1000 beijing university students marched to public 
security headquarters on june 3 to protest the murder of a fellow 
student a second planned march was thwarted by a police show of 
force 
several dozen students from the northeastern city of changchun 
tried to hold a sitin outside communist party headquarters a week 
later complaining that their study program was not accredited 
more than 1500 peasants in a village on beijings outskirts 
clashed with police to try to halt the release of contaminated 
water into their drinking and irrigation water supply 
both the changchun students and the peasants were dispersed 
forcibly a series of statements by top officials during the month 
made it clear they have no intention of allowing the authority of 
the ruling communist party to be challenged 
white collar and violent crime also have increased partly 
because of the new social tensions and partly because chinas 
economic reforms have increased temptations to steal 
the public security ministry said crimes resulting in serious 
injury or death rose 31 percent in the first four months of the 
year compared with the same period last year 
officials have said cases of gambling prostitution and 
publishing pornography are increasing and they have blamed chinas 
greater openness to the outside world 
china last month had its first known case of a terrorist threat 
against foreigners officials said nationals from an undisclosed 
third country plotted an attack on americans in beijing but were 
thwarted no details were released

in an unusual gesture the cuban government 
has allowed a human rights activist and former political prisoner 
to make a monthlong visit to the united states 
elizardo sanchez head of the cuban human rights and national 
reconciliation commission said that he believes he is the first 
dissident to be given permission to leave cuba for purposes other 
than emigration since the start of the revolution 29 years ago 
the main purpose of sanchezs us visit is to meet with his 
wife and children who came to the united states aboard the mariel 
boat lift in 1980 he plans to return to cuba in august 
sanchez discussed the human rights situation in cuba in measured 
terms because he believes that strong language could jeopardize his 
hopes for positive changes on the island 
we dont want to corner the government he said 
sanchez spoke to a reporter thursday shortly after his arrival 
in washington from miami 
sanchez 44 is a former professor of philosophy and the history 
of philosophy who was stripped of his job in 1968 because of his 
unorthodox political views 
since then he has spent seven years in prison because of his 
activities as a dissident he now works in a municipal library in 
havana although for many years the only jobs he could find were as 
a mechanic and a laundry employee he said 
he was last imprisoned in the fall of 1986 after speaking with 
reporters from two west european news agencies the reporters were 
expelled from the country and sanchez said he spent eight months 
in solitary confinement before his release last summer 
sanchez said he had applied repeatedly for permission to leave 
the country over the past eight years but his requests were 
ignored in april he finally got the goahead after he sent a 
telegram to president fidel castro seeking his assistance 
asked if he is grateful for castros help sanchez said that 
permission to leave ones homeland is a right specified in the 
universal declaration of human rights and that an expression of 
gratitude would therefore not be appropriate 
its a right that all should have he said 
during his us visit sanchez said he expects to meet with 
representatives of the human rights groups including amnesty 
international and americas watch but he added that he is not 
seeking publicity 
he described the human rights situation in cuba as 
precarious and said the lack of individual freedoms is the most 
difficult problem 
the current administration in cuba has a lot to do to 
improve the situation he said 
asked why he doesnt plan to remain in the united states 
sanchez said there are enough cubans outside the island who call 
attention to human rights practices there 
the most important thing for me is to remain inside cuba 
he said

conventions apparently closer than ever to agreeing on workable 
approaches to school reform 
but dont tell that to nea president mary hatwood futrell or aft 
president albert shanker who seem far more comfortable nursing 
their rivalry than contemplating a ceasefire 
neas 8227 delegates meeting here this week and afts 3000 
delegates in san francisco endorsed reform proposals aimed at 
freeing teachers to experiment the separate schemes differed in 
detail not spirit 
the aft proposed creating thousands of schools within 
schools where small clusters of teachers could try out their

in each state as learning laboratories 
asked if her plan signaled a rare consensus with the aft

with the tough competition of the 
olympics of barbershop singing only a day away hundreds of 
vocalists found harmony in hotel lobbies and halls as they belted 
out familiar tunes 
but all bets were off today when more than 1000 barbershop 
quartet and chorus singers compete at the 50th international 
convention of the society for the preservation and encouragement of 
barbershop quartet singing in america 
fiftyone quartets will battle for five finalist positions 
while 16 choruses of at least 50 men each vie for five spots 
the finals are set for saturday with one gold one silver and 
three bronze medals up for grabs in each category the gold medal 
winners are the international champions 
this is the olympics of barbershop singing and all of them 
have had to battle on the local level to get here international 
president james warner a lawyer from memphis tenn said 
wednesday it will be a tough competition because there is a lot 
of prestige that goes with the medals 
the competition may be fierce but in virtually every corner of 
the henry b gonzalez convention center and hotels wednesday many 
unfamiliar foursomes gathered like old chums and stretched their 
vocal chords 
barbershop quartets which cropped up mainly on the east coast 
at the turn of the century and became popular during the vaudeville 
era use fourpart harmonies to carry tunes 
the lead singer carries the melody a tenor harmonizes and a 
baritone and a bass handle the lower chords 
barbershop quartets began fading when vaudeville was replaced by 
other forms of music and motion pictures in the aftermath of world 
war i 
but in 1938 owen c cash a tulsa okla tax attorney and 
rupert hall another tulsa businessman formed the barbershop 
quartet society to preserve the music 
today there are 2000 quartets and 800 choruses divided into 16 
regions in the united states and canada as well as other groups in 
england sweden west germany holland and new zealand 
the organization based in kenosha wis helped spawn two women 
barbershop singing groups the sweet adelines inc and harmony inc 
i think we are gaining some respect again across the 
country warner said 
we are developing programs for young men in some high schools 
and its found increasing acceptance he said 
greg zinke 27 began singing in a quartet after being around 
his fathers group 
zinke who works in a tool and die shop in high bridge nj 
said he opted for barbershop quartet singing instead of rock n 
roll because of the selection of clean simple old songs 
just about anybody that has some kind of ear for music can do 
this you dont have to be a professional zinke said 
you dont have to be a fantastic singer to do this i think 
thats what makes it so nice for the guy off the street who admires 
the music he can come sing it too he said 
its easy to sing and its portable said 35yearold roger 
payne of new york city all you have to have is your pitch pipe 
and three other guys and you dont have to call anybody to move 
your piano it interacts with the audience in a real 
entertainmentkind of way

more than 1000 people had been evacuated by early today from 
the custer state park fire in south dakota near the granite 
monument to four presidents 
in alaska hundreds of firefighters battled three of the states 
more serious wildfires as weather forecasts continued to offer 
scant hope for rain 
the fire burning near the pipeline on the yukon flats national 
wildlife refuge grew from 110000 acres on monday bureau of land 
management spokeswoman sue mitchell said about 80 firefighters 
were assigned to the fire that is one of three the blm either 
manned or monitored on the refuge 
what theyre trying to do is stop it from getting any closer 
to the pipeline mitchell said 
the pipeline is made of heavygauge steel and is not 
susceptible to serious damage from a fire of that nature said 
tom brennan a spokesman for alyeska pipeline service co but he 
said we would rather not have it in the area of a pump station 
because those are manned for one thing 
firefighters in utah finished cutting fire lines today around an 
850acre blaze that has blackened oak brush and ponderosa pine in 
zion national park they expected to have the fire contained by 
tonight officials said 
the fire began june 19 and was allowed to burn in a small 
conditional area in accordance with park policy allowing 
natural fires to take their course said chief ranger bob andrew 
on sunday however winds gusting to 60 mph fanned the flames 
out of the conditional area and up to 200 firefighters were 
brought in 
in southern utah 45 firefighters battled a 3500acre fire that 
broke out late wednesday on bureau of land management and private 
land about three miles north of beryl near the nevada border 
spokeswoman eulail pickering said the fire was 85 percent 
contained and crews anticipated full containment later today 
another fire in wilderness area that also began june 19 was 
being held in check at 3400 acres in southcentral montana the 
lightningcaused fire was allowed to burn in the absaroka beartooth 
wilderness until it flared up over the independence day weekend and 
burned more than 1600 acres 
smokejumpers worked the north face of the fire wednesday while 
four helicopters dropped water and foam said information officer 
jo barnier in the billings interagency fire center 
wyoming firefighters aided by cooler temperatures and a drop in 
winds overnight contained a 1300acre fire in the bridgerteton 
national forest at 6 am today forest officials said 
two volunteer firefighters were injured one seriously battling 
the blaze said forest spokesman fred kingwill 
we still have a ways to go before well call it controlled 
he said adding that the wind in the next few days will determine 
the future of the fire 
officials originally said the fire had burned up 1500 acres but 
downgraded the acreage to 1300 after fire lines were dug and the 
blaze could be reassessed 
in yellowstone national park three fires covering nearly 1900 
acres of backcountry still were burning wednesday the fires one 
covering 1800 acres in the northwestern corner of the park and two 
others near shoshone and lewis lakes in the southern part of the

summer session thursday with a call for progress toward banning 
nuclear weapons tests and chemical weapons 
swedish ambassador maj britt theorin in a keynote speech said 
failure to agree on a final document at last months un special 
session on disarmament must not hamper the conferences 
negotiations 
she alleged that us negotiators prevented the 160nation

ussoviet treaty eliminating intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
a major breakthrough for nuclear disarmament she expressed 
hope the two superpowers will agree soon on halving their 
longrange nuclear arsenals 
but indications that additional countries have stockpiled 
chemical weapons and their increasing sophistication give rise to 
grave concern she told delegates to the worlds only 
multilateral arms negotiating body 
washington and moscow have failed to agree on a deadline or any 
concrete commitment to speed the conferences 20year negotiations 
on a comprehensive chemical weapons ban she said 
several outstanding issues including details of verification 
could be settled if good will persists she said time is not 
on our side 
on nuclear testing she said a comprehensive ban is as urgent 
as ever she noted more than 1600 atomic test explosions were 
set off by the end of last year and all five nuclear weapons states 
carried out tests in 1987 
the ussoviet talks on nuclear testing should focus on 
limiting the number of tests as a step toward a comprehensive ban

on the faucet when lightning struck just outside i guess it went 
through the pipes or something but it threw me all over the 
kitchen into the refrigerator and the table and onto the floor 
on wednesday mrs fortney 63 was outside placing a pail to 
catch rainwater for her plants when i felt a force pick me up 
and it threw me across the carport i dont know what the lightning 
hit if it was the ground next to me or the bucket but it really 
threw me and i wound up on my hands and knees facing the opposite 
direction 
mrs fortney was treated at hcanew port richey hospital for 
knee and ankle injuries and released she also complained of a hot 
and tingling sensation in her arm and paramedics said her blood 
pressure was high 
it really shakes you up she said its a terrible feeling 
because you have no control over it that was definitely an

than 500 people to hospitals most with heart and breathing 
problems 
hospitals around the country were place on alert temperatures 
in athens reached 106 degrees fahrenheit at 245 pm for the 
second straight day 
yugoslavia greeces northern neighbor reported at least 26 
people dead in a heat wave that has gripped belgrade for a week 
the temperature soared to 104 degrees wednesday 
the greek national weather service said temperatures were not 
expected to drop until sunday 
the smog of athens sent 496 people to hospital with cardiac 
and respiratory problems as pollution reached murderous levels 
said a statemment by the panhellenic center for ecologic studies 
a report from the national center for emergency help said 404 
people were treated as outpatients for heart or breathing 
difficulties and 92 were hospitalized it said hospitals admitted 
25 people suffering from heat stroke 
nikos benardis the athens coroner said the heat contributed to 
the deaths of 15 elderly people 
most of them had previous heart conditions and were on 
medication he said the heat certainly aggravated the 
condition of those with cardiac problems that caused their deaths 
soaring temperature have caused a shortage of electric fans and 
hundreds of people lined up at appliance stores for the few that 
remained 
we had 60 fans in the store and sold them all within minutes 
of opening there are people who have been waiting two or three 
days to buy one said efthimios arevas sales manager of a large

pollutants that forms in the lower atmosphere on warm still days 
and is known as the nefos the greek word for cloud government

house republican leaders unveiled an 
american family act on thursday saying they hoped the bill 
would win vice president george bushs backing and influence issues 
ranging from child care to gangbusting 
it is not enough for republicans to deride the failures of the 
great society programs we must provide a framework for change 
house republican leader bob michel rill said at a news 
conference 
the 2 billion package would provide federal support for 
promising state local and private programs designed to strengthen 
the american family 
though theyll introduce the legislation in august sponsors are 
really shooting for action in the next congress said rep dan 
coats rind the principal author of the bill 
sponsors also want to make the bill part of the gop platform and 
are hoping bush the allbutcertain gop presidential nominee will 
endorse it in whole or in part one of the sponsors is rep jerry 
lewis rcalif cochairman of the republican convention platform 
committee 
specifically the bill contains the following initiatives 
up to 50 million to states for experiments in schoolbased 
management in which teachers play a major management role and 
districts have greater budget and curriculum flexibility 
50 million to promote unrestricted school enrollment policies 
aimed at forcing schools to compete 
up to 450 million for bootstrap schools which have 
predominantly minority or lowincome students 
600000 for character education pilot programs and 
promotion grants would be available only to schools that require 
the pledge of allegiance daily 
college savings bonds with taxexempt interest if proceeds 
were used for tuition and other costs associated with higher 
education of the taxpayer spouse child or dependent such 
legislation has already been introduced with the backing of reagan 
and bush 
a 13 billion proposal targeting aid to lowincome working 
families already introduced by rep tom tauke riowa 
a multimilliondollar program to fight gang warfare including 
5 million to encourage states to adopt restitution laws 7 
million to states with laws allowing courts to find parents liable 
for restitution 35 million for law enforcement areas that want 
to set up a tracking system for juvenile offenders also there 
would be grants for community reclamation and other projects 
child support enforcement initiatives including mandatory 
automatic wage withholding and a requirement that at least 17 
percent of a noncustodial parents income go to support one child 
allowing public housing authorities to charge no more than 
fairmarket rent for housing currently families pay 30 percent of 
their gross incomes 
10 million in startup money for projects that coordinate 
services to high risk children 
the republicans said they are planning a second family package 
to address the issues of housing work and family and possibly 
health it is unclear they said whether the next bill will 
include a provision guaranteeing new parents jobprotected leave 
theres a lot of controversy about it coats said of such a 
requirement for parental leave an idea promoted by democrats and 
some republicans but strongly opposed by business weve resisted 
the temptation to pick up a politically charged issue and throw 
something out there that were not 100 percent comfortable with

a us company announced thursday it will buy 
advanced technology from china an unusual agreement that reverses 
the roles of the two countries in most high technology transfers 
the company egampg inc will buy technological knowhow and 
components for developing a helium magnetometer used for 
geophysical mapping and minerals exploration said egampg chairman 
and chief executive officer john m kucharski 
the technology will be provided by the china national geological 
technology development import and export co under the ministry of 
geology and mineral resources 
this is the first time for the ministry to cooperate with an 
american company to export technical products to the us said 
viceminister xia guozhi 
egampg a massachusettsbased high technology company with an 
18year history in china previously had sold technology to china 
but this is its first time on the buying end 
china has shared scientific and technological knowledge 
especially in the areas of agriculture with african countries it 
just signed an agreement with brazil to develop and launch two 
scientific satellites in a joint venture 
the united states last fall briefly froze further liberalization 
of high technology transfers to china to protest alleged sales of 
chinese silkworm missiles to iran 
bilateral trade last year reached 104 billion according to 
us statistics 
under the sixyear agreement egampg will use chinese knowhow to 
develop the helium magnetometer which will be produced in the 
united states and sold on the international market the instrument 
can be used on airborne marine and portable landbased systems for 
mapping the earths magnetic field 
egampg made no payments on the technology instead the chinese 
company will be paid on a royaltybasis neither side would reveal 
the amount 
kucharski told reporters that sales of the magnetometer are 
expected to exceed 10 million 
bian zhaohao president of china national geological technology 
import and export corp said the amount of money his company will 
earn is small but added that the significance of technology 
transfer from china to the united states was far more important 
than the profits 
in this way we would like to create various forms of 
cooperation not only with the us but with other countries as 
well he said adding the agreement reflects chinas policy of 
encouraging transfers and cooperation with other countries in the 
development of technology

an armada of rescue ships and 
helicopters scoured the chilly north sea today for 150 people 
missing after a fire engulfed an oil platform in possibly the worst 
oil rig disaster ever 
occidental petroleum corp the owner of the rig said in a 
statement that a gas leak was apparently to blame derek ellington 
a survivor described hearing a gas leak screaming like a 
banshee seconds before an explosion ripped through the piper 
alpha platform 
flames continued to leap into the air above the burning wreck of 
twisted metal two explosions triggered wednesday nights inferno 
on the piper alpha rig 120 miles off the scottish coast 
police said there was little hope of finding any more survivors 
energy secretary cecil parkinson told parliament that 229 people 
had been on the oil platform he said 65 survived and 16 bodies 
were found leaving 148 missing in addition two of three rescuers 
who disappeared still were missing 
occidental petroleum said 66 men survived and police said 67 
the discrepancies were not immediately explained 
police said most workers on the rig were scottish but press 
association the domestic news agency said workers from the united 
states canada continental europe and south africa were aboard 
officials at occidental petroleums los angeles headquarters had 
no immediate information on how many americans were aboard the rig 
said spokesman peter sinclair 
armand hammer occidentals chairman and chief executive 
officer said in a statement i wish to extend my deepest 
personal sympathy to the families of the men who have been injured 
or who have lost their lives in this tragic accident in the north 
sea we will continue to do everything we can to assist the injured 
and their families 
if those missing are confirmed dead the accident will be the 
worlds worst oil rig disaster 
the guinness book of records lists the worst as the capsizing of 
the alexander l kielland platform in norwegian waters in march 
1980 when 123 people died 
it was a case of fry and die or jump and try said ron 
carey 45 who managed to leap off the piper alpha into the 
57degree water after he was choked by smoke 
towering flames lit up the night and smoke blackened the sky 
today 
with the passage of time hopes are fading of finding any 
other survivors said a police statement 
six nato warships diverted from maneuvers to join the search 
that filled the skies with helicopters and the waters with more 
than two dozen boats 
sleeping workers died when flames raced through the piper 
alphas living quarters others leaped 150 feet into the water 
the aberdeen coast guard said rescuers from a rescue vessel the 
sandhaven disappeared into the flames as they headed to the rig in 
a small boat and a second explosion occurred police said two were 
missing 
queen elizabeth ii sent a message of sympathy and prime minister 
margaret thatcher expressed deep shock 
aberdeen hospital spokesman alan reid told reporters 21 people 
were hospitalized 13 of them in serious condition 
carey an instrument technician lay in a hospital bed with his 
arm in a sling and his eyes closed by burns 
he said he was choked by smoke after hearing the first of two 
explosions 
it was over the side or nothing i just dived it may have 
been 60 feet i was totally enveloped he said 
a second explosion sent bits of lifeboat raining into the water 
he said there was a lot of debris floating around and the flames 
were billowing above us i found my head was being cooked i had to 
keep ducking down to get it cool 
he saw bodies float past and then was rescued 
dr alistair matheson of the royal infirmary who treated 
injured aboard a rescue ship close to the rig said there was a 
strange silence about the place i could feel the heat of the 
flames in my face i knew this was a disaster of major 
proportions 
matheson said survivors told of taking refuge in a cool area of 
the rig and when the flames approached finding nowhere to jump 
where the sea was clear of flames two who jumped survived 
those who were lucky and able to escape were up and at work at 
the time and were able to jump straight into the sea and get into 
rescue vessels john brading occidentals executive vice 
president told a news conference 
he announced an urgent inquiry into why lifeboats with room for 
300 people failed to get off the platform 
witnesses said the flames engulfed the rig and towered over the 
horizon 
when we went on late last night we certainly could see the 
fire raging from 60 to 70 miles away and the flames at that time 
were wed estimate 300 or 400 feet said royal air force 
squadron leader garfield porter who was involved in the rescue 
it was the third accident at north sea oil installations in the 
past week on friday a blast rocked british petroleums sullom voe 
onshore terminal on the shetland islands 
on tuesday a fire broke out on the north sea brent alpha 
platform 
occidental is one of the major oil companies operating in the 
north sea it has been concentrating recently on developing new 
fields there 
serious incidents have regularly occurred on north sea drilling 
production and accommodation platforms since the start of the 
offshore exploration boom in the 1960s 
structural defects explosions or bad weather have all been to 
blame

distant future

a new test to quickly estimate blood 
cholesterol levels won approval thursday from the food and drug 
administration 
the new device quicker and easier to use than current tests 
uses a drop of blood on a chemically treated card that changes 
color according to the amount of cholesterol in the blood 
the test to be available for use by physicians is intended 
only as a preliminary screening technique to identify people with 
elevated cholesterol levels who may need treatment 
people with high readings on the screening test should receive 
further evaluation with conventional lab tests the fda said 
the new test does not give a count but indicates whether the 
sample tested falls within three ranges below 200 milligrams per 
deciliter from 200 to 300 milligrams or over 300 milligrams 
federal officials health officials urge further evaluation for 
anyone with a level above 200 milligrams per deciliter 
the new test called clinicard is made by chemelec inc 
of north webster ind and will be available on a limited basis in 
about a month the fda said

a runaway forest fire that swept near mount 
rushmore before turning aside today charred more than 10000 acres 
and prompted evacuation of up to 1000 residents and tourists near 
the national memorial authorities said 
when we told them residents and campers it was burning 1000 
acres per hour and it was three miles away they kind of 
believed us said sgt howard brunner of the pennington county 
sheriffs department who helped evacuate the town of keystone late 
wednesday 
visitors returned to mount rushmore this morning but it was 
accessible only from the west superintendent dan wenk said smoke 
was visible in the distance today but there was no smoke at the 
memorial itself 
the blaze which shot billows of smoke so high its pall was 
visible 160 miles away wednesday also threatened the parks game 
lodge summer white house for two presidents no structures have 
been destroyed 
its a very serious situation jerry hagen fire information 
officer with the us forest service said early today the fire in 
custer state park and the black hills national forest was within 
three miles of mount rushmore before switching directions and 
heading south said richard hohmann a spokesman for the state 
division of forestry 
the fire behavior was so extreme and erratic that the fire 
line was lost several times during the night forcing 
firefighters to retreat hohmann said 
since there are fewer buildings in the southern end of the park 
firefighters can now spend more time battling the blaze and less 
time protecting structures hohman said 
an estimated 1000 firefighters pilots and rescue personnel are 
battling the blaze hohmann said a threemilelong fire line has 
been cleared but 20 more miles are needed to surround the blaze 
he estimated the line would be completed sunday night 
cooler temperatures and lighter winds were forecast today which 
could help the firefighting effort said tom farver fire 
information officer 
two firefighters suffered minor injuries hagen said 
all entrances to the park were closed wednesday 
the fire was fueled by a continuing drought that has created 
extremely dry timber smoke was billowing thousands of feet into 
the air and the plume was visible from rapid city 25 miles away a 
haze from the smoke hung over a large part of western south dakota 
and was visible from pierre 160 miles away 
pennington county sheriffs officials knocked on doors in the 
tourist town of keystone and at the memorial asking people to leave 
early today hagen said he estimated between 300 and 400 people 
were being evacuated 600 were evacuated earlier from custer state 
park 
there was a continuous line of cars from keystone to rapid 
city but from all reports it went smoothly hagen said 
keystone about two miles from mount rushmore has only about 
300 residents but it attracts thousands of tourists a national 
guard official in custer estimated wednesday night that 1500 to 
2000 people would have to leave the area because it is the height 
of the tourist season 
neither the town nor the monument was in immediate danger this 
morning but the evacuation was a precaution in case the fire 
expands in their direction said a dispatcher at the fire center 
who refused to give his name 
employees who work at mount rushmore and park officials also 
were asked to leave hagen said 
evacuees fled to a red cross shelter in rapid city or to the 
national guard armory in custer 
menashe and abigail barzilai of winnipeg canada their 
monthold baby and two other children were five of the 
approximately 170 people who spent the night at the red cross 
shelter 
the barzilais who had been staying at a keystone motel were 
evacuated from mount rushmore during the evening lighting ceremony 
in which the granite faces are illuminated by floodlights 
we left all of our things in a motel including the 
passports barzilai said today 
now we cant go back mrs barzilai said about the fire 
i wasnt worried but about the passports i was and i dont have 
anything for the baby 
authorities believe lightning started the fire in the 
northcentral part of the 73000acre park monday night it was not 
spotted until tuesday afternoon 
the fire burned across the parks northern boundary and entered 
black hills national forest land wednesday night 
it makes you just sick to see the damage thats being done 
said gov george mickelson who toured the area by helicopter 
wednesday night 
firefighters brought in bulldozers to build a line around the 
parks state game lodge and sprayed water on it to save it the 
66yearold lodge was the summer white house for presidents calvin 
coolidge and dwight eisenhower 
custer state park is the secondlargest state park in the 
nation it includes the worlds largest publicly owned bison herd 
at 1500 animals the bison graze mostly in the southern part of 
the park away from the fire but the blaze is burning in some of 
the prime habitat for the rare big horn sheep

statehood didnt immunize alaska from 
hard times oil prices are down and there is no more boom in the 
economy but a leader in the campaign for a 49th star on the flag 
has no regrets 
statehood has done everything alaskans said it would do for 
them robert atwood chairman of the alaska statehood committee 
said as the state marked one of its 30th birthdays 
it was on july 7 1958 that president eisenhower signed the 
alaska statehood bill into law some consider the anniversary to be 
june 30 the date in 1958 that congress passed the bill to admit 
the huge territory into the union still others cite jan 3 1959 
when eisenhower signed the proclamation admitting alaska to the 
united states 
none of the dates is drawing much attention this year 
the list of official alaska holidays notes instead sewards day 
in march and alaska day in october sewards day marks the 1867 
signing of the treaty by which the united states purchased alaska 
from the russians alaska day recognizes the formal transfer of the 
territory and the raising of the flag at sitka in 1867 
the struggle for statehood spanned 10 years said atwood 
publisher of the anchorage times 
we had our issues over statehood in alaska would it be good 
for alaska and alaskans he said but congress wanted to know 
would statehood be good for the nation they didnt give a hoot 
about what would be good for alaska 
politically atwood said trying to gather votes among the 
nations lawmakers was like trying to line up 1000 dominoes so 
that when you knock one down they all fall 
representatives from some of the southern states worried alaska 
would send washington liberal congressmen who would bolster the 
civilrights movement he said 
texas didnt want to lose the title of the biggest state 
remembered atwood who moved to alaska in 1935 they joked about 
it but it was a real concern to them 
he said opposition within alaska came from the canned salmon 
industry 
they controlled the economics and the politics of the 
territory he said 
with statehood accomplished alaska went through governmental 
changes that atwood believes helped lure investors north 
previously he said companies with money to stake were held 
back by concerns about the amount of power exerted in alaska by the 
secretary of the interior before statehood atwood said alaska 
was a colony run out of seattle and washington dc

secretary of state george p shultz 
told southeast asian leaders thursday they do not stand alone in 
dealing with the tide of refugees still fleeing indochina 13 years 
after the end of the war 
the commitment of the united states to resolve the indochinese 
refugee problem is as strong today as it has been in the past 
shultz said we have come a long way now we solemnly recommit 
ourselves to stay the course 
shultz admitted a longstanding policy by southeast asians to 
grant temporary asylum to the refugees was in jeopardy and proposed 
a mix of strategies including a bangkokbased working group that 
would craft new approaches 
shultz spoke at the opening session of a threeday dialogue 
among the foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian 
nations and close partners japan australia canada new zealand 
the european community and the united states 
he arrived wednesday at the start of a ninecountry tour of asia 
amid tight security 
thai officials reinforced police and military security personnel 
in the wake of the us downing of an iranian airliner in the 
persian gulf on sunday 
shultz told reporters traveling with him that the united states 
was concerned and alert to the possibility of a response from iran 
which he accused of supporting terrorism 
focusing on cambodia shultz said the united states remained 
unalterably opposed to the khmer rouge returning to power in 
that country he urged strong support for resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk with whom he confers friday and noncommunist 
groups fighting the vietnamese in cambodia 
they represent the political alternative to the vietnamese 
occupation and the khmer rouge and are key to a cambodian 
settlement shultz said 
he said continued pressure had to be exerted on vietnam to 
withdraw all its forces from cambodia but added we look forward 
to the time when vietnam will rejoin the community of nations 
in a closed session shultz expressed cautious optimism 
about the results of talks this month in jakarta among the warring 
sides in cambodia state department spokesman charles redman said 
vietnam laos and asean also are to take part in the talks 
beginning july 25 
we do not have an independent plan the spokesman told 
reporters our position is supportive of asean 
the united states remains unalterably opposed to the khmer 
rouge ever again taking control in cambodia and we believe it is 
essential that any settlement have adequate safeguards to prevent 
this shultz said 
foreign minister sosuke uno of japan called for an international 
peacekeeping force in cambodia and said his country would consider 
funding and manning such a force 
vietnams forces invaded cambodia in late 1978 driving the 
murderous khmer rouge from power and into the jungles where they 
and two noncommunist groups continue to battle the vietnamese and 
the prohanoi government in phnom penh sihanouk leads the 
threeparty resistance 
shultz said washington regards normalization of relations with 
vietnam in context of a solution in cambodia vietnam must 
realize that our commitment to a free and independent cambodia is 
unswerving shultz said 
the secretary stressed that the issue of nearly 1800 americans 
still listed as missing in action in vietnam also continues to 
divide our two peoples 
we believe it is critical for vietnam to move on this issue 
this year he said 
you do not stand alone he said referring to nations in 
asia providing first asylum to refugees from vietnam laos and 
cambodia communist forces triumphed in those countries in 1975 
redman said shultzs proposal for a refugee working group which 
would include asean the dialogue partners and the un high 
commissioner for refugees received favorable comments from some of 
the delegates 
shultz also said the united states should discourage clandestine 
flights from vietnam continue to resettle refugees and get vietnam 
to expand a unsponsored orderly departure program 
facing a fresh surge of vietnamese boat people thailand 
malaysia and hong kong are adopting tougher measures they claim 
that most of the new arrivals are economic migrants rather than 
people fleeing political persecution 
in 1986 the united states accepted about 36000 indochinese 
refugees who had sought temporary asylum in other parts of asia 
this fiscal year the number is about 29500 since 1975 more than 
900000 indochinese refugees have settled in the united states

a house subcommittee chairman accused the 
interior department on thursday of trying to muster political 
support for oil exploration in an alaska wildlife refuge through a 
swap of its potential oilbearing tracts for land in other refuges 
such a swap could kill any chance that congress would approve 
exploration said rep george miller dcalif chairman of the 
house interior water and power resources subcommittee 
miller held hearings on a general accounting office report 
released wednesday that said the land swap as agreed to by the 
fish and wildlife service and six native corporations should be 
abandoned 
the analysts from gao the investigative arm of congress said 
the service had valued the swap at six times the appraised value of 
the refuge tracts 539 million vs 90 million and would get much 
land already protected from development or without much wildlife 
value 
the swap would transfer 896000 acres of surface rights to 
native holdings in seven refuges to the fish and wildlife service 
in exchange for mineral rights to 160000 acres in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge on the states northeastern coast 
the department claims it would still hold about twothirds the 
value of the oil if any is there 
the interior department has defended the exchange in a 20page 
technical critique calling the gao report full of errors and 
misunderstandings and has promised an even more detailed response 
but interior secretary donald p hodel wrote congress last month he 
had decided not to proceed with the required environmental impact 
statement which requires public hearings for the moment 
robert e gilmore alaska regional director of the fish and 
wildlife service when the exchange was negotiated last year and now 
assistant to the director in washington told the subcommittee 
among other things that the appraised values suffer from a fatal 
flaw congress forbade the use of condemnation proceedings 
i feel the taxpayers are getting an excellent bargain 
considering the fact theres no assurance theres oil under the 
arctic national wildlife refuge gilmore said 
rep don young ralaska commented that means the native 
corporations have got an 81 percent chance of not getting 
anything 
the department has estimated there is a 19 percent chance of 
finding oil and if any is there there is a 50 percent chance that 
the field would total 32 billion barrels and a 5 percent chance of 
9 billion barrels as large as the prudhoe bay field about 100 
miles away 
this never was designed to be a resource management system 
miller said at the close of gilmores testimony this was 
designed to be a lobbying system to generate support for 
opening up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling 
thats why the economics stink its a very very cynical 
approach to this issue miller continued 
if theres an insistence that this is part of the bargain 
then it is fatal to those deliberations this is so far outside the 
realm of the public interest that congress cant possibly accept 
it 
asked in the hallway if he wanted to respond gilmore said 
since he didnt give me the opportunity to i dont choose to 
now he said he was a little frazzled by millers attacks 
asked if the trade were part of a plan to generate lobbying 
support interior department spokesman alan levitt said its 
not

a rocket blasted into space today carrying an 
unmanned probe on a sixmonth mission to mars that is designed to 
help prepare for a manned voyage to the planet 
soviet television broke into its evening news program vremya 
for a live broadcast of the 938 pm launch from the baikonur 
space center in the soviet central asian republic of kazakhstan 
a 180foottall proton rocket capped by the probe phobos i 
erupted in white and gray smoke and orange and blue flames 
the newscast switched to the soviet mission control center 
outside moscow which reported the spacecrafts flight was normal 
more than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to 
swoop close to the surface of mars moon phobos and drop probes 
onto the small potatoshaped moon that scientists say may hold 
clues to how the universe was formed 
a second satellite phobos ii is scheduled to blast off july 12 
the satellites will enter mars gravity in january and begin a 
threemonth remote study of the surface and atmosphere of mars 
after that scientists said they will draw closer to phobos and 
drop descent vehicles carrying laser ionic and radar equipment to 
help determine the internal structure and composition of the moon 
the probes are expected to be sent to phobos in about april of 
next year according to roald sagdeyev director of the soviet 
academy of sciences space research institute 
soviet space scientists said phobos is an important step toward 
a manned flight to mars which they hope can take place in the 
early 21st century officials including soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev have proposed that the united states take part in the 
mission 
first it is necessary to draw up a more accurate map of the 
mars surface in order to choose a place for the future landing 
said vyacheslav balebanov a deputy to sagdeyev 
then it is necessary to study the climate and soil 
characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from 
earth or whther it can be gotten directly on the planet the study 
of mars renewed under the phobos program should provide answers to 
those questions he said in an interview with the newspaper 
sovietskaya rossiya 
also participating in the project are austria bulgaria 
hungary east germany ireland poland finland france west 
germany czechoslovakia switzerland sweden the united states and 
the european space agency 
the deep space network of the us national aeronautics and 
space administration will provide tracking data to permit two 
100pound landers to reach phobos and then will begin to track the 
martian moon precisely using antennas in california spain and 
australia and a soviet radio telescope in the crimea

a pentagon spokesman said today it was 
extremely unlikely that a second iranian airplane was near iran air 
flight 655 when it was shot down by a us warship sunday 
the chairman of the house armed services committee rep les 
aspin dwis had said after briefings by pentagon officials that 
the presence of a second plane would explain why the officers 
aboard the uss vincennes mistook the iranian a300 airbus for an 
f14 fighter 
aspins comment raised speculation that an iranian fighter might 
have been flying behind the airbus hoping to sneak up on the 
vincennes 
pentagon spokesman daniel howard told reporters that the realm 
of possibility is fairly small on a phantom aircraft on a second 
aircraft 
an iranian p3 orion patrol plane was far to the north of the 
vincennes along the northern shore of qeshm island and two 
iranian f4 fighters took off from bandar abbas after the airbus 
was shot down he said but they played no role in the incident 
previously pentagon officials had mentioned the p3 and one of 
the f4s but they had not mentioned the second f4 
the aegis radar and tracking system aboard the vincennes is 
sophisticated enough to have detected any aircraft flying in tandem 
with the iranian jetliner howard said 
the equipment sends out a radar signal that would have been 
three miles high and wide and one mile deep at the point when the 
airbus was nine miles away the point at which the vicennes fired 
sm2 standard missiles at it and knocked it down 
it would have been almost impossible for any other aircraft to 
have been within that area he said 
the plane was mistaken for an f14 howard said because the 
airbus was transmitting an identification signal on a frequency 
normally reserved for military aircraft 
howard also said that iran should share some responsibility for 
the downing of the plane because it took off from the joint 
military and civilian airfield at bandar abbas during an exchange 
of fire between the vincennes and iranian gunboats and was headed 
straight at the vincennes when it was shot down 
the iranians are the ones who bear the resonsibility for 
ensuring that if they are the ones who provoke the hostilities 
they are the ones who began the shooting in this incident that 
they ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending 
them into harms way howard said

the soviet union launched an unmanned probe 
thursday night on a sixmonth trip to mars moon phobos for a 
mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red 
planet 
the 180foottall booster rocket spewed orange and blue flames 
as it illuminated the nighttime sky at the baikonur space center in 
the soviet central asian republic of kazakhstan 
the launch of the proton rocket carrying the probe phobos i 
was carried live on soviet television which reported that the 
spacecrafts flight was proceeding normally 
more than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to 
swoop close to the surface of phobos and drop probes onto the 
little potatoshaped martian moon that scientists say may hold 
clues to how the universe was formed 
delegations from around the world gathered at baikonur for the 
launch of phobos i a joint eastwest project to study the moon and 
mars itself 
a companion probe phobos ii is scheduled for launch on july 12 
if all goes well the two spacecraft will enter the 
gravitational pull of mars in january 1989 and fall into orbit just 
behind phobos for a threemonth remote study of the surface and 
atmosphere of the planet in april the craft will drop out of 
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moons surface 
where they will release two small landers 
the soviet news agency tass said thursday that in one 
experiment a laser beam will be used to split a tiny piece of 
phobos rocky surface and trap a specimen for close examination 
one of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in 
stationary position sending back data another is designed to leap 
around the little moon in 20yard hops gathering soil samples and 
analyzing them 
this is the most sophisticated and ambitious of 18 soviet and 
us unmanned missions to study mars 
soviet space scientists have characterized the phobos mission as 
an important step toward a manned flight to mars which they hope 
will be possible in the early 21st century 
the phobos probes will help map the surface of the planet in 
order to choose a place for the future landing said vyacheslav 
balebanov of the soviet academy of sciences space research 
institute then it is necessary to study the climate and soil 
characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from 
earth or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has proposed that the united 
states join in the prospective manned mission but american 
officials have been cool to the idea saying it would be very 
expensive and would require solutions to many difficult problems 
one of which is the problem of astronauts physical deterioration 
during long periods of weightlessness 
soviet space officials have put the cost of the phobos mission 
at 480 million 
in addition to the soviets austria bulgaria hungary east 
germany ireland poland finland france west germany 
czechoslovakia switzerland sweden the united states and the 
european space agency are participating in the flight the united 
states a late entry will provide tracking data with its deep 
space network that can determine distances within yards and the 
velocity of objects billions of miles from earth 
the phobos craft also will carry a plaque commemorating the 
moons discovery by an american astronomer

the united states on thursday welcomed a new 
plan announced by south korea to ease tensions with north korea 
calling it a very constructive and forwardlooking policy 
deputy state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley expressed 
hope that north korea will respond positively to the sixpoint plan 
announced by president roh taewoo 
she said the us goals on the korean peninsula include a 
reduction of tensions between the two countries discouraging north 
korean recourse to terrorism and a dialogue leading to peaceful 
reunification of north and south korea 
we welcome the very constructive and forwardlooking policy 
which president roh has announced mrs oakley said she added 
that that united states has no immediate plans to take steps of its 
own 
the united states has no diplomatic relations with north korea 
and prohibits us diplomats from engaging in substantive contacts 
with north korean envoys 
that restriction had been loosened in 1987 but was reinstated 
last fall after north korean agents were blamed for the bombing of 
a south korean passenger plane over burma 
north korean requests to visit the united states are generally 
turned down but mrs oakley said an exception was made recently 
when a delegation of north korean technical experts was allowed to 
attend an international conference on dams in san francisco

hundreds of palestinians 
turned in their armyissued identity cards thursday to protest a 
predawn raid by israeli tax collectors 
the palestinian action was an unprecedented gesture of defiance 
by arabs toward military authorities in the occupied lands 
nonpayment of taxes has become one of the chief civil 
disobedience tactics used by palestinians in the uprising against 
israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip that began dec 
8 
in beit sahour near bethlehem israeli tax collectors 
accompanied by about 300 troops entered the homes of 50 residents 
at 5 am seized their identity cards and said they wouldnt be 
returned until the palestinians paid their back taxes 
troops also impounded the cars of some arabs apparently for 
nonpayment of vehicle licensing and other fees 
the move prompted about 250 other arab residents to hand in 
their identity cards in protest 
palestinians are required to carry identity papers at all times 
and face immediate arrest if caught without them the cards also 
must be presented when requesting permits to travel abroad or other 
government services 
an official of israels west bank military government said there 
had been no previous incidents of large numbers of palestinians 
returning identity cards in protest even though a number of 
underground leaflets have called for such action 
an army official said there was a large gathering outside city 
hall which dispersed without military intervention he declined 
further comment 
dozens of beit sahour residents streamed into town hall to turn 
over the orangecolored cards which filled a large drawer 
at one point palestinians broke into loud cheers and applause 
when abdullah mousta the mukhtar or leading town elder handed 
over his papers 
in their latest leaflet uprising leaders ordered palestinians 
not to pay taxes to escalate the uprising and bring us closer to 
total civil disobedience 
on thursday beit sahour residents were told to report to a 
girls high school where departments were set up for collecting 
back income taxes valueadded taxes and vehicle licensing fees 
few residents turned up to settle their bills some said they 
could not afford to pay what they owed and others said they 
refused to pay out of defiance 
the israelis are asking the impossible said a palestinian 
who would only give his first name abdullah we cant afford it 
we live in very difficult conditions 
narri kheir a carpenter said the army ordered him to pay 
2000 in taxes although he had not worked for three months 
a woman who refused to be identified said many residents were 
no longer afraid of israeli punishments we have nothing to lose 
any more she said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile said the first 
firebomb attack in jewish west jerusalem since the uprising began 
showed that arabs were intent on destroying israel 
there were no casualties in the wednesday night attack on an 
israeli passenger bus in the central commercial district of jewish 
west jerusalem 
the uprising is not about the question of territory but 
about our very existence shamir told israel radio this shows 
the growing nerve of hostile elements who dare to do such a thing 
in the center of the state of israel 
mayor teddy kollek described the firebombing as a terrible 
danger for the present and the future 
although stonethrowing and firebomb attacks have escalated 
recently in arab east jerusalem where 135000 arabs live the 
attack marked the first time violence has spread to west jerusalem 
where about 340000 jews live 
also wednesday assailants threw a rock from the roof of the 
largest commercial center in tel aviv damaging the roof of a car 
police spokeswoman dalia gilad said police blamed arabs and rounded 
up five residents of the occupied gaza strip for questioning four 
were later released 
the trial of hanna siniora editor of the propalestine 
liberation organization daily al fajr began thursday in a 
jerusalem district court 
siniora was charged with violating censorship laws last year for 
publishing an interview with plo leader yasser arafat without first 
submitting it to the military censor 
siniora has advocated an arab civil disobedience campaign

more hospital waste including intravenous 
tubing and vials of blood washed ashore today on a long island 
beach and officials declared it offlimits for swimmers just a few 
hours after it was reopened 
swimming bans were lifted today on other beaches along a 25mile 
stretch of the islands south shore facing the atlantic ocean but 
officials warned that winds and tides could bring more debris and 
force more closings 
there was no word on where the material came from 
meanwhile in new jersey officials said wednesday that five of 
the 104 bloodfilled vials that washed up on its shores last 
weekend contained aidscontaminated blood another two dozen vials 
were found wednesday 
the waves of debris that washed up today at robert moses state 
park the easternmost of the affected beaches were brought in by a 
combination of high tide and southwesterly winds said michael 
asheroff deputy regional director of the long island state park 
commission 
the waste was taken to the state department of environmental 
conservation for testing to determine its source 
asheroff said the popular jones beach and the other beaches 
closed wednesday and then reopened may see waste washing ashore 
later this afternoon or by high tide friday morning 
health inspectors after finding no new debris on beaches this 
morning had decided to reopen them they also tested the water 
quality and found it to be safe asheroff said 
inspectors from the suffolk and nassau county health departments 
and the state department of environmental conservation were in 
patrol boats looking for clues to the origin of the debris 
on wednesday the nassau county health department recommended 
that the state county and town beaches remain closed to swimming 
until the water was determined safe said shelly domash a 
department spokeswoman 
its the unknown you dont know what it is or what its 
carrying said ronald f foley regional director of the new york 
state parks we wanted to be on the safe side 
on a typical weekday 50000 to 60000 people visit jones beach 
and robert moses state parks with up to 15 percent swimming he 
said on weekends as many as 200000 go to jones beach and about 
40000 to robert moses which is 10 miles east 
a heat wave has just begun with forecasters predicting 
temperatures in the 90s through the weekend 
domash said officials were trying to figure out where the debris 
came from and whether it was related to the debris that washed up 
in new jersey 
the last time the parks beaches were closed in new york was 
1976 when sewage washed up foley said 
the new jersey health department announced wednesday that five 
vials discovered last weekend in bayonne showed evidence of the 
aids antibody it was the second time in a month that vials had 
washed ashore in new jersey 
the presence of the antibody does not necessarily indicate 
that there is live virus in the blood said deputy health 
commissioner thomas a burke 
early last month two of five vials found in ocean county were 
contaminated with aids a third tested positive for hepatitis 
which is substantially more infectious than aids 
police also said wednesday they have discovered another two 
dozen vials on the bayonne beach which have been turned over to the 
health department for analysis bayonne is on a bay that feeds into 
the atlantic ocean

syrianbacked palestinian guerrillas 
overran most of a refugee camp thursday in an assault aimed at 
driving loyalists of plo chairman yasser arafat out of their last 
stronghold in beirut police said 
at least 14 people died and 36 others were wounded in the 
fivehour assault on the bourj elbarajneh refugee camp police 
said according to police count 174 people have been killed and 
665 wounded since the fighting broke out may 1 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the dissident fatahuprising faction backed by a 
fierce mortar and rocket barrage moved into western and southern 
sectors of the camp 
arafats fighters were cornered on the eastern side of the 
devastated camp 
fighting died down about midday reporters who visited the camp 
saw mousas jubilant guerrillas cleaning debris from the main 
street 
the commander of fatah in the camp sultan abulainen asked 
leftist lebanese militia leaders to guarantee the safe 
evacuation of his men estimated at about 100 police said 
the police spokesman said leaders of the druse progressive 
socialist party the lebanese communist party and the syrian social 
nationalist party have agreed to sponsor the evacuation no 
timetable has been announced yet he said 
arafat has been trying for three years to rebuild the power base 
he lost after israels invaded lebanon in 1982 
his fighters pushed mousas faction out of bourj elbarajneh and 
a nearby camp chatilla in early may 
but the dissidents regrouped and began shelling the camps with 
artillery rockets and heavy mortars from syrianheld positions in 
the mountains surrounding beirut the camps already were devastated 
by attacks from israelis lebanese christians and syrianbacked 
shiite moslem militiamen in the last six years 
fatahuprising fighters led by col saeed mousa forced arafat 
loyalists out of chatilla on june 27 
arafats guerrillas had repulsed at least 21 major attacks since 
monday when fighting flared after a weeklong lull in the power 
struggle for control of the camps 
but arafats fighters lacked the heavy weapons to retaliate for 
the daily shelling 
the police spokesman said arafats guerrillas would probably be 
driven in police buses to the port city of sidon 25 miles south of 
beirut where the palestine liberation organization has bases 
syrian soldiers would escort the guerrillas to the awali bridge 
just north of sidon he added the bridge is the syrian armys 
southernmost position in lebanon 
the camp which once housed more than 40000 refugees was in 
ruins not a single shack has escaped the shellfire 
the fourstory haifa hospital the camps only medical center 
has been shelled repeatedly all its doors and windows were blown 
out 
hospital beds and other equipment were scattered in the street 
apparently hurled there by the blast of exploding shells the 
hospital was evacuated tuesday 
the few civilians who remained in bourj elbarajneh were seen 
packing up what was left of their households and fleeing through 
the smoking rubble 
were proud palestinians we dont want to live with traitors 
we will go wherever the plo can take care of us said a woman who 
identified herself only as fawziyeh 
mousa and other radical factions broke away from the palestine 
liberation organization in a 1983 syrianbacked mutiny and 
established headquarters in damascus 
the power struggle between fatah and mousas guerrillas erupted 
less than a week after arafat flew to damascus for a reconciliation 
with president hafez assad of syria to end a 5yearold feud over 
control of the palestinian movement 
the plo has claimed that syria was behind the latest fighting to 
drive arafats forces out of beirut 
arafats men have regrouped in bases in palestinian camps in 
south lebanon which is dominated by shiite moslems raising the 
specter of more violence

a republican political consultant said 
thursday that george bush will lose in november if he doesnt get 
the support of more women and that even a woman running mate would 
not help substantially 
the problem of gender gap is so serious that overcoming it 
is probably the most important demographic key to a bush victory 
said doug bailey a respected gop consultant 
if he doesnt bridge the gender gap he will not win there 
are not enough white men available for george bush to win this 
election bailey said 
bailey predicted that bush the likely republican nominee will 
win however by making changes in his campaign strategy to make 
him more appealing to women voters 
he said the campaigns emphasis on bushs past government and 
military experience does not appeal to women whose primary 
concerns tend to be economic issues affecting work and family 
theres nothing wrong with playing baseball at yale and there 
surely is nothing wrong with serving your country and being a 
genuine war hero and theres nothing wrong with being director of 
the cia bailey said 
but frankly that is a biography that links up dramatically 
with male instincts and male interests and male priorities it 
says nothing positive about linking up that agenda of issues of 
highest priority to women voters he said 
he recommended that the vice president concentrate on making his 
own family more visible at campaign appearances and make a more 
forceful commitment to issues like longterm health care job 
security and education 
bailey spoke at a news conference called by the national 
federation of business and professional womens clubs which 
released an analysis on the gender gap a term used to describe 
differences in men and womens political preferences and behavior 
the study looked at recent polls which have shown that women are 
more pessimistic than men about the economy and thus more likely to 
vote against the current administration as represented by bush 
polls show male voters generally split between bush and likely 
democratic nominee michael dukakis while women voters are more 
likely to lean toward dukakis 
the perception is that michael dukakis is respectful of women 
and george bush is not she said 
bailey acknowledged that the gender gap numbers over the first 
six months of this year have been disaster for bush 
asked about the impact of the selection of a women vice 
presidential candidate on the republican ticket bailey said that 
it could be negative if it is perceived as a symbolic act done 
because of the polls 
frankly i do not think that the selection of a woman for vice 
president would do more than a marginal job bailey said 
ethel klein a political science professor at columbia 
university who prepared the analysis noted that polls in recent 
weeks have shown more women undecided and that dukakis support 
among women had eroded somewhat 
much of dukakis support comes from antibush sentiment and 
substantial numbers of both men and women are not sure at this 
time that either of these men are suited to be president she 
said 
in any case womens votes will be crucial in november if this 
presidential election is as close as many analysts are 
predicting she said

most of the nations top goals for babies and 
pregnant women including a hopedfor reduction in the infant 
mortality rate will not be met by the 1990 target date federal 
health officials said thursday 
its certainly sobering and concerning said dr ann koontz 
a specialist with the health resources and services administration 
in rockville md this indicates that we have some significant 
problems relating to maternal and infant health 
the government in 1979 published its 1990 health objectives for 
the nation including 13 toppriority goals relating to pregnancy 
and infant health only three of those 13 goals are likely to be 
met the national centers for disease control said thursday in its 
weekly report 
the cdc using national center for health statistics data 
projects that the nations infant mortality rate infants dying 
before age 1 will be 91 per 1000 live births thats a drop 
from the 106 rate in 1985 but still short of the 90 rate in the 
1990 objectives 
based on data from 197081 health officials had projected a 
1990 infant mortality rate of 78 but the decline in the infant 
mortality rate has slowed the cdc said 
the reasons are not known ms koontz said its a very 
complex field she said wed all like to see improvements but 
theres not been a simple solution 
another objective says that no racial or ethnic group should 
have an infant mortality rate worse than 12 per 1000 among black 
americans the rate stood at 182 in 1985 and is projected to 
decline only to 159 by 1990 the cdc said 
the infant mortality rate among whites stood at 93 per 1000 in 
1985 and is projected to fall to 79 by 1990 the cdc noted 
although economics may play a part in the discrepancy between 
blacks and whites infant mortality rates we know that poor 
economic circumstances are distributed disproportionately among 
minority populations ms koontz said the complete reason is 
not clear she added 
previous studies have shown that among collegeeducated mothers 
black infants still have nearly twice the mortality rate of 
comparable white infants she noted 
a lot of attention is being given to try to discern whats 
accounting for the differences she said those answers arent 
readily available 
one of the goals that is likely to be met concerns the nations 
neonatal mortality rate babies dying in the first 28 days of 
life that rate is projected to be 57 per 1000 in 1990 below the 
target of 65 
the other two objectives likely to be met are having most babies 
leave the hospital in car safety seats a 1987 survey put the 
figure at 75 percent and putting into place programs to screen 
newborns for metabolic disorders which all states now have the 
cdc said 
among the other goals not likely to be met 
reducing the perinatal death rate deaths between 28 weeks 
gestation and the first seven days after birth to less than 55 
per 1000 the 1990 projection 85 
no county racial or ethnic group should have a maternal death 
rate above five per 100000 live births the 1990 national rate is 
projected at 70 with black mothers at 205 
no more than 5 percent of babies should be born under 2500 
grams or 55 pounds the 1990 projection 67 percent 
no county racial or ethnic group should have a 
lowbirthweight rate over 9 percent for blacks the 1990 
projection is 123 percent 
no more than 10 percent of pregnant women in any county 
racial or ethnic group should go without prenatal care in the first 
three months of pregnancy the 1990 national projection 236 
percent 385 percent for blacks 
the cdc said insufficient information is available to ascertain 
the progress toward the other three priority goals making 85 
percent of the nations childbearingage women aware of the hazards 
of smoking drinking and drugs serving all women and infants in a 
regionalized system of perinatal care and having comprehensive 
primary health care available to all infants

a sophisticated test that allows 
detection of minute amounts of the aids virus in people who by 
conventional tests appear uninfected is being offered commercially 
by two california laboratories 
the test uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction or 
pcr in which extremely small amounts of genetic material can be 
picked out and quickly copied to provide enough material for 
analysis 
it has been used in rare cases to identify people carrying small 
amounts of the aids virus but who tested negative on conventional 
tests 
the pcr test does not detect only aids but any tiny amounts of 
genetic material it has previously been available only for 
research 
cetus corp which developed the technique on wednesday 
announced it has licensed the pathology institute in berkeley and 
specialty laboratories inc in santa monica to use the test 
physicians or laboratories will be able to send them blood samples 
for testing which takes five days and costs about 145 
the pcr technique is not intended to replace the standard elisa 
test which detects antibodies to the acquired immune deficiency 
syndrom virus 
in many cases the aids virus does not trigger production of 
antibodies for six months or more after the infection has occurred

as michael dukakis looks over his list of 
potential running mates seven names by all indications no one 
of them stands out as an unencumbered choice 
the massachusetts governor is expected to announce his choice 
next week before the opening of the democratic national convention 
where he will be named the partys presidential nominee 
dukakis was on a western campaign swing on thursday scheduled 
to return to boston on sunday aides said he was taking monday off 
but the expectation was he would use that time to go over the 
material gathered by paul brountas the close friend and lawyer who 
has been heading the veep search 
the following names are understood to be on the dukakis list 
jesse jackson sens john glenn of ohio lloyd bentsen of texas 
bob graham of florida and albert gore jr of tennessee and reps 
richard gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton of indiana 
three other names were on the dukakis list sens sam nunn of 
georgia and bill bradley of new jersey and house majority leader 
tom foley of washington all three said no thanks 
its always possible that the buttoneddown dukakis could 
surprise everyone and choose someone whose name has made no lists 
but the known universe is the abovenamed seven each has been 
asked for detailed personal and financial information and each has 
met privately with the governor 
while strong cases can be made for each it often is the 
negatives that play a key role in determining the choice in other 
words it often is as much a process of elimination as of selection 
heres a look at the downside of the seven 
jackson despite a campaign in which he was widely praised for 
moving into the mainstream of the democratic party and addressing 
issues of primary concern to white as well as nonwhite voters 
every national survey has said jackson would hurt the democratic 
ticket far more than he would help it 
dukakis is a highly disciplined individual and would expect his 
running mate to be equally controlled an expectation that would be 
impossible with the volatile jackson 
glenn the former astronaut and marine pilot is a genuine 
national hero who would give the ticket an image of strength on 
defense polls indicate glenn helps the ticket in nearly every 
section of the country but glenn has always done better in the 
polls than at the ballot box he ran a disastrous campaign for 
president in 1984 and still owes more than 2 million another rap 
against him was best expressed by jimmy carter in 1976 after 
meeting glenn carter reportedly told aides hes the most boring 
man ive ever met 
bentsen no democrat has been elected president this century 
without carrying bentsens home state of texas which has the third 
largest number of electoral votes 29 but texas also is george 
bushs home state and there is no guarantee bentsen would carry the 
state for the democratic ticket in addition bentsen is up for 
reelection the old lyndon b johnson law remains in effect 
legislation passed in 1960 to permit johnson to run for reelection 
to the senate while he also was running for vice president but 
times have changed and an effort to go for a double could cost 
bentsen his senate seat 
graham graham would probably give the democratic ticket 
floridas 21 electoral votes but hes little known outside his 
home state and is only in his second year in the senate if dukakis 
is looking for washington experience to balance the ticket graham 
seems an unlikely choice 
gore damaged goods is the phrase some dukakis advisers 
use to describe the tennessee senator a reference to his failed 
presidential campaign a major argument gore used during his 
campaign earlier this year was that dukakis represented the 
mondalemcgovern wing of the party george mcgovern and walter 
mondale share the distinction of having lost 49 states as 
democratic presidential nominees it was a comparison that didnt 
sit well with dukakis 
gephardt another failed challenger for the presidential 
nomination gephardt ran well in iowa and creditably in new 
hampshire but then bombed out his japanbashing rhetoric on trade 
was sharply different from the dukakis approach he also was seen 
as too willing to play special interest politics 
hamilton well respected is the term often used to 
describe this senior member of the house foreign affairs committee 
boring is another virtually unknown outside his district 
hamilton couldnt even guarantee dukakis indianas 12 electoral 
votes

federal health officials reported thursday the 
nations first case of human anthrax since 1984 in a textile 
worker believed infected by contaminated cashmere 
a 42yearold maintenance man at a north carolina mill became 
ill last july with a small red lesion on his arm and developed 
pain fever and chills over the following week the centers for 
disease control reported he was diagnosed with a cutaneous form of 
anthrax a severe and potentially fatal disease most common in 
cattle and sheep 
only nine human cases have occurred in the united states in the 
last decade none since 1984 the cdc said 
the patient who recovered hadnt recently been out of north 
carolina or been exposed to animals or animal materials however 
the cdc noted his mill uses wool imported from australia and new 
zealand cashmere goat hair from china afghanistan and iran and 
camel hair from china and mongolia 
eight of 59 textile samples tested at the mill including five 
samples of west asian cashmere showed contamination with anthrax 
bacteria the cdc said in its weekly report 
the west asian cashmere was probably the contaminant the 
cdc reported western asia is an endemic area for anthrax 
the other three contaminated samples were either debris or 
australian wool which may have been crosscontaminated while stored 
near the cashmere the atlantabased agency said 
this case demonstrates that the potential for occupational 
transmission of anthrax still exists the cdc said 
vaccination programs were recommended for workers at the north 
carolina plant and at a texas plant where the cashmere was washed 
said the cdc which as is its custom did not identify the 
locations involved

the stone likenesses of four presidents 
carved into a mountain at the mount rushmore national memorial in 
the black hills have made a cameo appearance in a hitchcock film 
and inspired president reagan to recite a poem 
mount rushmore is not simply a tribute to four men but rather 
is a memorial to the ideas they represent rep tim johnson 
dsd said at a ceremony last year celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of abraham lincolns 66foot face mount rushmore is 
not a place of stoic stone faces its a place of dreams 
the monumental visages of george washington thomas jefferson 
lincoln and theodore roosevelt can be seen for 60 miles 
mount rushmore is the no 1 tourist attraction in south dakota 
with more than 2 million visitors a year custer state park draws 1 
million people a year and ranks third in the states 520 million 
tourism industry 
gutzon borglum began work on the monument in 1927 but died in 
1941 shortly before it was completed his helper and son lincoln 
borglum finished the work 
the national memorial which occupies 1275 acres is two miles 
west of keystone and about 20 miles southwest of rapid city 
keystone was evacuated wednesday night as a brushfire headed toward 
the memorial but the monument was reopened on thursday 
the monument was the scene of a climactic final battle in 
north by northwest alfred hitchcocks classic 1959 thriller 
starring cary grant 
it has also been the scene of protest last october five 
members of the environmental group greenpeace were arrested when 
they illegally climbed mount rushmore and tried to unfurl a 
160foot by 50foot banner reading we the people say no to acid 
rain 
in october 1986 reagan was moved after flying over the monument 
in air force one 
i may gaze on planets born of farther suns reagan recited 
i may greater glories one day see 
but today dear earth how i love thee

nashville has no restrictions on outside water use but reeves 
is doing his bit for conservation with his shower 
ive been using it for a shower and lawnwaterer 
intermittently for about three weeks now he said 
reeves moves the shower to a different spot each day but the 
dousings arent enough to water his entire lawn he limits the 
watering to specific flowers and trees 
any other water the lawn gets is from whatever spray or

the head of the hoover institution says he 
would be delighted and honored to have edwin meese take a post 
with the conservative think tank after he steps down as attorney 
general 
the san francisco chronicle reported in thursdays editions that 
w glenn campbell said he has invited meese to discuss an 
affiliation with the institution located at stanford university 
campbell said he would like to see meese who has resigned as 
attorney general effective later this summer serve as a 
distinguished visiting fellow at the hoover institution so that he 
can have some time to write the book that he should write 
he noted that secretary of state george shultz plans to serve in 
such a capacity 
it would be very good to also have ed meese in the coffee room 
so that the scholars learn that translating their ideas into policy 
and action isnt quite as simple as they think it is particularly 
when youre subjectd to continuing media harassment 
i think personally hes got a lot more to offer in terms of

the dukakis administration on thursday offered 5 
million for land designated for a prison but the owners demanded 
nearly twice as much money and vowed a court fight if the state 
acquires the property by eminent domain 
this bid is simply too low for us to seriously consider 
coowner daniel striar said after a brief meeting with state 
officials we feel confident that the property has a market value 
of over 9 million 
the controversy over the planned mediumsecurity prison on 782 
acres in rural new braintree has become a political embarrassment 
for allbutcertain democratic nominee michael dukakis 
the fbi is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by 
prison opponents that striar and coowner gary jacobson bought the 
land after receiving a tip about the states interest dukakis and 
the owners have dismissed the charges 
the massachusetts governor also has continued to back the 
proposal for the 500bed prison 
if negotiations are not successful we will move to take the 
property by eminent domain dukakis said 
striar and jacobson stood by the 96 million price they asked 
for when they first offered the land to the state in 1986 less 
than a year after they bought it for 3 million on the property is 
a building that once served as a religious academy 20 homes and 
more than 700 acres of farmland 
a preliminary state appraisal estimated the lands value at 87 
million 
opponents of the prison led by new braintree selectwoman 
dorothea thomasvitrac cited those figures to support claims that 
the state sought out the developers as middlemen in the land deal 
and would reward them with a whopping profit 
three subsequent more detailed appraisals that were 
commissioned by the state placed the value of the land at about 5 
million two appraisals put its worth at exactly 5 million the 
third at 498 million 
the states offering price was based on those appraisals which 
took into account an environmental impact study that said the state 
would have to build a sewage treatment plant on the land if it 
located a prison there 
if negotiations for the property do not resume and the state 
seeks to claim the land through eminent domain the owners can 
contest the states offering price in court michael goldman a 
spokesman for jacobson and striar said the owners would take legal 
action

president reagan and vice president george 
bush seeking to limit public disagreements directed their chiefs 
of staff thursday to coordinate campaign policy pronouncements and 
strategy 
i think everyone agrees that the main issue is no 
surprises presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said in 
describing a luncheon that reagan bush and aides had in the white 
house residence 
keeping them informed of our policy moves and vice versa would 
be a key element he said we didnt talk about specific 
issues 
fitzwater said reagans policy decisions would not be driven by 
consideration of how they would affect bushs prospects 
the president makes his decisions on the merits on what he 
thinks is best for the country he said on the other hand 
its also important to know what the vice presidents positions 
are how the campaign is framing certain actions and so forth 
at the luncheon he said reagan reiterated that he expects bush 
to present his own approach to the problems of the 1990s and 
he said reagan acknowledged their previously reached 
understanding that the vice president will want to take positions 
during the campaign that may differ from the president and 
administration policy 
but the spokesman also said that beginning monday a 
coordinating team headed by white house chief of staff kenneth 
duberstein and bush chief of staff craig fuller will meet at least 
once weekly 
fuller has been sitting in on white house staff meetings but 
the new committee fitzwater said would be aimed specifically at 
making sure neither reagan nor bush is blindsided by the other to 
the extent possible in a campaign in which bush will be on the road 
much of the time 
fitzwater would not say whether formation of the coordinating 
group resulted from differences that have arisen between reagan and 
bush on such issues as the civil rights restoration act and us 
strategy for ousting panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
taking part in thursdays meeting besides reagan bush 
duberstein and fuller were stuart spencer a longtime reagan 
political adviser former sen paul laxalt a reagan confidant lee 
atwater bushs campaign manager pollster robert teeter white 
house political adviser frank donatelli fitzwater and sheila tate 
the bush campaign press secretary 
fitzwater said that reagan outlined to bush the themes he would 
like to strike during campaignrelated appearances including 
patriotism family values military strength less government 
private initiative and lower taxes 
the president feels he can be especially helpful with 
conservative republicans democrats and other key groups which are 
not registered republican but which have voted for the reaganbush 
ticket in 80 and 84 he said 
reagan would like to spend at least two days a week campaigning 
for bush this fall after congress recess around oct 5 fitzwater 
said 
he said reagan may take part in some campaign activities for 
bush on the west coast during the presidents summer vacation in 
august 
bush said at a news conference in boston that joint reaganbush 
appearances were not discussed at the meeting but i would think 
there would be some

agriculture secretary richard e lyng met with 
six farmstate governors thursday and emerged saying the need for 
legislative action to provide drought relief has now become urgent 
theres a need to do something it would probably take 
legislation to do that and theres a need to do it with some 
urgency lyng told a news conference following the session with 
governors and key lawmakers 
lyngs call for swift action was in marked contrast to past 
remarks that congress should hold off on fashioning a drought 
relief package until it is certain of the extent of the damage 
wrought by sizzling temperatures and a shortage of rainfall in the 
farm belt 
since he made those remarks several weeks ago however the 
drought has become more ominous spring wheat oats and barley 
already are hard hit in the grain belt and authorities forecast 
drastic reductions in corn yields unless there is substantial rain 
in the midwest within a week 
its a critical time when the corn is tasseling and were in 
the pollinating stage said iowa gov terry branstad said after 
the meeting every day that goes by we see a substantial 
reduction in yields 
participants in the meeting at offices of the national 
governors association said they reached broad agreement on almost 
all fronts they said farmers need more assurance that congress 
will act this year and that therefore bill drafting should begin 
quickly 
the decision to act i think is uniform among the people who 
were present said north dakota gov george sinner chairman of 
the associations committee on agriculture and rural development 
there also was a uniform decision that congress probably should 
address this 
billdrafting sessions could start as early as next week in both 
the house and senate agriculture committees said the chairmen of 
those panels rep e kika de la garza dtexas and sen 
patrick j leahy dvt 
also on hand were govs george mickelson of south dakota terry 
branstad of iowa rudy perpich of minnesota john ashcroft of 
missouri and james martin of north carolina seven other states 
were represented at the session by their lieutenant governors 
lyng said there were good prospects that president reagan would 
sign relief legislation if it is a measure that is reasonable and 
compassionate and will help farmers 
officials said a consensus was forming around a few key 
proposals that could well be included in relief legislation they 
said the measure most likely would allow farmers to keep all of the 
socalled deficiency payments that they have received in advance 
deficiency payments are incomesupport subsidies they represent 
the difference between the market price of the crop and a target 
price set by congress and adjusted by the secretary of agriculture 
as the drought has intensified crop prices have been rising in 
anticipation of scarcity later thus the gap between market prices 
and target prices has shrunk leaving farmers with smaller payments 
at the same time that their crops have been wiped out forty 
percent of the deficiency payments however already were parceled 
out in advance to producers 
i think it would be very difficult to collect advance 
deficiency payments from farmers who have no income lyng told 
reporters 
the officials also said that producers of nonprogram crops 
should also receive relief under the legislation soybeans 
constitute the largest of these crops whose producers do not 
receive deficiency payments various other fruits and vegetables 
also are nonprogram crops 
the officials were less clear on exactly how much the measure 
would cost 
de la garza and others emphasized that the cost of the drought 
bill would not be able to push the cost of farm subsidies over 
their budgeted 17 billion limit lawmakers are expecting to save a 
considerable sum as a result of the smaller size of deficiency 
payments to many farmers 
this amount in turn could be recycled and paid out in the form 
of drought relief but that still would not take in aid to growers 
of nonprogram crops 
that was discussed in there said rep charles stenholm 
dtexas he said it was unsure where the money would come from 
governors made clear however that some form of relief was 
needed 
farmers in missouri would face a a real economic disaster from 
which they would not recover if we failed to get relief said 
ashcroft we will get relief

standing in front of a rundown motel where 
the government pays for the lodging of homeless families three 
democratic lawmakers on thursday called for a 15 billionayear 
program to create new lowincome housing 
we have a responsibility rep barney frank dmass told 
reporters and homeless activists at the capital city inn a 
washington motel where the government provides room and board for 
the homeless at an estimated cost of 3000 a month per family 
under franks bill about 75 billion would be spent over five 
years for construction of new housing renovation of existing 
buildings upgrading of public housing and the acquisition of 
additional units 
frank joined by reps kenneth j gray dill and floyd flake 
dny said the legislation is not aimed at this year but for 
1989 and the new administration frank said he has not discussed 
the proposal with massachusetts gov michael s dukakis the 
democrats expected presidential nominee 
the lawmakers criticized the reagan administrations cuts in 
housing programs and the increasing government reliance on 
vouchers designed to be used by the poor to go towards paying for 
rents in privately owned apartments they said the vouchers do not 
work in cities such as boston where there are few available 
lowcost housing units 
the legislative program would be selffinancing through a 
doubling of the cigarette tax limiting deductions for business 
meals and entertainment expenses and other tax adjustments frank 
said 
we cannot afford not to build more affordable housing said 
flake homeless are human beings and they have rights too 
the legislation was embraced by homeless activists 
this bill can eliminate this place said mitch snyder 
pointing to the motel where he said families with four and five 
children live in a single room windows in the rooms do not open 
forcing residents to leave doors open at night and making them more 
vulnerable to crime snyder said 
organizers from the community for creative nonviolence said 
parents or older children must stay awake through the night to 
protect infants from rats 
officials at the motel apparently upset by the publicity 
instructed security guards to prevent snyder and the congressmen 
from touring the complex with reporters and tv camera crews in tow 
tell him to have me arrested frank snapped at the guard 
the tour continued without incident 
the group did not go inside any rooms but walked through a 
darkened corridor littered with food and other trash to the back 
where snyder described living conditions 
motel manager fadru haji declined comment let them say what 
they want to say he said its a onesided story 
meanwhile homeless organizers announced plans for 
demonstrations in more than 60 us cities and towns next thursday 
to protest the plight of the homeless 
activists plan to occupy abandoned governmentowned buildings as 
an act of civil disobedience to focus attention on structures that 
go unused while some poor have no place to live 
the community for creative nonviolence said activists also plan 
24hour vigils rallies and marches

the house grappling with one of its most 
sensitive political issues sidestepped a decision thursday on 
whether to let the pentagon shut down unneeded military bases 
the chamber was considering a pair of plans setting up complex 
mechanisms and procedures for closing some of the 3800 military 
installations around the nation pentagon officials estimate that 
between 2 billion and 5 billion annually could be saved by 
shutting unneeded bases 
but after a preliminary test vote the chamber dropped the bill 
in part because the debate had run longer than scheduled house 
members generally do not work past thursday afternoons permitting 
members from western states to return home for electionyear 
campaigning 
for the past 11 years congress has blocked any base closings 
because closings mean lost jobs and lawmakers have been loath to 
see payrolls cut 
but the federal budget deficit has forced congess to take 
another look at the closings and rep william dickinson rala 
noted that this is also a politically opportune time to act 
many things have come together to make this possible 
dickinson said we have a window of opportunity we have a 
lameduck congress we have a lameduck administration a lameduck 
secretary of defense 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has appointed a ninemember 
commission to review the nations military facilities and decide by 
the end of the year which can be closed that commission has been 
meeting for the past two months 
under the two plans considered thursday the commission would 
send its report to president reagan next dec 31 who would then 
have until shortly before he leaves office next jan 20 to either 
accept or reject the entire list the president could not pick or 
choose from among the bases 
then under a plan proposed by rep dick armey rtexas the 
bases would be closed starting jan 1 1990 unless both the house 
and senate voted against the list 
but under the second plan the closings could not go forward 
unless both chambers voted in favor of the plan 
the second plan was backed by three committees which jointly 
agreed to overhaul the original armey plan 
the house in what house armed services committee chairman les 
aspin dwis called a key test of views on the issue voted 
250138 in support of an amendment providing that the base closures 
would go ahead unless both the house and senate vote to block them 
that provision by rep john kasich rohio is similar to the 
plan proposed by armey the amendment was added to the 
committeebacked bill 
rep jack brooks dtexas chairman of one of the three panels 
the government operations committee said congress should have to 
vote to approve any closings 
the armey plan is designed to circumvent the political 
process brooks told his colleagues 
but rep constance morella rmd said the armey proposal is 
the only way we can get this done 
in addition to requiring an affirmative rather than a negative 
vote the committeebacked plan would also require the pentagon to 
come up with plans to restore the environment at each outdated 
base along with new studies about the economic impact of the 
closings 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services 
committee noted that pentagon budgets are declining the 
congress ought to take every opportunity we can to make sure the 
money we spend on defense is spent wisely 
in the decades after world war ii when the nation was winding 
down from a largescale military structure the pentagon was 
generally allowed to do what it wanted on the issue with the 
exception of a handful of bases protected by key powerful members 
between 1961 and 1977 the pentagon closed 3600 installations 
but in 1975 the air force proposed shutting down loring air 
force base in northern maine that states legislators blocked the 
procedure by requiring lengthy and costly environmental impact 
studies for the loring closing and all future closings since 1977 
no major facilities have been shut 
armeys proposal was defeated last year 199192 but he decided 
to try again because circumstances were different 
house approval would send the plan to the senate which voted 
for its own baseclosing plan two months ago 
that proposal creating a 15member commission was attached to 
a pentagon budget bill but was later dropped by the housesenate 
conference committee called to resolve differences between the two 
chambers over the defense budget

vice president george bush hoping to steal 
thunder from michael dukakis is likely to break with tradition and 
go on the road stumping for votes and media attention during the 
democratic national convention 
the plan bush said is to get a little bit of ink while the 
spotlight is on dukakis and his nomination as the democrats 
presidential candidate 
traditionally presidential candidates keep a low profile during 
the nominating conventions of their rivals president reagan still 
playing by those rules although he is not running this year will 
be at his mountaintop ranch in california when the democrats meet 
in atlanta july 1821 
on another campaign matter bush and reagan seeking to limit 
public disagreements directed their chiefs of staff thursday to 
coordinate campaign policy pronouncements 
i think everyone agrees that the main issue is no 
surprises presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said after 
reagan bush and aides met over lunch at the white house 
bush said recently he was debating whether to travel during the 
democratic convention i think probably some but you know i 
dont know i dont know whats the right thing to do 
on the one hand bush said hed get news coverage by being on 
the road 
on the other hand he said you dont want to look like youre 
trying to frantically elbow your way into the news cycle 
tentatively bushs planners are looking at events on monday and 
tuesday and friday and saturday of democratic convention week the 
opening two days of the convention and the two days after it ends 
republicans already are planning to send a team of surrogates to 
atlanta to make sure the media hears their point of view 
sheila tate the vice presidents press secretary said bushs 
schedulers were looking mainly at fundraisers nuts and bolts 
work thats got to get done and its a good time to do it 
she said that wednesday and thursday are the big big days 
for the democrats and you keep them open wednesday night at 
the convention is reserved for the presidential nomination and 
presidential roll call while thursday night is set aside for the 
vice presidential nomination roll call and acceptance speeches 
at this point most polls show the dukakisbush race fairly 
close some surveys show dukakis ahead by about four points while 
others indicate it is even 
with all the attention on the democratic convention dukakis is 
expected to move ahead of bush and come away from atlanta with a 
hefty lead over the vice president perhaps as much as 10 to 15 
points according to richard wirthlin the reagans pollster 
the republicans need some kind of major event giving george 
bush the focus the play the visibility after atlanta wirthlin 
said 
he said an obvious thing for bush to do would be to name his 
vice presidential nominee right after the democratic convention 
robbing dukakis of the opportunity to bask alone in the limelight 
bush has said he has not begun to focus on his running mate yet 
bush talking with reporters on air force ii wednesday night as 
he returned from dallas said he would not be idle after he claims 
the republican nomination at the partys convention in new orleans 
aug 1518 he said he is thinking about having meetings in houston 
on campaign strategy and with surrogates 
he acknowledged that the general election phase of the campaign 
will begin ahead of the traditional labor day opening and talked 
about the demands that will pose 
the physical thing i dont want to get too tired id like 
to get some time off before this last rush to judgment but i 
know physically i can do this he said he was still jogging 
getting tired but i still feel up to it 
so physically im not too worried about it i dont want to 
get tired and make a lot of mistakes bush added and if you do 
get tired as ive found out you can make mistakes 
referring to dukakis who is 54 the 64yearold vice president 
said he will not outwork me might do other things more better 
but hes not going to outwork me he will not be in better shape 
than i am to do the physical part of this thing

droughtstricken counties no longer will have 
to get washingtons approval before approving emergency feed 
programs for livestock producers the agriculture department said 
thursday 
milton hertz administrator of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service or ascs said each county 
committee will have the authority to make the declaration based on 
a determination of substantial feed loss in the county 
previously the procedure required the agencys county 
committees to submit requests for emergency feed help to the state 
office for review if approved the state committee would then 
forward the request to ascs headquarters 
the aid involves the emergency feed program and the emergency 
feed assistance program 
under the emergency feed program the usda pays eligible 
livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace 
that which is normally produced on the farm the emergency feed 
assistance program allows the sale of usdaowned grain at reduced 
prices 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate 
gov terry branstad of iowa told reporters of the change in 
program approval earlier in the day after meeting at usda with 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
the drought counties will not have to make application to 
get approval here in washington for the emergency feed and 
emergency feed assistance program branstad said they can just 
notify usda that they will be providing that assistance on an 
individual farmerby farmer basis 
branstand said that to qualify a farmer will have to show the 
county office of the agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service that he has endured at least a 40 percent loss in normal 
feed stocks 
this is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of 
questions in the country that are hurting the livestock 
producers he said and i think it is a very positive 
development 
as of july 6 the feed programs were approved by usda for 474 
counties in 22 states overall 1844 counties in 37 states are on 
the departments drought list 
the emergency feed programs will now be available in all the 
remaining designated counties at the discretion of county 
committees

attorney general edwin meese iii said thursday 
he wants to be reimbursed for his legal fees from the independent 
counsels investigation and acknowledged that he would have handled 
the wedtech corp matter differently if he had known that this 
was a gang of crooks 
obviously if you had total knowledge of what was going to 
be revealed later then there might be things you do 
differently meese said in an interview with reporters 
for example in the wedtech matter which was handled like i 
would any other if i had known or anybody had known that 
this was a gang of crooks there would have been quite different 
handling of the situation obviously but nobody did know that 
said meese who announced tuesday he will leave government in late 
july or early august 
his reference to crooks apparently was directed at four 
former wedtech executives who pleaded guilty to criminal charges 
and are cooperating in the governments prosecution of rep mario 
biaggi dny and other politicians and businessmen in the 
wedtech scandal 
on the matter of his legal fees meese confirmed that he would 
seek reimbursement from the taxpayers for his expenses in defending 
himself during the investigation by independent counsel james 
mckay the independent counsel submitted his report on the 
investigation on tuesday although the contents of the report have 
not been not been made public meese has said he was vindicated 
because mckay did not seek an indictment 
on his 1987 financial disclosure form issued this week meese 
estimated his legal fees for the first 7 months of the 
investigation at 100000 to 250000 
the ethics in government act under which the investigation of 
meese was conducted provides for reimbursement of fees incurred by 
public officials who arent indicted meese will apply for payment 
of the fees to the threemember federal appeals court panel that 
appointed mckay 
also during the interview with reporters meese insisted that he 
has lived up to the promise he made 3 years ago to the senate 
judiciary committee that he would avoid the appearance of a 
conflict of interest or even a situation in which someone might 
unfairly interpret something as a conflict of interest 
ive adhered to that standard throughout meese said 
he added that obviously there have been things that i 
didnt know about at the time but said that based on 
everything i knew at the time ive upheld that standard 
throughout the time that ive been in office 
as white house counselor in 1981 meese at the behest of 
longtime friend e robert wallach interceded on behalf of the 
south bronx ny defense contractor meese has acknowledged 
directing his staff to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from 
the army in the companys effort to win a 32 million nobid 
enginebuilding contract 
wedtech ended up getting the job and meeses involvement with 
the company has been a major focus of the justcompleted 14month 
criminal investigation of his activities 
meese said in the interview that i did handle many other 
similar matters in the white house when there were complaints made 
or concerns expressed about the treatment being afforded by 
government departments 
while meese wont be indicted he could face an examination of 
his ethics by the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility or the office of government ethics 
wallach is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal and his close relationship with meese formed the 
basis for mckays criminal investigation of the attorney general 
meese said earlier this year that he still regarded wallach as 
his friend but subsequently has declined to answer any questions 
in regard to wallach who has yet to come to trial on the 
indictment

the funeral of the ousted panamanian presidents 
mother in that central american nation could bring the former 
leader out of hiding a consular official said thursday 
eric arturo delvalle recognized by the united states as 
panamas leader has not been seen in public since gen manuel 
antonio noriega replaced him in february with the current acting 
civilian chief of state manuel solis palma 
the body of delvalles mother abigail henriquez de delvalle 
71 was to be flown to panama on thursday evening she died at 
mercy hospital here wednesday of a heart attack a week after 
flying to miami for heart surgery said roberto dominguez panamas 
consul here 
her funeral was set friday and solis palma has said delvalle 
and his family can attend the service without fear of reprisal 
said dominguez 
i understand from family members that delvalle may attend the 
funeral but i have not spoken to him directly he said 
but it could be a trap added dominguez who opposes 
noriega the countrys military leader 
the funeral could be a problem for the united states which must 
decide whether it should protect delvalle he said 
in washington panamas antinoriega ambassador juan sosa said 
thursday the funeral will be private he did not not know if 
delvalle planned to come out of hiding for the service 
he said he has not received communications from the 
illegitimate government of panama about arrangements for 
delvalles safety 
us state department spokesman ben justesen in washington said 
his office had no information on whether delvalle or anyone from 
the us embassy there would attend 
the us embassy in panama refused comment on whether its 
officials would attend the funeral and said they did not know 
delvalles plans 
delvalle was replaced by noriega after he tried to fire him as 
head of the armed forces in the wake of the generals indictment in 
florida on drug charges 
the ouster was never recognized by the united states government 
which cut off funds to panama in an unsuccessful effort to remove 
noriega the reagan administration later offered to drop the 
indictments in return for noriegas departure but the deal fell 
through

a panamanian decision to boycott a scheduled 
meeting of the board that oversees operations of the panama canal 
is regrettable and irresponsible the state department said 
thursday 
the decision was also denounced by william r gianelli board 
chairman of the panama canal commission he accused panama of a 
total disregard for the efficient and safe operation of the 
panama canal 
the commissions next meeting is set for next week in savannah 
ga but panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter said tuesday that 
panamanian representatives will not attend that or any future 
meeting 
that policy ritter said will remain in place until the 
united states normalizes relations with panama and recognizes 
nominees appointed by the government that replaced the one headed 
by president eric arturo delvalle last february 
the reagan administration has continued to recognize delvalle as 
the legitimate authority in panama it also has called on panamas 
de facto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega to resign and to leave 
the country noriega is under federal indictment on drugsmuggling 
charges 
the panama canal treaty established the canal commission 
mandating that it consist of five us and four panamanian members 
gianelli said panamas boycott of the commission meeting 
impacts on training panamanians for higher positions with the 
canal commission and will undoubtedly slow the process of moving 
those outstanding panamanian employees into more responsible and 
senior positions

jesse jackson announced plans thursday to lead a 
threeday jackson action rainbow express bus trip from chicago 
to the democratic national convention in atlanta 
jackson said his presidential campaign also will sponsor 
workshops for people outside the convention hall he said the 
emphasis on nondelegates is intended to strengthen the party not 
steal thunder from the expected democratic presidential nominee 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
jackson was in atlanta thursday to review his convention plans 
and to join local civil rights leaders in work on his political 
action committee the keep hope alive pac 
we will be raising money to put the focus on areas where there 
is need to finance candidates running for various offices to keep 
building our progressive coalition of farmers and workers and men 
and women he said at a news conference 
jackson said he is not organizing a largescale pilgrimage of 
his supporters to atlanta for the july 1821 convention but said 
thousands of people always come 
he said the bus ride probably starting july 14 in chicago will 
allow him to thank his supporters and encourage voter registration 
for the general election 
we just decided to come by bus rather than by airbus we dont 
want a ship to mistake us he said jackson earlier had said that 
sundays downing of an iranian airbus passenger plane by a us 
warship showed american foreign policy should be based more on 
diplomacy than sophisticated weapons 
jackson would not comment on whether his enthusiasm for the 
general election might diminish if he were not asked to be the vice 
presidential nominee but he suggested he will be influenced by the 
treatment his candidacy and platform proposals receive from the 
convention and dukakis 
the conclusion of those steps will in some measure determine 
what our fall activities will be he said

the democratic platform committee will issue 
its streamlined party platform early next week a party official 
said thursday 
although the partys platform writers approved a roughly 
3500word draft platform in denver june 25 they have not yet 
completed the task of polishing the amendments approved at that 
meeting 
the michael dukakis campaign is still negotiating with jesse 
jacksons forces over the civil rights leaders plan to pursue as 
many as 13 minority plants at the partys convention in atlanta 
july 19 
the jackson campaign was rebuffed at the denver meeting on such 
issues as jacksons call for higher taxes on the wealthy a 
pentagon freeze a us promise of nofirstuse of nuclear weapons 
and selfdetermination for the palestinians 
mike barnes a former maryland congressman handling the platform 
for the dukakis campaign said we are continuing to work with 
the committee members and the other campaign trying to resolve 
outstanding issues 
he said purely mechanical reasons had delayed issuing the 
amended majority report people were hard to reach during the 
holiday weekend barnes explained 
a platform committee official who asked not to be identified 
said the entire report including the jackson minority planks may 
be released monday 
the convention starts july 18 in atlanta with the delegates 
scheduled to take up the platform the next day 
jackson controlled more than a quarter of the 186member 
platform committee enough to ensure that he can carry any issue he

here at a glance is a summary of developments thursday in the 
aftermath of last sundays destruction of an iranian jetliner by 
the uss vincennes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a pentagon spokesman said it was extremely unlikely that a 
second iranian airplane was near iran air flight 655 when it was 
shot down it has been suggested that a second plane emitting a 
military identification signal might have prompted the vincennes 
captain to fire on the civilian airliner 
the pentagon backed off from its earlier assertion that the 
iranian airliner was flying outside the commercial air corridor 
pentagon spokesman daniel howard also said that iran should 
share responsibility for the downing of the plane because it took 
off from a joint military and civilian airfield during an exchange 
of fire between the vincennes and iranian gunboats and was headed 
straight at the vincennes

denied pentagon claims the vincennes sent warnings to the plane on 
both ultrahigh frequency and veryhigh frequency radio channels 
he said the navy uses only uhf channels and the airbus received 
only vhf signals 
peroussi also said transponders on the plane emitted signals 
only in a civilian mode not a military mode the pentagon said 
the vincennes received both types of signals from the plane

alexander dubcek whose liberal 
czechoslovak prague spring was ended by a soviet invasion in 
august 1968 urged his countrys current leaders thursday to adopt 
new kremlinstyle reforms 
in a television interview said to be the first with a western 
network since his ouster as communist party chief dubcek called 
the invasion a heavy moral burden on our society 
dubcek 66 lost his party post in april 1969 and was expelled 
from the party in june 1970 
many economic and social reforms supported by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev are similar to those dubcek introduced 20 
years ago 
he now lives as a pensioner in virtual seclusion austrian 
television interviewed him as he worked in his garden at 
bratislava the capital of slovakia about 40 miles east of vienna 
dressed in an undershirt and shorts 
i welcome every positive step which is made for the 
application of soviet restructuring under our conditions the 
former party chief said some people say we cannot use all that 
but in the last 20 years the same people have copied everying from 
the soviet union 
when the late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev was in power 
we had to march the way brezhnev ordered dubcek said 
now the same people czech leaders are very selective when it 
comes to deciding what suits czechoslovakia and what not he 
said there is a certain inconsistency in evaluating the 
experience i believe that what happens in the soviet union now is 
well suited for our conditions 
dubcek deplored the fact that kremlin reform unfortunately 
comes after 20 years in those years he said the existing 
backwardness has deepened and that testifies to the fact that the 
invasion was not right 
asked for comment on the recent communist party conference in 
moscow dubcek said i was always firmly convinced that 
gorbachevs leadership will prevail the conference has confirmed 
that and i am happy about it 
dubcek chided western officials who he said believe it is a 
good thing if socialism ares badly 
on the contrary he said it is better for western democracies 
if the soviet leadership finally and radically distances itself 
from stalinist militarism and departs from brezhnevs dogmatism

a house judiciary subcommittee recommended 
unanimously thursday that the house impeach us district judge 
alcee l hastings for committing high crimes and misdemeanors 
the house criminal justice subcommittee voted 70 to send the 
resolution of 17 articles of impeachment to the house judiciary 
committee for further action the full committee is expected to act 
next thursday 
the resolution charges three main impeachable offenses that 
hastings conspired with a washington attorney to receive a bribe in 
exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers 
that he lied during his trial and that he compromised an fbi 
wiretap by leaking information from it to a target 
it aint over its far from over hastings said at the us 
district courthouse in miami where he had been participating in a 
trial 
hastings floridas first black federal judge and a fiery orator 
popular on the lecture circuit was unusually terse he refused to 
appear on local television newscasts 
saying he is legally morally and spiritually correct 
hastings called the proceedings politically motivated and said the 
panel decision shows they do not respect the jury system 
hastings said he would continue to hear cases because there is 
no reason why he would have to step down 
terence j anderson hastings lawyer said he believes the 
resolution will go to the house floor for a vote as soon as 
possible 
if the full house impeaches hastings the senate would conduct a 
trial to determine whether he should be removed from office 
i was pessimistic but i was surprised by the unanimity 
said anderson 
i take it in good faith that they believe it was an 
impeachable offense anderson said its now time to prepare 
for a trial in the senate 
hastings has insisted he is innocent of any wrongdoing 
the seven members voting for the resolution were chairman john 
conyers dmich don edwards dcalif mike synar dokla rick 
boucher dva john bryant dtexas george w gekas rpa and 
hamilton fish jr rny patrick l swindall rga did not 
attend the session 
conyers who like hastings is black said the decision was the 
hardest he has had to make during his years in congress 
reciting his civil rights record including opposition to 
southern judges who discriminate against blacks conyers said we 
did not fight that civil rights struggle to replace one 
discrimination with another we cannot set up a double standard we 
must demand that everyone live up to high standards 
we are not here to discuss guilt or innocence but whether 
there have been high crimes and misdemeanors and pass them onto the 
full house we have done that conyers said 
gekas said the resolution contains offenses that were 
substantiated fully in the hearings 
fish said the hearings showed that hastings sought to sell his 
office for private gain and then lied about it under oath he 
also said the leaking of the wiretap information cannot be 
tolerated 
the evidence in this matter is overwhelming said synar 
there is no doubt that judge hastings committed these act for 
which he is charged 
in february 1983 hastings was acquitted of charges he conspired 
with washington lawyer william borders to receive a bribe in 
exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers 
borders was convicted in a separate trial was sent to prison and 
has been released 
a month after hastings 1983 acquittal us district judges w 
terrell hodges of florida and anthony a alaimo of georgia filed a 
complaint under the 1980 discipline law asking the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals which includes florida to investigate 
hastings 
after a lengthy inquiry made longer by hastings challenge to 
the laws constitutionality a fivemember panel of the 11th 
circuit recommended that the house begin the impeachment inquiry 
the main charges against hastings before the house criminal 
justice subcommittee were that hastings conspired with borders to 
take a bribe that he had fabricated his defense to secure the 
acquittal at his criminal trial and that he had compromised three 
investigations by leaking the fact that the fbi hada wiretap in the 
cases

new york 
at least 5000 hungarians thronged the small farkasret cemetery 
for the reburial including foreign minister peter varkonyi and 
pianist annie fischer 
bartok one of the leading composers of the 20th century was 
born in 1881 in transylvania he left hungary in 1940 in disgust 
over its close ties with nazi germany and emigrated to the united 
states where he died five years later 
this is a welcome home and a last farewell rolled into one 
solemn ceremony jozsef ujfalussy former director of the franz 
liszt academy of music told the mourners his music created a 
new world that extended mankinds artistic horizons and tends to 
universality 
he set a great human example for mans search for freedom and 
humanity and his remains now return to a nation in quest of a 
newly found selfawareness said ujfalussy author of several 
monographs on bartok 
as part of a unitarian burial ceremony bishop joszef ferencz 
delivered a funeral oration extolling bartoks human qualities and 
moral standing 
a monument of swedish black granite the work of scupltor miklos 
borsos marked the burial place borsos said it symbolizes an 
apotheosis of music the soul as a takingoff bird 
bartok was reburied next to his two wives his mother and an 
aunt and near his greatest friend and collaborator zoltan kodaly 
the remains were exhumed at new yorks ferncliff cemetery june

a religious choir sang the hymn we have placed our faith in 
the lord at the funeral service thursday then ferencz spiritual 
leader of hungarys 10000 unitarians praised bartok for adopting 
the faith in 1916 
this faith is humane tolerance itself very much an embodiment 
of what he stood for as a musician and a man he said 
vice president rezsoe trautmann spoke after the unitarian 
service he criticized some of the dogmatic events of the early 
1950s when bartoks music was oficially frowned upon as 
formalist and effectively disappeared from concert programs 
the return of his remains now is a great solace for the nation 
as a whole trautmann said 
at least 10000 hungarians and hundreds of foreign visitors 
wednesday paid their last respects to bartoks remains at the

more than 40 balloonists from 15 countries 
floated over the negev desert thursday in israels first 
international balloon race with us participants saying the 
weather was perfect for the threeday adventure 
balloonists including 20 from the united states came to israel 
for the threeday international hot air balloon goodwill fiesta 
organized as part of a festival in the negev desert highlighting 
israels 40th anniversary celebrations 
ron bush 48 of lubbock texas said the unpredictable desert 
winds forced him to make an unscheduled stop in a bedouin village 
we found that the winds were taking us quite a way from the 
main road into this village he said we were curious so we 
made a lowlevel flight about six feet off the ground right 
through the village 
when we landed at the edge of the village the boys and the 
men came out to greet us bush said they were very excited 
these people have never seen such a thing he said 
the children shouted ahlan wahsahlan arabic for welcome 
when the balloon touched down on wednesday the first part of the 
race the daily jerusalem post said 
some of the american competitors said quickly shifting desert 
winds provided conditions that were just right for ballooning 
its great for balloonists said bush you can pick a 
current that can take you this way or that way at home the winds 
usually blow in the same direction 
paul smith 32 a lawyer from albuquerque nm agreed the 
wind speed is less than five knots on the ground for a nice easy 
takeoff and a little faster when you get up smith said 
bill arras of redmond ore took the lead wednesday thursdays 
results were not immediately available 
smith said that when he landed at the end of the race wednesday 
he came down next to some camels but they just walked away from 
us 
participants are ranked according to how close they come to a 
target but speed is not essential smith said in a telephone 
interview 
he said the 70foottall balloons can reach an altitude of 
50000 feet although in the current race most floated at about 
2000 feet 
balloonists can only adjust the altitude of their crafts they 
navigate horizontally by latching on to wind currents taking them 
in the right direction 
the takeoff field near tel arad about 35 miles south of 
jerusalem was heavily guarded by israeli troops 
one soldier noted the duty was a nice change from the west 
bank referring to previous tours of duty in israels turbulent 
occupied territories

interior secretary donald p hodel told 
congress on thursday that a white house agency he heads isnt doing 
the job and ought to die a natural death 
the agency is the threemember national critical materials 
council of which hodel is chairman the council was established in 
the executive office of the president by congress in 1984 to report 
within a year on inventories and prospects for certain important 
materials 
among other things the council was supposed to coordinate 
materials research by government agencies 
that couldnt be done hodel said in testifying before the house 
science subcommittee on transportation aviation and materials i 
have gradually and reluctantly come to the conclusion that this is 
not a workable model he said and advised the subcommittee that 
the legislation establishing the council be allowed to lapse 
without renewal in 1990 
it is extremely difficult for a threeperson council to 
move in and take a look at the very heart of missionrelated 
departmental programs and tell the department managers how they 
ought to restructure or structure their research programs there is 
considerable resistance to doing that said hodel 
robert dale wilson until a month ago executive director of the 
council blamed the office of management and budget for delaying 
the councils first report a report hodel said was now at the 
printer 
omb directed me to delete or substantially rewrite all of 
these four factual chapters because and i quote giving these 
facts to congress would be like throwing raw meat to dogs 
wilson said in written testimony 
he did not indicate the specific facts in question but said the 
chapters dealt with the administrations notoriously flawed 
proposal to sell 96 percent of the national defense stockpile a 
discussion of our recently increased dependence on the soviet bloc 
for metals the importance of south african minerals and the 
inequitable and noncompetitive impact of us involvement in 
funding international financial institutions which directly 
subsidize competitors of the us mining industry 
wilson said the american mining industry should be helped by the 
government the council should be retained with a larger budget and 
ombs powers should be reduced i have seen it override decisions 
made by cabinet secretaries who opposed it omb does not want 
the council to survive or to issue its reports in any fashion 
that might be helpful to the public interest quite frankly i do 
not know who is served by their actions 
answering questions from the subcommittee chairman rep dave 
mcgurdy dokla hodel said a single administrator would be 
stronger than a multimember body 
but the councils job he said might better be handled by the 
presidents science adviser because that adviser has experience 
roaming through different departments access to the president and 
just as important access to the office of management and budget

the piper alpha platform destroyed in 
the worst offshore oil rig disaster was an assembly of flatroofed 
structures and steel towers that rose 150 above the water 
it was 215 feet long and 100 feet wide among the largest of the 
123 fixed platforms that dot the british sector of the north sea 
oil field a fire burned constantly at its top flaming off excess 
gas 
the 901 million piper alpha owned by occidental petroleum 
began pumping oil and gas in december 1976 from its location 120 
miles off eastern scotland and was among the oldest of the north 
sea rigs 
last year the 34000ton platform produced a daily average of 
23 million cubic feet of gas and 167200 barrels of oil 
it was linked to four other platforms in one of the most 
profitable sectors of the north sea field discovered in the 1960s 
more than 200 men worked the piper alpha earning up to 1000 a 
week in dangerous jobs they lived on the platform for up to two 
weeks at a time on a duty schedule of 12 hours on and 12 off 
the piper alpha was pinned to the sea bed and supported by steel 
stilts with most of its 649foot height submerged it included a 
helicopter landing pad used to ferry the workers out from aberdeen 
and had lifeboats with a total capacity of 300 people

when questioned during a trip to london about whether the united 
states should offer compensation 
at no time did i say anything that would lend itself to the 
interpretation that i was endorsing the idea wright told 
reporters in his first news conference since returning from the 
weekend trip 
rather wright said any decision on such payments should come 
from president reagan if the president decides to offer 
compensation congress would likely support it he said 
in a national abc newswashington post poll following the 
incident 61 percent of those surveyed said they did not favor 
payment of compensation 
in london on tuesday wright was asked whether the united states 
should offer monetary compensation for the 290 lives lost 
he responded that it was difficult to equate money with lost 
lives but added yes if that would assuage the grief of the 
other aggrieved party surely we could do that congress would 
support that if it were requested 
wright also called the incident a very straightforward error 
of misidentification he told of a time during his service as a 
bombardier in world war ii when what he had thought were us p38 
fighters began to fire on his aircraft its a human error he 
said

the 1979 crash of an air new zealand dc10 
into a mountain in antarctica was the result of crew error and not 
any fault of navy air traffic controllers a judge ruled thursday 
us district judge harold h greene blamed the airline and the 
crew of flight 901 for a series of mistakes that caused the plane 
to fly off course into mt erebus killing all 257 people on board 
greene dismissed 32 million in negligence claims against the 
us government by relatives and heirs of 16 of the 20 crew members 
who died in the nov 28 1979 crash on ross island in antarctica 
the judge blamed the airline for changing the original flight 
plan for the sightseeing trip without briefing the crew he also 
cited the crews failure to use the airliners internal navigation 
device and a weather radar system to determine its location 
were it not for the tragic outcome the planning phase of 
flight 901 could be described as a comedy of errors some of these 
errors were perpetrated by air new zealand others by members of 
the flight crew greene said 
the change in the flight plan put the plane directly in a course 
over mt erebus instead of down the center of mcmurdo sound the 
plan called for flight 901 to avoid the mountain by flying at an 
altitude of 16000 feet 
to give passengers a better view of ross island the plane 
descended without radar assistance to less than 2000 feet in 
violation of air new zealand policy greene said 
it was flying at an altitude of 1500 feet when it crashed into 
mt erebus 
the crew never discovered the change because it never bothered 
to plot the coordinates of the new flight plan greene said nor 
did crew members bother to use the planes internal navigation 
system to determine its geographical location 
had a single crew member performed this simple task at any 
time during the last hour of flight he would have learned that the 
aircraft was not on longitude 165 degrees heading down the open 
sound but on a longitude of 167 degrees heading toward mt 
erebus 
if the crew were more alert it would have noticed that beaufort 
island was to the planes right instead of the left as it would 
have been if flight 901 had flown on the original course greene 
said 
the air traffic controllers at mcmurdo station had no reason 
to suspect that these errors in the most fundamental principles of 
planning and airmanship had occurred and that they had profoundly 
altered what would otherwise have been a safe and uneventful 
flight greene said 
absent such knowledge they had no basis for suspecting that 
flight 901 was in mortal peril or for taking extraordinary 
measures that even the flight crew never requested them to take 
greene said 
the navys air traffic controllers are assigned to mcmurdo 
station to help direct aircraft used in scientific exploration by 
the national science foundation and other organizations

roy carey a survivor of the worlds 
worst offshore oil platform disaster said thursday we had all 
that water around us and no way to get it to us we had sprinklers 
but they werent strong enough 
careys remark as he lay badly burned in a hospital bed in 
aberdeen royal infirmary pointed up a bitter irony of offshore 
oildrilling one of the worlds most dangerous occupations 
the presumed death toll from the explosion and fire wednesday 
night on the piper alpha platform in the north sea exceeded 160 
urgent questions about safety in the offshore oil and gas 
industry are being raised by the disaster which brings to more 
than 300 the number of people who have died in the british sector 
of the north sea since gas was first pumped ashore in 1967 
drilling accidents killed 76 and a helicopter crash killed 45 
last year six workers were killed and 59 seriously hurt among the 
28000 british workers 
three workers from piper alpha died after being thrown into the 
sea when a gangway collapsed in 1982 in 1984 a nonfatal 
explosion and fire forced the evacuation of 174 men 
the platform which has been producing oil since december 1976 
passed its latest annual safety inspection by the energy department 
less than two weeks ago 
smoking and drinking are forbidden on oil platforms and a rescue 
vessel stands by each rig at all times 
john brading a londonbased executive of occidental petroleum 
which operates the platform said workmen had been installing a 
vertical pipe linked to a seabed pipeline that runs to a new oil 
field 
the platform draws mixed oil and gas from under the seabed 
separates them and sends them ashore through separate pipelines 
when a reporter asked if sparks from an oxyacetylene burner 
could have ignited gas supplies passing through the platform 
brading replied it is much too early to draw any conclusions 
a company statement said the fires cause appeared to be a gas 
leak derek ellington one of the survivors said he heard a 
shrieking sound just before the explosion and believed it was gas 
escaping from the separation system 
in parliament lawmaker john prescott of the opposition labor 
party claimed inspection and maintenance of rigs had been reduced 
in recent years insufficient money was spent on training and 
government health and safety legislation did not apply fully to the 
north sea oil and gas industry 
energy secretary cecil parkinson replied that serious north sea 
accidents had declined from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year but that 
is too high a figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure 
that improvement is maintained 
labor unions have complained in the past about the quality and 
avilability of survival gear and too few rescue helicopters they 
see a conflict of interest in making the energy department 
responsible for oil production as well as safety

men jumped from the blazing oil 
platform or slithered down searing pipes as the heat popped windows 
like bubbles but most had no chance and comrades could only watch 
helplessly from a nearby vessel 
it was a case of fry and die or jump and try said technican 
roy carey 45 who leaped into the cold north sea to escape the 
flames that engulfed the giant piper alpha rig after an explosion 
wednesday night 
his face was burned and his arms were in slings i was 
smothered with smoke i could hardly see and couldnt breathe so 
it was over the side or die there he said from his hospital bed 
in aberdeen 
carey said one of the rigs survival boats floated past him and 
three other men 
they grabbed at it and a man aboard held out his hands but i 
couldnt get a foothold the waves were hitting me in my chest i 
didnt want to drag him off so i just stayed in the water 
another boat picked him up half an hour later 
we had all that water around us and no way to get it to us 
to fight the fire carey said we had sprinklers but they werent 
strong enough 
james mcdonald a 50yearold rigger told the aberdeen evening 
express he waited for about 45 minutes in the crews quarters then 
he and three others decided to run for it through doors blocked by 
flames 
i wasnt going to sit down and get burned to death mcdonald 
said you either stayed where you were and burned to death or you 
tried to get out 
he said they fought past men on packed stairways to the lower 
levels of the platform and i just forced my way through the 
flames and slid down a hose and jumped the water was red 
hot mcdonald said 
tony sinnett 34 was on the nearby support ship tharos because 
of a shortage of beds on the piper alpha 
there was nothing that anybody could do he said it was 
totally hopeless it was like the platform had been hit by an 
atomic bomb there was massive mushrooms and flames shooting into 
the air i just thanked god i wasnt on board 
john maxwell another rig worker also watched from the tharos 
as some of the more than 200 workers tried to get off the platform 
we were in our survival suits ready to go to the rescue when 
we saw the drill derrick giving way falling toward the pipe deck 
and possibly on the accommodation crews quarters i dont 
know he said 
if there were men inside then they couldnt have survived 
they couldnt have survived all that heat 
the heat was blowing out the windows panes of glass were 
all cracking off and the ferocity of the heat would suck all the 
oxygen out and the men inside would have smothered it was 
terrible 
bill elder 48 a burly scot who also had been on the tharos 
said he watched men slide down pipes and hoses on the side of the 
blazing platform 
some were swimming from the ship he said i felt 
helpless sick there was panic all around we saw 10 guys waving 
from the deck there was nothing you could do 
he waited at a hotel in a dirty undershirt and blue sweat suit 
cap stuffed in his pocket to tell his story to investigators 
elder arrived in aberdeen by helicopter with other survivors and 
witnesses more than 12 hours after the disaster 
rig worker dave lambert said the deck collapsed as he tried to 
find a way through the flames the cabin slid forward and a hole 
appeared so we made for it and jumped he said we fell in the 
sea it must have been 60 or 70 feet 
it was stay and get toasted or jump and chance it in the 
water said lambert 38 he was in the water several hours before 
a rescue boat reached him 
bill lobben 27 his hand burned one wrist in a cast said he 
was watching a movie when the explosion shook the platform 
we didnt see any flames so i went down and got warm gear and 
a survival suit and then went on the pipe deck he said 
there was a lot of flames and smoke there there were more 
explosions and the rig just dropped suddenly to one side i was 
terrified i shielded myself and jumped into the water 
lobben clung to a piece of debris and swam to the tharos

iraq said its warplanes bombed oil 
targets in southwest iran on thursday while iran announced that 
its air force raided military positions along its southeastern war 
front 
a war communique carried by the official iraqi news agency said 
iraqi bombers destroyed oil installations at imam hassan oilfield 
and ghorah in an attempt to keep iran from using its petroleum 
resources for aggressive purposes 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iranian 
fighterbombers hit iraqi military positions east of basra in 
southwestern iraq 
both agencies were monitored in nicosia 
irna gave no specific casualty toll but said irans air raids 
inflicted substantial losses and casualties upon the enemy 
the iraqi agency said all iraqi air force jets returned safely 
after carrying out 91 combat missions in a campaign to throttle 
irans economic lifeline 
no independent confirmation of the raids was available nor did 
the tehran and baghdad governments immediately comment on each 
others claims 
both iran and iraq reported border skirmishes in various sectors 
of their 730mile front in the nearly 8yearold war 
the iraqis have driven the iranians out of their southern 
bridgeheads on the faw peninsula the salamcheh sector in the south 
and the oilrich majnoon islands north of basra in consecutive 
assaults in the past three months 
the last iranian foothold left on iraqi soil is the northern 
kurdish mountains where the iraqis recently claimed to have 
recaptured more than a dozen peaks in heavy fighting 
from manama bahrain came reports by shipping executives that 
radio monitors picked up a distress signal in the persian gulf on 
thursday from a vessel that identified itself as a romanian 
freighter and gave a location close to irans farsi island 
the executives said however that six hours later they still 
had not determined that it was authentic and thought it might be 
another hoax 
distress signals purportedly sent by two other vessels wednesday 
were not confirmed 
the executives who spoke on condition of not being identified 
said the waterway might be suffering from a wave of hoaxes by 
irresponsible radio operators exploiting the tense situation 
following sundays downing of an iranian airliner by a us 
warship killing all 290 aboard

federal investigators offered a 5000 reward 
thursday for information leading to an arrest in the placing of 13 
homemade bombs under bridges and behind buildings in this community 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms offered the reward 
because of the inherent danger to the public safety caused by the 
explosive devices said spokesman joe thurman 
the bombs were found tuesday in this small southern indiana 
community about 30 miles north of louisville ky some of the 
devices detonated causing small fires but no one was injured 
thurman said investigators continued to canvass the business 
district and neighborhoods searching for clues that might lead to 
a suspect 
we keep hoping each lead we run down is the one but so far we 
dont have any suspects he said 
thurman declined to say whether investigators had been able to 
track down the source of the dynamite used to make the devices 
which were found in paper grocery sacks 
were not going to talk about the device components wed just 
as soon keep quiet about that thurman said its normal 
procedure the people were looking for dont need us to tell them 
what were looking at 
thurman said there were about 35 outside investigators working 
on the case representing the atf the fbi the indiana state 
police and the us army 
its just a big investigation and its taking some time to 
run down the leads thurman said 
life for the 6000 salem residents had returned to normal by 
thursday 
theres no areas blocked off or anything like that thurman 
said as far as i can see things are back to normal other than 
you have a town full of strangers here running around asking 
questions 
he said residents had been urged to report any suspicious 
packages 
we hope there arent any more out there but people should be 
aware that there could be another one out there we hope we got

the chairman of the house banking committee on 
thursday proposed legislation that would permit bank holding 
companies to underwrite many securities 
the longawaited bill from rep fernand j st germain dri 
also would require banks to cash social security and other 
government checks and abolish an agency set up to sell property 
from insolvent savings institutions 
it would reverse in large part restrictions on the mixing of 
investment and commercial banking that have been in place since the 
1933 passage of the glasssteagall act 
securities subsidiaries of bank holding companies would be able 
to underwrite and deal in corporate bonds commercial paper 
municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and 
other kinds of loans 
banks would be precluded from underwriting in two major 
securities areas corporate stocks and mutual funds however the 
subsidiaries would be able to sell mutual funds underwritten by 
others 
the legislation provides for various fire walls to prevent 
losses in the securities affiliate from affecting the safety and 
soundness of bank deposits 
other provisions require securities subsidiaries to be regulated 
by the securities and exchange commission also to prevent any 
confusion by consumers with insured deposits in a bank the 
securities subsidiary could not share a name logo advertising or 
location with an affiliated bank 
this is st germains second try at fashioning a bill that would 
attract enough votes to pass his committee in march a week before 
the senate passed broad legislation including bank underwriting of 
mutual funds and corporate stock st germain offered a much more 
restrictive bill 
the latest effort is more permissive in a statement st germain 
called it a consensus document and predicted it would get broad 
support in his committee and on the house floor aides said a 
committee vote likely will be held by the end of july 
however a spokeswoman for the banking industrys largest trade 
group the american bankers association said bankers who support 
the senate bill are disappointed with the proposal 
the price of paying for new consumer protections far outweighs 
any benefits banks would get from entering new areas aba 
spokeswoman maryliz meany said 
in return for getting new powers banks are being asked to cash 
government checks presented by noncustomers a measure aimed at 
helping social security and welfare recipients who cant afford to 
maintain a bank account they also will be required to offer 
lowfee lifeline checking accounts for depositors with less 
than 1000 
also the bill gives a break to big competitors of banks 
socalled nonbank banks owned by sears and other commercial 
companies which make loans or accept deposits but not both a law 
enacted last summer restricted a nonbank banks growth to 7 
percent a year however st germains legislation would lift the 
limit for two years 
and the bill curbs expansion of banks insurance and real 
estate powers 
an unrelated provision abolishes the federal asset disposition 
association which has been accused of wasting money and doing a 
poor job of disposing of loans and real estate from closed savings 
institutions

independent counsel james mckay said thursday 
he has referred his 830page report on attorney general edwin meese 
iii to the justice department a step which could result in an 
ethics review of meese 
mckay sent the report the result of a 14month criminal 
investigation of the attorney general to solicitor general charles 
fried in frieds capacity as acting attorney general 
fried ultimately will have the authority to turn it over to the 
office of professional responsibility which investigates 
accusations of improper conduct within the justice department 
for now however the special threemember federal appeals court 
which appointed mckay has issued an order which directs that those 
holding copies of the report not discuss it with anyone 
asked whether an ethics review was imminent justice department 
spokesman patrick korten said only that the report is being 
handled in the ordinary course 
acting on an order by the appeals court panel mckay also sent 
the report to meeses lawyers nathan lewin and james rocap who 
refused to take reporters telephone calls a secretary in their 
office citing the court order said the attorneys werent 
permitted to discuss the report with anyone 
mckay said april 1 that if he decided that no criminal 
prosecution of meese was warranted he would refer all the matters 
he had investigated to the appropriate administrative 
authorities 
when meese announced his plans tuesday to leave the government 
in late july or early august his aides said there wouldnt be an 
office of professional responsibility probe because of the attorney 
generals impending departure on wednesday however after other 
justice department sources disputed that assessment korten 
acknowledged that an ethics review by opr was possible 
opr has the power to recommend sanctions ranging from reprimand 
to dismissal but it also in the past has conducted reviews of 
employees who were leaving the department 
the justice departments deputy attorney general harold 
christensen and associate attorney general francis keating 
outrank fried but are filling their jobs on an acting basis 
therefore the report was referred to fried 
mckay said anyone who believes he or she is named in the report 
and wishes to respond should notify the independent counsels 
office which will provide the portion of the report relating to 
that person 
mckays office launched a criminal investigation of meese on may 
11 1987 and ended it tuesday by submitting the report to the 
court 
the independent counsel has been examining the involvement of 
meese at the request of his longtime friend e robert wallach 
with scandalplagued wedtech corp in 1981 and 1982 when meese was 
white house counselor mckay also has been looking into meeses 
involvement again at wallachs behest on behalf of a 1 billion 
proposed iraqi oil pipeline project in 1985 
mckay reviewed the attorney generals meetings with and decision 
on behalf of executives of the regional bell telephone companies at 
a time when he held 14000 in telephone stock 
the independent counsel also looked into the fact that members 
of a washington real estate family through a foundation arranged 
to pay a 40000ayear salary for meeses wife while leasing 
office space to the justice department 
wallach was involved with meese in both the phone stock and mrs 
meeses job

launchings of the new submarinebased missile authorities said 
the 44foot 237million missile carrying a dummy warhead 
package blazed away from a land launch pad at 638 pm edt after 
a flawless countdown and darted quickly into heavy clouds but the 
navy later issued a statement reporting a problem developed during 
firststage flight 
the range safety officer sent a radio signal 60 seconds after 
liftoff to blow apart the missile so that pieces would fall 
harmlessly into the atlantic ocean and not threaten land the navy 
said 
the statement said the cause of the malfunction could not be 
determined immediately 
the threestage trident 2 was to have hurled its warhead package 
to an atlantic ocean target several thousand miles to the 
southeast the weapon has a range of nearly 6000 miles but its 
intended range thursday night was not disclosed 
the test was the 13th of 20 land pad launches planned here to 
be followed by at least five submarine launch tests the weapon is 
scheduled to become operational late next year 
the test program began in january 1987 and reeled off nine 
straight successes before logging a failure last january it had 
recorded two more successes before thursday nights malfunction 
each trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to 
different targets there are to be 24 of the weapons aboard each of 
nine planned trident submarines

the senate on thursday adopted a 143 billion 
fiscal 1989 foreign aid bill that would revive us contributions 
to the world bank which makes development loans to third world 
countries the vote was 7515 
the measure has been remarkably without controversy this year 
in part because of last years agreement between congress and 
president reagan that smoothed the way for this years money bills 
if signed into law the bill would be the first freestanding 
foreign aid money bill to be completed since 1981 since then aid 
money has been rolled into large omnibus spending measures each 
year 
the senate version would provide 71 million as the us 
contribution to a recapitalization of the world bank under a new 
fiveyear commitment to boost lending authority 
the senate rejected an attept by sen j gordon humphrey 
rnh to withhold the aid unless the bank changed its practices 
to make loans no more favorable than those available from other 
sources to us borrowers 
but the senate did adopt an amendment offered by sen phil 
gramm rtexas to withhold 12 billion in us contributions to 
all multilateral development banks if needed to meet next years 
deficitreduction target 
the house version of the bill which was approved may 25 does 
not include the world bank contribution and would need additional 
authorizing legislation before the money could flow 
the legislation is the primary vehicle for us economic and 
military aid to friendly foreign countries as usual the largest 
chunk of aid goes to israel which would get 12 billion in 
economic and 18 billion in military assistance egypt is the 
secondlargest recipient with 815 million in economic and 13 
billion in military aid 
other major aid allocations include the philippines which would 
get 125 million in military aid 124 million in economic aid and 
40 million for development 500 million to an african development 
fund 101 million to an international drug control program turkey 
would receive 500 million in military aid and greece 350 million 
in central america el salvador would receive 185 million in 
economic support guatemala 80 million costa rica 90 million 
and honduras 85 million 
the bill also would continue a ban on aid to panama where 
strongman gen manuel antonio noriega continues to defy us 
efforts to remove him from power including elimination of panamas 
lucrative us sugar sales quota 
the bill also includes a cut in aid to pakistan which would 
receive 210 million in economic and 220 million in military aid 
the total is 10 million less than the house earmarked and 60 
million less than the administration requested 
pakistan has received favorable treatment in recent years 
because of its status as a conduit for us aid to the antisoviet 
rebels in neighboring afghanistan as the soviet union withdraws 
its troops some in congress are beginning to call for a 
reexamination of us aid 
in addition the bill makes available 50 million to aid afghan 
refugees and 362 million for other refugee programs 157 million 
for the peace corps 40 million for an international program to 
combat aids and 1 million for the solidarity trade union in poland

a spokesman for irans foreign ministry 
on thursday denied statements by us secretary of state george p 
shultz that iran recently tried to open direct talks with 
washington it was reported 
the official islamic republic news agency agency monitored in 
nicosia said the foreign ministry dismissed claims by shultz that 
iranian officials had sent messages through third parties 
indicating a desire to open diplomatic discussions with the united 
states 
the unidentifed foreign ministry spokesman described shultzs 
claim as futile efforts to divert world public attention from 
sundays downing of an iranian passenger airliner by a us missile 
cruiser in the persian gulf all 290 people aboard the jetliner 
were killed 
the new york times published a report wednesday quoting shultz 
as saying weve had a number of probes from iran through 
various third parties saying that theyd like to talk with us and 
weve responded to those 
the newspaper said shultz declined to identify the iranian 
officials involved and that he would not speculate on what effect 
the airliner attack might have on the previous proposal 
the iranian spokesman said shultzs report also aimed at cooling 
down the fury of the iranian people over the us crime and 
legitimizing its illegal military presence in the gulf

apple consumption in the united states has 
risen to a record 20 pounds per person this year good news for 
growers saddled with last years largest crop in history the 
washington apple commission said thursday 
the nation has produced about 130 million 42pound boxes of 
apples this season with washington growing about 67 million of 
those the commission reported 
we never had the supply nationally to really find out if 
people would eat more apples said charles st john spokesman 
for the industry marketing group based in wenatchee 
a lot of skeptics have said the industry cannot increase apple 
production because americans will not eat more apples st john 
said this year weve found that people will eat more apples 
using its own unofficial projection methods the commission has 
determined that apple consumption will be 216 pounds per person 
this year up significantly from last years 184 pounds per 
person st john said 
that is the only time since 1970 date of the earliest research 
that apple consumption has topped 20 pounds per person he said 
normal consumption since 1970 has been 17 to 18 pounds per 
person with a high of 199 pounds in 1975 which was another 
bumper crop year st john said 
consumption has been pushed up this year by the combination of a 
massive crop low prices and extensive marketing activities 
washingtons 67 million boxes in 1987 easily eclipsed the 
previous years record of 55 million boxes 
but the huge crop lowered prices to below the 950 per box cost 
of production for much of the year 
only since the first of the month have prices jumped up and 
currently are up to 19 per box for top grades according to market 
news service 
this year has been an economic disaster from the growers 
perspective said st john although the consumption projections 
provide a silver lining in that dark cloud 
the current apple season ends in august when the remaining 44 
million boxes of washington apples still in storage will be gone 
st john said 
early projection for the 1988 crop indicate it will be smaller 
because of this years low prices and because irrigation water 
supplies in the yakima valley are lower than normal due to last 
years northwest drought 
the projections were created by the commission which used 
production reports from around the nation subtracted known exports 
and divided the remainder by the nations population st john 
said we came as close as we can to a true domestic consumption 
figure he said 
washington which accounts for about 90 percent of apple 
exports has shipped a record 122 million boxes to other nations 
so far this year well above last years 52 million boxes 
the us consumption figure does not take into account imports 
from other nations so consumption may actually be higher st john 
said 
the projections assume all apples shipped to the fresh market 
are sold and do not include apples processed into juice applesauce 
and other products he said 
the amount of apples sold for processing for less money varies 
each year and depends on how many were undesirable for the fresh 
market because of weather damage or undesirable color about a 
quarter of washingtons crop usually goes to processors but up to 
a third of the 1987 crop was unfit for the fresh market in other 
growing areas up to half of the crop may go to processors

a bomb placed by a gang of 
gunmen exploded against the inside wall of a public swimming pool 
building thursday killing two people and wounding four police 
said 
the royal ulster constabulary said the bomb apparently was meant 
to bring the wall down on a security patrol that was passing by in 
the falls road a predominantly roman catholic area of west 
belfast but the timing was wrong 
the explosion missed the patrol and all the casualties were 
civilians including a 4yearold girl who was slightly injured 
a police spokesman said a group of armed men came into the 
building and ordered swimmers to leave they held the pool staff at 
gunpoint while they placed the explosive device police said the 
gunmen escaped and the bomb exploded a while later 
those killed in the explosion were a 60yearold woman and a 
24yearold man police said 
asked if anybody telephoned to warn police about the bomb in the 
interval between the gunmens escape and the explosion a police 
spokesman said youll have to draw your own conclusion about 
that 
the falls road is a guerrilla stronghold and the implication of 
the spokesmans comment was that no warning was telephoned either 
because those involved feared guerrilla reprisals or because they 
sympathized with the guerrillas cause 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility but police said 
it bore the hallmarks of an attack by the outlawed irish republican 
army the mainly catholic ira targets security forces in its 
guerrilla war to end british rule in predominantly protestant 
northern ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic 
republic of ireland under socialist rule

giant chunks of debris from what had been his department store 
owner bernard levine voiced amazement at being alive 
i was lucky god was with me not a scratch he said 
at least seven people died and 60 were injured when the roof of 
levines threestory amigo store collapsed during a driving 
rainstorm 
three hundred rescue workers using everything from dump trucks 
to wheelbarrows carefully dug into the debris hoping to find 
survivors 
i need an ax one worker high on the pile of debris shouted 
in english then spanish 
hundreds of onlookers held back by police sawhorses strained 
to get closer to the site 
as police sgt dean poos prepared to brief reporters a woman 
approached and asked in heavily accented english children 
no children the policeman replied somberly 
us border patrol and customs agents brought in dogs which 
usually hunt drugs to search for people possibly trapped 
the rubble crushed cinderblocks broken brick and glass 
twisted steel was speckled with remnants of merchandise levine 
had been selling moments before disaster struck 
tshirts caps hats a little girls dress were strewn in with 
the piles broken concrete

democrat michael dukakis on thursday questioned 
republican george bushs rather late commitment to affirmative 
action and accused the vice president of breaking his pledge not to 
support new taxes 
dukakis before heading west for three days of presidential 
campaigning also called again on president reagan and bush to 
support trade legislation that includes a plantclosing 
notification provision 
he refused to say whether he would select a running mate next 
week but with democratic national convention less than two weeks 
away conceded he would have to make up his mind in the not so 
distant future 
bush the presumed republican nominee promised wednesday that 
he would appoint a hispanic to his cabinet if elected president 
it strikes me that this is a rather late commitment said 
dukakis who made a similar pledge a year ago i dont know where 
he has been for the past eight years 
like bush dukakis refused to extend an absolute commitment to 
women and other minority groups but invited examination of his 
state appointments and said his record on affirmative action stood 
in dramatic contrast to the reaganbush administration 
i expect to have women black citizens hispanic citizens 
dukakis said 
dukakis flew to dallas where he spoke to the annual convention 
league of united latin american citizens or lulac a day earlier 
bush spoke to the same group and made his pledge to appoint a 
hispanic american to his cabinet 
the massachusetts governor continued to jab at bush 
some people think its enough to wake up after eight years and 
then promise opportunity for one hispanic i want to stand with you 
and create opportunity for 20 million hispanic citizens across the 
country he said 
ive campaigned fom one end of this country to another and i 
know that we americans are ready for a change dukakis added 
were tired of waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few 
privileged neighborhoods into our cities and into the small 
communities of rural america 
dukakis made some of his remarks in spanish 
earlier in boston dukakis said bush had broken his pledge to 
oppose any new taxes by supporting a provision of the trade bill 
that calls for 1 billion in taxes for job training programs and 
catastrophic health care legislation that included 6 billion in 
taxes on elderly people who opt for the comprehensive care 
so much for ironclad no tax commitments said dukakis who 
himself had to renege on a notax pledge in his first term as 
governor 
bush who was in dukakis hometown for the day hit back 
im against raising taxes and i think recent events here in 
this state that i dont plan to go into demonstrate we have a 
different view on taxes he said that was a clear reference to 
dukakis recent signing of a cigarette tax and the governors 
support for another taxhike measure 
the bush campaign also quarreled with dukakis assertion 
the vice presidents campaign pledge not to raise tax is 
ironclad and its not going to change added mark goodin a bush 
spokesman he said neither of the proposals dukakis mentioned 
involved tax increases 
he is dead wrong on both counts and he is trying to blow smoke 
into the room goodin said 
reagan earlier this year vetoed major trade legislation because 
it contained a provision requiring employers to give 60 days 
notice before closing plants the measure has won overwhelming 
senate approval for a second time and is awaiting action in the 
house 
the president opposes it the vice president opposes it i 
dont know why dukakis said 
dukakis said american workers deserved such notice and said the 
issue represented the fundamental difference in what a democratic 
administration would mean to this country 
dukakis has been dogged at home by a fiscal 1988 deficit and a 
struggle to balance the budget for fiscal 1989 which began last 
week 
legislation to erase the defict and close the books on fiscal 
1988 is working its way through he legislature although portions 
of the administrations plan remain controversial and a compromise 
on the new budget was reached wednesday 
dukakis said he expected final passage of both by the end of 
next week 
if there is one thing we are committed to doing in this state 
it is to making sure we have a strong fiscal foundation dukakis 
said 
some local dukakis critics have contended that the governor has 
been late dealing with budget problems because he is preoccupied 
with his search for a running mate a process which included 
interviews with eight contenders in the past two weeks 
georgia sen sam nunn removed himself from consideration 
dukakis said that none of the remaining seven have been ruled out 
they are sens john glenn of ohio albert gore jr of tennessee 
lloyd bentsen of texas and bob graham of florida reps richard 
gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton of indiana and jesse jackson 
paul brountas dukakis campaign chairman and closest adviser 
has been in washington this week researching the vice presidential 
contenders and is expected to remain there through friday dukakis 
is due back in boston late saturday 
dukakis aides expect dukakis and brountas to meet during the 
weekend and predict an announcement next week

a navy petty officer charged 
with murdering a disbursement officer during the robbery of a 
94000 payroll had plenty of money and was wrongly accused his 
lawyer said thursday in opening arguments 
petty officer 1st class ruben colon 34 had saved more than 
100000 and was preparing to leave the service after 15 years the 
attorney lt matthew michels told a courtmartial panel 
however prosecutors told the fiveofficer panel that colon was 
tailed by navy investigators to the bank where 87000 in cash and 
2575 us treasury checks were found in a safe deposit box rented 
in colons name 
colon of vega baja puerto rico faces the death penalty if he 
is convicted of the murder charge the navy has not executed anyone 
since an 1849 mutiny 
lt jg ratish prasad disbursing officer of the destroyer john 
hancock was bound strangled and shot with a 38caliber handgun 
march 15 in a robbery of the warships payroll the weapon has 
never been found 
michels argued there was nothing to link his client to the 
slaying or to the items found in the safe deposit box 
there are no fingerprints on the money or checks or the safe 
deposit box said michels calling the governments case purely 
circumstantial 
evidence submitted to the court shows that colons drivers 
license was used as proof of florida residence to purchase a 
38caliber revolver three days before the robberymurder 
but store clerk cheryl crismas of southside guns who testified 
said she sold the weapon march 12 said she listed the purchaser as 
ruben cohen and she couldnt identify the defendant in court 
dr bonifacio floro deputy chief medical examiner for the city 
of jacksonville conducted an autopsy on the victims body and 
concluded that the primary cause of death was a gunshot fired at 
pointblank range into prasads left temple he said the victim was 
probably kneeling when he was shot in the head 
larry d smith of the florida department of law enforcement 
crime lab testified the ropes that bound prasads feet and neck 
were similar to rope found in colons apartment but smith said he 
could find no fiber evidence from the victims clothing or the 
crime scene to match that of the defendants 
investigators had two primary suspects that should still be 
suspects michels said 
the prosecutor lt daniel glary told the jury that colon 
bought a 38caliber revolver three days before the robberymurder 
he also said witnesses will testify that colon lied about his 
movements during and after the slaying 
much of the governments case is circumstantial but the 
case against this defendant is devastating glary said 
colon who was marine corps military police officer before his 
navy service is a qualified weapons expert and was an electronic 
warfare technician for the navy 
he is also charged with the victims kidnapping which carries a 
life sentence robbery with a 15year sentence and receiving 
stolen property with a threeyear sentence 
it takes a vote of at least four of the five jurors to convict 
on any of the charges but the death penalty cannot be considered 
unless the murder conviction is unanimous 
the prosecution said it would introduce a bank witness who will 
testify that colon rented the box in which the cash and checks were 
found by agents of the naval investigative service the agents were 
tipped off by bank officials who became suspicious about renting 
out their largest box to a sailor 
shortly after the robberyslaying colon took leave and told 
friends upon his return that he was going to leave the navy so he 
could provide a better living for his family 
michels told jurors that colon had fathered a child seven years 
ago while stationed in the philippines and that the mother had 
recently joined him here 
colon was arrested april 12 almost a month after the crime 
the judge cmdr john a studer said he expected the military 
trial to last about two weeks

the nations two largest financial markets took 
a joint step thursday toward averting another stock crash 
proposing reforms that include special attention to small investors 
and coordinated trading halts when the dow jones industrial average 
falls 250 points 
the announcement by the boards of the new york stock exchange 
and chicago mercantile exchange addressed many of the key issues 
raised by government studies on the causes of the october crash 
particularly the need for cooperation between the nations 
financial markets 
it also marked the most comprehensive action yet taken by the 
securities industry to reform itself since then and convince 
millions of crashburned investors that the markets are safe and 
fair 
had the joint measures been in place oct 19 the unprecedented 
508point plunge in the dow average would have been averted 
we have developed a program of coordinated procedures which 
serve the current needs of financial markets cme chairman leo 
melamed said these combined initiatives demonstrate our 
commitment to serving the needs of all investors and ensuring a 
level playing field for all market participants 
nyse chairman john phelan said that although markets have 
returned to more normal patterns there is still a perception 
that individuals are at a disadvantage in todays highspeed 
markets the initiatives approved by the boards should overcome 
that concern 
all of the initiatives must be approved by the securities and 
exchange commission which oversees the nations stock markets and 
the commodities futures trading commission which regulates the 
futures markets 
the steps include a system for expediting trading orders of 
individual investors to the nyse floor on heavy trading days 
during the crash many individuals were unable to sell their stock 
quickly because the markets system was clogged with sell orders 
from large institutional investors 
both exchanges also proposed a oneyear experimental system of 
coordinated circuit breaker mechanisms to forestall panicky 
selling when the dow average is falling rapidly 
under this system which must be approved by other markets and 
the securities and exchange commission all trading on the nyse 
would be halted for an hour if the dow average falls 250 points 
and for two hours if the average falls an additional 150 points the 
same day 
at the cme the key standard amp poors 500 stockindex future 
could fall a maximum 30 points before trading would be halted a 
twohour halt would be called if the sampp index future fell another 
20 points the same day 
if the sampp index fell a total of 50 points in one day that 
market could not reopen but the nyse would have the option of 
reopening after a twohour halt 
the experimental reforms are aimed at taming the wild price 
swings in both markets that some crash studies have attributed to a 
trading method called index arbitrage in which brokerages use 
large computers to sell stocks and buy stockindex futures or vice 
versa to profit from momentary price discrepancies 
the nyse implemented a temporary measure called the collar 
in february aimed at quelling the effect of index arbitrage 
the collar banned use of the nyses computer system for that 
method on days when the dow average rose or fell 50 points from the 
previous close but its effect was controversial some critics said 
that it worsened volatility by severing an important link between 
the cash and futures markets 
phelan said the new measures would supercede the collar limit 
which is scheduled to expire in august but he said the nyse 
reserved the right to impose additional restrictions if volatility 
returned

police said thursday they had few clues to 
who punctured orange juice cartons with hypodermic needles at three 
suburban markets this week and left notes warning of poison 
a national expert on product tampering warned that widespread 
news coverage of the cases could prompt copycat crimes and 
noted there were more than 700 reports of product tampering across 
the country last year 
no one drank from any of the juice cartons discovered monday 
tuesday and wednesday at three supermarkets within a few miles in 
the san fernando valley suburbs police tests were incomplete but 
one grocery store test cleared the first carton of cyanide 
contamination 
investigators have yet to find anyone who saw any of the 
tampering and are hampered in fingerprint checks because of the 
number of people who handle cartons in stores said police lt fred 
nixon 
were treating it as very high priority despite the fact that 
we dont know for certain that there is contamination present in 
either case its still a crime nixon said 
police advised consumers particularly near the affected stores 
25 miles northwest of downtown to check cartons before buying 
the three supermarket chains involved vons hughes and alpha 
beta all stepped up security in stores in the area company 
spokesmen said involved were two national orange juice brands 
coca cola cos minute maid and procter amp gambles citrus hill 
in each case a twoquart carton of orange juice was removed 
from the refrigerator case and punctured with the needle from a 
hypodermic syringe the cartons with the needles still attached 
were found by customers or employees on shelves elsewhere in the 
markets each with a note attached suggesting poison had been 
injected 
california law makes threats of tampering with food or drugs a 
misdemeanor and actually contaminating a product a felony the fbi 
is evaluating the case to see if federal felony tampering statutes 
apply said spokesman fred reagan 
investigators withheld some details of the tampering to make it 
easier to identify possible imitators 
research suggests that one nationally publicized case of product 
tampering leads to 30 copycat crimes across the country said 
park elliott dietz a psychiatrist at the university of virginia in 
charlottesville who studies such cases and has consulted for the

the major determinant of how many cases there will be in the 
next three months is how widely this is publicized dietz said in 
a telephone interview the consensus of how to handle this is to 
make sure the public is informed about potential risk in that 
geographic area 
according to statistics from the food and drug administration 
threatened and actual product tampering increased ninefold in 1986 
to 1698 reported cases after the death of a new york woman who 
took a poisoned tylenol pain capsule 
in 1987 the fda received 774 consumer complaints of tampering 
with food drugs and other regulated products and confirmed 84 
cases of tampering with packages or their contents 
cases of threats combined with some form of tampering as in the 
california incidents are much more rare said richard swanson 
director of emergency operations for the fda he wasnt able to 
provide statistics on such cases

striking movie and tv 
scriptwriters announced thursday they overwhelmingly approved an 
interim contract that will put writers back to work for at least 13 
production companies including the makers of the rambo movies 
members of the writers guild of america who cast ballots 
wednesday night in new york and los angeles approved the interim 
pact by an 81 margin union president george kirgo said thursday 
this will help bring this town back to work kirgo said 
referring to the 18week strike that has stalled production in 
hollywood and forced postponement of the start of the fall 
television season 
the interim contracts with independent producers are a union 
effort to split the ranks of the industrys bargaining group the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers 
thirteen companies have already signed the new deal including 
carolco pictures makers of the rambo movies and actress 
shelly duvalls platypus productions inc union officials said 
the significance of this vote for the industry is that there 
is one remaining obstacle to getting this town back to work and 
its not the writers guild of america said brian walton 
executive director of the unions western division 
walton predicted that the new interim agreement in conjunction 
with a previously approved independent contract would mean 300 to 
500 writers would resume work in coming weeks 
walton said the producers alliance is pressing independent 
companies to spurn the interim pact 
the union earlier approved a different independent contract and 
as of thursday 124 mostly small production companies had signed 
that pact 
abc and cbs officials said earlier thursday they wouldnt use 
any programming made by independent producers nbc and fox 
broadcasting co officials had said they would not enter into new 
deals with independent production companies that signed contracts 
with the wga during the strike 
we strongly believe that the economic issues remaining in this 
labor dispute with the wga are directly related to the longterm 
viability of the television industry abc entertainment president 
brandon stoddard said through a spokeswoman 
we feel that independent production companies tempted to sign 
the interim agreements would be prolonging the strike and 
contributing to further industry uncertainty without gaining any 
real advantage she said 
cbs completely supports the industry position in its dealings 
with the writers guild we do not believe it is in the best 
interests of any producer to sign the interim agreement the wga is 
offering in support of that position we will not enter into any 
new agreements for product produced under the interim wga 
agreement the network said in a statement issued thursday 
the economic issues in this labor dispute bear importantly on 
the continued health of our entire industry it is clearly in 
everyones best interest to end this strike as soon as possible we 
believe that acceptance of the wga interim agreement will prolong 
this strike to the disadvantage of all the statement said 
nbcs greatest hope is that this lengthy strike comes to a 
swift settlement and the writers go back to work we dont feel we 
are in a position to give economic or business advice on a series 
of complex issues nbc said in a statement released in new york 
nbc earlier had confirmed separate agreements to continue 
production of the cosby show a different world alf 
highway to heaven and amen 
guild leaders believed a model interim contract could be used to 
lure a studio network or additional small production companies to 
break ranks with the alliance more than 100 independent production 
companies have already signed interim contracts with the wga 
allowing some writers to go back to work 
among those who have been able to resume writing is cartoonist 
garry trudeau writer of the tanner 88 series on cable 
televisions home box office 
the strike started march 7 after the two sides could not agree 
on payments for television reruns and foreign television 
syndication 
meanwhile 20th century fox studios said it was imposing forced 
vacations on several hundred employees beginning july 11 the wga 
strike has placed the start of the fall television season in 
jeopardy and has resulted in sweeping layoffs among californias 
230000 entertainment industry employees 
the alliance has stated publicly that its last contract offer 
rejected by the wga on june 22 by a 31 margin was final

republican george bush campaigning on michael 
dukakis home turf hailed the ethnic background of his democratic 
rival before an audience of greekamericans thursday and disavowed 
any responsibility for an attack against dukakis on religious 
grounds 
i know how proud you are of michael dukakis bush said in a 
speech to a conference of laity and clergy of the greek orthodox 
church 
what a tribute it is to greekamericans to our political 
system and to this great country of ours that we find it totally 
natural that the son of an immigrant is one of two men still 
contending to be president of the united states said bush 
certain to be the republican nominee 
bush got a warm reception from the audience of several thousand 
of dukakis fellow greek americans his address was delayed more 
than 45 minutes until after 10 pm by other speakers and the 
singing of greek songs he joked to the audience that it was wise 
to have dukakis and himself appear on different days 
too much charisma can be dangerous to your health he said 
to laughter 
at a news conference earlier bush turned aside questions about 
dukakis role as massachusetts governior in handling the states 
budget and overseeing its economy 
i dont want to get into these details said bush who on 
other occasions has relished attacking dukakis i prefer to be 
positive and tell you what to do to lead this country 
the vice president was asked his view of a widely distributed 
letter written by james jatras a staff member of the senate 
republican policy committee and a greek orthodox church layman who 
called dukakis a renegade an outcast for his positions and for 
his marriage to a jew 
im not going to get into that said bush that did not 
emanate from me and i had never heard of it before 
archbishop iakovos the primate of the greek orthodox church in 
the americas has said the attack was extremely unjustified and 
that dukakis was a steadfast son of the church 
in his speech bush identified with the values of the 
greekamerican community family faith education hard work 
those are the keys and no one knows it better than you he said 
its the same message you preach in your homes the same way i 
was raised the same way barbara bushs wife and i raised our 
family 
while praising dukakis heritage and saying he did not want to 
criticize him bush went on to do exactly that saying the two 
candidates had a different view on taxes 
the massachusetts governor recently signed a cigarette tax 
bush also said he would try to make clear who has the most 
experience who is best to sit down with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
the vice president added that the reagan administration has 
achieved the only arms control agreement in the nuclear age to 
eliminate an entire category of weapons when some were sitting up 
here saying freeze freeze lock in soviet superiority with a 
thousand warheads and zero for the united states 
on another matter dear to greekamericans bush expressed hope 
for a resolution of greekturkish differences over cyprus 
he said the administration encourages dialogue we pray for 
reconciliation and we seek for cyprus a constitutional democracy 
based on majority rule the rule of law and the protection of 
minority rights he said 
at his news conference bush said his strategy with the help of 
surrogates will be to put dukakis record on public display he 
said one recent poll found that twothirds of the people surveyed 
thought dukakis was more conservative than bush 
theres something wrong with that bush said the issues 
are not in focus i honestly believe that the country doesnt 
yet fully appreciate where the governor stands on a lot of key 
issues 
bush faulted himself for not making clear what makes me tick 
inside 
he said ive not felt too comfortable talking about the 
private side of the bush family and all of that what it means to 
me the loss of a child whatever it might be 
i now have concluded that i have to make clear what makes me 
tick inside he said referring to a speech wednesday before a 
hispanic audience in which he talked at some detail about his life 
bush said i was trying to say look i understand this is 
what motivates me heres the inner side 
he jokingly said he wasnt trying to draw a contrast that 
weve got 12 grandchildren and hes dukakis working for one 
however the vice presidents wife quickly corrected him on the 
number of grandchildren and bush said make that 10

the reagan administration on thursday combed 
through a pretty long list of candidates for attorney general 
in hopes a successor to edwin meese iii can be nominated before 
congress recesses late next week for the democratic national 
convention 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house is 
moving as rapidly as possible but its not the end of the 
world if the search goes beyond the convention recess the 
democrats meet in atlanta july 18 
with another recess scheduled for the republican convention in 
midaugust it appears that only the least controversial of 
prospects could be confirmed before september meese long an 
object of campaign debate has said he will leave office in late 
july or early august now that he has been vindicated by an 
independent counsels decision not to seek an indictment against 
him 
some successor prospects would have to undergo a vigorous fbi 
background check but others already have been investigated for 
other toplevel positions and their reviews would only need to be 
updated according to fbi spokesman bill carter 
the ideal time for an early confirmation vote would appear to be 
in the first two weeks of august before the gop convention break 
the senate doesnt plan to return until the second week of 
september 
the judiciary committee which would conduct the confirmation 
hearing already has a heavy schedule the last week in july 
including confirmation sessions for those nominated as top justice 
department deputies 
theyve got time to get somebody in but it depends who its 
going to be said sen patrick j leahy dvt who has presided 
at the committees judicial confirmation hearings 
if they go with competence rather than ideology they can get 
somebody in easily with the right person it can be done in august 
everybody would bend over backwards to work it out but nobodys 
going to rubber stamp a candidate he said 
added sen orrin g hatch rutah i think the administration 
is going to have to make up its mind next week 
fitzwater said there really isnt anything new except to say 
that we are proceeding with the collection of names and processing 
of individual candidates and we would like to have a nominee 
before the congress recesses for the democratic convention the 
week of july 18 
fitzwater said the white house list is still pretty long ive 
seen a number of news reports with a lot of names in them and you 
take the longest one and were at least that long 
among those mentioned as possible successors to meese former 
republican sen paul laxalt of nevada former house republican 
leader john rhodes of arizona the former democratic attorney 
general under jimmy carter griffin b bell reagans first 
attorney general william french smith former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole former white house chief of staff howard 
h baker washington attorney judith richards hope a nominee for a 
federal appellate judgeship and the daughterinlaw of comedian bob 
hope and acting deputy attorney general harold christensen 
also former american bar association president eugene thomas 
lois haight herrington chairman of the presidents conference for 
a drugfree america carla hills former republican secretary of 
housing and urban development william d ruckelshaus former 
administrator of the environmental protection agency former 
pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh howard t markey chief judge 
of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in washington 
and us attorney rudolph giuliani of new york 
a statement issued thursday by laxalts law office said he was 
not interested in the position and is committed to remain with the 
office he opened less than a year ago 
in addition no one has approached the senator about accepting 
the job the statement said adding that reports laxalt could be 
a successor to meese amount to nothing more than speculation and 
rumor 
hatch said christensen from the senators hometown of salt lake 
city would be the most logical choice because he already has 
received a background check for his nomination as deputy attorney 
general christensens confirmation hearing is set for july 28 
the senator who has spoken to the white house said christensen 
and laxalt are among those under consideration they know id 
support laxalt hatch said he declined to name anyone else under 
consideration 
meanwhile meese said wednesday he would have handled his role 
in connection with scandalplagued wedtech corp differently if he 
had known at the time that this was a gang of crooks 
obviously if you had total knowledge of what was going to 
be revealed later then there might be things you do 
differently meese said in an interview with reporters 
for example in the wedtech matter which was handled like i 
would any other if i had known or anybody had known that 
this was a gang of crooks there would have been quite different 
handling of the situation obviously

the soviet union launched an unmanned probe 
thursday night on a sixmonth trip to mars moon phobos for a 
mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red 
planet 
the launch of the 180foottall proton rocket carrying the 
probe phobos i was carried live on soviet television which 
reported that the spacecrafts flight was proceeding normally 
more than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to 
swoop close to the surface of phobos and drop probes onto the 
little potatoshaped martian moon that scientists say may hold 
clues to how the universe was formed 
a companion probe phobos ii is scheduled for launch on july 12 
if all goes well the two spacecraft will enter the 
gravitational pull of mars in january 1989 and fall into orbit just 
behind phobos for a threemonth remote study of the surface and 
atmosphere of the planet in april the craft will drop out of 
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moons surface 
where they will release two small landers

unusual formations on the surface of mars 
including a milelong rock shaped like a human face may have been 
carved by a lost civilization or could be just a trick of 
nature four scientists said thursday 
in either case they said the mysterious outcroppings demand 
further scrutiny by spacecraft 
the scientists including a former astronaut said that a 
photograph taken of the martian surface in 1976 by nasas viking 
spacecraft clearly shows a face that could have been carved out of 
a martian mountain a half million years ago 
and the sphinxlike image that stares outward from the planet 
may be part of a complex as evidenced by other unusual formations 
nearby which was built by a civilization that has since 
disappeared the scientists said 
or they admit it could all be a trick of light and shadow

states said richard andrews deputy director of californias 
office of emergency services 
the report by the us geological survey and a working group of 
its national earthquake prediction evaluation council deals only

the war over their industries wasted and their 
recovery prospects dim the japanese attached themselves to a 
concept that as much as anything else helped them rise up from 
the ashes 
the concept was industrial quality which presupposes that you 
offer a customer the very best you can produce because that and 
nothing less is what the customer expects 
in concept or practice it wasnt new americans had learned the 
trick years before and its authorities on the subject were quite 
willing to share their ideas a flock of them trekked to japan the 
japanese listened and improved 
now one of the great authorities on the subject armand 
feigenbaum former manager of general electrics worldwide 
manufacturing operations has finished offering a revolutionary 
idea to the soviets 
the notion the customer is always right and what the customer 
wants needs demands is quality 
on reading that advice most people consider it too obvious for 
comment but the fact of the matter is that it isnt at all 
time after time companies have fallen on bad times because they 
forget it repeatedly companies have resurrected themselves on 
rediscovering it and not just companies but entire nations as 
witness the japanese 
the notion was all but lost in the labyrinthic soviet production 
system which for decades has emphasized production goals over 
customer needs and thereby affirmed one of feigenbaums basic 
nonos to wit 
the wrong way is for the manufacturer of a product or the 
provider of a service to satisfy his own perceived internal needs 
at the expense of the customers requirements 
the message was delivered last month to an audience at the 32nd 
annual conference of the european organization for quality control 
made up mostly of russians bent on improving soviet production and 
export prowess 
will the russians take heed as the japanese did and as much to 
the point will americans remain competitive by practicing quality 
control or will they forget as they did for 20 years or so prior 
to the 1980s 
feigenbaum author of total quality control a bible on the 
subject is now president of general systems co a pittsfield 
mass company that installs quality control systems throughout the 
world 
these are some of the points he made to the russians and which 
he suggests might draw the attention of american producers of 
products and services 
quality is everybodys job but it will become nobodys job 
unless management provides operating systems that support the work 
of individuals and promote teamwork among individuals and 
departments 
quality and cost are partners not adversaries the essence of 
both higher quality and lower costs is fully effective use of 
resources anything less produces waste which means higher costs 
automation is no substitute for quality unless installed as an 
integrated part of an overall quality system automation merely 
produces the same bad products faster 
quality is not just a technical function or department it is 
an operating system that extends throughout the organization and 
provides the social stability and economic efficiency essential to 
quality 
quality improvement doesnt come through sloganeering bumper 
stickers occasional quality fireworks called campaigns or the 
dusting off of a few traditional qualitycontrol techniques 
customers perceive quality and they relate it to price quality 
shows through he says and when it isnt there it doesnt take 
long for the customer to know it in japan the united states or 
the soviet union

mexico medical school 
kelley seemed to have a physicians demeanor and plenty of 
medical knowledge he wore a white lab coat embroidered with his 
name and told stories about his teaching job 
but it turns out that nobody at the university had ever heard of 
him and that the new mexico medical examiners board had no record 
of a michael j kelley being licensed to practice medicine in the 
state 
and now his former friends remembering inconsistencies in his 
story that they once glossed over say they are embarrassed and 
angry they wee taken in by a man they describe as confident

relationship with a teenage boy who died

con as an investigator put it and helped bring about his arrest

51 54 or 56 surfaced in albuquerque early in 1986 allegedly 
passing himself off as a wealthy endocrinologist and surgeon whose 
heart problems forced him to leave a busy and prosperous practice 
in new york 
the part of the story about heart problems may be true copeland 
says kelley issued medication to himself as lampkins for treatment 
of a heart condition 
kelley allegedly prescribed ibuprofen a muscle relaxant to one 
woman who complained to him of lower back pain to another friend 
he allegedly prescribed an antibiotic after she experienced a 
negative reaction from a flu shot he is not accused of performing 
examinations or surgery but of issuing prescriptions 
his lawyer public defender richard knowles declined to allow 
his client to be interviewed saying i just dont like the idea 
of going to trial with newspaper clippings 
authorities say lampkins criminal record dates back to the 
early 1950s and that his convictions range from kidnapping to 
making false statements hes served time at the federal 
penitentiary at leavenworth kan for violating the selective 
service act and for other offenses in state and county prisons in 
missouri and california 
then theres the story of his relationship with 18yearold 
ronnie teunis 
kelley and teunis who lived together in the formers opulent 
oakland calif apartment took out a 100000 life insurance 
policy on each other in november 1982 teunis died in a motorcycle 
accident two weeks later the district attorneys office in oakland 
has closed the case according to investigator nicole lee 
but its not closed as far as allstate life insurance co is 
concerned 
kelley collected 203365 from allstate a sum that included 
interest and payment on a double indemnity clause the insuror now 
is trying to recover the money plus 600000 in punitive damages 
contending that kelley or lampkins misrepresented himself as 
teunis stepfather 
a newspapers legal notice of the insurance companys suit added 
to albuquerque friends vague uneasiness about kelley 
things would happen to sow a seed inside you but then nothing 
would happen for a while said a woman whose family regularly 
invited kelley to dinner and parties 
a small balding man described by friends as slightly effeminate 
and given to talking dramatically with his hands he was good 
company highly intelligent schooled in the arts and 
welltraveled he drove a mercedesbenz and carried a business card 
saying he was a phd as well as a medical doctor 
the woman and her husband who spoke on condition they not be 
identified said kelley avoided doctors whom they tried to 
introduce him socially and sometimes gave inconsistent accounts of 
his marital status divorced in one version widowed in another 
he wept while telling about the motorcycle accident that killed 
ronnie they said but he said it happened in new york not 
california and that the boy was an underprivileged youth his 
family had taken in 
every time kelley piqued the couples suspicions the wife said 
hed offer a gift or a compliment something nice to overcome 
the feelings i had 
but the legal notice was too much the couple discussed their 
suspicions with a friend who passed them on to cheryl boll a 
placitas nm kennel owner who had befriended kelley through 
their mutual interest in dogs 
i think several people began snapping to this person who was 
not who he said he was but she pegged him as a phony and a 
manipulator eventually she outconned the con guy copeland the 
prosecutors investigator said of mrs boll 
i talked to him almost every day she said basically i 
played a role as his dearest and best friend call me judas thats 
a good name 
her motivation she said was to stop a phony doctor she 
eventually told what she knew to the district attorneys office 
an arrest warrant accusing gerald thomas lampkins of practicing 
medicine without a license and listing more than six aliases 
was filed last feb 12 
lampkins who had fled albuquerque after being served with the 
allstate summons three months earlier was then living in tempe 
ariz 
lt stephen graehling and other tempe officers knocked on his 
door 
we stood around for a few minutes graehling says he came 
out the back door which empties onto a golf course and tried to 
run out back but i had two deputies out back who arrested him he 
didnt run very far

director ingmar bergman is turning 70 
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking 
in a run of theater successes 
recuperating from a hip operation bergman is quietly 
celebrating his july 14 birthday at his retreat at faro a rugged 
island of beaches and pine trees in the baltic sea with some of 
his eight children and his fifth wife ingrid 
bergman whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely 
touched by others says he has made his last movie that was his 
1982 triumph fanny and alexander which won four academy awards 
but he is hardly slowing down and has theater productions 
scheduled in sweden until 1991 
in april he scored a critical and box office sensation with his 
stage production of eugene oneills long days journey into 
night his autobiography lanterna magica was a swedish 
bestseller when it was published last year 
his swedishlanguage production of hamlet put in a modern 
setting was panned by some critics here but was a sensation in 
florence italy and won a critics prize last year in london it 
played in new york in may 
hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances 
bergman said in a radio interview it is the best i can do which 
means that i have reached quite far with it 
his next directing project will be shakespeares a winters 
tale at stockholms 200yearold royal dramatic theater 
bergman was not always the cultural hero in sweden that he is 
today his volcanic temper didnt help 
he used to refer to anyone who didnt throw furniture around 
as inhibited says gunnel lindblom one of his leading ladies 
in 1969 he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known 
for his sharp reviews 
and it was worth it bergman said 
today he says the critics dont bother him as much 
i dont even get angry he said in the radio interview of 
course when you were young you took it very hard and were very 
hurt but not after 45 years 
now he says everybody is very kind to me i suppose it 
is because i have become old and harmless 
his many love affairs often with women starring in his films 
drew more attention in sweden than his art but his latest marriage 
his fifth has lasted since the early 1970s 
in his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier 
fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession 
there were very many years of my life when i was so occupied 
with what i was doing that i forgot wives and children now since i 
am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my 
children he said 
bergman was swedens youngest theater director at 26 when he was 
put in charge of the provincial helsingborg city theater in 
southern sweden the theatrical tradition he says has always been 
the real influence on his art 
he is best known for directing more than 50 films most of which 
he wrote himself he won three oscars for best foreign films the 
virgin spring in 1960 through a glass darkly in 1962 and 
fanny and alexander 
to mark the birthday the swedish film institute published a 
special englishlanguage edition of its magazine chaplin paying 
homage to the director who made his first film in 1944 and who 
launched the careers of such international stars as liv ulmann 
bibi andersson and max von sydow 
bergman is probably the greatest film artist all things 
considered since the invention of the motionpicture camera 
wrote woody allen one of a dozen international directors 
contributing to the 90page tribute 
sir richard attenborough the british director said bergman 
extended the medium of film in a manner unequalled by any of 
his contemporaries 
for some four decades bergman divided his time between theater 
and film likening the two forums to my wife and my mistress 
after fanny and alexander he said he was giving up his 
mistress and devoting himself to the stage since then he 
produced only one swedish television film in 1984 after the 
repetition 
fanny and alexander was a multilevelled story of a 
welltodo family at the turn of the century which appeared to 
have traces of bergmans own childhood with his clergyman father 
the film marked bergmans return to sweden after six years in 
selfimposed exile in west germany in 1976 he was hauled away by 
police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations he was 
cleared but left the country in disgust 
he is now back at the royal dramatic theater where he saw his 
first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from 1963 
to 1966

they often are based on 
seatofthepants judgments rather than scientific measurements 
but the governments weekly crop reports are among the most eagerly 
awaited figures for commodity traders farmers and other drought 
watchers 
another round of reports will be released monday afternoon and 
analysts will be looking to see how the nations corn fields are 
standing up to dry conditions during a pollination period that is 
crucial to the survival of the crop for soybeans that 
makeitorbreakit point is still weeks away 
in iowa like other farm states the reports are assembled from 
hundreds of questionnaires returned by farmer volunteers 
government employees and bank officers who make farm loans there 
are few yardsticks for the responses that among other things rate 
crops from excellent to very poor participants say they rely on 
their own judgment 
its probably one of the least scientific surveys we do 
however its the most popular release we have says duane skow 
state statistician for iowa for the agricultural statistics service 
of the us department of agriculture its a subjective report 
its not based on measurements 
to farmers the figures help in making decisions on when to buy 
hay corn or soybean meal to feed livestock or whether to sell 
livestock and break up herds because of concern adequate feed will 
be too costly in winter farmers also may use the reports to base 
decisions on buying or selling crop surpluses or contracting for 
future sales or purchases 
public policymakers are watching the figures as they consider 
droughtrelief programs this year for example reports are being 
distributed for the first time to members of the iowa legislature 
and are being circulated to members of state drought task forces 
commodity firms traders and market watchers view the figures as 
an important benchmark for grain and livestock markets providing 
regular progress reports on the condition of crops months before 
the harvest as well as assessments on the availability of grains 
and grasses used as livestock feeds 
these numbers are closely followed by grain trade analysts 
says robert wisner an extension economist and grain market 
specialist at iowa state university 
they are used for a general indication of whether the crop is 
improving or deteriorating in condition wisner said 
obviously they are not precise enough to forecast exact yields 
per acre but these are good indicators 
last weeks report for iowa for example indicated a slight 
improvement in the soybean crop from the previous week when 
tripledigit temperatures blistered fields 
in the june 27 report none of the iowa soybean crop was rated 
excellent and 16 percent was graded poor but on july 5 four 
percent was given an excellent rating and 12 percent was poor 
in general a normal crop is considered good better than that 
is excellent and below normal is either fair poor or very poor 
the people who fill out the weekly questionnaires say it is 
easier to distinguish between the excellent and poor crops than to 
make distinctions between crops that are good or fair 
excellent and failure are real easy to identify said 
richard thuma extension service director and agriculturalist in 
henry county in southeast iowa who has been participating in such 
surveys for 36 years 
but sometimes a conversation with a farmer will determine how 
some parts of the survey are answered 
is subsoil moisture inadequate 
thuma said it is when a farmer tells me he dug a fence post 
three feet deep and didnt find water 
in iowa 427 questionnaires go out each wednesday asking for 
ratings of crops an assessment of the moisture content of the soil 
and subsoil progress on hay harvests and general comments on 
livestock weather effects fertilizer supplies soil erosion or 
related topics as the growing season progresses questions are 
added each week to track the progress of corn and soybean crops 
last weeks survey marked the start of questions on corn 
pollination a critical period that will determine if kernelfilled 
ears will develop 
tassels already have formed on some stalks and must drop pollen 
on silks that are beginning to form on the ears the silks must be 
moist and sticky enough to catch the pollenotherwise you have a 
cob without corn skow said 
survey participants are asked to complete the forms on friday or 
on saturday morning and replies received monday morning in des 
moines are tabulated and combined with data provided by the 
national weather service and the state climatologist 
last weeks iowa report was based on 222 questionnaires returned 
in time for use 
skows office strives to avoid sensationalizing the reports as 
he put it to limit the adjectives 
a typical passage last week said the rain and cooler 
temperatures helped sustain the condition of iowas corn crop this 
past week particularly in the northern and western parts of the 
state overall the corn was in fairtogood condition 
this year in iowa because legislators restored cut funds 
supporting such projects the weekly reports not only give 
statewide summaries but also have restored a section that provides 
figures on soil moisture and crop progress for nine areas of the 
state 
the people who compile and contribute to the report say that 
even if ideal conditions return the corn crop has suffered 
im not one to overdramatize this situation but im also a 
realist said roger brummett a farmer and an agriculturalist at 
the extension service in taylor county who responds to the 
questionnaires in his southwest iowa community were looking at 
a potential 40 percent to 60 percent corn crop loss right now in 
this county

after persistent reports of civil 
rights abuses by indian tribal governments federal attorneys are 
quietly pressing to close loopholes that deny constitutional 
protection to indians on reservations 
we have complaints of people who have lost property or liberty 
without due process brian miller counsel for the us civil 
rights commission told the associated press we have evidence of 
undue influence on judges 
he said the commission would hold hearings july 20 in nearby 
flagstaff and then prepare a report for the white house including 
evidence from four previous hearings held around the country since 
august 1986 
the new hearings will focus on the navajo the largest indian 
tribe but complaints come from many of the nations 260 
reservations miller said 
meanwhile the justice department is seeking an amendment to the 
1968 indian civil rights act that would allow federal courts to 
review civil rights decisions taken by indian tribal courts 
we see a lack of checks built into the tribal government 
process said james schermerhorn attorney for the justice 
department violations are continuing hence the need for federal 
review 
miller and schermerhorn said they had received widespread 
allegations of election abuse and favoritism based on political or 
blood loyalties 
in interviews on reservations indians who described themselves 
as victims and private lawyers repeatedly likened the tribal 
governments to small dictatorships or police states 
stephen pevar a professor of indian law at denver university 
asked to comment on tribal governments he had visited replied 
the situation is an abomination 
dennis ickes former deputy undersecretary of the interior and 
an indian law specialist in salt lake city told the civil rights 
commission earlier this year this is our gaza strip 
he said tribal members were secondclass citizens because they 
have no recourse to a judicial system that is not subordinate to 
the tribes political body 
the issue is fiercely controversial because is revolves around 
indian sovereignty established in a series of laws since 
reservations were established in the last century 
all 137 million indians have us citizenship but in 1978 the 
supreme court determined that tribal courts had the final word on 
civil rights cases for the 332000 indians living on reservations 
one problem federal lawyers contend is that indian judicial 
systems are often rudimentary and vulnerable to pressure from 
tribal authorities 
as a result they say a strong tribal chairman amounts to 
president chief justice and speaker of the house and is in a 
position to control his own reelection 
in the navajo system generally regarded as the best among 
tribal courts only two of 14 judges have law degrees and no 
tribal constitution sets out a separation of powers 
peter macdonald chairman of the 200000member tribe told the 
ap federal court appeal would violate indians sovereign status 
he acknowledged he was the final authority in the navajo nation 
it is an awful responsibility for one man he said but it is 
in our customs and traditions 
former navajo chairman peterson zah locked in a legal dispute 
over what he calls arbitrary actions by macdonald takes a 
different view 
i am against the idea of federal court appeal because it 
diminishes the sovereignty of indians he said but this 
governments actions have made it necessary we will suffer but we 
have no choice 
one witness expected to testify to the commission is robert 
walters a navajo judge fired by the tribal government he told the 
ap judges were controlled by threats 
it is not a free country up there he said it is a 
socialistic state they tell you what to do 
problems are general throughout much of indian country said 
butch oneal an indian development consultant and a sioux who 
lives on the navajo reservation 
it is scary when you think of it he said if you anger 
someone your whole family suffers if deprived of property or 
anything else you have nowhere to go beyond the tribe 
oneal left his job as director of the crownpoint nm 
institute of technology when peter macdonald took over as navajo 
chairman in 1986 because oneal said he expected to be forced out 
for political reasons 
when us presidents go a lot of people lose their jobs 
but not the secretaries and janitors he said here everyone 
can get nailed 
in january assistant attorney general john bolton wrote to the 
senate select committee on indian affairs about serious tribal 
deficiencies in applying and enforcing the indian civil rights 
act 
more recently justice department officials have been preparing 
a memo to congress requesting legislation to allow federal review 
boltons letter cited testimony from commission hearings at 
rapid city sd in august 1986 which alleged flagrant abuse on 
several northern plains reservations 
former chief judge trudell guerue of the rosebud sioux in south 
dakota said that in one fivemonth period prior to the hearings he 
found more than 300 people arrested but not brought to court 
we had people whod stay in jail for 10 days without charges 
being filed he said 
ray springer a former cheyenne river sioux police officer 
testified he was forced to be a witness against himself in a tribal 
court if youre politically in youre probably all right he 
said otherwise it runs right between fear and horror and just 
total awe in the people 
indians are divided sharply on federal court review 
one proponent is charley john one of two judges macdonald fired 
in 1978 after they refused to allow him to use 70000 to pay f 
lee bailey fordefending him against an internal revenue service 
audit 
most of the tribal judges are fearful he said i think 
one good case brought before federal courts would put the fear of 
accountability back into tribal government 
another navajo former judge tonny bowman told his nonindian 
interviewer you have more rights on a reservation than indians 
do 
but john chapela a lawyer dismissed as head of the navajo 
housing authority with the change in leadership said i would 
benefit personally but indians would be the losers we must settle 
these things ourselves 
chapela argues that the navajo should adopt a constitution 
allowing them an effective recall process 
a sampling of private attorneys with experience in indian law 
showed widespread if reluctant sympathy for at least a limited form 
of a federal review 
richard hughes a former indian legal aid attorney now 
practicing in albuquerque nm said suppression of political 
dissent is the way of life with many tribes that kind of 
problem is what gives rise to the critical civil rights issues 
attorneys pressing for federal court review complain of 
resistance from the senate indian affairs committee and the bureau 
of indian affairs which they allege are interested is preserving 
the status quo 
some of the attorneys refer to the entrenched posture of the 
senate committee the bia and tribal governments as the iron 
triangle the result they say is that indians suffer at indian 
hands 
but officials who oppose federal review argue that indians 
should be left alone to run their tribes 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate committee 
repeatedly criticizes what he calls the imposition of unsuccessful 
solutions on indians 
we are convinced that the solutions are in indian country 
he told a group of tribal leaders last fall in miami its about 
time indians decided on how to solve their own problems

carolyn benally a navajo employment 
officer got some action when she complained to a local paper about 
favoritism in tribal civil service hiring she was fired 
her lawyer john chapela offers little encouragement for 
redress he is only in private practice because he was dismissed as 
head of the navajo housing authority for being he said in the 
wrong party 
civil rights attorneys say the navajos have perhaps the best of 
any tribal court system but they point to a recent scandal and 
allegations of civil rights abuses as evidence that individual 
navajos face discrimination by tribal leaders 
chairman peter macdonald who spoke in an interview with charm 
and persuasion of his plans to restore navajo prosperity denied 
any wrongdoing he has never been indicted much less convicted 
but even close associates acknowledge that recent developments 
provide cause for raised eyebrows 
a major scandal is bogate the tribes purchase of the big 
boquillas ranch near tuba city ariz a year ago 
middlemen paid tenneco west 262 million for it five minutes 
later the navajos bought the ranch for 334 million 
macdonald in an interview said the navajos paid a fair price 
and did not know what the intermediary purchasers had paid a 
commission to the middlemen was normal he said adding thats 
partly how business is done in america 
but a principal middleman was an old associate who had raised 
money for macdonalds campaigns the ranch had been on the market 
20 years 
shortly after the tribal council approved the purchase coconino 
county records show macdonald paid off the loan on his retirement 
home 
the circumstances prompted separate investigations by the 
inspectorgeneral of the interior department the internal revenue 
service and the fbi all are still under way 
more recently macdonald sought to assert tribal control over 
the navajo education and scholarship foundation regarded as a 
sinecure for his arch rival peterson zah the former chairman 
zah locked out of his office got a court order barring anyone 
from evicting him the tribe found another judge after a judicial 
tugofwar police shut down the whole building leaving 80 other 
employees in the street 
the integrity of the navajo nation law has been reduced to 
this game of musical doorknobs observed duane beyal zahs 
spokesman 
shortly after a group of workers marched to macdonalds office 
to ask for alternate quarters two participants were fired 
although the tribe gave other reasons for their dismissal 
dissent has been rare since macdonald shut down the 
independentminded navajo times daily in 1986 expelling editors 
before they could produce the next mornings edition macdonald 
said the tribeowned paper was losing money 
nevertheless the tribe spends 2 million a year on public 
relations firms and washington lobbyists macdonald acknowledged 
chapela who is collecting signatures for a recall that can take 
place only with approval from macdonalds handpicked council 
said his goal is to bankrupt the navajo nation to finance his 
goldplated retirement 
other sources speak to visitors in whispered asides or through 
notes passed at the navajo nation motor inn the focal point of 
this windswept capital city in northern arizona 
but warned a nonindian lawyer with long experience on the 
reservation allegations are not proof if macdonald is a 
crook he said he is a smart one to protect himself the 
lawyer insisted on anonymity

the rustylooking building the democrats will 
crowd into next week has been home over the years to revivals 
rodeos and rock concerts tennis tractorpulls and title fights 
springsteen sinatra and soccer and basketball especially 
basketball 
the omni arena which opened in 1972 with a professional hockey 
game was built at a cost of about 17 million on a platform over 
land owned by a group of developers who also put together the 
adjacent omni international businessofficehotel complex 
since then the building housing the businesses has been sold to 
ted turner he changed the name to cnn center after his cable news 
network which moved into space originally occupied by an indoor 
amusement park 
a turnerowned company manages the arena but it remains owned 
by a joint citycounty authority 
the arena was constructed mainly to provide a home for the 
atlanta hawks a professional basketball team said former mayor 
sam massell he spearheaded the negotiations with thenhawks owner 
tom cousins who was also the lead developer in the larger complex 
turner now is majority owner of the hawks 
there was a thirst for professional sports massell said 
and a hope that the arena would serve as a catalyst for development 
on a neglected side of downtown atlanta 
massell admitted that hasnt happened as rapidly as some 
predicted 
the buildings exterior was intentionally designed to rust to 
cut down on maintenance costs 
its roofline of 25 pyramidshaped pods has been compared to an 
upsidedown egg crate the configuration designed to provide 
external support and to avoid columns inside 
indoors the arena floor runs diagonally to give more room for 
16237 seats for basketball and to provide space in the corners for 
private clubs 
that space is going to be at a premium for the democrats since 
construction of the podium and of skyboxes for network television 
will reduce the seating to about 11000 forcing off the convention 
floor many of the nondelegates accustomed to priority seating in 
the past 
little controversy has surrounded the building aside from 
periodic griping about concession prices beer drinking and drug 
use at rock concerts 
as for the unusual name massell recalled that as one of the few 
controversies 16 years ago 
he said the name came from the dictionary which defines the 
latinderived prefix omni as all universal without 
restriction its been quite appropriate considering the ice 
shows circuses and conventions staged there year in and year out 
massell said the name omni was unusual when the complex was 
built but the omni international hotel was the beginning of whats 
become a chain of upscale hotels

atlanta is dressing up for the democrats with the 
hope that the 35000 visitors to the partys national convention 
will take home a rosy impression of the city 
but the newlyplanted flowers along peachtree street and the 
scrubbed down convention center will be unable to hide the rickety 
shanties of cabbagetown and the thousands of homeless 
this prosperous heart of the new south has a core city that 
ranks as the secondpoorest in the nation and activists estimate 
that 7000 to 10000 people are homeless leaders say they plan to 
make their plight known during the convention in july 
anita beatty codirector of the atlanta task force for the 
homeless said there are no plans for large marches or 
demonstrations during the convention because the impact would be 
lost 
instead with representatives of national homeless groups task 
force members will occupy some of the 1300 empty public housing 
units in atlanta for an undetermined time starting july 14 four 
days before the opening gavel 
who among the democrats will take action to solve the problem 
if the problem is not visible mrs beatty said its nice to 
have 58 facilities to house the homeless but it is kind of like 
letting steam out of the kettle 
the coalition plans a sanctuary space either in a church or 
large tent where homeless can go and not fear arrest in cleanup 
drives the city also decided some months ago to keep open a 
shelter for about 150 men that would have closed at the end of 
march and to add three more shelters each housing about 30 people 
statistically atlanta is an island of prosperity in the south 
but the numbers for the atlanta area say little about the city 
proper which has only about 20 percent of the metropolitan areas 
22 million residents 
suburban atlanta is composed of large shaded lots nice brick 
homes golf courses shopping malls and white faces urban atlanta 
is overwhelmingly black with about 27 percent of the residents 
living below the poverty line second only to newark nj 
according to us census figures 
fulton county which includes the city of atlanta has an 
unemployment rate of 62 percent the average for the four 
surrounding metropolitan area counties is 43 percent 
some of atlantas homeless live under a viaduct that runs past 
the convention site within the projected security zone around the 
convention area city officials say the indigents must vacate the 
shantytown for security reasons 
i dont see why theyre tryin to hide us it aint like we 
done nothing wrong we just aint got nowhere else to stay said 
charles prater 37 one of the group 
mrs beatty fears that some draconian things are going to be 
done

jesse jackson and his days in the 1960s civil 
rights movement are not topics of easy conversation on the home 
ground of the late rev martin luther king jr 
few among the civil rights old guard want to talk about 
jacksons time with kings southern christian leadership 
conference and those willing to discuss the subject sometimes 
paint a less than flattering picture of the man who went on to run 
for president 
kings widow coretta scott king declined to reminisce publicly 
about jackson except to say he was the one who told her king had 
been shot and instructed her to take the next thing smoking to 
memphis tenn 
ralph abernathy and andrew young kings top aides did not 
return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on jackson 
the rev joseph lowery the current sclc president and a jackson 
supporter paused for several minutes when asked for movement 
memories of the democratic presidential candidate 
i dont remember nothin he said 
atlanta city councilman hosea williams who worked in field 
operations for the sclc said jacksons desire to work with king 
led to a meteoric rise in the organization and a post running its 
chicago departments 
jesse was smart energetic charismatic he really impressed 
dr king williams said 
but jackson also had an obvious disdain for following rules 
williams said and would use the funds he raised for his chicago 
operations without prior approval of sclc officials 
king and the rest of the sclc executive council grew tired of 
jacksons rulebending williams said and emotions came to a head 
in late march 1968 during an atlanta meeting five days before his 
death king had a heated exchange with jackson and stormed out of 
the room in uncharacteristic anger 
he turned around and looked at jesse and said jesse if you 
want to start your own national organization i understand its ok 
with me but dont try to destroy me in the interim williams 
said 
after kings death jackson had other rifts with sclc officials 
into the early 1970s leading him to walk away from the 
organization and never return williams said 
one major source of friction with civil rights leaders was the 
bloody shirt incident 
jackson created an uproar when hours after kings 
assassination he appeared in chicago and on national television 
wearing a bloodstained turtleneck sweater and saying he had cradled 
king as he died civil rights leaders were outraged 
when i got up there abernathy was cradling docs head and 
andy had gone into the room to get a towel williams said we 
got doc in the car and they headed to the hospital abernathy went 
with him 
all at once i heard someone say i was the last man in the 
world king talked to i looked around and it was jesse with all 
the press around he said all this blood on my shirt i got it 
when i cradled his head 
williams said jackson was not on the memphis motel balcony when 
the shots were fired jackson had been standing in the parking lot 
with the chauffeur and the rev james bevel the sclc field 
strategist who brought jackson into the organization in 1965 
jackson generally declines to talk about the incident but the 
washington post quoted him in april as saying it happened the 
way i said it did 
later williams said kings aides gathered and pledged their 
support to abernathy kings best friend as the new president of 
sclc 
i remember jesse saying he was sick he said im going to my 
room what jesse did is jesse went to chicago williams said 
describing how kings horrified aides watched as jackson wore the 
bloodsmeared sweater on the today show and during hearings 
before the chicago city council 
some of those like andy and coretta and others have never been 
able to forgive jesse for that he said 
rep john lewis dga who worked with the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee during the 1960s is less accusatory than 
williams in his comments on jackson he said in an interview that 
criticism of jacksons movement activities stem from the fact that 
jackson didnt play the politics of the movement 
i think a great many older people and some not so old that 
were part of the movement felt threatened by jesse jackson by his 
leadership by his ability lewis said he had some idea about 
what direction he wanted to move and set about doing just that 
he made a very signtion in chicago to give the 
movement a solid presence in a large urban area outside the 
south lewis added i dont think jesse deliberately went out 
on a course to usurp power in the sclc 
bevel a staunch republican who currently works withificant contribu 
a chicago 
youth organization he formed said i brought jesse jackson into 
sclc i recommended jesse he said there was a struggle within 
the organization against the recommendation but he was set up in 
chicago to set that operation into motion 
we were in memphis together when king was shot bevel said 
king got shot about 6 oclock and ralph abernathy told me to 
go up to the temple to tell the people because him and andy and 
bernard lee were gnature 
lincoln was nominated on the third ballot won the election over 
the divided democrats and reluctantly appointed cameron to the 
treasury 
the last convention year in which both major parties opened 
their conventions with the outcome uncertain was in 1952 
gen dwight d eisenhower beat out ohio sen robert taft the 
choice of conservatives for the gop nomination on the first ballot 
the uncertainty was greater on the democratic side eleven 
candidates were nominated the frontrunner sen estes kefauver of 
tennessee could muster only 28 percent on the first ballot 
democratic kingmakers began to look elsewhere 
their eyes fell on illinois democratic governor adlai e 
stevenson who had delivered a stirring keynote address 
stevenson refused to run 
a draft movement was formed and on the third ballot it succeeded 
the longest convention in the history of either party was the 
democratic conclave of 1924 in new york 
there were 103 roll calls over 17 days 
new york gov al smith passed william gibbs mcadoo secretary of 
the treasury in the woodrow wilson administration on the 86th 
ballot of the political marathon in a convention divided between 
rural and big city elements 
humorist will rogers complained that new york city had invited 
delegates to visit the place not live there permanently 
mcadoo recaptured the lead on the 94th but released his 
delegates on the 99th 
wall street lawyer john w davis who had received just 31 votes 
on the first ballot finally prevailed on the 103rd and marched off 
to defeat by calvin coolidge in november 
it was the republican convention of 1920 that produced that 
classic symbol of a brokered convention the smokefilled room 
there is disagreement on whether there was actually a 
smokefilled room in chicago where party bosses turned to sen 
warren harding of ohio 
but there is no disagreement that the term has entered american 
political history as a powerful symbol of a manipulated convention 
according to the boller account harry m daughtery hardings 
campaign manager had predicted four months before the convention 
that delegates would deadlock and weary party bosses would select 
harding in a hotel room meeting in the early morning hours 
actually harding was called before republican leaders at 200 
am told he might win the nomination the next day and asked 
whether there was anything in his background that might prove 
embarrassing or harm his effectiveness as candidate or president 
harding was left alone to think about it then declared there 
was nothing no obstacle to his candidacy a declaration that 
might have been less than candid considering hardings affair at 
the time with a married woman 
after it was all over according to boller someone called 
pennsylvania sen boies penrose who had helped orchestrate 
hardings selection and said he hoped hardings weakness for women 
wouldnt be brought up in the campaign 
no worries about that said penrose 
well just throw a halo around his handsome head and 
everything will be all right

oil futures traders generally have disregarded a 
report that three opec members were calling for an emergency 
meeting of the cartel but prices still rose on technical factors 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for august 
delivery of west texas intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents 
higher at 1536 per barrel wednesay after picking up 15 cents on 
tuesday 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
closed up 084 cent to 5056 cents a gallon and home heating oil 
advanced 102 cents to 4261 cents a gallon 
most traders gave little weight to a kuwait news agency report 
that three members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries might request an emergency meeting of the cartel said 
madison galbraith senior energy specialist for merrill lynch 
energy futures 
the kuwaiti news agency citing highlevel senior industry 
sources said officials from venezuela algeria and ecuador wanted 
opec to consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices 
some traders were concerned about the report and the possibility 
of higher prices but wednesdays gains were the result of just 
another shortcovering rally galbraith said 
in a short trade an investor sells borrowed contracts in hope 
of replacing them later with contracts bought at lower prices in 
such cases a price rise can cause a flurry of buying as traders 
try to cover their positions 
galbraith called the advance a correction of an oversold market 
and said the underlying market fundamentals remained bearish 
at its meeting last month opec oil ministers failed to settle 
their internal problems and simply left the existing system of 
production quotas and prices unchanged 
but that system was and still is in disarray most opec 
members are producing above their individual quotas or discounting 
their prices 
some estimates put opec production at 35 million barrels above 
the groups selfimposed overall ceiling of 1506 million barrels a

the new york stock exchange trying to appease 
big brokers and small investors is abandoning a postcrash limit 
on computerized program trading while considering a plan to give 
individuals speedier access to the market 
directors of the nations biggest securities market were 
discussing the changes at their regularly scheduled meeting today 
said sources familiar with the big boards plans who spoke on 
condition they not be identified 
scrapping the socalled collar restraint on highvolume 
computerized program trades would end one of the most controversial 
confidenceboosting revisions undertaken by nyse in the aftermath 
of the october crash 
the sources said there was widespread thinking especially among 
large brokerages which utilize program trading that the collar no 
longer was needed because the market has been relatively stable in 
recent weeks 
the other measure which the sources likened to a rushhour 
express lane for individual investors is designed to counter a 
perception that the nyse ignores small trading orders in favor of 
the larger and more profitable transactions from big brokers and 
their institutional clients 
nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin said she could not comment on 
matters before the board but she said the collar limitation 
implemented in february never was meant to be permanent 
trading professionals gave mixed reactions to the collar news 
some called the limit useless but others said it played a valuable 
role in calming the wild price swings that frightened away 
investors during and after the crash 
under the collar the nyse banned use of its order system for a 
popular form of computerized program trading called index arbitrage 
on days when the dow jones industrial average rose or fell at least 
50 points from the previous close 
if they take the rule off i think there will be more 
volatility said david johnson president and chief executive of 
johnson lane space smith amp co a brokerage in savannah ga 
that means there will be less inclination for the individual to 
participate in this market 
robert kirby head of capital guardian trust co in los angeles 
and an outspoken critic of index arbitrage said he thought the 
collar had helped curb computerarmed speculators from rampantly 
trading stocks to capture shortterm profits regardless of 
underlying values 
investors are being flushed out of the system by a bunch of 
star wars guys kirby said markets are going to go where they 
go but id like to see them driven by investors not computers 
the individualinvestor proposal before the nyse board also got 
a mixed reaction with some calling it a confidence builder and 
others discounting it as a symbolic gesture 
under this proposal individuals placing orders of less than 
1000 shares would have a special computerized express lane to 
the nyse floor on days when the dow average swung more than 25 
points from the previous close 
during the crash many small investors complained they could not 
get their sell orders to the nyse floor quickly because of the 
congestion caused by large institutional orders this meant 
individuals were forced to sell at much lower prices while larger 
investors were able to sell first 
i think the individual should have equal access said john 
bachmann chairman of the securities industry association and 
managing partner of edward d jones amp co a st louisbased 
brokerage anybody who thinks the individual had equal access 
last time during the crash were wrong 
but john markese vice president of the american association for 
individual investors in chicago said he was not sure such a 
proposal would help small stockholders 
its holding out a hand he said its going in the right 
direction but it may prove to be a token gesture

irving bank corp has vowed to appeal a state 
court ruling striking down a provision of its poison pill 
defense aimed at thwarting bank of new yorks hostile merger 
efforts 
supreme court justice herman cahn on wednesday granted a 
preliminary injunction against the provision ruling it unfairly 
discriminated against bank of new york and the company would suffer 
irreparable harm from irvings takeover defense 
the defense would allow all of irving shareholders except a 
hostile suitor to buy 400 worth of irving shares for 200 if any 
suitor bought more than 20 percent of irving stock without the 
support of irvings management such provisions are intended to 
make unsolicited takeover bids prohibitively expensive 
irving attorney robert a falise said the bank planned to appeal 
cahns ruling which he called erroneous 
but falise said he was pleased the judge did not reject irvings 
entire poison pill which adheres to a new york state antitakeover 
law that prevents an unfriendly merger for at least five years 
bank of new york reaffirmed its outstanding buyout offer and 
said it would seek a 60day extension from the federal reserve 
board for conditional approval of its proposed merger with irving 
the feds approval was due to run out saturday 
rodgin cohen an attorney for bank of new york said cahns 
ruling should remove the single biggest question they the fed 
had and that was the ability to complete the merger 
mark alpert a banking analyst with bear stearns amp co 
predicted the fed would grant an extension if the fed had wanted 
to stop this the takeover battle they would have spoken up now 
alpert said it was unlikely bank of new york would attempt to 
amass a larger stake in irving for fear that irving would win an 
appeal that would trigger the poison pill 
he also noted that even if an appeals court ruled in favor of 
bank of new york the state antitakeover law would force bank of 
new york to operate irving as a separate subsidiary 
cahns decision came a day after irvings board of directors 
accepted an improved merger offer from a friendly suitor staterun 
banca commerciale italiana spa italys second largest bank 
the milanbased bank offered tuesday to sweeten its bid for a 51 
percent stake of irving with warrants entitling shareholders to buy 
newly issued irving stock at 65 a share over the next seven years 
stockholders would receive one warrant for every four shares they 
currently owned 
the offer was contingent upon irving keeping its poison pill 
intact 
banca commerciale previously had offered 80 a share for 51 
percent of irvings 185 million common shares outstanding or 
about 760 million the blended value was as much as 7650 per 
share 
the merger proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring 
plan that includes among other things sale of irving assets 
costcutting measures and a special cash dividend 
irving said the latest offer made the overall transaction worth 
at least 7950 per share which the banks board deemed superior 
to bank of new yorks best and final bid 
however estimates of the value of the offer have differed 
widely 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its own stock for each of 
irvings common shares outstanding the offer is valued at around 
68 a share or 12 billion 
the bank had offered to sweeten the rare hostile bid by slightly 
raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder 
incentives including a special cash dividend if irving agreed to 
abandon its poison pill

the suzuki samurai collided headon with bad 
publicity in june as allegations that it was prone to roll over 
contributed to a 706 percent drop in sales from a year earlier 
consumers union the group that blasted the samurai said the 
drop was a good sign if it was the result of the groups report 
alleging that the boxy jeeplike vehicle was dangerous in certain 
situations 
american suzuki motor corp said wednesday it sold 2199 
samurais in june the least since december 1985 which was the 
month after the vehicles us introduction 
suzuki sold 7479 samurais in june 1987 and 6074 in may of this 
year when concerns about the suzuki already had begun to spread 
through the buying public 
suzuki has maintained the consumers union tests were biased and 
inaccurate but dealers said potential buyers were unnerved by 
dramatic television news clips of the vehicle tilting over during 
driving tests 
suzuki said it was not surprised by the decline expected sales 
to increase in coming months and remained absolutely confident of 
the samurais safety 
consumers union the nonprofit publisher of consumer reports 
magazine has said suzuki should recall the vehicle and give 
refunds to owners 
asked for comment on the sales figures consumers union 
spokesman david berliner said if it is a reflection in any way 
of the public giving credence to our findings then i think that is 
a good sign 
consumers union said june 2 that the samurai tends to roll over 
when the driver swerves sharply back and forth to avoid an 
accident the mount vernon nybased group gave the vehicle its 
first not acceptable rating in 10 years 
suzuki is not planning on withdrawing the samurai from the 
market in response to the poor june sales said rob cahn a 
representative of the companys public relations agency rogers amp 
associates he said that has been the companys position from the 
beginning 
for the first six months of 1988 samurai sales were down to 
31221 from 42912 a year earlier according to american suzuki 
the brea califbased subsidiary of japans suzuki motor co ltd 
its impossible to tell whether samurai can pull out of this 
or not said ronald glanz an analyst for montgomery securities 
inc in san francisco who said the vehicles reputation already 
was in question before the consumers union report 
i think suzuki will keep protesting that the product is safe 
and then shift production over to the sidekick a bigger more 
stable vehicle that is scheduled to be introduced next spring 
glanz said 
the samurai a fourwheeldrive vehicle has a high center of 
gravity a narrow tread width a short wheelbase and relatively 
light weight consumers union said that combination made the 
vehicle inherently flawed but suzuki said the design was sound and 
cited statistics showing the samurai had a good safety record 
the samurai passed the ordinary consumers union test it flunked 
only when the consumer organization altered the obstacle course to 
make it more challenging 
the samurai gained a reputation as a fun car popular with young 
people and became a bestseller almost immediately after its 
introduction in the united states it took some business away from 
larger and more expensive cousins such as the jeep wrangler jeep 
cherokee and isuzu trooper ii 
but sales already had begun to slow down from their torrid 1987 
pace earlier this year partly because of allegations by the center 
for auto safety about the samurais propensity to roll over 
sales of the jeep wrangler the samurais closest competitor 
jumped 46 percent to 4848 in june from 3318 in june 1987 the 
wranglers sales were up 85 percent from 4469 in may of this year

eastern airlines unions and management are not 
ready to declare peace is at hand despite an agreement to separate 
safety issues from their other disputes 
the key word to use is guardedly optimistic because theres 
been such an extended period of mistrust said jb stokes a 
spokesman for the eastern local of the air line pilots association 
which represents 3500 pilots you have to be somewhat cautious 
the pact announced wednesday comes a month after federal 
investigators warned that safety could be threatened at 
financiallytroubled eastern the nations sixthlargest airline 
if its labor problems were not resolved quickly 
the deal spells out procedures for the company and its 32500 
workers to discuss complaints and disagreements 
we are optimistic and hopeful this will represent a 
breakthrough in relations said charles e bryan district 
president of the machinists union easterns largest labor group 
with 12000 members we dont think this is going to be a total 
cure for all the problems of eastern 
judy coughlin secretarytreasurer of the transport workers 
union local representing 7000 eastern flight attendants said her 
union was skeptical of the deal but supported any attempt to 
improve safety 
were willing to cooperate on anything but the problems are 
not going to be solved until our people can go to work and not 
worry about being fired she said 
robin matell a company spokesman said eastern would not 
characterize the agreement beyond a statement by president phil 
bakes who said the pact would keep safety out of collective 
bargaining issues but bakes also noted it was essential to 
complete negotiations on economic issues with the machinists and 
pilots unions 
former labor secretary william e brock chosen by federal 
officials june 2 to find ways to ease easterns labormanagement 
relations said he found tensions were accelerated to an 
unbelievable level between the two sides 
years of disputes including lawsuits lobbying in congress and 
negative newspaper advertisements have made passengers afraid to 
fly eastern and had created a situation where the airline is losing 
1 million daily brock said 
transportation secretary james h burnley iv called the 
agreement a good beginning and said federal inspectors would 
continue steppedup monitoring of eastern to assure the flying 
public that it remains a safe fit airline 
rankandfile reaction to the safety agreement seemed mixed as 
reports reached eastern employees in its miami base 
a mechanic fired 18 months ago said he was skeptical about how 
well the deal would ease tensions 
there have been so many things done to people and their 
families it would be awfully hard to forgive and forget said 
the mechanic who asked that his name not be used because his case 
is in federal arbitration 
a flight attendant arriving at miami international airport said 
she found it encouraging that some agreement any agreement was 
made you have to start somewhere said the woman who like many 
eastern employees asked that her name not be used 
the pact calls for the establishment of a master safety 
committee consisting of top company and union officials which will 
help resolve safety problems pointed out by employees 
panels will be established throughout the country at which local 
managers and union leaders will attempt to resolve issues such as 
captains authority the handling of calls to the companys 
complaint lines training of maintenance workers and a study of 
workplace injuries 
the document is worthless if there is not compliance bryan 
told reporters we have a collective bargaining agreement which 
has been blatantly violated consistently by this management so 
there was some reservation about putting a lot of confidence in 
this document 
a measure of the continued mistrust was the inability to get 
management and union leaders to appear together at the washington 
news conference 
eastern has been marked by labormanagement conflicts for more 
than a decade as a period of cooperation under former chairman 
frank borman deteriorated and led to the moneylosing airlines 
sale in 1986 to houstonbased texas air corp 
texas airs management led by chairman frank lorenzo heightened 
tensions by saying eastern had to cut its labor costs by up to 30 
percent eastern lost 241 million last year and texas air lost 
466 million 
the machinists in federal mediation with management since 
january have refused to take wage concessions of up to 50 percent 
for some nonmechanics such as baggage handlers eastern says it 
cant reverse its losses without the concessions 
a group of eastern pilots testified before congress last year 
that they were pressured repeatedly to fly aircraft they considered 
unsafe the agreement pledges that no employee will be harassed 
threatened or disciplined for reporting or causing to report an 
unsafe condition on an aircraft 
federal officials conducted special inspections of aircraft 
flown by eastern and continental last spring and also examined 
texas airs management and finances they announced they had not 
found unsafe conditions but warned of possible safety problems 
because of the labormanagement battles 
the federal aviation administration in april proposed an 
823000 fine against eastern for recordkeeping and maintenance 
infractions fourteen months earlier the airline had agreed to pay 
a record 95 million penalty

federal prosecutors say information gathered 
from ivan boesky and others caught up in the snowballing wall 
street insider trading scandal led indirectly to unprecedented 
stock manipulation charges against gaf corp 
gaf two subsidiaries and the corporations vice chairman were 
indicted on numerous securities law charges wednesday for an 
alleged scheme to manipulate the price of union carbide corp 
common stock 
gaf made an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for union carbide 
in 1985 and kept alive the threat of another attempt until it sold 
much of its carbide stake in late 1986 
us attorney rudolph giuliani said the indictment marked the 
first time a corporate entity was charged with stock 
manipulation in the governments widening probe 
the 10count indictment charged gaf two subsidiaries gaf 
chemicals corp and jay amp company inc and james t sherwin 
gafs vice chairman and chief administrative officer with 
conspiracy stock price manipulation securities fraud wire fraud 
causing the creation of false brokerage records and obtaining 
improper margin loans to finance stock purchases 
a spokesman for gaf a wayne njbased chemical and building 
products conglomerate said the board of directors had expressed 
its full confidence in sherwin as well as its deep disappointment 
in the governments decision to bring these unprecedented charges 
the spokesman said the company and sherwin intended to defend 
themselves vigorously against the charges and were confident of 
complete vindication 
the indictment alleged the stock price manipulation was 
conducted through the los angelesbased brokerage firm of jefferies 
amp co which was not charged with any wrongdoing 
the companys founder boyd l jefferies has been cooperating 
with investigators and pleaded guilty in march 1987 to two felony 
charges arising from the boesky insider trading scandal 
jefferies who faces a maximum 10year prison term has yet to 
be sentenced 
ivan boeskys connection to this matter is indirect said 
giuliani boesky cooperated and as a result of his cooperation we 
were able to develop a case on jefferies jefferies cooperated and 
among other things he revealed this particular situation 
giuliani said jefferies cooperation and the investigation were 
continuing he declined to say if additional indictments were in 
the works 
the gaf indictment alleged that sherwin acting for gaf had two 
unidentified jefferies amp co employees make union carbide stock 
close at or above a specified price over several days in late 
october 1986 
according to assistant us attorney carl loewenson jr the 
indictment charged sherwin with plotting to drive up the price of 
union carbides stock to attract buyers and to maximize the 
profits gaf could earn by selling its carbide stock 
the indictment further alleged that sherwin promised gaf would 
pay jefferies amp co for any losses the brokerage incurred on such 
trades at the time gaf owned nearly 10 million shares or 10 
percent of carbides outstanding common shares 
jefferies amp co bought large amounts of carbide stock and lost 
money near the close of trading on oct 29 and 30 1986 the 
indictment contended that boosted the price of carbide common stock 
the indictment said one of sherwins alleged coconspirators at 
jefferies sent him a 40000 invoice for fictitious advisory 
services sherwin allegedly approved payment of the invoice and 
gaf made out a check payable to jefferies amp co 
on nov 10 1986 gaf sold 5 million shares of carbide stock to 
salomon brothers for nearly 115 million giuliani said salomon 
brothers cooperated with investigators 
according to the indictment sherwin never sent the 40000 gaf 
check to jefferies after the news media reported that boyd 
jefferies chairman of the brokerage had been subpoenaed by the 
securities and exchange commission in the boesky investigation 
sherwin allegedly instructed his secretary to void the 40000 
check 
if convicted on all counts sherwin 54 of princeton nj 
faces a maximum 50 years in prison and up to 25 million in fines 
the charges against corporate defendant carry maximum fines of up 
to 5 million each

a study of the fees paid to investment bankers in 
friendly business mergers concludes that such payments which may 
total millions of dollars are no more excessive than the 
transaction fees paid to real estate agents 
researchers william curt hunter and mary beth walker of the 
federal reserve bank of atlanta stated their review of 125 friendly 
mergers between 1979 and 1985 indicated the bankers fees though 
large in absolute terms are only a small percentage of the 
economic value created by the mergers 
on average when measured against the gain that the merger 
creates for the new entity the fee approximates that of a 
typical real estate transaction said the researchers who 
figured the average fee equalled about 66 percent of the economic 
gain created by the mergers 
furthermore the investment bankers fees averaged a very 
reasonable less than 1 percent of the total transaction price 
with the highest being 34 percent of the price hunter said 
the study was published in the atlanta feds economic review 
publication 
the researchers limited their survey to friendly mergers of 
public companies and did not look at those where investment banks 
provided only fairness or underwriting services walker said it was 
the first survey to compare fees with services rendered 
the mergers ranged in value from 34 million to 6 billion with 
fees ranging from 100000 to 20 million 
the two largest fees came from the 28 billion deal in 1984 
that joined beatrice foods co and esmark inc and the 5 billion 
merger in 1985 of allied corp with the signal cos inc 
hunter said each deal paid 20 million to the investment banks 
involved first boston corp and lazard freres and co in 
beatriceesmark lazard salomon brothers and oppenheimer and co 
in the alliedsignal merger 
the wave of mergers and acquisitions in recent years has brought 
more attention to the fees paid investment bankers with some 
critics claiming the fees are excessive 
trade publications have discussed the fees in articles with 
titles like merger fees that bend the mind and wall streets 
overpaid young stars the merger departments of three separate 
wall street firms each earned 200 million in 1985 
hunter said the attention and worry have caused some 
mergerminded companies to consider a doityourself approach 
but hunter and ms walker argued against bypassing the 
investment bankers 
bringing together of buyer and seller and advising on what 
price to pay from that point of view investment bankers seem 
to be well worth their fee hunter said in an interview 
firms contemplating a doityourself approach simply because 
fees charged by professional merger intermediaries appear excessive 
would do well to scrutinize the costs and benefits of 
selfsearch hunter and ms walker wrote 
the researchers note that investment banks traditionally have 
provided a range of services including underwriting marketmaking 
and advice on capital structure dividend policy mergers 
acquisitions and divestitures 
while other financial institutions provide many of these same 
services the investment banks specialization and expertise in 
corporate financial matters along with their position overlooking 
capital markets as a whole give them a comparative advantage that 
permits them to command handsome fees they wrote 
hunter also said investment bankers are constantly gathering and 
assessing information on corporate assets research that would have 
to be done otherwise by individual suitors

car shoppers in a healthy economy lured by 
sophisticated incentive programs are likely to keep on buying at 
the higherthanexpected rates of the first half of the year 
industry analysts say 
the big three domestic automakers on wednesday reported a jump 
in their sales rates during the june 2130 sales period 
combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 459918 
during the latejune period this year against 359784 in the same 
period last yera a jump of 136 percent in daily sales rate 
the latejune period had nine selling days this year and eight 
in 1987 so percentage comparisons are made on the basis of daily 
sales rates rather than total sales 
combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 1120962 
for all of june an 85 percent increase in daily sales and 
6184576 for the year through june 30 up 11 percent from the 
first half of 1987 
we see sales for the rest of the year as pretty good with a 
possible soft spot in october said thomas ogrady an analyst 
with integrated automotive resources inc in wayne pa 
a lateyear lull might occur as buyers wait to see what 
incentives will be offered on newly introduced 1989 models in 
dealers showrooms he said 
among imports car and light truck sales totaled 333066 for the 
month down 76 percent and 1874004 for the first half down 15 
percent 
for the june 2130 sales period ford motor co sold 89927 
cars a 274 percent jump in daily sales for the year through june 
30 ford sold 1161574 cars a 128 percent increase over the 
first half of 1987 
general motors sold 144205 cars in late june an 18 percent 
jump and 1952402 for the first six months a 49 percent 
increase 
chrysler corp sold 40817 cars in late june up 84 percent a 
day and 574609 for the first half of 1988 up 143 percent 
ogrady said sales were helped by the apparent success of new 
models at some automakers such as general motors gm10 models he 
also said sales were helped by us automakers increasing 
adeptness at offering incentives with shorter programs and more 
frequent changes in affected models smoothing sales peaks and 
valleys the programs once triggered 
the combination of record employment and a need to replace old 
vehicles gave the industry a good start this year ford vice 
president robert l rewey said 
honda sold 30049 domestically made cars and 33279 imports in 
june up from 25015 us made cars and 31078 imports last june 
toyota sales of usproduced cars for the month reached 3066 up 
from 1228 and its imports rose to 54906 from 47584 last june 
nissan sold 49957 us produced cars in the first half of the 
year down 234 percent and 24644 imported cars down 673

gillette co inaccurately portrayed a new 
yorkbased partnership during a proxy battle earlier this year but 
did not mislead shareholders by withholding information about 
potential buyers says a federal judge 
us district court judge mark l wolf issued his ruling 
wednesday but withheld a decision on whether to invalidate an april 
shareholder vote that defeated a dissident slate of directors 
nominated by the investment group coniston partners 
the judge postponed that decision until after further testimony 
by gillette on alleged proxy violations by coniston 
in a prepared statement gillette said it was surprised and 
disappointed by the ruling on the advertisements 
while gillette disagrees with the ruling and believes its 
conduct was proper its immediate efforts will be directed 
vigorously toward the further critical issues in the case relating 
to conistons conduct the statement said 
coniston principals were not in their new york offices when 
called for comment wednesday 
during the trial which began june 20 both sides alleged 
violations and misrepresentations occurred during their nearly 
threemonth proxy battle over four seats on the gillette board of 
directors 
wolf ruled that several newspaper advertisements by gillette 
during the proxy solicition contained falsely misleading 
information about coniston but wolf said he still was reviewing 
whether coniston violated full disclosure laws in its filings with 
the securities and exchange commission 
he also ruled that gillette was not required to provide 
stockholders with names of companies interested in acquiring the 
bostonbased company including ralston purina co and anheuser 
busch co 
at least 10 companies have signed agreements not to seek control 
of gillette without first notifying gillette management according 
to court testimony most of the pacts expire in november 
gillette on april 14 filed suit seeking to block conistons 
proxy bid on the grounds coniston falsified sec filings and did not 
fully acknowledge all of its investors including swiss finacier 
tito tettamanti 
judge rya zobel allowed the suit but rejected the bid for the 
temporary injunction 
a countersuit by coniston filed on april 19 alleged gillette 
misrepresented coniston in advertisements and mailings to the 
companys 27000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose the 
companies that had expressed interest in buying gillette 
gillette shareholders rejected the dissident coniston slate by a 
52 percent to 48 percent vote during the april 21 annual meeting 
the candidates coniston partners augustus k oliver paul e 
tierney jr keith r gollust and cable television executive david 
strassler had indicated they would urge the 12member gillette 
board to sell the company 
two coniston subsidiaries own 676 million gillette shares or 
about 58 percent of the shares outstanding 
zobel withdrew from the case june 11 on the grounds that she and 
gillette chairman and chief executive officer colman mockler are 
affiliated with harvard university

this should be good news for those still concerned about the 
economy overheating and setting off inflation sparks said 
kenneth goldstein an economist for the organization 
with the latest employment data showing little change new 
hiring is unlikely to rise sharply in the next few months 
goldstein said mays 56 percent unemployment rate matched the

joining the police force his stellar record got him into law

after law school biaggi worked for republican gov nelson 
rockefeller but was bounced from a post as assistant secretary of 
state in 1965 after refusing an order to take unpaid leave instead 
of vacation to work on the mayoral campaign of abraham beame 
beame lost that race to john lindsay 
in 1968 biaggi was elected to congress to fill the seat of 
republican paul fino who had been appointed a judge he has been 
reelected every two years with overwhelming majorities he became 
known as a lawandorder democrat an advocate of handgun control 
and an opponent of british rule in northern ireland 
but one office always eluded him he desperately wanted to be 
elected mayor of new york city 
why did he want to be mayor 
why do people climb the himalayas he replied 
in 1972 he made a run for the job and looked to be a shooin 
for the democratic nomination which in new york city is tantamount 
to election but biaggis candidacy was destroyed by a series of 
investigations and allegations which culminated in his being 
proven a liar 
at the time biaggi was questioned by a grand jury looking into 
allegations of payoffs to congressmen who sponsored certain 
immigration legislation when reports surfaced that biaggi had 
taken the fifth amendment before the panel he vehemently denied it 
he sued to have some but not all of the record made public 
but the tactic backfired when the judge released all the minutes 
proving biaggi had in fact asserted his right to not to incriminate 
himself 
beame was elected mayor and biaggi went back to congress 
in 1986 new accusations were leveled at biaggi and these began 
to stick 
first he was indicted for illegally accepting paid vacations in 
exchange for using his influence to steer federal contracts to 
coastal dry dock and repair a brooklyn shipyard he was convicted 
of taking a gratuity illegal interstate travel and obstruction 
but he wept when he was sentenced to 2 years in prison and fined 
500000 biaggi is appealing the decision 
a second indictment accused him of using the wedtech corp a 
bronxbased machine company as a racketeering enterprise the case 
is now on trial in new york and biaggi is charged with accepting 
millions of dollars worth of company stock issued in his sons 
name in exchange for helping the company get military contracts 
his son and four others are on trial with biaggi 
the house of representatives forced biaggi to relinquish his 
subcommittee chairmanships after the first indictment last year and 
to refrain from voting after his conviction in september but those 
moves were slaps on the wrist compared to what was to come 
in february the house committee on standards of official 
conduct recommended that biaggi be expelled for criminal conduct 
going to the heart of his representational responsibilities 
in an unusual maneuver however congressional leaders decided to 
delay action while biaggi defended himself in the wedtech trial in 
new york 
it is unclear when the resolution may be brought up but biaggi 
has resolved to fight it it must pass by a twothirds vote of the 
house asked what his defense would be he said simply truth 
biaggi has not denied taking the two vacations to a florida spa 
which were paid for by former brooklyn democratic boss meade 
esposito 
hes a friend of 40 years biaggi said it boggles the 
mind 
at the time however coastal owed espositos insurance company 
280000 in premiums esposito was himself convicted of paying 
illegal gratuities and given a twoyear suspended prison term and a 
maximum fine of 500000 
biaggi compared his situation to that of former us labor 
secretary raymond donovan the first sitting cabinet member to be 
indicted donovan was acquitted in may 1987 of larceny and fraud 
charges that forced him from office in 1985 
biaggi however was convicted still he bristled at 
comparisons to rep michael ozzie myers dpa the last 
congressman to be expelled myers ousted in 1980 was convicted of 
bribery after being videotaped taking 50000 in the abscam sting 
i dont think the case is comparable biaggi said his was 
for bribery youre talking about a gratuity 
despite his legal woes and editorials urging him to resign 
biaggi said he is absolutely running for an 11th term 
as a convicted felon however he wont even be able to cast a 
vote for himself

the incident in the persian gulf last weekend which killed 
nearly 300 civilians has raised fears of a retaliatory attack by 
iran 
political experts have suggested that revenge could take the 
form of a terrorist assault against us military bases or 
personnel overseas or against other american targets including 
commercial airline flights 
bob kierce twas director of international security said the 
airline has taken steps to ensure that its already tight security 
precautions are being exercised to the fullest 
kierce said the airline also has added some new measures at 
several airports which he declined to name those measures include 
having a senior member of management on duty whenever a twa plane 
is on the ground at those locations 
twa the nations seventhlargest airline has been the target 
of some of the most notorious terrorist attacks against jetliners 
in recent years in june 1985 lebanese shiite moslems hijacked a 
twa flight over the mediterranean and diverted it to beirut where 
they killed a passenger the hostages werent freed until 17 days 
later 
terrorists set off a bomb in the passenger cabin of a twa 
jetliner over greece in april 1986 killing four americans 
other us airlines that carry passengers abroad also have been 
on alert following the iran air disaster beefing up security in 
the midst of the peak summer travel season experts say 
like twa most big carriers have their own security divisions 
but also contract with outside security companies for passenger 
screening in airports and other protective services 
many of the airlines are touchy about security and refuse to 
discuss what theyre doing but they emphasize that antiterrorist 
defenses are always intensified after such an incident 
the airlines dont need a crystal ball its so obvious 
said dick lally assistant vice president for security at the air 
transport association a washingtonbased trade group that 
represents the nations major carriers 
the airlines have most likely tightened their security in 
consultation with the federal aviation administration lally 
suggested 
pamela hanlon a spokeswoman for pan am corp said there is 
always heightened awareness of security when a potential 
terrorist attack looms our security we believe is overall 
very very good she said 
in addition to its world services subsidiary which sells 
security maintenance and other services to government agencies and 
other airlines pan am also has an internal security division 
after twa pan am probably has the highest profile among the 
american carriers that are active overseas 
united airlines has increased security at some of the foreign 
airports it uses spokesman dan sheehy said united the nations 
largest carrier with scores of domestic flights has all its 
overseas operations in the far east 
in a similar way eastern airlines specializes in latin america 
as its foreign market 
we are taking additional precautions said eastern 
spokeswoman paula musto eastern a subsidiary of giant texas air 
corp was the target of several hijackings to cuba between 1979 
and 1981 but drug smuggling is now its biggest security headache 
airlines from countries that are identified as close allies of 
the united states could also be potential targets of the iranians 
ire 
israels national el al airlines has a reputation as the worlds 
toughest carrier when it comes to security in some instances in 
europe el al has kept its flight routes secret from passengers 
until they actually boarded the plane el al also sometimes uses 
planes of a subsidiary that do not carry the carriers bright blue 
logo 
we dont talk about our security we just do it said aviva 
lavi a spokeswoman for el al in its new york office refusing to 
say whether the airline had tightened security as a result of the 
persian gulf shooting

a massive oil rig fire off the coast of scotland 
will worsen a shortage of north sea oil but the disaster is not 
likely to have a big impact on the industry experts say 
the fatal accident which caused a jump in world oil prices 
thursday prompted the governments department of energy to 
postpone the process for granting new offshore licenses which 
would open up more areas for exploration the department had been 
scheduled to announce on thursday the blocks for which it was 
inviting bids for the licenses 
because of what happened weve decided to postpone that at 
the moment said a department spokesman who spoke anonymously in 
keeping with british practice 
the price of brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil jumped on thursday to 1505 a barrel for september 
delivery up 32 cents from late wednesday 
occidental petroleum co owner of the piper alpha rig said a 
gas leak apparently was to blame for the disaster 
the rig produced 167200 barrels a day the company said a 
barrel contains 42 gallons 
in addition to the piper oil field five other fields were shut 
down the department said they were the claymore tartan 
highland scapa and petronella fields it said 
that meant production was cut by a total of about 220000 
barrels a day to 250000 barrels a day or about onetenth of the 
british sectors production the department and analysts said 
theres pressure on the immediate availability for north sea 
crude said philip morgan an oil analyst with the london 
investment firm warburg securities 
lucy mullins an oil analyst with the london investment firm 
barclays de zoete wedd ltd added however thats going to be 
fairly shortterm 
the related fields should be back in production in a week and 
piper alpha probably will be out of production for up to a year 
ms mullins said 
morgan said the industry already was experiencing a shortage 
because of regular maintenance which oil companies generally do in 
the summmer when the weather is milder 
north sea oil production in the british sector averages 2 
million barrels a day the department of energy says production is 
down 400000 barrels a day from that level because of the 
maintenance morgan said 
producers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
of which britain is not a member will step in to meet demand ms 
mullins said 
the oil price also has been boosted by favorable statistics 
released this week morgan said 
there is starting to be a perception that the glut in world 
supplies in general is not as bad as people thought morgan said 
occidental petroleums production wont be severely affected by 
the fire because it has other outlets ms mullins said 
there were concerns about claims against the company however 
and occidental petroleums stock fell 50 cents to 2625 in early 
trading on the new york stock exchange the stock price of british 
petroleum co plc the biggest producer in the british sector fell 
3 cents to 449 in afternoon trading on londons stock exchange 
the disaster could prove expensive for the north sea oil 
producers in general morgan said 
obviously questions are going to be raised about safety which 
might involve companies in a lot more expenditure morgan said 
the british sector of the north sea oil fields runs from the 
shetland islands north of scotland down to east anglia on englands 
southeast coast covering hundreds of thousands of square miles 
the first british sector gas fields were discovered in 1964 and oil 
production began in 1975 the department of energy said 
the sector employed 28000 people in offshore facilities at the 
end of last year it said 
there are 123 fixed installations including the piper alpha 
platform in the british sector with 40 mobile rigs the 
department said

president reagans latest nominee for a seat 
on the federal reserve board was accused thursday of attempting to 
dodge taxes in negotiating a 25million golden parachute 
compensation agreement with the boston bank holding company he 
heads 
i am concerned about it sen william proxmire dwis 
chairman of the senate banking committee said of the agreement at 
the end of a confirmation hearing for john p laware chairman of 
shawmut national corp 
laware said im not sure a tax dodge was involved in the 
compensation agreement which he said was offered to assure him 
that his annual income of about 500000 would be continued until 
he reaches age 65 he turned 60 on feb 20 
despite proxmires concern that the bank not laware is 
obligated to pay a special excise tax on a portion of the pay 
agreement there was no indication the issue would affect lawares 
nomination in fact proxmire told laware you are a very 
impressive candidate for the job 
however committee aides say some democrats are reluctant to see 
the nomination approved because it would mean that reagan would 
have filled all seven seats on the board which controls the 
nations money supply 
these senators are hoping that fellow democrat michael dukakis 
will be elected president and could promptly fill the federal 
reserve seat after taking office next january 
laware a registered democrat would replace henry g wallich 
who resigned the 14year term would expire jan 31 2002 
proxmire told reporters he will confer with committee members 
before deciding whether the panel should vote on the laware 
nomination this year should the panel recommend the nomination it 
would be up to majority leader robert c byrd dwva to 
determine whether the senate should consider the nomination this 
year 
the issue of monetary policy was barely mentioned at the 
hearing most questions were about the federal budget and trade 
deficits the increasing share of us debt held by foreign 
investors and third world debt 
laware said he is little concerned about the fact that only one 
of the worlds 10 biggest banks is american i dont think that 
makes much difference he said its how wellmanaged and 
profitable they are i am more concerned with the 
profitandloss statement than with size 
none of the other committee members took up proxmires line of 
questioning about the golden parachute agreement which was 
negotiated earlier this year as part of the merger that created 
shamut national corp 
similar agreements are used to reward executives when control or 
ownership of a corporation changes in 1984 congress required 
recipients of such arrangements to pay a 20 percent excise tax on 
the portion that the law considers excessive in addition 
corporations were barred from taking a tax deduction for the 
excessive payments 
under lawares agreement which he acknowledged to be worth 
about 500000 a year the corporation itself is obligated to pay 
the 20 percent tax 
proxmire estimated that would save laware about 200000 in 
taxes 
how do you justify such an attempt to dodge the tax code 
proxmire asked the idea behind the 1984 law he said was to 
discourage excessive payments which officers and directors vote 
themselves 
im not sure its a dodge laware said the tax is being 
paid regardless and the federal government is losing no money 
he said 
laware must pay income tax on the full amount of the golden 
parachute payment including whatever amount the bank chips in to 
cover the special excise tax

general mills inc said its profit jumped 53 
percent in its fourth quarter from a year earlier boosted by a 
lower tax rate good volume growth in consumer foods strong 
performance by key restaurant chains and significant productivity 
gains 
the food giant reported thursday that its profit for the quarter 
ended may 29 rose to 549 million or 65 cents a share from 361 
million or 41 cents a share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1987 
fourthquarter sales increased to 13 billion from 12 billion 
a year earlier 
for fiscal 1988 which was one week shorter than fiscal 1987 
earnings rose 27 percent to 2831 million or 325 a share from 
222 million or 250 a share 
sales in fiscal 1988 were up 10 percent to 52 billion from 
47 billion the previous year 
the earnings report for the fourth quarter includes the 
discontinued specialty retailing operations of talbots and eddie 
bauer general mills will post a 200 million gain after taxes in 
the first quarter of fiscal 1989 from the sale of the retailing 
companies 
general mills chairman bruce atwater said the consumer foods 
division achieved a 4 percent increase in domestic packaged food 
volume leading to annual sales and operating profit gains of 9 
percent and 11 percent respectively the company said the success 
of several new microwave food products and growing acceptance of 
yoplait yogurt and other new foods contributed to the earnings 
increase 
spending on big g cereals for the fourth quarter was 
particularly strong as both volume and market share grew atwater 
said 
in the restaurant division red lobster and olive garden 
operations were up 16 percent both leeann chins and yorks 
reported losses including charges of 129 million related to 
closing unprofitable units which caused total operating profits to 
be down 4 percent 
during the fiscal year the company invested 411 million in new 
assets an increase of 25 percent from a year earlier major 
investments were for new food capacity new and improved red 
lobsters new olive gardens and investments for improved

control data corp will convert its 
disk drive operations into a separate subsidiary a possible 
prelude to a sale or partnership for the billiondollar unit 
analysts said the reorganization would make it possible for 
control data to attract a jointventure partner or a buyer for the 
unit which accounted for nearly 1 billion of the companys 3 
billion in revenue last year 
disk drives are devices used for storing and retrieving 
computerized information at high speed 
louis lundberg a company spokesman said creation of the 
subsidiary will enable control data to explore the full spectrum 
of opportunities for data storage products in the future those 
include joint venture partnership acquisition or divestiture 
lundberg on wednesday confirmed the contents of a june 29 memo 
from lawrence perlman a control data executive vice president and 
president of the data storage products group 
lundberg said control data had not planned to announce the move 
because it was an internal reorganization in addition to the 
memo the creation of the subsidiary was disclosed in the july 1 
issue of current an internal control data publication 
subsidiary status also will make the disk drive operations more 
competitive and free control datas financial resources for use in 
other areas he said but he provided no details 
william easterbrook an analyst for kidder peabody amp co inc 
in san francisco said it would be easier to sell a subsidiary 
a buyer can more easily see separate books separate 
profitandloss statements that are not so meshedin with the rest 
of control data it makes it easier for him to think of a 
price he said 
gary smaby an analyst for needham amp co inc in minneapolis 
said the strategy has been set in motion that could lead to the 
spinning out refinancing or restructuring of that business 
within the next two years 
in the refinancing area the subsidiary might raise additional 
capital through the sale of stock smaby said its a way to 
raise capital on their own if they need capital to be competitive 
without having to pull it from the mother corporation 
lundberg confirmed that the data storage products group could 
sell stock in itself to outsiders as a group or division of 
control data it could not do that he said

banca commerciale italiana spa italys second 
largest bank may be forced to abandon its friendly merger plans 
with irving bank corp if it fails to win regulatory approval to 
pay irving shareholders a special cash dividend experts said 
thursday 
that could be a boon to bank of new york which has been bidding 
for control of irving for more than nine months the analysts said 
regulators already have raised serious concerns about special 
payouts with one top official from the federal reserve bank of new 
york saying they should be considered only by banks with more than 
adequate capital 
it seems a little odd that this the special dividend comes 
into play right now when the fed is trying to standardize 
international bank capital adequacy requirements by 1992 said 
james j mcdermott jr a banking analyst with the investment firm 
keefe bruyette amp woods 
1988 has been a year when most major moneycenter banks have 
been building capital not paying out extra dividends he said 
but a proposed 10ashare special cash dividend is a key 
element of banca commerciales offer to buy a majority stake in 
irving as an alternative to bank of new yorks hostile bid 
the milanbased bank is offering 80 a share for 51 percent of 
irvings 185 million common shares outstanding and the special 
dividend for the remaining 49 percent 
earlier this week it sweetened the offer to include warrants 
entitling shareholders to buy newly issued irving stock at 65 a 
share over the next seven years stockholders would receive one 
warrant for every four shares they now own the offer is valued at 
a minimum of 7950 a share 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its own stock for each of 
irvings common shares outstanding the offer is valued at around 
68 a share or 12 billion 
from a practical standpoint i would think if the fed was to 
disallow the banca commerciale special dividend that would 
place pressure on bci to increase its offer in a tangible manner 
said michael starr a banking analyst with duff amp phelps inc 
i wouldnt think it would have to be a dollarfordollar 
match i dont think the market expected the full 10 to go through 
anyway that was a major if 
a number of analysts agreed that at some point it might no 
longer be economically feasible for banca commerciale to continue 
with the deal leaving irving alone with bank of new yorks 
persistent takeover advances 
i believe it current offer already is at the upper end of 
the range said mcdermott 
patricia skigen of willkie farr amp gallagher banca 
commerciales legal adviser said her client remained committed to 
the irving merger 
the offer that we made is outstanding ms skigen said 
she contended the feds reservations about special dividends 
contained in a letter dated wednesday to all three banks by new 
york fed executive vice president frederick c schadrack was meant 
solely as a a spot policy statement to the world at large 
the fed also must determine whether to grant bank of new york an 
extension of conditional approval for its proposed merger with 
irving bank of new york asked for 60 more days on thursday the 
fed approval was due to expire saturday 
in addition a new york appeals court will be faced with 
deciding whether a provison of irvings antitakeover poison 
pill is valid it was struck down by the new york state supreme 
court on wednesday but irving has vowed to appeal 
in other developments thursday a courtappointed referee 
refused to change the outcome of a crucial proxy vote in which 
shareholders reelected irvings board of directors over bank of 
new yorks nominees 
the referee did decide however that a block of 450000 votes 
of irving shares belonged in bank of new yorks camp and that an 
amendment to irvings bylaws alolowing 10 percent of holders to 
call a special shareholder meeting had passed

the securities and exchange commission voted 
thursday to limit the ability of american companies to weaken the 
voting power of their stockholders as way of fighting hostile 
corporate raids 
the new oneshare onevote rule approved 41 does not 
altogether ban dual classes of common stock but rather spells out 
how shares with reduced voting power can be issued 
one popular takeover defense in which companies entice 
stockholders into giving up their voting rights by offering a 
special onetime dividend would be prohibited 
also barred would be rules that require a stock purchaser to 
wait sometimes for several years before newly acquired shares 
accrue full voting rights 
companies will have to comply with the new sec rule if they want 
their stock traded on an exchange or through the national 
association of securities dealers automated quotation system 
however in another voting rights area the sec decided to defer 
to the states in states that allow it companies will be permitted 
to deny voting power to takeover raiders unless the other 
shareholders approve 
about a dozen states have adopted such laws and the sec in 
friendofthecourt briefs has argued that they improperly 
interfere with national securities markets 
in unrelated action the commission voted unanimously to back 
off from recommending congressional legislation barring brokerage 
firms from requiring customers to agree in advance to settle 
disputes before an arbitration panel 
state securities regulators and others have been arguing that 
socalled predispute arbitration clauses in the fine print of 
account agreements are unfair because they require customers in 
some cases unwittingly to sign away their right to sue in court 
before they know the nature of any disagreement that may arise 
richard g ketchum director of the secs division of market 
regulation said he doubted the new oneshare onevote rule would 
have a dramatic effect on takeovers but he conceded that in a few 
cases takeovers would be easier because the rule eliminates some 
extremely effective defenses 
commissioner charles c cox the only member to vote against the 
rule said he believed the sec was intruding into an area that has 
traditionally been left to states the chartering and governance of 
corporations 
i believe this is an improper use of the listing standards to 
tamper with corporate governance he said 
however sec chairman david s ruder said the rule is structured 
to be as least intrusive as possible 
companies will still be permitted to issue new shares with 
diluted voting power dilutedpower shares can also be issued to 
accomplish a merger and private companies going public will be 
able to issue both strongvoting and weakvoting shares 
however corporations will not be able to issue supershares 
that have more voting power than common stock already issued that 
would have allowed company insiders such as managers to buy up 
the strong shares to acquire control over the company 
stocks of foreign companies traded in the united states will be 
exempted from the regulations the 359 us companies that had 
disparate voting rights before thursday will also be exempted as 
will the stocks of small companies listed in the nasds socalled 
pink sheets and traded by brokers over the telephone 
despite the exceptions the rule drew praise from the united 
shareholders association which is headed by texas oilman and 
takeover specialist t boone pickens jr 
the secs action helps to restore democracy to corporate 
america pickens said in a statement 
commission debate over the rule approved thursday began nearly 
two years ago when the new york stock exchange in september 1986 
asked for sec permission to drop its 60yearold oneshare 
onevote standard 
exchange officials said they were dropping the standard 
reluctantly out of fear of losing business to the american stock 
exchange which had more liberal rules and the nasd which had no 
such standard 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee and others have argued that the sec does not have 
jurisdiction over the matter and should defer to congress 
however commissioner edward h fleischman said congress has not 
acted in two years and that the law requires the sec to approve or 
disapprove changes in exchange rules 
on the arbitration issue the sec voted to ask the stock 
exchanges and the nasd to study predispute clauses and to report 
back to the commission by oct 15 
nevertheless reps rick boucher dva john d dingell 
dmich and edward j markey dmass have gone ahead and 
introduced a bill anyway 
the head of the north american securities administrators 
association which represents state regulators called the sec 
decision disappointing 
small investors will see the commission failure to act as 
another sign that the deck is stacked against them said james c 
meyer president of the association and tennessees top securities 
regulator

most grain and soybean futures prices plummeted their limits for 
daily trading thursday on the chicago board of trade taking some 
analysts by surprise and leaving them divided on the reasons for 
the move 
on other markets gasoline futures soared and other energy 
futures also gained livestock and meat were mixed precious metals 
advanced and stockindex futures gained 
im astounded katharina zimmer new yorkbased grains 
analyst for merrill lynch capital markets inc said after the 
grain and soybean markets closed 
most corn soybean and oat contracts plunged their respective 
15 30 and 10cent limits for daily trading and the limitless 
contracts for july delivery fell even further wheat contracts for 
december march and july 1989 delivery tumbled 20 cents a bushel 
the limit in that market 
despite new forecasts for weekend rains in the dry and dusty 
midwest ms zimmer said the selloff was technically inspired 
this market has nothing to do with fundamentals any more 
she said instead she said thursdays action was dominated by 
socalled technicians who base their trading decisions on 
historical chart patterns 
on thursday the charts indicated it was time to sell ms 
zimmer said 
more likely the drop was caused by a combination of technical 
and fundamental factors said ted mao grain specialist with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
though prices turned lower shortly after the opening mao said 
the sharpest drop followed midday news reports that senate minority 
leader robert dole rkan had said the senate may consider 
measures allowing farmers to plant soybeans and oats on a portion 
of their acreage idled under government crop programs 
but dole speaking to the commodity club in washington said the 
senate probably would not act on the matter for at least another 
month 
private forecasts for moderate rainfall this weekend in the 
northern corn belt also pressured the markets mao said 
the market continues to show its sensitivity to prospects of 
getting even a little bit of rain he said 
thats nonsense countered ms zimmer who dismissed the 
expected rain as sprinkles 
to tell an illinois farmer were locked limitdown because of 
the rain were going to get i dont know what theyd say but it 
probably would not be printable she said 
wheat settled 15 cents to 20 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 378 a bushel corn was 14 cents to 22 cents 
lower with july at 320 a bushel oats were 10 cents to 22 cents 
lower with july at 301 a bushel soybeans were 26 cents to 49 
cents lower with july at 934 a bushel 
prices for future delivery of unleaded gasoline and heating oil 
soared on the new york mercantile exchange in reaction to 
wednesdays weekly american petroleum institute report showing a 
sharp drawdown in gasoline supplies analysts said 
energy futures were broadly supported by reports that the tragic 
explosion of a north sea oil rig could cause production of north 
sea crude oil to fall by 30000 barrels a day said nauman barakat 
energy analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
crudeoil futures declined on profittaking in the second half 
of the session he said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 43 cents to 55 cents 
higher with august at 1583 a barrel heating oil was 137 cents 
to 168 cents higher with august at 4429 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 123 cents to 256 cents higher with august at 5312 
cents a gallon 
the inflationary implications of higher energy prices supported 
precious metals futures on new yorks commodity exchange analysts 
said 
gold settled 40 cents to 120 higher with august at 44110 a 
troy ounce silver was 115 cents to 136 cents higher with july at 
6935 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the drop in grain prices prompted reversals of recent 
droughtrelated trends in the cattle and hog markets and pork 
bellies rebounded sharply after touching 8year lows on wednesday 
said paul hare an analyst with linnco futures inc in chicago 
live cattle were 60 cent lower to 15 cent higher with august

unr industries inc filed a reorganization plan 
thursday to settle nearly 113 million in debts and about 90000 
personalinjury claims stemming from exposure to its asbestos 
products 
under the plan all creditors and health claimants would become 
shareholders in the chicagobased steeltubing maker which stopped 
manufacturing asbestos pipe insulation in 1962 
the plan calls for business creditors to exchange their 1127 
million in claims for 28 percent of the stock in the restructured 
company which will have equity in excess of 190 million 
according to unr attorney malcolm gaynor 
personalinjury claimants would receive 64 percent of the common 
stock of the restructured company and current shareholders would 
receive 8 percent gaynor said 
current shareholders also would receive the right to purchase 
enough stock at 515 per share to double their holdings during 
the next six years he said 
asbestos commonly used as an insulating material until the 
early 1960s can cause a range of respiratory ailments when its 
fibers are inhaled 
most of the health claims were filed by shipyard workers who 
said their contact with unrs asbestos pipe insulation had caused 
them to develop health problems gaynor said 
stock earmarked for the claimants would be placed in a pool to 
be divided among all current and future claimants he said 
out of that fund will come the cost of determining who it will 
go to gaynor said were saying heres a block of stock 
its your problem to divide it up at your expense 
he said the plan was endorsed by representatives of unrs 
largest creditors and the personalinjury claimants creditors and 
claimants still must vote on the plan although no date for the 
vote has been set gaynor said 
he said us district judge william j norton the 
courtappointed examiner in the us bankruptcy court case also 
had endorsed the plan 
unr filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy 
code in 1982 after the cost of defending itself against 
asbestosrelated personalinjury claims contributed to a 
secondquarter loss of 89 million 
unr a holding company consisting of unarco industries inc unr 
inc and unr products inc reported a profit of nearly 19 
million for the first quarter of 1988

but he said it is necessary because there has been no turnaround 
for the oil industry reading amp bates has had three years of losses 
and a fourth is anticipated he said 
i think theres no question itll get better bates said 
the question is when if the company is to survive as a major

the securities and exchange commission on 
thursday backed off from recommending legislation that would 
guarantee investors the right to sue their stock broker in court 
the commission had been considering asking congress to outlaw 
clauses in brokerage account agreements requiring customers to 
settle disputes through industrysponsored arbitration panels 
rather than through the courts 
but by a 50 vote the commission decided instead to ask stock 
exchanges and other organizations that run arbitration systems to 
study the matter and report back by oct 15 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the securities markets said 
the sec had caved in to industry lobbying with its decision 
apparently there was a fullcourt press by the industry that 
was successful markey said i think the industry stared 
into the secs eyes on this issue and the sec blinked 
when the commission discussed the arbitration clauses last 
month the legislative recommendation looked headed for approval 
it was supported by sec chairman david s ruder and member aulana 
l peters commissioner charles c cox said he was inclined to 
favor it but wanted to hear from securities firms which strongly 
opposed banning the clauses 
but on thursday ruder retreated from his earlier support he 
said he was persuaded to defer action after learning the industry 
would at least favor disclosure notices to customers explaining the 
meaning of the clauses 
an sec survey found that 39 percent of cash accounts carry 
arbitration agreements and that firms holding another 40 percent 
were considering using such clauses 
but ruder said many firms that were once looking into using the 
clauses for cash accounts appear to be holding off at least for 
now he also said some regional firms have recently made a point of 
advertising that they will open cash accounts without arbitration 
clauses 
however nearly all firms surveyed 95 percent require 
arbitration agreements for option and margin accounts where the 
risk of loss is greater 
proponents of the clauses argue that customers are free to 
negotiate the clauses out of the contract and that firms have a 
right to set the conditions under which theyre willing to do 
business 
administration officials including beryl sprinkel chairman of 
the council of economic advisers had sent letters to the sec 
criticizing staff proposals on arbitration clauses 
despite the lack of sec support reps rick boucher dva john 
d dingell dmich and edward j markey dmass have introduced 
legislation anyway 
the bill is backed by state securities regulators and others who 
say arbitration clauses are unfair because they require customers 
to sign away their right to sue before they know the nature of any 
disagreement that may arise 
the head of the north american securities administrators 
association which represents state regulators called the sec 
decision disappointing 
if the commissions mistake goes uncorrected investors will 
end up having only those rights which the securities industry 
chooses to give them small investors will see the commission 
failure to act as another sign that the deck is stacked against 
them said james c meyer president of the association and 
tennessees top securities regulator 
ruder however said i want to make it clear that this 
is not a decision to deemphasize consumer interest in the 
securities industry

a former secretary to prime minister noboru 
takeshita was added thursday to the list of aides to top 
politicians who reportedly profited from questionable stock 
dealings in a scandal sweeping japanese business and politics 
takeshita told reporters that his former secretary ihei aoki 
earned profits by trading the shares of the real estate company 
recruitcosmos he said aoki obtained shares from the company and 
then sold them shortly after recruitcosmos went public in october 
1986 when takeshita was finance minister 
in related developments the president of japans leading 
economic newspaper and the chairman of recruitcosmos resigned the 
chairman of recruitcosmos and its parent company also announced he 
will step down 
the dealings were not illegal but critics said the case 
illustrates doubtful ethics in the links between japans 
politicians and businessmen 
takeshita did not elaborate on the number of shares aoki traded 
or his profits from the deal and refused to take responsibility 
for his former aides action 
but takeshita acknowledged that the scandal would seriously 
affect an upcoming session of the diet japans parliament when 
the administration hopes to push through a major tax reform measure 
the controversy surfaced last month as a bribery case in a local 
government but entered a new phase with revelations that aides to 
leaders of the governing liberal democratic party profited with 
recruitcosmos stock 
in addition to takeshita the scandal has affected secretaries 
of finance minister kiichi miyazawa former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone liberal democratic party secretary general and former 
foreign minister shintaro abe former defense agency director 
general koichi kato and michio watanabe the former minister of 
international trade and industry 
of them only miyazawa has denied knowing of the stock deals 
the others said they had become aware their aides had received the 
stock and made profits 
this involves the most senior liberal democratic party 
officials and there is going to be a major outcry from the 
japanese people said shigeru ito a leader of the main 
opposition japan socialist party although they broke no law 
they abused their positions to line their pockets 
saburo tsukamoto chairman of democratic socialist party the 
third largest opposition party also was found on the list of 76 
people who reportedly profited from the transactions 
according to japanese press reports recruitcosmos gave or sold 
stock at an artificially low price to highranking politicians in 
some instances the company reportedly lent money to politicians to 
buy the shares 
when the company went public in october 1986 and the stock price 
soared the politicians were able to reap large profits the 
reports said 
it was not clear what if anything the politicians did for 
recruitcosmos in return 
whether they are politicians or company heads those who have 
responsibilities must behave prudently not to be criticized by the 
general public chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi said in the 
only official comment from the government on the matter 
not only politicians are involved in the scandal 
ko morita president of japans leading economic daily nihon 
keizai shimbun resigned wednesday after it was revealed that he 
had dealt in recruitcosmos shares violating the rules of his 
newspaper 
hiromasa ezoe chairman of recruitcosmos and its parent company 
recruit ltd a giant information service firm also announced that 
he will resign the two chairmanships 
the president of recruit naotaka ida said ezoe will also 
withdraw from the governments tax commission 
politicians want as much money as they can get and 
businessmen always look for connections with politicians said an 
editorial in asahi shimbun the newspaper that broke the story 
the controversy is the latest in a series of scandals to rock 
japans longdominant liberal democratic party 
six people have been indicted since may for allegedly arranging 
bribes by advertising agencies to gain public relations contracts 
with the prime ministers office 
last month five executives of a tokyo electronics firm who made 
large donations to both the liberal democratic and japan socialist 
parties were arrested for evading income taxes of 12 million 
earned from illegal stocks manipulation 
former prime minister kakuei tanaka was found guilty in 1983 of 
accepting bribes from the lockheed corp of the united states but 
he remained an important force in japanese politics until he 
suffered a stroke in 1985 
takeshitas faction within the ruling party is made up mainly of 
former tanaka followers

a federal jury on thursday awarded 
226 million to the estate of nowdefunct esm government 
securities ruling against financier marvin warner whom the firm 
claimed had unjustly profited from its 1985 failure 
the jury deliberated seven hours before ruling in favor of esm 
on civil complaints in the lawsuit accusing warner of fraudulently 
taking money out of the troubled securities firm when he knew the 
firm was in dire financial trouble of profiting from insider 
information and of loaning esm money in exchange for profits on 
bogus financial transactions 
warners cincinnatibased thrift home state savings bank was 
esms biggest customer home state collapsed shortly after esm 
failed in 1985 triggering a savings and loan panic in ohio 
warner 69 said he would appeal he was visibly upset when he 
heard the verdict and said the jury has spoken im stunned 
terribly 
warners attorney andrew hall said it was clearly a decision 
based on court passion clearly the jury did not understand what 
this case was about 
district judge jose gonzalez jr had given the jury 22 questions 
to consider and they ruled in favor of esm trustee thomas tew on 
every question including the amounts requested by the plaintiffs 
the lawsuit also had claimed warner violated securities 
racketeering and civil theft statutes and that he unjustly profited 
from esms 1985 failure 
warner won a strategic victory just before the start of 
deliberations wednesday when gonzalez determined the plaintiff had 
not proven warner was involved in securities fraud 
but in thursdays verdict the jury found that he actually 
participated in the fraudulent purpose of esm government 
securities 
although he dismissed the fraud counts gonzalez did not change 
the amount of damages that could be sought the judge earlier 
reduced the damages sought from 62 million to 22 million 
before the verdict warner said regardless of the financial 
outcome what that judge did vindicated me 
warner last year was acquitted of federal criminal charges but 
convicted of state charges in ohio and sentenced to three years in 
connection with the collapse of home state he is free while 
appealing that conviction 
much of the blame for the thrifts problems was placed on 
warner who held a personal account at esm and had encouraged home 
state to invest with the obscure fort lauderdale firm 
tews lawyers claimed warner was an insider at esm who demanded 
and was given special treatment because of home states huge 
investments with esm 
before the verdict tew said he was disappointed by the 
dismissal of the fraud counts but that the damage to his suit was 
minimal 
hall said the dismissal of the four fraud counts supported his 
claim that warner was a victim and not a perpetrator of fraud at 
esm 
the largest single victim of esms fraud is marvin warner 
hall said in closing arguments if you are a victim how can you 
be an insider 
as evidence hall repeatedly reminded jurors that warner 
continued to invest money and real estate with esm after allegedly 
learning of the firms troubles 
but jose garciapedrosa the attorney for tew argued that 
warner had to keep investing in esm because esm and home state were 
dependent on each other for survival

sun co incs board of directors on 
thursday approved a major restructuring plan that will spin off the 
companys 48 billion domestic oil and gas exploration and 
production business into an independent company and trim its work 
force by more than 1000 
the plan also calls for the nations 10th largest oil company to 
expand its international exploration and production operations as 
well as its refining and marketing business which will be retained 
by the restructured sun company officials said 
it comes two days after sun announced it had agreed to buy 
atlantic petroleum corp a northeast refiner and retailer for 
513 million from oil trader john duess 
the reorganization is projected as a majorcost savings move for 
the radnorbased company said peter waitneight vice president of 
corporate financing 
the earnings have not been growing in the rather weak market 
for crude oil and natural gas waitneight said in a telephone 
interview 
he said company officials believe that payroll reductions and 
independent management structures for the separate companies would 
result in higher earnings that would boost profits 
under the plan current sun shareholders would receive a 
oneforone taxfree distribution of stock in the newly created sun 
exploration and production co which will handle domestic oil and 
gas exploration and production 
the redistribution is subject to approval by shareholders and 
dependent on the internal revenue service granting it taxfree 
status 
the new company to be headquartered in dallas would become the 
largest independent oil and gas producer in north america with 
approximately 48 billion in assets and 16 billion in revenue in 
1987 sun officials said 
the original sun would restructure with more than 9 billion in 
assets excluding the domestic oil and gas exploration and 
production business sun totaled 91 billion in revenue last year 
waitneight said the distribution would be presented for 
shareholders consideration during a special meeting in early 
october with distribution of shares if approved planned for the 
end of october 
reduction of the work force will begin immediately waitneight 
said 
about 800 sun workers employed in the new companys operations 
most of them in the western united states will lose their jobs 
waitneight said 
another 250 workers at the restructured sun most of them in the 
east and many in the philadelphia area also will lose their jobs 
he said 
company officials said some employees would be offered early 
retirment incentives but waitneight would not specify how many 
sun officials expect the restructuring to produce 65 million in 
aftertax savings for sun eampp each year and 15 million for the 
restructured sun each year most of that through payroll reductions 
the driving force behind this decision is to enhance value for 
holders of sun stock said robert mcclements jr chairman and 
chief executive officer of sun 
robert p hauptfuhrer suns president and chief operating 
officer was named by the sun board as the chairman and chief 
executive officer of the newly created sun eampp james mccormick 
who heads the companys exploration and production operations will 
become the president and chief operating officer of sun eampp 
sun company has more than 20000 employees in the united states 
and eight other countries it has refineries in pennsylvania ohio 
oklahoma puerto rico and canada and mines coal in five states sun 
sells gasoline under the sunoco brand 
atlantic has one refinery with 440 employees in philadelphia 
owns 571 gas stations and supplies another 400 independent 
stations primarily in pennsylvania new york and new jersey 
the atlantic purchase also includes 30 oil terminals owned by 
atlantic plus its 986mile products pipeline system from its 
refinery to pittsburgh pa and rochester and tonawanda ny 
sun reported revenue of 239 billion in the first quarter of 
1988 compared to 226 billion in the first quarter of 1987 net 
income for the first quarter of 1988 was 60 million or 57 per 
share of common stock a 58 percent increase from the 38 million 
or 35 per share of common stock in the first quarter of 1987

the us postal service has turned to a 
federal court in an effort to thwart challenges to a contract it 
arranged with texas computer billionaire h ross perot 
at stake is a potentially multimilliondollar contract to study 
ways to improve postal efficiency 
the deal is being challenged by wouldbe competitors who didnt 
get to bid they have asked the general services administrations 
board of contract appeals to order suspension of the agreement and 
the board complied thursday ordering a temporary freeze on the 
contract 
the postal service on wednesday asked the us court of appeals 
for the federal circuit to rule that the contract board doesnt 
have jurisdiction in the case 
the postal service contends that it is exempt from the federal 
procurement law that calls for the gsa to arrange most government 
purchases of data processing services and equipment 
that argument didnt wash with the board of contract appeals 
however which declined to drop the case on jurisdictional grounds 
in a separate case last april the board concluded that it did 
have jurisdiction over the postal service and said that agency is 
indeed bound by the procurement rules 
postal officials insisting that they are not covered by the 
law declined tuesday to provide documents or individuals to 
testify before the board 
the postal service agreed that it did not follow provisions of 
the law saying that that was because it has its own purchasing 
rules which were followed 
the deal is being challenged by electronic data systems corp 
perots former company and now a part of general motors corp and 
by planning research corp of mclean va 
the contract is in two phases the first is a 500000 agreement 
calling for perot to analyze postal operations and recommend ways 
to save money it was announced june 2 and immediately drew 
criticism from a variety of sources 
after the first 90day phase there is to be a second part in 
which perot would be paid a percentage of any savings the postal 
service realized from implementing his recommendations for ways of 
improving its systems and procedures 
the senate meanwhile has requested the general accounting 
office to investigate terms of the deal and directed the postal 
service to delay the second phase in the meantime
