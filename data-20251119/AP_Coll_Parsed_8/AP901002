recreational hikers spotted the wreckage on the great gulf trail 
on this mountain in eastern new hampshire the northeasts highest 
peak

bring down the bodies and wreckage mock said

the grayhaired woman stood 
motionless as the health workers fingers gently probed for the 
hard nodules under her skin that signal river blindness 
the ravages of years of infection are evident in the drooping 
skin of her face in her strangely elongated earlobes victoria 
morales is 49 she could pass for 69 
in her case the disease was curbed before the parasite spun a 
blinding web of microscopic filaments over her eyes 
it took years of painful treatment with a drug whose side 
effects made many afflicted peasants flee the rural health workers 
that prowl the rich coffee country of southern chiapas state 
mexico has been fighting river blindness for nearly a 
halfcentury suddenly it has a new weapon a gentler new drug 
called ivermectin 
rural health worker jose alfredo gordillo 32 recalls how he 
used to pressure people to take the old medication diethyl 
carbamazine used in mexico since 1953 
theyd say you have come to make us sick the sixyear 
veteran of the federal health departments river blindness brigades 
said 
some people simply refused the treatment was so unpleasant 
they paid the price with disfigurement premature aging or 
blindness 
but the side effects of ivermectin are milder and patients now 
readily come forward for treatment 
we have a problem gordillo said smiling the community 
leaders want everyone treated even if they arent sick 
ivermectin has raised hopes worldwide in the battle against a 
disease the world health organization says afflicts 18 million 
people in west africa latin america and parts of the middle east 
an estimated 300000 of them mostly in west africa have been 
blinded 
ivermectin was developed in the 1970s for livestock parasites 
when researchers discovered it was a safe effective treatment for 
onchocerciasis or river blindness the manufacturer merck and co 
of rahway nj decided to provide it for free 
a committee of medical experts based at the carter center in 
atlanta was set up to handle applications 
dr bruce dull the committees secretary said mexico which 
has one of the worlds oldest river blindness control programs 
began using ivermectin in may 1989 
the three varieties of black fly that carry river blindness in 
mexico are found in chiapas and nearby oaxaca only at the high 
cool altitudes that coffee grows best their larvae thrive in 
fastmoving streams 
coffee workers are those that are primarily affected and 
coffee is very important to our economy said dr andres martin 
a federal health official in mexico city 
he said 250000 people live in areas where river blindness is 
found about 20000 active cases have been diagnosed and 16000 
people are now taking ivermectin he said 
worldwide up to 500000 people take the drug which carries the 
brand name mectizan dull said 
twentyfive brigades of health workers spend up to 40 days at a 
time in the field hiking to remote villages sleeping on floors 
and treating the ailment peasants here call dogs skin or bad 
bruise piel de perro or mal morado because of the 
discoloration and disfigurement it causes 
there are 76 families on the ejido or communal farm of nuevo 
victoria in the heart of river blindness territory nearly all are 
affected by the disease said jorge velasco head of the regional 
river blindness program 
velasco dips his hand into a stream that runs through the ejido 
a squirming black goo covers his fingertip it is the larvae of the 
black flies that carry the disease 
the adult flies in turn inject the larvae of the parasite worm 
into humans with their bite the larvae grow into adult worms some 
as long as two feet which can live inside humans for 12 years and 
often cluster insie hard nodules under the skin 
but it is not the adults that do the damage its their 
offspring hundreds of millions of microworms called 
microfiliariae that swarm through human body tissue 
blindness is more common in africa than latin america but the 
microworms produce fierce itching and disfigurement in most 
victims 
they cause the skin to decay it becomes dark scaly flaccid 
and in the severest cases lesions develop over the eyes until 
sight is gone 
the effects are not reversible the only hope is to control the 
infection before the worst damage is done 
both drugs kill the microworms 
reactions to diethyl carbamazine swelling itching low blood 
pressure joint pain rash fever swollen lymph nodes can be so 
intense that it is not used in some rural areas where patients 
could not be hospitalized 
although ivermectin also produces swelling and itching the 
effects usually pass in days 
we give thanks to god that this was invented to help us 
said rumalda raymundo perez 51 who has taken both drugs 
neither drug is preventative or a complete cure but both kill 
the microworms and ivermectin appears to reduce the rate at which 
the adult worms breed 
although it appears annual treatment is effective mexico has 
permission to administer it twice a year to see if the rate of 
infection drops dull said 
the war against river blindness is a tropical disease success 
story in a country where thousands of children die each year of 
simple ailments like measles and diarrhea but hopes of eradication 
depend on elimination of the diseasebearing flies 
in my 23 years here nothing has been done to attack the 
vector carrier said vicente ardines martinez head of the 
transmittable disease program in chiapas a state famed for its 
lush forests mountains jungles and waterfalls 
but the environment is fragile we dont want to destroy it

the justice of gender in the locker room was 
supposed to be settled 12 years ago courts gave women 
sportswriters equal access to dressing rooms so they would have the 
same chance as men to do their jobs 
yet the issue of women in the clubhouse keeps making headlines 
denise tom of usa today was barred monday night from the cincinnati 
bengals dressing room hours after the national football league 
named an investigator to look into charges of harassment of boston 
herald reporter lisa olson 
we go into locker rooms not because we want to but because we 
have to wrote christine brennan a sportswriter with the 
washington post and one of pioneers who fought for equal access 
its not exciting or sexy or tantalizing its cramped and 
steamy and messy she said but most stadiums are too old to 
have a room big enough for all reporters and all players to meet 
for interviews so the only place we can do our jobs is the locker 
room 
about 500 women work as sports journalists according to the 
association for women in sports media they have the same right to 
do their jobs as women who drive trucks mine coal doctor the sick 
or practice law 
precedent was established in 1978 when a federal judge ruled 
melissa ludtke a reporter for sports illustrated could go into 
the new york yankees clubhouse barring her violated her 
constitutional right to equal protection under the law judge 
constance baker motley ruled 
in 1985 commissioner pete rozelle ordered all nfl teams to 
treat reporters equally in interview areas regardless of sex some 
teams like the dallas cowboys set up rooms where players could be 
interviewed others handed out bathrobes or towels to players 
major league baseball provided equal access that year too 
basketball and hockey already had set open policies the national 
basketball association schools rookies on how to deal with the 
media male and female 
but the going has hardly been easy for women in the world of 
jocks where clubhouses smell of sweat and salve and soiled 
athletic supporters but where reporters have to go for interviews 
in 1986 susan fornoff of the sacramento calif bee received a 
live rat wrapped in a shoe box from dave kingman of the oakland 
athletics joan ryan of the orlando fla sentinel once told of a 
player from a defunct football league who ran a razor up her leg as 
she conducted an interview 
earlier this year intern jennifer frey of the detroit free 
press was told by detroit tigers pitcher jack morris i dont 
talk to people when im naked especially women unless theyre on 
top of me or im on top of them 
when the newspaper complained tigers president bo schembechler 
wrote back no female member of my family would be inside a mens 
locker room regardless of their job description 
now former watergate investigator philip heymann has been named 
to look into charges that new england patriots players exposed 
themselves and made suggestive remarks to olson on sept 17 the 
herald reporter called it nothing less than mind rape 
tight end zeke mowatt was fined 2000 and apologized but 
denied making lewd gestures or comments he said the only thing he 
told her was you are not writing you are looking 
patriots owner victor kiam at first called the locker room 
incident a flyspeck in the ocean then told the paper it was 
asking for trouble by sending a female reporter into a football 
dressing room he was also quoted as calling her a classic 
bitch 
after the national organization for women called from a boycott 
of remington products inc which kiam owns he took out fullpage 
ads in the new york times the boston herald and the boston globe 
kiam apologized and said theres no excuse for what 
happened he also denied calling her a name 
she was booed at sundays game 
in seattle bengals coach sam wyche kept usa todays tom from 
the locker room because our guys dont want a woman to walk into 
a situation like that in the past wyche has closed the locker 
room to all reporters in violation of nfl policy and was fined last 
year 
commissioner paul tagliabue said wyche faces another fine for 
not letting a woman into the locker room 
if he wants to make a stand on the issue he can make a stand 
on the issue he will be fined very heavily for it if he wants to 
quit he can quit because he has been warned twice already 
tagliabue said 
tuesdays edition of usa today contained a column by 
sportswriter rachel shuster aimed at nfl brass she concluded 
weve earned our place in the locker room now just give us some 
respect and well do our jobs and let you do yours

as germany ended 45 years of division the 
soviet military chief of staff said the end of the cold war opens 
the road to cooperation between the armed forces of the united 
states and the soviet union 
gen mikhail moiseyev embraced and toasted his american 
counterpart gen colin powell at a dinner reception in new york 
on tuesday on the second day of his first visit to the united 
states 
we have buried the cold war and i dont think that general 
powell or i are going to try to dig it back up moiseyev 51 
told an audience of about 120 us and soviet military officers and 
new york politicians and businessmen 
there are not only wide prospects for friendship between our 
people and the american people but also wide prospects for 
cooperation between our armed forces moiseyev said 
earlier moiseyev commented on the possible use of force against 
iraq by multinational troops stationed in saudi arabia 
he said the economic sanctions against iraq were working and 
that no force should be used in the persian gulf unless it was 
approved by the united nations according to a report in 
wednesdays editions of the new york times 
saddam hussein is finding himself in economic and political 
isolation and he cant survive very long that way moiseyev told 
the newspaper 
but powell who joined moiseyev in the times interview said 
president bush has not ruled out any options in the current crisis 
moiseyev his countrys first deputy minister of defense and 
chief of the general staff is the highestranking soviet military 
officer to visit the united states since soviet marshall sergei 
akhromeyev met with thensecretary of defense frank carlucci in 
december 1987 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff accompanied 
moiseyev from washington where the soviet general arrived monday 
for his sixday visit 
the alliance of our countries lives again in our time under 
the leadership of bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
powell told the audience 
he referred to himself and the soviet general a former 
railroad worker as old soldier powell and old soldier 
moiseyev 
earlier tuesday moiseyev visited fort drum in upstate new york 
and observed the 10th mountain division training drill a battle 
exercise once intended to prepare american soldiers for a military 
encounter with a soviet foe 
the soviet military leader said he had a typical soldiers 
lunch meal and everything was fantastic 
the very soul of what it is to meet the american military was 
what we have accomplished moiseyev said adding that hes a 
little jealous of general powell because hes a man who pays so 
much attention and does so much for the us armed forces 
from new york moiseyev is to travel to other military 
installations in michigan south dakota california and colorado 
in washington moiseyev visited the pentagon and the vietnam 
veterans memorial received a 19gun salute and met with president 
bush 
in our hearts weve felt much more than we have seen in 
meeting the average american citizen we felt care attention 
affection the soviet general said

erich honecker the ousted and reviled 
leader of the vanished east germany spent reunification night 
behind the walls of the soviet military hospital where he is 
confined 
like the other 166 million citizens of the now extinct state he 
ruled for 18 years the excommunist party chief became a citizen 
of united democratic germany at the stroke of midnight tuesday 
residents of beelitz 20 miles south of berlin had decorated 
buildings with german flags for the occassion and mass was 
celebrated in the town church 
the 77yearold honecker who withdrew in seclusion and disgrace 
after he was ousted a year ago amid massive prodemocracy protests 
can sometimes be seen strolling through the pine and birch forest 
on the hospital grounds 
you can see him at night walking around quietly its a very 
restful place said a soviet civilian taking a walk along the 
road next to the hospital the soviet did not give his name and 
said he was receiving treatment for an eye ailment at the facility 
the hospital and oldfashioned brick villas on the grounds are 
surrounded by a thick white wall 
honecker directed the building of the 1961 berlin wall that kept 
east germans trapped in the communist state for 28 years 
most of them detested honecker 
asked once what he liked most about unity wolf biermann the 
former east german dissident expelled to west germany in the 1970s 
replied that honecker became a citizen of united germany and 
cant do anything about it 
honecker was accused of corruption and expelled from the 
communist party in december but was spared the indignity of 
imprisonment when doctors determined that he suffered from a kidney 
tumor and was too ill to survive jail life 
he was transferred to the soviet military hospital earlier this 
year soviet officers at the gate declined to allow a western 
reporter on the grounds 
unity is the business of the germans we wont interfere 
said one he said the base had no plans to celebrate unification 
the 360000 soviet troops in what was east germany are scheduled 
to return home by 1994 
honecker could face trial and imprisonment in the united 
germany where he is under criminal investigation for allegedly 
giving shoottokill orders to border guards and harboring leftist 
terrorists wanted in west germany

the bumper crop of farmers markets blooming all over the country 
is forging ties between city dwellers and the source of their food 
and providing growers with a way to hang onto their farms 
farmers markets in parks and school yards along downtown 
malls or in church lots in hundreds of communities are great 
equalizers sophisticated chefs shop alongside poor working 
mothers both in search of inexpensive fresh food and perhaps a 
conversation with the farmer who harvested it the day before 
its much more than a simple economic relationship said 
elizabeth ryan who with her husband farms 35 acres of apples and 
other food in staatsburg in new yorks hudson river valley 
it makes you take what you do very seriously you see the 
people who buy your food you see the people who put it in bottles 
and feed it to their baby said ryan who does 90 percent of her 
sales through new york citys greenmarket which has 17 sites and 
an estimated 40000 shoppers a week 
there are nearly 2000 farmers markets nationwide compared with 
1200 in 1980 according to public markets collaborative which 
works to establish and preserve markets 
massachusetts had six markets in the mid1970s it has 85 this 
year california had just one market 15 years ago today there are 
140 greenmarket farmers took in at least 9 million last year 
said barry benepe a planning consultant who founded greenmarket in 
1976 
american demographics magazine estimates consumers will spend 1 
billion to 2 billion for fresh food directly from 200000 farmers 
this year but that includes roadside stands and other outlets as 
well as farmers markets 
places like the 200yearold french market in new orleans and 
pike place market in seattle for example combine farmers markets 
and permanent shops 
farmers markets are urban or suburban sites where growers bring 
fresh food and sell directly to consumers they are supported by 
local or state governments or by nonprofit organizations and are 
set up for many reasons to support family farms revitalize 
downtowns provide fresh inexpensive food to urban residents 
when lynn bagley started four markets in northern california 
she said she was primarily interested in nutrition but you 
quickly find out that what youre really doing is supporting the 
small farmer and in the long run helping maintain a regional food 
belt 
in a study robert sommer director of the center for consumer 
research at the university of californiadavis found that people 
shop at farmers markets for highquality food lower prices and 
atmosphere in that order 
in the old days people went to the dump now they go to the 
farmers market its become a big social event said august 
schumacher outgoing commissioner of food and agriculture in 
massachusetts 
market shoping is really a form of entertainment you 
dont go to an openair farmers market because its convenient 
said hilary baum of public markets collaborative 
all year every wednesday friday and saturday dozens of 
growers do business in manhattan at union square park once a 
haven for drug dealers and provide more than ample atmosphere 
amid fragrant waisthigh stalks of basil chef demonstrations 
tours and tastings 
one recent day shoppers could choose white eggplant cider 
peaches apples okra sour cherries squash blossoms raspberries 
eggs chickens bursting sunflowers and apple and blueberry pies 
a woman at a fish stand hands out cards with a number to call a 
day ahead to find out what kinds of fish will be spread out on ice 
the next morning the blews who farm in pittstown nj offered 
13 kinds of peppers 
new york citys markets range from the sprawling union square 
market where benepe said growers can make up to 10000 a day 
to one on the lower east side six farmers once a week farmers pay 
less than 5 percent of gross for their stalls he said 
growers first came to greenmarket with great skepticism 
benepe said they feared theyd come with full loads and go home 
with empty pockets ripoff city 
they found otherwise 
merrie kernan gets up at 230 am three days a week to drive a 
truckload of produce 125 miles from bridgton nj she likes 
talking with new yorkers even those who ask when banana season 
starts or will she have oranges or artichokes soon 
then there are the kids she brings lightning bugs for and the 
customer who just bought a small farm and told kernan she was going 
to pay someone to cut the hay i told her you dont pay 
somebody they pay you 
running a farm is very grueling and very demanding there are 
times you feel discouraged ryan said and the thing that 
really makes it worth it honestly its such a shot in the arm to 
get in that truck and go to market on saturday and know that its 
all worthwhile 
and for consumers studies show prices are 5 percent to 30 
percent lower at farmers markets where there are no middlemen 
and low transportation costs there is more than good shopping at 
work however 
without the markets many family farms too small to comply 
with demands for volume and uniformity of whole distributors 
would be forced to sell out a greenmarket survey found that 70 
percent of its farmers said the market was either essential or 
important to their economic wellbeing benepe said 
in connecticut the nonprofit hartford food system found that 
farmers could not afford to run fullscale markets in the poorest 
neighborhoods so it linked up with neighborhood organizations 
bought food from farmers and opened farmstands said mark winne 
the organizations executive director 
connecticut also is one of 10 states in the federal farmers 
market coupon program last year an estimated 275000 poor women 
and children were issued coupons worth 25 million many farmers 
also accept food stamps 
in massachusetts government made a difference schumacher said 
the mayors of many cities wanted to link consumers to local 
growers they gave us wonderful spots many in front of city halls 
boston brockton springfield 
the markets in turn can help a city 
a twiceweekly market saved downtown pasco wash said linda 
sue williams of the pasco downtown development association seventy 
farmers drive to a lot where the city has in the last five years 
built 48 shelters for growers and their food three thousand to 
5000 people shop there a week she said 
its been credited by many many people with sving the 
downtown williams said its the best thing thats happened to 
pasco in a long long time 
but a saturday market in columbus ohio across from a 
convention center under construction may be threatened by related 
commercial development 
there is support but our future is still a little unknown 
said nancy duncan porter executive director of the north market 
development authority which formed to save the market from 
becoming a parking lot just three years ago 
some people just like to tear down and build more than they 
like to preserve she said the market is a very people 
activity and social in nature and we think a great drawing card 
for downtown

republicans have won the iowa governors 
race in every election since 1968 but democrat don avenson is 
within striking range and thinks he can beat gov terry branstad to 
break the streak 
our time is coming says avenson the state house speaker 
we have a chance 
recent polls vary showing branstad with a lead ranging from a 
statistically insignificant three points to as much as 13 points 
avensons campaign is pursuing the following strategy 
raise onethird of the more than 3 million branstad will 
spend 
play off of iowas recent economic problems even though the 
state appears to have come through the worst 
reap some voter support from avensons prochoice position on 
abortion even though hes not counting on the issue to dominate 
the campaign and provide his margin of victory its not a silver 
bullet he says 
avenson hopes to chip away at the lead of a governor who is a 
tireless campaigner and who has never lost an election 
the last election i beat the majority leader and this time im 
going to beat the speaker of the house says the 43yearold 
branstad who also has been a state representative and lieutenant 
governor 
this governors been at it six days a week 14 or 16 hours a 
day for eight years says branstad i oftentimes have said 
the harder i work the luckier i get you kind of make your own 
luck 
while democrats have a lead of about 100000 in voter 
registration among the states 15 million registered voters 
branstad discounts that he argues there were more democrats than 
republicans when he won in 1982 and again in 1986 
branstad has called for restoring the death sentence a move 
polls show has broad support 
he feels the sentiments are changing among iowans and among 
legislators and this year the legislature may accept a limited 
death penalty said branstad spokesman richard vohs 
i think the governor is nervous i think hes saying this 
because hes politically nervous says avenson a veteran 
politician of 18 years in the state legislature eight as speaker 
in an era when many polls show voters leery of government 
avenson who is 46 takes an activist role 
we dont need more government we need more of the government 
we have he said i think we need to let government go unleash 
it and let it do its job we need to find ways to make government 
work again 
in the last 10 years weve grown older smaller and poorer 
he says if he were a football coach they would have fired him a 
long time ago for that kind of a record 
that approach may not be effective with the states economy 
stronger than during the depths of a farmbased recession 
throughout the 1980s 
our goal in the 90s is to continue the economic comeback that 
we began in the past few years says branstad 
avenson admits he has big hurdles to overcome and points to the 
growing branstad presence on television 
they are going to inundate this state said avenson he 
just doubled that i cannot double my effort i dont have the 
money 
another wild card in the election is abortion rights supported 
by avenson and opposed by branstad 
with polls showing that twothirds of iowans consider themselves 
prochoice avenson hoped that would translate into votes he 
conceded that his private polling shows prochoice voters still 
split between the two candidates and not familiar with their 
positions 
while branstad takes an antiabortion position he hasnt asked 
the legislature to impose restrictions and he picked a prochoice 
woman state sen joy corning as his running mate 
i dont want to tear this state apart over an emotional 
issue branstad argues 
you see the antichoice vote all of them support terry 
branstad said avenson but the prochoice vote hasnt come all 
the way over because i havent made it clear 
we will cause that movement to take place because we will make 
it very clear said avenson 
other activists argue the issue will help prochoice candidates 
but only around the fringes 
iowa democratic chairman john roehrick said movement will come 
as independent voters focus in the final weeks 
weve still got five weeks to go until the election said 
roehrick i dont think it will be the only issue i think it 
means two to four points

president bush wants to keep us aid flowing 
to pakistan even though there is evidence the country is violating 
rules against nuclear weapons proliferation administration and 
congressional sources say 
senior state department officials are working on capitol hill to 
lift the legal requirement that bars pakistan the third largest 
recipient of us aid from getting any money if it presses ahead 
with nuclear bomb development 
us aid to pakistan technically came to a halt monday the 
beginning of the 1991 fiscal year because bush had not issued the 
required annual certification that pakistan does not possess a 
nuclear bomb and that continued us aid will reduce the prospect 
for development of atomic weapons 
pakistan has scheduled national elections for oct 24 to replace 
the government of former prime minister benazir bhutto who was 
removed from office two months ago amid charges of corruption 
the administration wants to give the new government that emerges 
after those elections time to curb or roll back the countrys 
nuclear weapons program before making a decision on cutting off 
aid said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
senior administration officials including undersecretary of 
state reginald bartholomew and deputy assistant secretary teresita 
schaffer went to capitol hill last week to ask for a waiver the 
idea was received coolly among key house officials including rep 
david obey dwis chairman of the foreign aid appropriations 
subcommittee and rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the 
subcommittee on asia 
the administration which typically finds a warmer welcome in 
the senate is hoping it can pursue the waiver there either as an 
amendment to the foreign aid bill that comes up for committee 
consideration today or on another bill before congress adjourns 
later this month 
leonard spector a weapons proliferation analyst at the carnegie 
endowment for international peace said policymakers appear afraid 
to assert us values adopting a waiver he said would mean we 
are in effect announcing to the world that pakistan has nuclear 
weapons and we just dont care 
but an administration official said it is prudent to withhold 
judgment on the certification until after we get beyond this 
point of flux and set up a dialogue with the new government 
while the white house would like to see a yearlong waiver it will 
settle for six months the official said 
nobodys jumping up and down about it but they are 
sympathetic and they understand the seriousness of the issue the 
official added 
pakistan has provided the base for covert us aid to afghan 
rebels in the 1980s and also has promised troops to help defend 
saudi arabia from iraq 
bhutto who was warmly received when she promised her country 
would not develop a nuclear bomb during a 1989 speech to congress 
was removed from power on aug 6 while she is among those vying 
for control in the new elections analysts say she is unlikely to 
regain power 
uspakistani relations have benn shaky since bhuttos ouster 
a minister in the caretaker cabinet urged that us ambassador 
robert oakley be recalled for questioning the impartiality of 
tribunals looking into government corruption and pakistan lodged 
an official protest of his remarks 
sources on capitol hill and others with access to top pakistani 
officials said there are fears that pakistan has produced enriched 
uranium in a form that could be the basis for a bomb stepping over 
the line that both sides understood would trigger an aid cutoff 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher said only 
that the question of whether to issue the presidential 
certification is still under review and that aid cannot be 
provided until a certification is issued 
pakistan received nearly 580 million in us military and 
economic aid in fiscal 1990 making it the third largest recipient 
of american largess after israel and egypt similar amounts have 
been requested for this year 
the administration has quietly told pakistans interim 
government that it must roll back the nuclear steps taken this 
year said one source those moves have the effect of reducing the 
time it would take pakistan to field nuclear weapons from a matter 
of months to a matter of weeks several sources said 
bombmaking requires enriching uranium hexafluoride a gas then 
solidifying it into a metal that is milled into a hollow sphere for 
use as a bomb core pakistan already has taken some of those steps 
the sources said

kuwaiti families gather each day in hotel 
lobbies on this small island nation the adults are depressed and 
uncertain about their homelands future their children troubled by 
nightmares 
we pass our time day after day reading newspapers meeting 
other kuwaitis thinking and praying said a kuwaiti lawyer who 
brought his mother and sisters to bahrain 
we are depressed and idle we are emotionally very tired 
but a 10yearold kuwaiti boy said he knew what to do wait 
until his 12th birthday then join the underground resistance and 
die killing iraqi soldiers 
the boys aunt said all he does is talk about killing iraqis 
and dying himself 
a 10yearold girl with dark circles under her eyes has suffered 
frequent nightmares since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
i dont know how to comfort her said her mother we keep 
telling her she is in bahrain not kuwait but she is still 
frightened 
the two children are among the thousands of kuwaitis who fled to 
bahrain about 180 miles south in the persian gulf 
the kuwaitis in bahrain once enjoying one of the worlds 
highest standards of living now must depend on their savings 
outside kuwait as well as help from friendly arab governments 
the kuwaitis interviewed spoke on condition their full names not 
be used seeking to avoid possible reprisals by iraqi forces 
against family members remaining in kuwait 
we threw away our passports and id cards we were told there 
would be strict inspections on the way out said one woman 
sitting in a hotel lobby the kuwaitis are placed by their embassy 
at hotels in manama until their identities can be verified until 
then they cannot collect full benefits from their 
governmentinexile or put their children in school 
instead of school the children gather in the lobbies with their 
mothers and spend most of the time drawing or playing their games 
almost always involve shooting and fighting 
their attitudes have changed a kuwaiti woman said of the 
children they draw soldiers tanks and blood they have lost 
the carefree spirit they once had 
we are trying to raise the morale of everyone and we have 
social workers going from hotel to hotel trying to pinpoint those 
suffering from severe psychological problems said a social 
worker at the kuwaiti embassy in bahrain but sometimes their 
dignity will not let them come forward to ask people for help 
in a radio broadcast heard in bahrain the exiled crown prince 
of kuwait sheik saad alabdullah alsabah on monday hailed the 
refugees for heroic steadfastness in the face of the despot of 
baghdad a reference to iraqi president saddam hussein 
do not despair of the crimes of the brutal aggressor for he 
will not be able to destroy your will nor weaken your resolve and 
resistance said sheik saad his exiled government is now based 
in neighboring saudi arabia 
history has not seen such world unanimity in support of a 
cause as that given to the just one of kuwait to tightening the 
noose around the iraqi occupation until its forces pull out by 
peace or war the sheik said 
abdullah chairman of the information committee at the kuwaiti 
embassy in bahrain said he sometimes chats with friends and 
momentarily forgets the troubles 
but when we go to our beds and put our heads on the pillow 
and think about whats happening we almost go crazy from the pain 
how are we coping psychologically through hope the hope that 
we will return to our country soon

the man destined to become the 
oldest person to fly in space is not getting any younger as he 
waits and waits and waits for nasa to fix and launch the 
shuttle columbia 
but the onagain offagain launch doesnt have 59yearold 
vance brand worrying whether if hes past it 
only if you let problems really get you down do you feel 
older brand commander of columbias astronomy mission said 
monday 
were just all having to be very patient he said time is 
passing but i dont think its hurting any of us just the sake of 
the shuttle program id just like to get going 
brands mission has been on hold since late may when columbias 
hydrogen leaks first were detected nasa tried three more times to 
launch the shuttle before stopping two weeks ago to make way for 
discoverys highpriority flight 
discovery lifts off saturday with five astronauts and a 
satellite that will be sent on a fiveyear journey to study the 
suns poles it will be the first shuttle flight since discovery 
carried the flawed hubble space telescope into orbit in april 
ill be a little jealous watching discovery go up brand 
said in a telephone interview from johnson space center in houston 
but well get there 
brand an astronaut since 1966 made his first space flight in 
1975 on the apollosoyuz mission in which the crews of the 
american and soviet spacecraft docked in space he has flown in 
space two other times 
brand said he isnt any more nervous about flying on a shuttle 
than he was before hydrogen leaks struck columbia and then 
atlantis 
crew member mike lounge while frustrated also takes it in 
stride 
you just go home and mow your lawn and pay your bills and take 
a little leave were still getting paid lounge 44 said we 
dont get a lot of sympathy about what an awful job we have here 
brand figured he and his six crewmates have broken at least one 
record while waiting to fly the most time spent in quarantine for 
a mission the seven men have been confined to crew quarters for a 
week before each launch attempt adding up to about a month 
weve had the supreme test and we all get along great 
brand said 
id like to be an astronaut until im 80 brand said but 
i think when i finish this flight there will just be a switch that 
flips in my head that says ok youre going after your second 
career and its going to have its own challenges and interesting 
things so lets get with that 
brand plans to move into management at johnson space center

a century after a crooked louisiana 
lottery bilked an entire nation voters in this state will decide 
whether to give a new one a chance 
louisiana voters will consider a constitutional amendment 
saturday ending the states ban on lotteries louisiana stands to 
become the 33rd state to enact a lottery to help finance state 
government 
the legislature already has passed a bill establishing a 
quasipublic corporation answerable to lawmakers and the governor 
to operate the games 
despite opposition from gov buddy roemer the horse racing 
industry and others who question its economic value recent polls 
favor passage 
its a good alternative to the sales tax said state rep 
raymond lalonde who sponsored the measure in the house the 
lottery will bring as much as a penny in sales tax on milk and 
bread 
opponents led by the coalition against legalizing a lottery 
argue a lottery would drain money from the states weak economy and 
take advantage of the poor 
its a senseless leech on our economy its a pernicious 
cancer on the pocketbooks of the poor said ed steimel a 
coalition spokesman 
but proponents are so confident of passage that an organization 
to push for a lottery was formed only in the past few weeks after 
an antigambling group began a grassroots campaign 
meanwhile voters in neighboring arkansas will consider adopting 
a lottery on nov 6 to boost education funding 
opponents including church leaders who denounce it on moral 
grounds hope to get the state supreme court to rule it off the 
ballot a poll commissioned by the arkansas democrat and reported 
last week found that 52 percent favor the lottery 36 percent 
oppose it and 12 percent are undecided 
since louisianas economy declined along with oil prices in the 
1980s the legislature has routinely renewed a sales tax on food 
and utilities to balance the states books such items were 
traditionally exempt from the sales tax 
lotteries have been banned by the louisiana constitution since a 
scandalplagued private lottery operated in the state during the 
late 1800s tickets for that operation were sold all over the 
united states and the people who had been duped complained to 
washington 
in 1890 president benjamin harrison addressed a special message 
to congress asking for relief because the people of all the 
states are debauched and defrauded by the louisiana lottery 
congress responded with legislation that blocked the use of the 
mail for selling lottery tickets since the lottery sold as much as 
93 percent of its tickets outside louisiana the enterprise 
collapsed that postal prohibition still applies today 
because of the debacle there has been deeprooted opposition to 
a lottery in louisiana for years but favorable sentiment has been 
growing 
estimates of state revenue for the first full year range from 
59 million to 111 million according to the public affairs 
research council a research and government watchdog group 
but steimel said that for the state to net 110 million annually 
from a lottery at least 300 million would have to be wagered 
money that otherwise would go into the private economy 
we have an economy that is in real deep trouble he said 
instead of a transfusion were getting a blood sucker

two months after iraqi president saddam 
hussein forced a gasoline price increase of about 25 cents a 
gallon the us government is moving to tack on another 12 cents 
a gradual 10cent increase in the 9centagallon tax and a new 
2cent levy on refined petroleum productions including gasoline 
is one of the biggest items in a 500 billion fiveyear plan for 
reducing the budget deficit the energy taxes would raise almost 
57 billion 
the energy information administration said monday the price of 
selfservice regular unleaded gasoline averaged 1311 a gallon on 
sept 27 compared with 1075 july 31 two days before iraqs 
invasion of kuwait disrupted oil markets 
the budget proposal backed by president bush and leaders of 
both parties relies heavily on excise taxes and makes few changes 
in income taxes 
as a result analysts say the impact is likely to be felt most 
by poorer younger and rural families who spend a larger portion 
of their disposable income on gasoline tobacco and alcoholic 
beverages 
other parts of the plan target fliers state and local 
government employees workers whose wages exceed 51300 taxpayers 
with incomes over 100000 and anyone with a taste for expensive 
cars furs and jewels 
the proposal also would mean more internal revenue service 
audits in an effort to corral more tax cheats and raise 94 
billion 
earlier this year the congressional budget office found that 
americans spend 27 percent of aftertax income on gasoline 11 
percent on tobacco and 2 percent for liquor wine and beer 
the poorest 20 percent with aftertax income averaging 8200 
spent 69 percent for gasoline 4 percent on tobacco and 37 
percent for alcohol the 20 percent just below the richest with 
income averaging 38000 after taxes spent 29 percent for 
gasoline 11 percent for tobacco and 22 percent for alcohol 
here are some major parts of the tax plan which congressional 
leaders hope will become law this month 
energy the federal gasoline tax of 9 cents a gallon would rise 
by 5 cents dec 1 and another 5 cents next july 1 on jan 1 a 
2centagallon tax on most refined petroleum products including 
gasoline and home heating oil would take effect almost 94 percent 
of families buy gasoline 
tobacco the 16centapack tax on cigarettes would rise 4 cents 
on jan 1 and another 4 cents two years later taxes on cigars 
chewing tobacco and snuff would be increased at each step by 25 
percent about 46 percent of americans use tobacco 
alcohol about 71 percent of taxpayers would be affected the 
tax on hard liquor now 1250 for a gallon of 100 proof 50 
percent alcohol would rise to 14 up 30 cents for a fifth 
lowerproof liquor would go up by the same ratio the tax on beer 
now 16 cents for a sixpack would double most wines also would 
face higher taxes the 3cent tax on a fifth of table wine would 
rise to 25 cents 
airline tickets more than 12 million passengers fly each day 
the 8 percent tax would rise to 10 percent on the average 
roundtrip ticket costing about 300 the tax would go up about 
6 
luxuries a 10 percent luxury tax would apply to the portion of 
the sales price of certain commodities above certain thresholds 
for cars the threshold would be 30000 for private boats 
100000 for jewelry and furs 5000 the buyer of a 35000 car 
would pay a tax of 500 10 percent of 5000 
itemized deductions a couple or individual with adjusted gross 
income above 100000 could continue to deduct all allowable 
medical expenses and investment interest expense but they would 
have to reduce other deductions by 3 for each 100 that their 
income exceeds 100000 a person with 120000 income and 20000 
in allowable deductions for example could deduct 97 percent or 
19400 about 25 million people would be affected 
medicare wages about 8 million workers earning more than 
51300 would pay more tax for medicare coverage the tax withheld 
from paychecks as part of the social security levy is 145 percent 
of the first 51300 earned each year that wage limit would be 
raised to 73000 meaning a 315ayear tax increase employers 
match employees taxes 
about 2 million employees of state and local government hired 
before april 1 1986 who do not now pay for medicare would be 
required to pay the 145 percent tax for the first time 
social security about 4 million state and local workers not 
covered by a public retirement plan would have to start paying the 
62 percent social security tax on their first 51300 of wages 
the employer would pay an equal amount 
education the guaranteed student loan program would be trimmed 
by 2 billion negotiators suggested eliminating all schools with 
default rates above 30 percent which officials acknowledge would 
include many trade and vocational schools as well as historically 
black colleges 
agriculture agriculture programs would be cut by 13 billion 
which is onefourth of the 54 billion being sought for the next 
five years 
post office the price of stamps would rise faster because the 
postal service would absorb about 5 billion in cuts over the next 
five years

the national endowment for the arts emerged 
unscathed from an assault by house critics but faces a floor battle 
later this week over attempts to impose new antiobscenity curbs 
by voice vote monday the house appropriations committee 
resoundingly defeated a proposal by rep tom delay rtexas to 
eliminate all funds for the federal arts agency until congress 
votes separately to extend the neas life 
rep sidney yates dill and other endowment supporters on the 
panel said a vote for delays amendment would be a vote to abolish 
the 25yearold agency delay is among the neas most vocal 
conservative opponents 
the committee voted to give the endowment a 5 percent spending 
increase in the fiscal year that began monday from 171 million to 
180 million and it persuaded rep ralph regula rohio to 
withdraw a proposal to forbid the nea to finance any obscene or 
indecent works 
instead at the urging of yates and rep vic fazio dcalif 
the committee sidestepped the obscene art issue in favor of 
house action on a separate measure authorizing a fiveyear 
extension of the neas life 
floor debate on that measure was tentatively scheduled to begin 
wednesday or thursday the endowments statutory authority expired 
sunday night 
rep pat williams dmont a staunch nea supporter and rep e 
thomas coleman rmo a conservative who is seeking restrictions 
on the kinds of art eligible for endowment support circulated the 
outlines of a proposed compromise among their house colleagues 
monday 
their proposal reportedly would embrace a bipartisan senate 
measure that would require the nea to recoup money from any grant 
recipient who is convicted in court of using federal funds to 
violate obscenity laws 
fazio said the compromise also would call for increasing to 275 
percent the share of nea grant money allocated to state arts 
agencies 
the current state share is 20 percent coleman originally had 
sought to shift 60 percent of nea funds to state control 
for the time being the arts endowment is operating under a 
temporary extension of last years 171 million spending level 
until congress approves appropriations bills for the nea and other 
federal agencies for fiscal 1991 which began monday 
that means the endowment is still working under an obscenity ban 
that congress imposed last fall at the request of sen jesse helms 
rnc and other conservative lawmakers they were angered by nea 
support for exhibitions of works by photographer robert 
mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano which they denounced as 
obscene and blasphemous 
the proposed 180 million budget for the nea was included in a 
145 billion appropriations bill that the house committee approved 
by voice vote monday and sent to the floor the measure also 
includes money for the interior and energy departments the forest 
service the smithsonian institution and the national endowment for 
the humanities

senior citizens say the proposed deficit 
reduction package that would increase medicare premiums and 
deductibles requires them to shoulder more than their fair share of 
budget cuts 
the budget summiteers have declared budget war on the 
elderly said ron pollack executive director of families usa 
which represents the elderly 
those that wage this war shouldnt expect older americans to 
be pacifists on election day he said 
of the 119 billion in domestic programs that would be saved 
over the next five years under the budget compromise 60 billion 
would come from medicare 
half of the savings in the health care program would be achieved 
by requiring its beneficiaries 33 million elderly and disabled 
americans to pay more out of their own pockets for medical 
services 
their 2860 monthly premium for doctors care would rise to 
3430 next year their 75 deductible on doctors bills would 
double by 1995 and a 20 percent copayment for laboratory costs 
would be restored 
the rest of the savings about 30 billion would come from 
cutting growth in reimbursement rates for hospitals and physicians 
were very disappointed that seniors have beensingled out for 
this unfair tax treatment said martha a mcsteen president of 
the national committee to preserve social security 
the american association of retired persons was concerned about 
the size of the medicare cuts as well as protections for the poor 
its clearly going to take a very big hit said judy schub 
a legislative representative for aarp 
instead the government should resort to the progressive 
income tax said arthur flemming a republican and head of the 
save our security coalition of elderly lobbying groups change it 
so it puts a heavier burden on the wealthy 
president bush asked about senior citizens displeasure with 
the plan said monday well what are you going to do you cant 
keep everybody happy i learned that long ago youve got to do 
whats right thats what were trying to do 
house speaker thomas foley dwash defended the plan saying 
the medicare program has been the fastest rising cost of any 
federal entitlement program 
aarp and the other senior citizens groups were relieved that 
budget negotiators decided against cuts that would affect social 
security recipients they had considered proposals to delay cost of 
living adjustments and to tax a larger portion of social security 
benefits 
gail wilensky head of the health care financing administration 
which handles medicare said the compromise package protects the 
poorest elderly by continuing for them medicaid coverage of 
medicares outofpocket costs 
also she noted all medicare beneficiaries will be protected by 
a provision passed by congress last year limiting the amount 
physicians can charge beyond what medicare will pay that limit 
will be 25 percent on jan 1 and will drop to 15 percent by 1993 
additionally she said the higher costsharing for recipients 
is still far less than it was when the program began in 1965 then 
beneficiaries paid 50 percent of the cost of premiums for doctors 
care now it is 25 percent but would rise to 30 percent under the 
budget compromise 
i do believe you can say these are reasonable and justified 
changes wilensky said 
also as part of the package higher paid workers would see the 
145 percent tax that helps support the medicare program apply to a 
larger part of their income currently the tax is applied only to 
the first 51300 of income but under the agreement it would be 
applied to the first 73000 
wilensky said this would help extend the solvency of the 
medicare trust fund which could go bankrupt in the early part of 
the next century if changes are not made

the senate is calling a halt to military 
construction projects overseas until president bush draws up a plan 
for basing a smaller military force 
by voice vote on monday the senate approved an 8 billion 
spending bill for fiscal 1991 that eliminates most of the projects 
bush proposed for europe and deletes all construction in south 
korea and japan 
it would be premature to proceed with construction at 
specified locations until the defense department has finalized 
overseas base closure plans the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on military construction said in its report on the 
bill 
the bill trims 11 billion from bushs budget request for the 
fiscal year that began monday it is about 400 million below the 
amount approved by the house conferees from the two chambers will 
meet later this month to craft a compromise measure 
the senate bill cuts 151 million from bushs budget of 153 
million for west germany 43 million from the request of 44 
million for italy and 46 million from the budget of 47 million 
for britain 
the bill eliminated all 83 million the administration sought 
for south korean projects and all 18 million for japan 
the defense department should seek hostnation funding for all 
construction requirements in those countries the subcommittee 
report said 
certain to draw the ire of the bush administration is a 
provision of the bill that prevents the use of us dollars from 
the nato infrastructure fund and the air force for construction of 
new air base in crotone italy to house the 401st tactical wing of 
f16 jet fighters 
the united states and its allies agreed to build the new 
facility in italy after spain refused to allow the fighter wing to 
remain at the us base in torrejon de ardoz spain 
the committee report said financing for a new 800 million 
foreign air base is simply not available when dozens of domestic 
bases are being closed 
domestically missouri and washington state were hit hard as the 
senate targeted construction projects associated with the b2 
stealth bomber and the plan to place mx nuclear missiles on 
railroad cars 
in missouri the bill cut 41 million from the administrations 
budget request including 9 million for b2 maintenance docks 
washington lost 93 million in construction projects including 73 
million for rail garrison facilities 
the senate was kinder in the home states of several of the 
subcommittees members 
in utah home of republican sen jake garn construction 
projects increased 40 million funds for georgia home state of 
democratic sen wyche fowler increased 30 million including 10 
million for a soldier service center at fort gordon 
in alaska home of republican sen ted stevens the bill adds 
13 million over the administrations request in hawaii home of 
democratic sen daniel inouye the bill added 2 million the same 
amount went to nevada home of democratic sen harry reid 
in iowa home of the subcommittees ranking republican sen 
charles grassley funds for military construction were 14 million 
over the administrations request 
but in tennessee home of the panels chairman democratic sen 
james sasser funds for projects dropped 43 million with all the 
money coming from a large rocket test facility at the arnold 
engineering development center 
in west virginia home of the chairman of the full senate 
appropriations committee sen robert byrd projects for the army

synchronized leasing a fancy name for moving 
hell 
not enough vans not enough crews not enough room on the 
streets for thousands of chicago apartment dwellers who pack up and 
head for new digs at the same time twice each year when their 
leases expire simultaneously 
monday oct 1 was one of those days may 1 is the other 
we started at 10 am and it is now 4 pm said jim 
marchesi who had to maneuver his rental truck around four others 
on his north side block sunday i have only had to move about 
five blocks and it feels like i have moved from five different 
countries 
socalled synchronized leasing has been around a long time 
but most cities abandoned the practice no one seems to know why it 
lingered in chicago but many people believe it may have something 
to do with the citys weather 
no one in their right mind wants to move in a chicago summer 
or a chicago winter said leasing agent tom lucido 
by may 1 its usually warm but not hot and the weather 
really does change significantly from september to october by oct 
1 its cool but not cold 
synchronized leasing lucido said is horrendous 
the typical nightmare is that you have a tenant whose lease 
expires sept 30 and they havent moved out yet when the new 
tenants supposed to move in oct 1 he said you end up with a 
tenant sitting out there in a moving van with no place to go 
commonwealth edison co and peoples gas co estimated that more 
than 50000 rental units were up for tenant changes on or about 
oct 1 a similar number of moves were made about may 1 
you cant get a truck you cant get a mover you cant get an 
elevator said joel kline youre moving into an apartment 
someones moving out of youre moving out of an apartment 
someones moving into its just terrible 
kline was among the lucky he got a fourday lease extension 
its been total chaos said dave beard assistant manager of 
a uhaul outlet we never seem to have enough equipment come may 
and october people get frustrated there are attitude problems 
chicago student movers which uses leased trucks and a temporary 
work force of college students to provide inexpensive moving for 
apartment dwellers averages 10 moves a day most monts it had 80 
sunday more were lined up for monday 
company owner guy wojciechowski said he brought in 155 
additional trucks and hired 100 extra men to handle the business 
truck and trailer rental companies recommend reservations at 
least several weeks in advance of the may 1 and oct 1 deadlines 
but many renters never seem to learn 
simply put if they reserved a truck weeks in advance theyre 
very happy people said charlotte adams who works for ryder 
truck rental if they just walk in hoping to get one theyre 
very unhappy people 
some accuse landlords and real estate agents of clinging to 
synchronized leasing to manipulate the availability and price of 
rental housing but lucido maintained it really doesnt benefit 
building owners and managers 
when the worst happens and the october renter cant move in 
you have to provide him with emergency housing rent free until 
you manage to get the old tenant out he said by law it takes 
21 days to get eviction proceedings going and the sheriffs 
department is always backed up three or four weeks this time of 
year so you can wind up losing several months rent

the deregulatory policies of the reagan 
administration helped contain the savings and loan crisis former 
treasury secretary donald t regan is telling skeptical 
congressional democrats 
i think the thrift industry would have gone into the tank 
sooner and may have never emerged regan told the house banking 
committee at the first in a series of hearings on the causes of the 
sampl mess 
regan who was treasury secretary from 1981 to 1985 said that 
after interest rates soared in the early 1980s it became clear that 
a financial business confined to taking deposits from savers and 
lending the money to home buyers could not survive 
he said he had favored giving thrifts the same investment powers 
as commercial banks but had opposed the broader deregulation in 
some states that had given thrifts nonbank powers 
the committee also heard on monday from richard t pratt who 
served as the nations top thrift regulator from 1981 to 1982 
pratt defended his decision to allow sampls to hide their losses with 
accounting techniques 
pratt said when he took office nearly every sampl in the country 
was technically insolvent because soaring interest rates had 
drastically cut the value of their lowinterest fixedrate 
mortgages 
regulators strategy was to close the worst institutions and to 
buy time for the others until interest rates fell as they did he 
said 
panel members pressed regan who was chairman of merrill lynch 
before becoming treasury secretary on his involvement with the 
development of socalled brokered deposits 
such highinterest deposits placed by wall street brokerage 
houses usually in amounts just under the 100000 deposit 
insurance limit are blamed for fueling the explosive growth in 
risky investments at many sampls 
regan however said he had disqualified himself from any policy 
matters affecting brokered deposits because of his connection to 
merrill lynch he said the firm did not deal in them extensively 
until after he left 
i want a blood test as far as being the father of brokered 
deposits i am not in no way shape or fashion he said 
rep joseph kennedy dmass countered that regan allowed his 
subordinate deputy treasury secretary rt mcnamar to forcefully 
advocate their use 
edwin gray the nations top thrift regulator from 1983 to 1987 
has accused regan of trying to force him from office when he tried 
to rein in the industry in general and brokered deposits in 
particular 
regan who previously had not had a chance to reply to gray in a 
public forum described him as an absentee lax regulator 
in 1985 when i became white house chief of staff i began 
to hear rumors that this man was not paying attention he was part 
of the problem not the solution he was sort of a front for 
the industry i didnt like that regan said 
he said that between september 1983 and june 1986 gray was in 
his office only 397 weekdays and absent 466 days he also noted 
that gray was forced to repay his agency the federal home loan 
bank board 26000 for travel and entertainment 
he want to pebble beach he went to greenbriar my crack was 
i think hes working more on his golf handicap than hes working 
on the thrifts regan said 
gray and former federal reserve board chairman paul volcker are 
scheduled to appear before the committee wednesday the committee 
chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas plans to hear from 
carter administration officials later 
in other sampl developments monday 
federal regulators said they had transferred most offices of 
the phoenixbased merabank to bank of america estimating the 
bailout of the thrift once arizonas largest at 1 billion 
bank of america arizona a subsidiary of the san franciscobased 
holding company is taking over merabanks 66 arizona branches the 
resolution trust corp said the agency will keep merabanks seven 
texas branches for later sale 
texas and california savings and loans dominate a list of the 
top 100 federal thrift investigations by the justice department 
national mortgage news a weekly trade newspaper reported 
there were 36 texas sampls on the list which has not been 
publicly released and 20 from california oklahoma and illinois 
and eight institutions listed florida had six colorado five and 
louisiana and new jersey four each

oil prices may be soaring and americas 
dependence on foreign petroleum may be all too clear but a key 
congressional panel says those arent reasons enough to open the 
nations coastal waters to oil drilling 
the house appropriations committee voted monday to extend for a 
year the widereaching prohibition on oil and gas leasing along 
thousands of miles of coastal waters from alaska to new england 
the moratorium on the leasing was included in the interior 
departments budget and goes even farther than the curbs on 
drilling announced by president bush last june 
this was the first real test to protecting the offshore areas 
since iraq invaded kuwait said lisa speer an attorney for the 
natural resources defense council a private environmental 
organization 
we had been nervous about this she said noting that the 
oil industry has been pressing the administration and congress to 
open new areas of the outer continental shelf for exploratory 
drilling in light of the persian gulf crisis 
industry groups greeted the action by the house panel with 
disappointment 
the outer continental shelf contains enough oil to replace our 
imports from the persian gulf for the next 25 years said robert 
stewart president of the national ocean industries association 
the group represents companies involved in offshore oil drilling 
the action was seen widely as an attempt to preempt any action 
by the administration to reverse itself on the decision last june 
when the president announced a postponement in some cases as long 
as 10 years of oil and gas leases off much of the west coast 
southern florida and new england 
this extension guarantees the protection of the california 
coastline to avoid any possible retreat by the president said 
rep leon panetta dcalif it provides the protection that we 
need 
white house officials have said bush has no intention of backing 
away from his june announcement despite lobbying from industry to 
ease some of the prohibitions 
some congressmen as well as environmentalists have been worried 
that the administration might change its mind amid the clamor over 
jumping oil prices the threat of possible shortages and pressures 
to ease americas reliance on foreign crude 
the appropriations committee voted to extend the moratorium on 
oil leases for one year in all the areas singled out for special 
protection by bush last june and went a step further it extended 
the ban on leases in alaskas bristol bay the eastern gulf of 
mexico off northern florida and along a 50mile buffer in the 
north atlantic from connecticut to northern virginia 
the measure must still be approved by the house and the senate 
but environmentalists called the vote a key victory for protecting 
the offshore areas from oil companies traditionally the house 
appropriations panel has taken the lead in pushing for moratoria on 
offshore leasing with the full house and senate likely to go 
along 
the oil industry has cited the persian gulf crisis as clear 
evidence that domestic oil production should be expanded including 
more offshore drilling along the outer continental shelf 
many observers in the past month have noted the irony in the 
fact that the us is risking the lives of american troops and 
spending billions to protect middle east oil while the domestic 
supply lies dormant in our own backyard said stewart the 
drilling industry spokesman

the senate ethics committee is summoning five 
senators to explain their assistance for charles h keating jr at 
a time his lincoln savings and loan was plummeting toward a massive 
collapse 
the senators will appear over the next two weeks the committee 
announced monday after which the panel will act on recommendations 
from its special counsel 
congressional sources said counsel robert s bennett has 
recommended that the investigation go forward for democratic sens 
alan cranston of california donald w riegle jr of michigan and 
dennis deconcini of arizona 
bennett also recommended that the investigations of sens john 
mccain rariz and john glenn dohio be dismissed the sources 
said 
continuation of any of the cases could mean triallike hearings 
would be scheduled probably next year 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said bennetts 
report establishes crucial links between the timing of 
contributions by keating to cranston riegle and deconcini and 
actions they took on keatings behalf 
the conclusion was there was no connection between the 
contributions and actions of glenn and mccain one source said 
the links were instrumental in bennetts recommendations said 
another source who added bennetts conclusions are not based on a 
single factor but o a pattern and practice of behavior by each 
senator 
glenn and mccain are scheduled to appear before the sixmember 
ethics panel this week sources said it was not known when the 
other senators will testify 
under our existing practices the committee must give each 
senator under investigation the opportunity to be heard by the 
committee in executive session before any decisions are made a 
committee statement said following these meetings with the 
senators the committee will meet to decide how it will proceed 
the five senators received a total of 13 million from keating 
and his associates for their campaigns and causes and intervened 
with us banking regulators on behalf of the former head of 
lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
the federal government seized keatings thrift in april 1989 it 
could cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to cover the losses from 
the collapse 
the senators have said they intervened with regulators 
especially in two key meetings in april 1987 because keating made 
a persuasive case that his sampl was being treated unfairly all have 
denied that their intervention was driven by the donations 
public documents and statements show some links between the 
contributions and contacts with regulators by riegle cranston and 
deconcini 
however bennett reportedly has much more precise connections 
involving the timing 
the public record shows that 
keating was the host of a fundraiser for riegle in detroit on 
march 23 1987 less than two weeks before four senators met with 
the nations chief thrift regulator april 2 1987 riegle said he 
received 78250 from keating and his associates at the 
fundraiser 
riegle didnt attend that april 2 meeting although he suggested 
it be held he was at an april 9 meeting between all five senators 
and regulators examining lincoln 
cranston solicited 850000 from keating for three voter 
registration projects the contributions began in june 1987 two 
months after the meetings with regulators and continued through 
february 1988 cranston also received 39000 from keating and his 
associates for his 1986 reelection campaign 
deconcini received 15000 in campaign donations from keating 
or his associates in 1986 before the meetings with regulators and 
an additional 5000 in october 1987 
in addition to the april 1987 meetings deconcini and cranston 
continued a series of contacts with regulators right up to the time 
the thrift was seized in april 1989 both said they intervened in 
an effort to get lincoln sold rather than seized by the 
government in order to save jobs 
the links between those contacts and contributions could not 
immediately be determined 
at the april 2 1987 meeting cranston mccain deconcini and 
glenn discussed lincoln with edwin j gray then chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board 
gray told the house banking committee last november that riegle 
suggested the meeting with senators riegle acknowledged that such 
a meeting was one of the issues he discussed with gray a month 
earlier but he denied actually arranging the session 
gray testified that the four senators at the april 2 meeting 
offered a deal on keatings behalf if regulators waived a rule 
prohibiting risky investments for lincoln the thrift would finance 
more home mortgages all four senators vigorously denied that a 
deal was offered 
on april 9 1987 all five senators meeting with the san 
franciscobased regulators who were examining lincoln were told 
that allegations against keatings thrift were so serious that 
criminal referrals were being made to the justice department

students barricaded inside a building at the 
university of the district of columbia say they may give some 
members of the schools board of trustees until march 31 to resign 
leaders of the protest which began wednesday had said the 
students wouldnt leave the building unless the 11 mayoral 
appointees to the 15member board submitted letters of resignation 
immediately however they softened that demand on monday 
that gives everybody six months to determine whether or not 
there are some members we want to reinstate or some we want to 
replace protest leader mark thompson said 
the protesters are demanding extensive changes in the way the 
12000student university is run and improvements in several 
athletic and academic programs they say the board has allowed the 
quality of the school to decline and put the accreditation of some 
of its departments in jeopardy 
the students and the board have reached agreement on nearly all 
of the students other demands but negotiations remain stalemated 
on the issue of resignations with most of the board refusing to 
quit 
it would not appear to be in the best interests of the 
university for them to quit udc spokesman john britton said 
weve made progress and honestly the dialogue has become a 
bit more candid and a bit more cordial but were still discussing 
and neither side has really bent any thompson said 
thompson said about 500 students remained in the building 
monday down from the 1000 he said participated in the 
demonstrations this weekend 
trustees have estimated the number of students involved from 150 
to 300 
thompson said protesters were successful in persuading most 
students to stay away from classes monday despite administrators 
having officially opened the university for the first time since 
demonstrations began 
as far as we are concerned school is still closed thompson 
said 
all buildings except an administration building occupied by the 
students were reopened but instructors were seen conducting 
classes with fewer than 10 students each 
two trustees have agreed to resign for personal reasons britton 
said but the protests had not forced the actions a third trustee 
has agreed to quit because of illness thompson said 
trustee nira long has agreed to step down as board chairwoman 
but has refused to leave the board

poles have poured into berlin by the tens of 
thousands packing buses jamming trains and sputtering along in 
tiny cars their goal one last mad shopping spree to get western 
goods before german unification 
poles could freely come to east germany and then pass unhindered 
into the consumer nirvana of west berlin but at midnight today 
east germany wont exist and poles and others will have to meet 
rigorous visa requirements 
others seeking a quick profit in berlins frantic days before 
unification were east european gypsies a few soviets germans and 
even an enterprising afghan 
the poles were especially noticeable on downtown streets monday 
there were poles pulling baggage carts loaded with stereos 
video equipment television sets and boom boxes 
rushing through berlins hectic streets the poles pushed their 
goods and loaded them into dozens and dozens of waiting buses 
parked along broad avenues 
berliners sat in outdoor cafes despite an uncomfortable wind and 
threatening dark clouds 
they seemed subdued compared with the euphoria of the days in 
november when the berlin wall was opened millions of east germans 
then poured across the border and west berlins streets were a 
circus of consumerism 
but the most cosmopolitan of german cities was still enjoying 
the show on monday throbbing with life as it prepared to become 
germanys capital the biggest city between paris and moscow 
at the brandenburg gate hundreds of tourists browsed through 
the bazaar that has mushroomed along the former death strip 
that separated east and west 
an afghan sold his nativecountry rugs east german soldiers 
fur aps sovietmade watches and islamic literature 
the symbols of an outdated ideology and its military might were 
being auctioned off at the onceforbidding cold war barrier 
a german was peddling east german flags soviet army belts and a 
large blue goldedged banner that said always ready for peace 
and socialism 
next to him two soviets were offering records of lenins 
thoughts excerpts from speeches by their late hardline leader 
leonid brezhnev and heroic martial songs performed by the red army 
choir 
at row after row of stands eastern european gypsies were doing 
brisk a business in soviet military belts spy glasses 
nightvision infrared binoculars pistol holsters east german 
army helmets and soviet and east german uniforms 
a soviet woman was unloading a bagfull of red lenin banners to a 
gypsy seller another group of soviets was selling lenin pins to a 
group of americans 
above the crowd television technicians used cranes to hoist 
floodlights in preparation for unification which comes at the 
stroke of midnight 
asian manufacturers of electronics will be celebrating german 
unification too their countries are receiving another boost to 
their bulging trade surpluses 
west berlin merchants were struggling to meet the demand on 
monday as poles scrambled to beat the imposition of visas that will 
come with unification 
to get visas poles will have to have 50 marks about 30 for 
every day they plan to spend in germany and will have to show they 
have medical insurance coverage for their stay 
across from the seedy zoo train station a truck was unloading 
tv sets impatient poles were crowding around the truck a worker 
wiped his sweaty brow and begged for space so that he could carry 
the packed sets into the store 
in front of the city radio store ropes were put up to form 
lines the stereos the tv sets the videos never got unpacked as 
scores of poles snapped them up 
polish cars took nearly all parking spaces around the station 
and in some of them weary shoppers took naps families took breaks 
sitting on boxes of newly bought stereo equipment 
others fanned across the city to search for their buses perhaps 
hundreds were parked along the broad avenues leading to the 
brandenburg gate even blocking the view to the bellevue palace 
the official residence of german presidents 
thousands went back to poland in train cars packed with people 
food and the latest in electronic gear 
one man pushed a supermarket cart on top of which a huge tv set 
too big to fit into the cart swayed precariously tied with a 
rope 
one woman took off her shoes and lay across several boxes 
containing stereos a large grocery bag served as her pillow

the harold washington party is filing a 20 
million federal lawsuit accusing cook county democratic party 
leaders of conspiring to keep the predominantly black third party 
off the nov 6 ballot 
r eugene pincham attorney for the washington party said the 
cook county democratic party and a number of its leaders were named 
as defendants as were five private citizens who challenged the 
washington partys nominating petitions 
pincham a former appellate judge running for the cook county 
board on the washington party ticket said the lawsuit contends the 
democratic party concealed its involvement in challenges to the

the lawsuit filed monday in us district court also contends 
that one sheet of objections to the petitions was duplicated 6000 
times and that copies were attached to each petition pincham said 
election law requires that objections be made out for individually 
for each challenged petition sheet 
there never has been such a massive fraud disclosed pincham 
said at a news conference 
the lawsuit contends democratic leaders hired influential former 
us district court judge george n leighton to serve as attorney

several large quiet triangular wingshaped 
aircraft of unknown origin have been spotted in the air near air 
force bases in california and elsewhere in the west reports 
aviation week and space technology 
a different aircraft whose engines produce a loud roar that 
resembles heavy rocket engines also has been spotted the magazine 
said 
the air force declined to confirm or deny that the sightings 
were of new warplanes 
the publication the current weeks edition that became 
available monday says the triangular aircraft are possibly 
prototypes of the air force b2 or navy a12 aircraft 
the a12 is a new fighter under development which has not been 
displayed the b2 is the stealth bomber which has been 
displayed and its shape is wellknown 
aviation week published what appeared to be pictures of the a12 
without explaining whether they were actual aircraft in flight 
artists conceptions models or something else 
the magazine said the triangular craft did not resemble the 
production b2 with its distinctive sawtooth wing trailing edge 
it quoted well qualified observers as reporting that the 
aircraft are fairly flat and triangular shaped with a rounded 
nose rounded wingtips and probably no vertical tail surfaces 
the observers were not otherwise identified 
one observer in nevada was quoted as saying the shape of the 
aircraft was like a manta ray 
the magazine said there have been at least 11 sightings of the 
triangular aircraft near edwards air force base in california and 
one near fresno calif it said there have been other sightings of 
similar aircraft in central nevada near ranges operated by the air 
force and the energy department 
it described at least 14 sightings of the loud craft called the 
pulser from the pulsating nature of the sound varying up and 
down in intensity once or twice a second plus other reports of the 
sound often at night 
it said that typically the pulser aircraft are seen flying a 
southwest to northwest track near edwards air force base and the 
china lake naval weapon center 
this routing would suggest the aircraft are returning from 
test ranges or work areas off the western us coast where 
airline pilots have reported seeing very highspeed vehicles at 
altitudes above 50000 feet the magazine said 
a companion article said research aircraft flying from nevada 
sites include both manned and unmanned hypersoniccapable 
aircraft designed to perform strategic reconnaissance and other 
less conventionally defined missions some aircraft were said to 
have exotic propulsion and aerodynamic schemes not fully 
understood at this time

the dartmouth review a politically 
conservative dartmouth college weekly that has attacked women 
blacks and homosexuals is under fire for printing an antisemitic 
passage from hitlers mein kampf 
the student newspaper was distributed saturday on yom kippur 
the jewish day of atonement and judaisms most solemn day 
dartmouth spokesman alex huppe said monday a student petition 
drive against the newspaper collected more than 1000 signatures 
and a protest rally is planned for thursday the offcampus paper 
is not affiliated with the college 
the dartmouth student assembly which represents the 3200 
undergraduates condemned the review and university president 
james freedman accused the paper of an act of moral cowardice 
and a pattern of discriminatory attacks 
the passage from hitlers manifesto was inserted without 
attribution into the credo on the reviews masthead 
therefore i believe today that i am acting in the sense of 
the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am fighting for 
the lords work 
editor in chief kevin pritchett said the quote was inserted 
without the editors knowledge he said someone could have gotten 
access to the papers computers 
it was an ugly awful antisemitic prank he said it 
caused a lot of hurt feelings we at the review are sickened by 
this 
the newspaper in a statement offered heartfelt apologies to 
jews at dartmouth and to the dartmouth community at large and 
said it is investigating how the passage got into print 
our office is not secure pritchett said its hanover 
new hampshire not new york city 
the paper which has been published since 1980 with backing from 
some of the nations most prominent conservatives has been 
vilified over the years for its views on women homosexuals and 
blacks 
most recently william cole a black music professor resigned 
in august after the review attacked him for seven years in print 
belitting him as mediocre cole said his effectiveness was 
compromised by the attacks 
cole filed a 600000 libel suit against the paper that was 
settled out of court two years later for no money 
after cole refused to talk about a scathing review article in 
1988 four student staff members confronted him in his classroom 
after a lecture 
the students photographed and taperecorded the encounter 
saying cole swore at them and broke the flash attachment off the 
camera the college suspended three of the students a judge 
ordered them reinstated 
the petition distributed against the review accused it a series 
of actions that have fostered an intolerance of diversity at the 
college and undermined our colleges reputation and hindered 
unity 
the opinions expressed by the 24 staff members of the review 
do not represent those of the dartmouth community the petition 
said

us army troops have turned an 
abandoned oasis into a training ground for a kind of warfare not 
usually associated with the desert street fighting 
its called mout for military operations in urban terrain 
the exercise monday shows the determination of us forces to be 
ready to defend saudi towns from any iraqi invasion or possibly to 
dislodge iraqi occupation forces from kuwait city 
it was an otherworldly setting to play out fearsome 
possibilities the site which one officer described as right out 
of a 1950s foreign legion movie was a town that once had about 
200 inhabitants 
the town has stood vacant silent but for the desert wind 
whining through scrub pines since the residents picked up and left 
about 10 years ago for a new town that was built for them by king 
fahd 
a wall bore evidence of incongruous foxhole humor a sign 
saying master charge and visa accepted here 
but for military reasons this cluster of stone and mud 
buildings some still bearing ornate wooden doors was an ideal 
setting said capt john madigan 
madigan of springfield va a company commander in the 101st 
airborne division said he had trained in street fighting at a site 
in california but that doesnt replicate the distance or size 
that you have out here in the saudia desert 
in mondays exercise his troops advanced building by building 
through the sandswept streets employing the tactics they would 
use in actual street fighting they simulated combat without using 
live ammunition 
although the town is uninhabted madigan said his troops were 
instructed to avoid further damage to crumbling walls 
some soldiers complained about suddenly finding their bottled 
drinking water replaced by well water with an unpleasant brackish 
taste 
frontline units have had liberal supplies of water in plastic 
bottles since the beginning of operation desert shield the us 
military buildup in saudi arabia 
weve gone to an oasis well water here said 1st sgt joseph 
mudd of st louis its the only type of water we may see in 
combat he said chlorine had been added to purify it 
maj dan grigson a division spokesman said the bottled water 
took up too much space in helicopters the oasis water came from a 
100foot well and has been tested and is perfectly safe he 
said 
some troopers said the packets of flavored drink mix in the meal 
rations helped to overcome what spec anthony stewart of bessemer 
ala said was like swimming pool water 
spec lorenza abrams of richmond calif said regular water 
goes down easy not this one they say to close your eyes and your 
nose that way you wont taste it

the education department says an investigation 
has determined that a graduate mathematics program at the 
university of california at los angeles discriminated against asian 
americans 
michael williams assistant secretary for civil rights said 
monday that the 30month inquiry found a statistical disparity in 
the rates of admission to the mathematics department on the basis 
of race and an inconsistency in how asian and white applicants 
who received the same evaluation ratings were treated 
seventyfive other departments were cleared of discrimination 
allegations while eight departments were found to have 
inconclusive records williams said 
the office of civil rights also is investigating undergraduate 
admission practices at ucla and at harvard 
as a result of the findings williams said ucla must offer 
admission to five asianamerican students who had been 
discriminatorily denied admission the university also must 
establish a uniform system of admission and improve recordkeeping 
to allow us to determine whether or not it is observing the civil 
rights laws 
ucla chancellor charles young said the university will appeal 
the violation finding because we firmly believe that racially 
neutral criteria were used to make these decisions and that the ocr 
has no basis to conclude that discrimination exists at ucla

new television sets with 13inch screens or 
larger would have to include builtin decoders for displaying 
closed captions for the deaf under legislation awaiting president 
bushs signature 
the house gave final approval to the bill monday by voice vote 
the senate passed it in july 
the measure requires tv sets sold after july 1993 to be equipped 
with circuitry for converting audio portions of a tv program into 
subtitles on the screen decoders are available now but they sell 
for 160 to 200 separately 
the house energy and commerce committee estimated that including 
the chips at manufacture would add no more than 15 to the retail 
price 
in addition to the estimated 20 million to 24 million americans 
who are deaf or hearing impaired backers said the decoders also 
would benefit millions of children and functionally illiterate 
adults in learning to read as wells as immigrants trying to learn 
english 
all primetime television shows broadcast by the three major 
networks now carry closed captions as do most national news shows 
and sports events

the house has sent legislation to president 
bush that would reinstate limits on commercial advertising on 
childrens television shows 
the bill was approved on voice vote without dissent despite 
oposition from the bush administration which says the 
restrictions would create new and extremely serious first 
amendment problems involving free speech 
also approved without opposition by the senate the legislation 
would effectively reverse the reagan administrations deregulation 
of the commercial content of childrens tv programming in 1984 
similar legislation was passed by both the house and senate two 
years ago but it was vetoed by president reagan after congress had 
adjourned 
but with opposition from the television networks and the 
national association of broadcasters defused sponsors of the bill 
said they hope the overwhelming congressional support it enjoys 
will persuade bush not to veto it 
the limits which we propose are reasonable said rep john 
bryant dtexas i trust the support of various groups will 
persuade our president that this bill fits into his program as a 
kinder and gentler president who responds to family concerns 
the legislation would limit commercial advertising during 
childrens programming to 10 minutes an hour on weekends an 12 
minutes an hour on weekdays 
it also would require the federal communications commission in 
renewing the licenses of television stations to weigh how well 
broadcasters are serving the educational and informational needs of 
children 
the house energy and commerce committee estimates that the 
average child spends 10000 to 15000 hours in front of a 
television more time than in school and is exposed to more than 
200000 tv commercials by the time he or she reaches age 18

retired gen curtis e 
lemay the gruff cigarchomping iron eagle who built the 
nations global nuclear strike force and suggested the united 
states threaten to bomb north vietnam back into the stone age 
is dead at 83 
the fourstar air force general died of a heart attack monday at 
the base hospital 
in addition to transforming the warweary strategic air command 
into a force that could deliver nuclear weapons anywhere in the 
world lemay relayed the order to drop the abomb on japan and 
directed the berlin airlift in 1948 
in 1968 he ran for vice president as george wallaces running 
mate 
during world war ii lemay was instrumental in pressing the 
daylight bombing offensive against the nazis he led missions 
personally demanding bombers not use evasive maneuvers over target 
areas thick with antiaircraft fire 
transferred to the pacific he organized the b29 bombing 
campaign against japan his planes dropped the atomic bombs on 
hiroshima and nagasaki but he said later that japan had already 
been beaten by incendiary bombing 
we went ahead and droppped the bombs because president truman 
told me to do it he said in a 1985 interview 
lemay was in charge of the air force in europe in 1948 when the 
soviet union cut off access to west berlin his management of the 
berlin airlift kept west berlin supplied and dismayed stalin 
he became air force vice chief of staff in 1957 and chief of 
staff in 1961 
contending strategic air power held the key to us security 
lemay pushed for a modern bomber force he ushered in the b52 
still part of the nations nuclear deterrent 
lemay retired as chief of staff in 1965 frustrated by robert s 
mcnamara defense secretary under presidents kennedy and johnson 
mcnamara had subordinated lemays coveted bombers to the new 
ballistic missiles and put restraints on us air power in vietnam 
a sore point for lemay who believed in allout war 
in his 1965 autobiography mission with lemay he wrote that 
a solution to the vietnam war might be to warn the north vietnamese 
that they must draw in their horns and stop their aggression or 
we are going to bomb them back into the stone age 
born in columbus ohio lemay graduated from ohio state 
university charles lindberghs flight to paris led him to enlist 
as a cadet in the army air corps in 1928 
tough on himself and subordinates he was unable to distinguish 
between the unfortunate and the incompetent but he would do any 
job he demanded of his followers he was as comfortable in a 
machine gun turret as he was in the cockpit 
the 1955 jimmy stewart movie strategic air command provided 
a glimpse of the strike force lemay built a cigarchomping frank 
lovejoy played a character with lemays tough demanding persona 
one story about lemay was that he once found a sac sentry who 
had put down his weapon to eat a sandwich this afternoon i found 
a man guarding a hangar with a ham sandwich there will be no more 
of that lemay said in a memo 
lemay was a gun collector biggame hunter and ham radio 
operator his nicknames included iron eagle and iron pants 
in his autobiography he said he had blood on my hands not 
because i preferred to bathe in blood it was because i was part of 
a primitive world where men still had to kill in order to avoid 
being killed or in order to avoid having their loved nation 
stricken and emasculated 
a memorial service is scheduled for wednesday at the air base 
chapel burial will be at the us air force academy on thursday 
survivors include his wife helen and a daughter

reporters notebook from her desk for an investigation of a

to rest said paul pash police commissioner in suburban warren 
detective richard van hulle seized the notebook saturday from

newsroom of the 55000circulation newspaper in macomb county he 
returned it on monday 
herschel fink chairman of the state bar of michigan law and 
media committee called the seizure a violation of the first 
amendment 
its so frankly abhorrent to freedom of speech maybe we all 
felt comfortable it couldnt happen he said i dont think 
its a matter that we can allow to pass 
fink said his committee will discuss recommendations to the 
michigan supreme court for a rule to prevent a similar incident 
mooty said the notes were of interviews with elizabeth schultz 
on the sept 21 slaying of roy smith iii smith 17 was shot from

wed like to maintain that he said 
the search warrant was issued friday by district judge dawnn 
gruenberg who said police told her mooty had agreed to turn over 
the notes 
under the particular facts i had i do not believe this was in 
any way connected to the first amendment or a free press the 
judge said 
the police commissioner and deputy chief said they were not 
aware a judge had issued a search warrant until it was executed

notes they would have to subpoena them and that the newspaper

published or unpublished information and sources or bars a contempt 
ruling for refusing to submit material she said 
reporters shouldnt be afraid on a saturday morning when they 
go in to do a story that the police are going to show up

two leading doctors organizations are under 
fire from members for joining with a subsidiary of a tobacco 
conglomerate on a campaign to lower americans cholesterol and 
reduce their risk of heart attack 
its a pathetic use of a medical organization for the 
commercial ends of a tobacco and food conglomerate said dr alan 
blum a family physician and chairman and founder of the 
antismoking group doc or doctors ought to care 
blum is a member of the two doctors organizations the american 
medical association and the american academy of family physicians 
basically the american medical association and the american 
academy of family physicians are associating with people who murder 
400000 americans a year in order to save a possible 35000 or 
40000 because of lowering cholesterol said dr brent blue of 
jackson wyo a member of the family physicians academy 
smoking is a leading cause of heart disease cigarettes kill an 
estimated 390000 americans each year according to the us office 
on smoking and health 
the doctors organizations have allowed their names and symbols 
to appear in newspaper and magazine supplements supported by 
fleischmanns a maker of margarine and a cholesterolfree egg 
substitute 
fleischmanns products are made by the nabisco foods co part 
of the rjr nabisco tobacco conglomerate fiftyfive percent of the 
conglomerates net sales in 1989 came from tobacco products 
according to rjr 
in a separate campaign fleischmanns paid the ama 250000 to 
become a sponsor of its campaign against cholesterol 
three years ago doctors ought to care successfully fought to 
prevent the american academy of family physicians from joining 
fleischmanns in a cholesterol screening program 
at that time the academy decided it would not deal directly 
with tobacco companies but that this proscription did not extend 
to subsidiaries with no involvement with tobacco products the 
academy said in a statement monday 
asked about the tobacco company link larry joyce an ama 
spokesman said the only concern we would have is if any company 
tried to influence the public health messages that are part of the 
program he said the campaign includes antismoking messages 
academy members opposed to the earlier fleischmanns proposal 
said they were distressed at the new alliance 
this is what we worked on and this is what they said they 
werent going to do said blum were shocked and disappointed 
were in disbelief 
fleischmanns is an advertiser in the academys supplement in 
the current issue of readers digest fleischmanns ads appear on 
the same double foldout page with the academys lowcholesterol 
message supplements advertising fleischmanns and featuring the 
ama name and symbol appeared in sundays newspapers 
the academy has several links with fleischmanns in addition to 
the public health campaign and its medical journal the american 
family physician accepts fleischmanns advertising said academy 
spokesman william delay 
discussion of the rjr nabisco link is likely to come up at the 
academys meeting said blue 
the maine chapter has proposed that the academy stop 
interweaving its public health messages with commercial 
advertising for fear that will damage the reputation of family 
physicians

the comic woody allen once wrote in 
perpetrating a revolution there are two requirements someone or 
something to revolt against and someone to actually show up and do 
the revolting 
on monday in what the leftist sandinista front had predicted 
would be the most violent antigovernment action yet the second 
factor someone to show up was largely missing 
the result was nothing to laugh about for the sandinistas it 
was a stark public display of the dwinding popularity of the party 
of revolution that had ruled nicaragua for a decade 
a handful of burning tires scattered around some street 
intersections and a demonstration by about 500 sandinista 
supporters at the government complex were the only signs in managua 
that it wasnt a monday morning like any other 
the demonstration was supposed to kick off a round of mass civil 
disobedience over the governments economic policies 
nicaraguans interviewed expressed weariness with the 
sandinistas violent tactics and a desire to give violeta 
chamorros usbacked government a chance to work 
just a few months ago the sandinistas could whip up impressive 
throngs for antigovernment marches and party celebrations 
but on monday people went to work and children to their 
schools while traffic and pedestrians skirted the piles of burning 
rubber 
sandinista party and labor leaders had been announcing the 
protest for weeks 
former president daniel ortega who lost feb 25 elections to 
mrs chamorro had issued dire warnings that this situation is 
practically reaching the point of no return 
lucio jiminez secretarygeneral of the national workers front 
the umbrella group for sandinista labor unions had said mondays 
protests would mobilize large numbers of supporters 
jiminez organization alone claims to represent 200000 people 
after a governmentsandinista meeting last week the government 
announced a set of measures to alleviate hunger and misery the 
program addressed sandinista demands that the government cushion 
the poorest sectors against a drastic economic recovery program 
but the sandinistas apparently sure of their popular appeal 
persisted in their plans for what ortega called a social 
explosion 
according to ortega it would be much bigger than two 
sandinistaled strikes in may and july that paralyzed the country 
the last one in which six people were killed and hundreds left 
injured nearly deteriorated into civil war 
political observers have noted that the sandinistas seemed to 
start losing support in the first strike which occurred barely two 
weeks after mrs chamorros inauguration 
government supporters chided the sandinistas for not living up 
to their promise to be a loyal opposition 
aftr the second strike people interviewed in the streets 
expressed anger at the governments apparent inability to put down 
the demonstrations which caused millions of dollars in damage and 
lost production and left managuas streets nearly impassable for 
days 
for mondays action however mrs chamorros young government 
has shown it is learning how to take control 
after announcing the cushioning measures friday staterun 
television repeatedly ran clips from street interviews showing 
people who agreed with the steps 
many nicaraguans who watched a live television interview with 
ortega on friday night saw the former president as unreasonable 
the interview was conducted by the deputy minister of the 
presidency antonio ibarra 
while ibarra tried to have ortega admit the need for 
governmentsandinista talks to work out a consensus on social and 
economic reform ortega fell back on timeworn sandinista 
accusations and slogans 
despite this ortega has in the last few days begun to sound 
somewhat conciliatory and even jimenez seems to be softening his 
stance agreeing to hold talks with government officials today

presidential candidate lech walesa has told 
his first campaign rally that he opposes abortion and attacked the 
antisemitism that has tainted politics in his overwhelmingly roman 
catholic nation 
at the rally monday the solidarity chairman also stressed that 
no alternative exists to the painful shock economic reforms now 
pinching the polish people 
walesa 47 said it was too early to present his program but he 
took questions for 45 minutes from the crowd of 5000 assembled in 
a cold windswept market square of the northerncentral city of 
torun 
one pole drew scattered murmurs of support from some in the 
crowd when he asked walesa to remove all the communists and 
jews from the government 
the union leader replied look at america and other countries 
many ethnic groups are existing there in a pluralistic way and 
they are doing well i am not a jew but i am not antisemitic 
and i will always be against such slogans 
he was applauded and said to the questioner i won 
walesa also said he supported a controversial ban on abortion 
approved by one house of parliament on saturday you know that i 
am a practicing catholic and my opinion here cannot be different 
from that of the church he said 
it was walesas first rally since declaring his candidacy sept 
16 and he struck a populist note declaring i am one of you and 
want to remain one of you 
walesas likely chief rival onetime ally prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki has not yet formally declared 
polands first popular presidential vote in more than 50 years 
could take place as early as nov 25 under a newly passed election 
law signed monday by president wojciech jaruzelski the exact date 
is to be announced shortly 
jaruzelski the former communist party leader asked parliament 
on sept 19 to shorten his term because of increasing demands for 
him to step down as an unwanted symbol of polands old order 
parliament elected him to a sixyear term in july 1989 
when walesa appeared on the redbrick balcony of the medieval 
town hall in torun he flashed vforvictory signs the brass band 
struck up a tune instantly recognizable to poles as the anthem of 
prewar strongman marshal jozef pilsudski 
a banner read torun welcomes lech and two posters said we 
will elect lech walesa president 
walesa received a warm but not thunderous welcome 
evoking the spirit that made solidarity endure after it was 
created as the east blocs first independent trade union in 1980 
walesa said we succeeded 10 years ago ten million people joined 
us in the search for new chances for poland today i have a similar 
job 
walesa said poland is really free but we need new minds 
in government 
he said repeatedly that the economic reforms were crucial but 
he did not appear to win over the audience 
the labor leader has accused the mazowiecki government of being 
too slow to privatize the statedominated economy and to dismiss

askew covered the capitol for years as a newsman he resigned as 
an editorial writer for the tallahassee democrat to enter politics 
the winner faces republican incumbent jim smith in the nov 6

points but more than a third of the voters surveyed said they 
hadnt yet made up their minds 
minter pinned his hopes on good government types such as 
environentalists and political activists hastings was said to be 
strong among unions and minorities 
i will get 90 percent of the black vote but i cant win with 
just the black vote he said i have to get broadbased 
support and i have it

oversees corporate charters and state records 
minter and hastings have called for campaign finance reform and 
both have outlined positions on the environment education and 
other issues

should iraqi president saddam hussein 
choose to grab it there now is a lifeline in the turbulent persian 
gulf waters to pull him free from an ultimate military showdown 
with the united states 
it was cast out monday by president bush in a united nations 
speech that blended condemnation of the iraqi leader as a plunderer 
of kuwait with the option of a diplomatic solution 
if saddam wants to save face if he takes seriously the recent 
wartalk of senior administration officials the iraqi can 
rationalize a withdrawal from the small oilrich emirate as a means 
to arab ends 
after all bush said iraqs unconditional departure from kuwait 
could create new opportunities a permanent settlement between iraq 
and kuwait new but undefined arrangements for stability in the 
persian gulf and a settlement between the arabs and israel 
later bush told reporters there is no flexibility here 
he said his policy had not changed and they should not look for 
nuances hidden meanings in his speech 
and yet mixed in with the denunciation of saddam hussein and 
even the threat of a war crimes trial the president offered more 
in the way of a diplomatic alternative than at any point in the 
twomonth crisis 
in effect bush said withdraw then negotiate implicit is an 
opportunity for saddam to take up his territorial demands with the 
ousted rulers of kuwait provided they are restored to power 
the iraqi leader feeling the pressure of an international trade 
cutoff has complained that iraq is being singled out while other 
countries actions are not checked by the united nations 
saddam has pointed an accusing finger at israel seeking to 
swing other arabs to his side by projecting iraq as the bearer of 
the banner for an israeli withdrawal from the west bank and gaza 
which jordan and syria lost in the 1967 mideast war 
but at least one major arab nation egypt reportedly took 
exception to any gesture to the iraqi leader 
butros ghali the egyptian minister of state for foreign 
affairs discussed bushs speech with david levy the israeli 
foreign minister afterward diplomatic sources reported that ghali 
said saddam should not be given any chance to claim a bonus for 
his takeover of kuwait and that the arabisraeli dispute should not 
be linked to it 
just as bush took a cue from soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in raising the spectre of a war crimes trial for 
saddam the president followed the lead of french president 
francois mitterrand in offering saddam a way to avert 
confrontation 
mitterrands fourstep proposal before the un general assembly 
last week also held out to saddam the potential of an arabisraeli 
settlement if iraq gives up kuwait 
senior us officials who had dismissed any linking of the two 
disputes showed little interest in the french proposal at the 
time 
but on sunday the birthday of the muslim prophet mohammed 
saddam said iraq was prepared for a dialogue with france so that 
everything is based on clear ideas and actions 
mitterrand said one of his objectives was to ensure israels 
security bush of course would do nothing less for americas best 
friend in the middle east 
and yet saddam and other arab leaders also are aware that us 
policy seeks israeli withdrawal from the west bank and the golan 
heights 
bushs script for the area in the event of an iraqi withdrawal 
holds promise of realizing that goal 
whether it entices saddam to execute a complete turnabout only 
the iraqi leader can say 
the president is providing a way out short of war for saddam 
and yet he also is prepared to take the ultimate military step if 
scorned 
there are 165000 us troops in the persian gulf region and 
more arriving daily 
brent scowcroft the presidents assistant for national security 
affairs and other senior officials have been warning that us 
patience is running out 
were still giving sanctions the time to work the time to be 
effective bush told reporters monday and im a little 
encouraged that perhaps they are having a strong effect 
the choice evidently is saddam husseins

america tonight cbs answer to 
nightline has a way to go before its more than an insomniacs 
edition of morning talk 
monday nights premiere proved a onceoverlightly exercise 
with too much crammed into too little time 
the 30minute premiere included a 40th anniversary story on 
peanuts cartoonist charles schulz and a promising segment 
called the endgame the creators will mercifully shun 
interviews with actors hawking movies 
we hope to have some insights to have some arguments and have 
some fun said folksy charles kuralt the shows anchorman in new 
york crisp efficient lesley stahl is the programs anchor in 
washington 
the show which began at 1135 pm edt could have dispensed 
with analyses that added little to the worlds knowledge one on 
prospects for war in the persian gulf the other economic reporter 
robert krulwichs lighthearted although knowledgeable look at 
the federal budget compromise 
the endgame is an occasional segment in which visiting 
experts and analysts discuss the days hot topics that can be 
dreary but the first matchup of two former reagan administration 
officials discussing the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 proved 
an inspired different sort of washington forum 
former assistant secretary of defense richard perle and former 
navy secretary james webb made war or the prospect of one more 
than just a tv abstraction

gunmen raked supporters of rebel 
christian gen michel aoun with automatic weapons fire as they 
rallied at a candlelight vigil and police said today that 30 people 
were killed and 100 wounded 
aoun blamed the lebanese forces militia of rival christian 
warlord samir geagea calling mondays killings a horrific 
massacre he said president elias hrawis syrianbacked 
government was equally responsible 
for his part geagea accused aoun of engineering the bloodbath 
to win international sympathy as government troops tighten a siege 
around the generals enclave 
the rival forces of aoun and geagea battled for control of 
lebanans christian communities earlier this year hrawi is 
besieging aouns strongholds in an effort to make him yield to 
government authority 
in a new attack today snipers fired at pedestrians in the same 
spot as mondays shooting killing a civilian and wounding four 
police said 
the earlier carnage occurred shortly before midnight at the 
coastal highway bridge spanning nahr elmaut or death river five 
miles north of beirut police said 
they said about 5000 aoun supporters carrying candles 
demonstrated at the crossing to protest the weeklong siege of 
aouns enclave where his 15000 soldiers are headquartered 
as they shouted slogans condemning the president and mr 
geagea for the starvation blockade gunfire suddenly erupted and 
the crowd panicked in a stampede said a police spokesman 
some of the victims were trampled to death but at least 22 
died of gunshot wounds said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified in line with standing rules 
in his statement aoun said hrawi geagea prime minister salim 
hoss defense minister albert mansour and hrawis army commander 
gen emile lahoud are equally responsible for carrying out the 
massacre 
he called on the united states the soviet union britain and 
france to withdraw their recognition of hrawis government 
he said forces of geagea and lahoud had fired at his supporters 
from the north side of the crossing 
aoun said geageas militiamen and units of lahouds army fired 
on the demonstrators from the northern tip of the river crossing 
however a statement from geageas command in the christian port 
of jounieh 12 miles north of beirut said aouns planted 
intelligence agents fired at the demonstrators from behind 
it said the incident was designed to try to win some 
international sympathy and acclaim and to prolong his stay in the 
presidential palace a few more days 
aoun is headquartered at the presidential palace in suburban 
baabda the traditional seat of heads of state 
he and geagea fought a fourmonth war this year for control of 
the christian enclave that covers 310 square miles of coastal and 
mountainous territory north of beirut 
by police count 1046 people have been killed and 2799 wounded 
in that confrontation aouns forces were left trapped in parts of 
east beirut and neighboring mountains with no air or sea outlets 
geageas 6000member militia which ended the fighting in 
control of more than 80 percent of the christian enclave has 
pledged allegiance to hrawi 
he was elected president by parliament on nov 24 under an arab 
league peace plan designed to give equal power to the moslems in 
the government which was long dominated by christians 
but aoun who had been appointed a caretaker leader before the 
peace plan has rejected hrawis presidency he has tried to oust 
the estimated 40000 syrian troops from lebanon 
the president in turn has threatened to attack to dislodge 
aoun if the blockade fails

with the flick of a pen thefour victorious 
powers of world war ii have signed away the rights they won over 
germany by pounding hitlers army into submission 45 years ago 
ministers from the two germanys joined in signing mondays 
declaration and toasting it with champagne they pledged that the 
reunited germany being created this week will be dedicated to peace 
and good neighborliness 
the two german officials spoke at a 35nation ministerial 
conference on european security and cooperation the first such 
official meeting in north america president bush and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze congratulated the german 
people during the session 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany and east 
german scienceeducation minister hansjoachim meyer addressed the 
conference minutes after the four world war ii allies signed away 
the special rights they have exercised in the germanys and berlin 
since the end of the war in 1945 
the declaration suspends allied rights from the moment the two 
countries formally merge at midnight tuesday 
the suspension is a stopgap measure to allow the united germany 
to be a fully sovereign country a sept 12 treaty must be ratified 
by the us senate and legislative bodies of the soviet union 
britain and france 
meyers participation marked one of the final appearances on the 
international stage for east germany 
united germany wants to set a good example the germans commit 
themselves to their duty to keep the peace and they bindingly 
declare that never again will germany raise territorial claims and 
that it recognizes existing borders as final meyer said 
as a member of the nato alliance and the western european 
community united germany is in a good position to substantially 
promote the process of europes growing together meyer said 
in an emotional speech genscher said unification day marks 
the fulfillment of a desire cherished by the german people for 45 
years to unite in peace and freedom 
genscher who was raised in what became east germany also vowed 
that a united germany will dedicate itself to peace 
we are uniting in happiness and gratitude not in 
nationalistic euphoria he said the dark chapters of our 
history are a cause for reflection on what was done in 
germanys name that will not be repeated 
in his remarks bush said he had watched on television on sept 
12 as us secretary of state james a baker iii shevardnadze 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd french foreign minister 
roland dumas and the two germans signed the document suspending 
postwar allied rights 
those strokes of a pen bring to an end an era of discord and 
division he said a few minutes later as he opened the twoday 
meeting of 33 european countries the united states and canada 
we rejoice with the german people that their nation is united 
once more and we will soon welcome a united germany into the 
community of states bush said 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe known as 
csce began with the 1975 helsinki eastwest conference with the 
crumbling of the soviet blocs warsaw pact many countries count on 
using the csce framework for a new alleuropean security system 
provided negotiators at vienna agree in time on a treaty 
reducing european conventional forces baker said the united states 
would agree to a csce summit in paris in november

conservative zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi has refused to meet nelson mandela to discuss 
ways to end savage factional fighting that has claimed hundreds of 
lives officials said today 
the african national congress said buthelezi leader of the 
inkatha party declined an invitation to attend a meeting friday of 
black homeland leaders at mandelas home in soweto outside 
johannesburg 
the anc would have preferred if mr buthelezi would have 
attended the consultative meeting on friday said anc spokesman 
abba omar 
inkatha officials said buthelezi was visiting switzerland and 
they had no immediate comment 
anc officials said they hoped buthelezis refusal to attend the 
meeting would not derail efforts to end fighting between the two 
groups the meeting was called last month when dozens of people 
were being killed daily in black townships around johannesburg 
the anc feels the peace initiatives that we have begun on the 
ground and which involved inkatha members will continue omar 
said 
it was not clear how the anc could have any meaningful dialogue 
with inkatha without buthelezi playing a role 
buthelezi had expressed reservations about attending the meeting 
because he was invited as leader of the kwazulu homeland he said 
he would attend as head of inkatha and asked for a preliminary 
meeting with mandela 
government officials meanwhile said today they were still 
considering a call from mandela for an emergency meeting on 
political violence an official spokesman who declined to be 
identified said the government thought such a meeting would not be 
worthwhile at this time 
some 800 people have been killed since august in black townships 
around johannesburg in bloody battles pitting xhosas and other 
blacks loyal to the anc against zulus linked to inkatha similar 
fighting has claimed about 5000 lives in recent years in natal 
province 
anc officials said mandela would meet friday with five other 
black homeland leaders homelands were set up by the south african 
government as separate states for blacks under the apartheid 
system 
the ancs proposal to include buthelezi among the weak homeland 
leaders was seen by many observers as an attempt to sideline the 
inkatha leader 
buthelezi who heads inkatha and the kwazulu homeland has 
demanded a oneonone meeting with mandela to prove they are the 
countrys two top black leaders mandela has declined such a 
meeting mainly because of pressure from other anc leaders who 
refuse to have anything to do with buthelezi 
buthelezi has accused the anc of attempting to monopolize 
political power and excluding other black political groups from 
talks on ending white minority rule president fw de klerk has 
promised to end apartheid and share power with the black majority 
the anc and inkatha both oppose apartheid but differ over plans 
for a future south africa inkatha wants a freemarket economy and 
appeals to zulu nationalism while the anc is more leftist and pan 
tribal 
in other developments police said a man was killed today in 
durban on the east coast when a bomb exploded at a computer 
company the company is owned by a white member of the anc and one 
of his workers was killed and two women workers injured they said 
no group claimed responsibility for the blast police said

police opened fire on a stonethrowing 
mob today killing two people as thousands of villagers rampaged 
through the government district of the capital one policeman also 
was killed 
the riot followed a studentled rally of more than 100000 
people to protest a federal policy to reserve up to half of public 
jobs for lowcaste indians there were indications the rally was 
exploited by politicians seeking to destablize the government of 
prime minister vp singh 
police used gunfire when tear gas failed to disperse the mob a 
police spokesman said two people were killed and news agencies 
reported seven people were wounded 
one policeman was killed by an unknown gunman in the crowd said 
a police inspector who declined to be identified 
at least two other policemen were injured apparently by stones 
news agencies reported 
the violence ended four days of relative calm in the indian 
capital following riots that crippled parts of new delhi last week 
and affected supplies of gasoline water and basic foodstuffs 
near the rally site mobs set fire to a fivestory government 
building damaging the ground floor of the ministry of food and 
civil supplies fire officials said 
i have never seen such a dirty crowd said kanwaljit deol 
commander of the 3000 police deployed in a twomile stretch of the 
lawn where the rally was held brigades of paramilitary forces were 
called in assist police 
new delhi police chief vijan karan said mobs set ablaze two fire 
engines hurled stones at police patrols and government buildings 
and smashed windows 
the rally was the largest yet in the studentled movement 
fighting singhs job policy which he announced aug 7 
since then 70 people have died in protests and riots including 
about 20 youths who set themselves on fire or ate poison 
todays violence began after fiery speeches from student 
leaders social activists and farmers lambasting singh 
the speeches were punctuated by chants of death to vp 
singh and whoever lives like hitler dies like hitler 
offices and most shops were closed for a national holiday it 
was the 121st anniversary of the birth of indias independence 
leader mohandas k gandhi the prophet of nonviolence 
police and some students claimed many participants in todays 
rally were bused in from the neighboring largely rural haryana 
state to create turmoil that could destablize the government 
a political rival of singh devi lal has resigned from 
parliament to protest singhs handling of the jobquota issue he 
has a substantial following in the countryside and is a senior 
leader of singhs janata dal party 
the students have been outmaneuvered by the politicians 
said rajev awasthi who said he quit the student committee that 
helped organize the rally when he saw it lose control 
the rally went ahead despite a supreme court injunction monday 
ordering the government to halt the job quota program until the 
court rules on its legality 
the disputed policy reserves 27 percent of government jobs for 
lower classes in addition to a 22 percent quota previously set 
aside for the most deprived castes 
uppercaste students claim they are victims of reverse

president bush has a tough job selling the 
budget compromise he negotiated with congress a republican 
dissenter said today as the president began an armtwisting drive 
to win support 
people are very skeptical about this kind of solution coming 
from washington said rep tom tauke riowa who has declared 
his opposition to the package of tax increases and spending cuts 
tauke is in a tough senate race as he tries to unseat democrat 
tom harkin and like other republican challengers bush hopes are 
victorious in november tauke was quick to break with the president 
on the budget agreement 
harkin complained that senior citizens and our family farmers 
will suffer disproportionately under the agreement and said he 
would spend the next couple of days studying it carefully 
bush summoned nearly 60 skeptical republican members of congress 
to the white house to urge them to back the agreement 
hes going to be twisting arms and cajoling and telling people 
that if you are not supportive of this we ask you to take another 
look and think anew said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
hes got a tough job selling it said tauke 
muggers in pinstriped suits cried rep lynn martin the 
republican trying to unseat democratic sen paul simon theyre 
back at your pocketbook again 
throw out the leadership of congress said martin 
apparently excluding bush from the gang of muggers 
simon left himself a little more room to maneuver saying the 
more i see of it the less willing i am to support it 
the plan would enact permanent tax increases while leaving 
spending cuts up to congress to enact in the future complained 
rep newt gingrich one of congress leading conservatives 
gingrich rga also was upset that the plan did not contain 
enough measures to help businesses 
we can do better for america said gingrich the no 2 house 
republican this package will lose jobs raise taxes and deepen 
the recession 
the cries of outrage over the compromise were bipartisan on 
monday and came with certain swiftness from politicians running for 
higher office or suspected of harboring such ambitions 
im opposed to it said gov mario cuomo of new york who 
could be bushs democratic opponent in 1992 every middleclass 
person will be forced to pay more for tobacco gasoline alcohol 
while the rich go free because president bush promised the 
conservatives we wouldnt tax the rich people 
fiscal irresponsibility said gov l douglas wilder of 
virginia another democrat 
only last week bush campaigned in illinois for martin and in 
michigan for rep bill schuette who is challenging democratic sen 
carl levin 
my inclinations and leanings are that this is a bad 
agreement said schuette who defended the president as having 
gone the last mile before being forced into the deal by 
liberal democrats 
an aide to rep claudine schneider the rhode island republican 
challenging sen claiborne pell said schneider was evaluating 
it studying it trying to ascertain that no one group is being 
singled out 
on his campaign swing bush threatened to put the blame squarely 
on the democrats if negotiators failed to reach an agreement and 
the government ground to a halt 
i will take that message to every state in the union he 
said 
but an agreement was reached and this week found the president 
switching from bashing democrats to trying to persuade republicans 
i think this hurts the republicans said lyn nofziger white 
house political director during president reagans first two years 
in office i think its going to hurt our election chances next 
month 
nofziger said the agreement takes an issue away from the 
republicans how can they go out and say by golly were not going 
to raise taxes 
vice president dan quayle said that if an incumbent votes 
against the package there will be a lot of heavy water to carry 
on the campaign trail 
political operatives involved in 1990 campaigns were more 
cautious in their assessment 
i dont know what is going to happen said anita dunn of the 
democratic senate campaign committee i dont know who is going 
to vote for what and i dont know what the final vote is going to 
look like 
today is really a day of assessing and studying said wendy 
burnley spokeswoman for the republican campaign committee

an escaped convict was acquitted of a 
rape charge after claiming that a woman whose home he broke into in 
the middle of the night was living out a fantasy when she had sex 
with him 
gilbert stevens diamond was convicted of burglary assault and 
escape charges monday but found innocent of rape in the dec 17 
incident 
his attorney public defender richard reinhart had called the 
sex encounter something she did to him and said the 48yearold 
woman reported it only because she felt guilty afterward 
neither the woman nor jurors would discuss the case after the 
verdict was announced 
the woman testified last week that she awakened to find diamond 
sitting on top of her with one hand on her throat and a knife in 
the other hand she said she submitted to sex and even suggested 
one sex act to diamond after he threatened to kill her 
moments after diamond left the home the hysterical woman called 
manatee countys emergency telephone number the jury twice heard a 
tape recording of the call 
i cant believe this is happening the woman sobbed over and 
over on the tape 
circuit judge robert boylston had forbidden the public defender 
to ask the woman questions about her sexual conduct but reinhart 
stated his fantasy theory in his argument to the jury without 
objection from prosecutors 
assistant state attorney james parker described the womans 
submission as a question of life or death 
knowing that rape was inevitable she had nothing to do but 
save her life parker told the jury she had to do what was 
necessary in order to survive 
the judge set sentencing on the assault burglary and escape 
convictions for nov 1 
diamond 31 was convicted in january 1989 of burglary and 
assault he had been assigned to a workrelease program and 
testified he escaped by walking away from his dishwashers job at a

iraq challenged president bush today to 
demand that israel dispose of its nuclear weapons arsenal in return 
for the removal of other weapons of mass destruction in the hands 
of the arabs 
an iraqi government spokesman reacting to bushs speech at the 
united nations on monday said 
we support the removal of all mass destruction weapons from 
the region provided this applies not only to chemical or other 
weapons the arabs possess but also the nuclear weapons israel 
has 
and we challenge bush who is ever so careful not to anger 
israel to declare a clearcut position regarding this issue and 
make the suggestion to israel the spokesman said his statement 
was carried by the official iraqi news agency monitored in 
nicosia 
he said bush should prove he is sincere in his call for peace 
and security in the region and worldwide 
or is he again using the flowery calls for peace and for the 
removal of the threat of mass destruction weapons as a camouflage 
for ill intentions he harbors against the arab people their wealth 
and sanctities 
israel has never responded directly to allegations it has 
nuclear weapons saying only that it will not be the first country 
in the region to introduce such weapons 
western intelligence reports say that israel possesses up to 100 
atomic bombs and nuclear warheads 
in 1981 israeli warplanes destroyed an iraqi nuclear reactor 
believed to be developing an atomic bomb 
 
iraq has been condemned by the united nations for using chemical 
weapons banned under a 1925 geneva protocol in its 198088 war 
with iran 
baghdad also has been widely criticized for using mustard gas 
and other chemicals in a crackdown on rebellious kurds becoming 
the first country to use such weapons against its own people 
iran claimed the iraqis killed some 4000 kurds in the march 
1988 attack on the iraqi kurds who allied themselves with iran 
during the war 
un teams who inspected victims hospitalized in iran found 
traces of the outlawed weapons including blisters severe burns 
and darkened skin 
iraq also was reported to be developing biological weapons 
including toxins that spread lethal diseases

an unruly mob today broke down police 
barricades and stormed the courtroom where ousted prime minister 
benazir bhutto was to stand trial for corruption 
dozens of people including policemen and journalists were 
injured in the stampede apparently aimed at delaying the court 
proceedings until after the oct 24 parliamentary elections 
hundreds of police armed with steeltipped batons and automatic 
rifles stood by prohibited by law from using force around the 
punjab high court 
ms bhutto pale and visibly shaken by the outburst waited with 
her lawyers and bodyguards in a room adjacent to the courtroom 
after more than two hours of pandemonium justice rashid aziz 
khan adjourned the hearing until oct 9 the day ms bhutto is to 
stand trial before him on another corruption charge 
police blamed ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party for the 
melee 
ms bhuttos lawyers accused police commandos of triggering the 
violence to deliberately discredit the former prime minister and 
her pakistan peoples party the party seems to be gaining strength 
since the armybacked caretaker government resurrected the 
onejudge special tribunals to try members of her ousted government 
for corruption 
ms bhuttos political opponets were expected to try to 
capitalize on the violence portraying it as an example of her 
partys disrespect for law and order 
ms bhuttos government was dismissed after only 20 months by 
president ghulam ishaq khan who cited charges ranging from 
corruption and nepotism to abuse of power 
ms bhutto and half a dozen former cabinet ministers have been 
charged with corruption before the tribunals 
the charge before aziz khan today accused her of selling 
governmentprotected land to a londonbased firm owned by a cousin 
the land reportedly sold at below market value 
other charges to e heard before tribunals in her hometown of 
karachi allege she illegally used an asia development bank loan to 
hire a foreign consulting firm to oversee a karachi power project 
and allowed a britishbased firm to export cotton at rates far 
below the international market rate 
she is also accused of giving lucrative contracts for the 
distribution of liquified gas to family and friends 
ms bhuutto has said she does not recognize the jurisdiction of 
the special tribunals which were orginally set up in 1977 during 
the days of martial law 
but she has said she is appearing in protest to show the 
hollowness and maliciousness of the caretaker government which is 
comprised of former allies and bitter critics 
she has vehemently denied any wrongdoing 
if she is convicted of any of the four charges she could be 
disqualified from the oct 24 polls and banned from politics for up 
to seven years

president bush heartened by unbroken support 
he heard from world leaders for standing up to saddam hussein says 
he hopes the iraqi leader will reverse course and withdraw from 
kuwait 
bush met today with the soviet unions military chief gen 
mikhail moiseyev who applauded the steps bush and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev have taken in arranging highlevel exchanges 
between superpower military officials 
we cherish what is uniting our two nations today and we fully 
understand the contribution you both made to the improvement of our 
ties the general told bush 
bush also met today with chile president patricio aylwin and 
was meeting later with angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi in their 
first meeting since aylwins inauguration returned democratic rule 
to chile last march bush told the chilean president that relations 
between the two countries are moving in the right direction 
the president who faces a hard sales job to both the public and 
politicians on his 500 billion deficitcutting deal was keeping 
the emphasis on foreign affairs after returning late monday from a 
weekend whirlwind of diplomacy in new york 
bush held oneonone talks with nearly two dozen world leaders 
and renewed his indictment of iraq in an address to the un 
general assembly that held out the possibility of opportunities 
for settling saddams quarrels with kuwait once iraq withdraws 
unconditionally 
at a news conference after signing a stopgap resolution keeping 
the government running until friday bush said he felt optimistic 
both that the tough un economic sanctions against iraq are 
holding fast and that the message is getting through to saddam that 
he stands alone 
lets hope that that coupled with the economic sanctions 
will cause him to do what hes done in the past do a 180 degree 
turn and get out said bush he said the iraqi president had 
executed a turnabout in dealing with his old war adversary iran 
bush said theres no flexibility on the demand for a 
complete iraqi withdrawal and restoration of the government of 
kuwait 
but he said he was not pressing at this point for a new un 
resolution to unleash force against iraq bush said he shares 
british prime minister margaret thatchers view that the 
multilateral force in the gulf already has that authority 
he said he found totally solid support for the un position 
and the us position among the world leaders what im 
optimistic about is that there isnt one single breach in the 
armor of worldwide condemnation of iraq he said 
the stopgap funding resolution also frees more money for 
operation desert shield in which the united states has dispatched 
some 165000 troops to saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
the presidents 23rd and last meeting in new york was with 
president alfredo cristiani of el salvador who assured bush that 
he will push the murder investigation in the ugly case of the 
jesuits until the end 
six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter were 
killed during cristianis election campaign last november and the 
military has been accused of obstructing the investigation in 
which government troops have been implicated 
earlier the white house announced the united states is sending 
two batteries of patriot airdefense missiles to israel to defend 
against an increased threat from iraq

a french warship fired warning shots today to halt 
a north korean freighter near djibouti the first use of naval 
firepower by france to help enforce the trade embargo against iraq 
military officials in paris said the corvette doudart de lagree 
opened fire after the freighter sam il po defied an order to stop 
for inspection 
the warship set off in pursuit firing blank warning shots from 
more than 300 yards away before a third shot from closer range 
prompted the freighter to halt officials said 
a french search party then boarded the freighter officials 
said the vessel was allowed to resume its passage after searchers 
determined it did not appear to be violating the un embargo 
imposed on iraq and occupied kuwait 
the incident occurred in the bab al mandab strait linking the 
red sea and the gulf of aden french officials did not say where 
the freighter began its journey or where it was headed 
it was the fifth interception in which warning shots were fired 
since the blockade was imposed aug 6 four days after iraq invaded 
kuwait the earlier incidents involved us warships and an 
australian frigate 
it was the 16th time french search teams have boarded vessels in 
connection with the blockade 
the foreign ministry said today that 332 french citizens 
remained trapped in iraq or kuwait including 67 held at strategic 
sites in iraq to deter possible military attacks 
the ministry said iraqs decision this week to free nine french 
hostages was good news for their families but would in no way 
soften frances insistence that all foreign hostages be freed by 
iraq 
the nine expected back in france by wednesday night apparently 
were chosen at random and were not among those held at strategic 
sites the ministry said 
the release was announced by iraq on monday a day after saddam 
hussein said he would like to launch a dialogue with france based 
on remarks by president francois mitterrand at the united nations 
last week 
mitterrand apparently piqued saddams interest by suggesting 
that resolution of the crisis caused by the iraqi invasion might be 
followed by initiatives to solve the problems of lebanon and the 
palestinians but mitterrand reiterated the wests insistence that 
iraq withdraw from kuwait and free all hostages before any 
negotiations take place 
foreign minister roland dumas has suggested that saddam is 
attempting to drive a wedge between france and the united states

the bush administration urged the supreme 
court today to let oklahoma city children attend the schools 
nearest to their homes even if that results in racial imbalance 
the school board has no realistic control over where people 
choose to live solicitor general kenneth starr the 
administrations top courtroom lawyer said in arguing that 
oklahoma citys schools should be freed from a courtordered 
desegregation plan 
but julius chambers the new york city lawyer representing those 
black parents who challenged the neighborhood school plan said the 
court should not turn back the clock he opposed the plan adopted 
by the city school board in 1985 for students in kindergarten 
through fourth grade 
you should not let the school district in oklahoma city or in 
any other city reinstate the same assignment practices that caused 
segregation in the past chambers argued 
how the justices resolve the oklahoma city dispute a decision 
is expected by july could determine the future racial makeup of 
public schools in hundreds of american cities 
at issue is what oncesegregated school districts can do after 
achieving racial balance under courtordered plans 
the court must decide whether school districts like oklahoma 
citys may abandon forced busing and other desegregation tactics 
once a federal court rules they have become fully integrated 
ronald day representing the citys school board said 
residential segregation of the races is a phenomenon over which 
this school board indeed no school board has control 
starr representing the federal government warned the court 
against placing undue emphasis on the numbers he added no 
one is assigned on the grounds of race 
justice thurgood marshall the courts only black member and the 
winning lawyer in the 1954 supreme court case that outlawed 
racially segregated public schools challenged starrs assertions 
the poor afroamerican kid is still in the same school 
marshall said it remains a segregated school 
a federal judge ruled in 1977 that oklahoma city schools had 
achieved full integration and eight years later city school 
officials returned to a neighborhood schools plan for children in 
kindergarten through fourth grade 
the racial balance that had been achieved through busing 
disappeared and some parents called the result resegregation 
hundreds of school districts including those in most major 
cities operate courtordered busing plans for racial 
desegregation only a few have persuaded courts to declare their 
oncesegregated systems fully integrated but the potential impact 
of the high courts ruling in the oklahoma city case is enormous 
nevertheless 
a federal appeals court disapproved the oklahoma city 
neighborhood schools plan last year ruling that federal court 
supervision in such cases extends beyond the termination of the 
wrongdoing 
the citys schools once were racially segregated by law black 
parents sued in 1961 to end the last effects of such segregation 
and in 1972 a courtordered desegregation plan was put into place 
us district judge luther bohanon ruled in 1977 that the school 
district had become fully integrated and ended his supervision 
school officials continued the crosstown busing however until 
1985 when children in kindergarten through fourth grade were 
allowed to attend the school nearest their home 
by 1986 33 of the school districts 64 elementary schools were 
90 percent black or white 
after some black parents challenged the new racial makeup 
bohanon ruled that the 1972 desegregation plan no longer had to be 
enforced 
but the 10th us circuit court of appeals in reversing 
bohanons ruling said the oklahoma city school board has a 
continuing duty to refrain from any action that could weaken racial 
balance in the public schools 
other federal appeals courts have ruled in cases from norfolk 
va and austin texas that a local school boards obligation to 
promote racial balance ends when the school district is declared 
unitary or fully integrated 
the justices opened the courts 199091 term with a flurry of 
activity monday the court 
agreed to decide in an ohio case whether juries may impose 
stiffer sentences because of a crimes impact on the victims or 
their families 
said it will consider letting states outlaw all barroomstyle

iraq has strengthened its forces in southern iraq and kuwait and 
has now deployed nearly half its 1 millionman army to defend the 
occupied territory us military sources said today 
in the persian gulf meanwhile the aircraft carrier uss 
independence arrived on a visit intended partly as a show of 
force against iraq a navy officer said in saudi arabia 
the 79000ton carrier and several ships of its battle group 
passed through the strait of hormuz the only gateway to the gulf 
today and are now operating in the waterway a statement from the 
pentagon said 
the independence and its escorts will remain in the persian 
gulf for a short period to conduct normal operations the 
pentagon said

more egyptian soldiers were headed to saudi arabia today two 
ships passed through the suez canal headed for the saudi red sea 
port of yanbu canal officials said they carried troops and

at the united nations iraq unexpectedly postponed its speech to 
the general assembly on monday just hours after president bush 
hinted that an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait could help resolve 
arabisraeli tensions 
iraqs un mission gave no explanation for rescheduling the 
address to wednesday diplomats speculated however that baghdad 
wanted time to evaluate bushs message 
earlier monday iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari praised 
bush for saying he preferred a diplomatic outcome 
in his speech bush said iraqs unconditional withdrawal from 
kuwait could create opportunities for iraq and kuwait to settle 
their differences permanently for the states of the gulf 
themselves to build new arrangements for stability and for all the 
states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that 
divides the arabs from israel 
the us military sources in dhahran saudi arabia said 
analysts estimate there are well over 400000 iraqi troops in 
southern iraq and kuwait compared to 360000 a week ago 
the numbers of tanks artillery pieces and other heavy weapons 
have also been increased the sources said speaking on condition 
of anonymity they gave no figures 
the pentagon said last week there were about 3500 iraqi tanks 
in the kuwait theater most are believed to be in defensive 
positions many dugin behind earthworks 
the buildup of recent weeks is concentrated in areas inland from 
the persian gulf and in a crescent around kuwait 
the iraqis were also said to have reinforced their defenses 
along the supply lifeline from the southern iraq city of basra into 
kuwait the highway runs about 20 miles to the border and another 
50 miles to kuwait city 
us and saudi officials have stressed that the allied forces 
are in defensive positions to protect against an iraqi invasion of 
saudi arabia 
but many analysts have discounted the possibility of an invasion 
in view of the buildup of us troops now around 165000 in the 
kingdom 
the saudi government says it will not allow the united states to 
initiate offensive action against the iraqis from saudi soil 
without their consent 
the offensive capabilities of us forces have been underscored 
in recent days by shipborne us marine units conducting 
amphibious landing exercises in oman and by the arrival in the 
gulf of the uss independence 
in paris today foreign minister roland dumas dismissed iraqs 
order monday to release nine french hostages as insignificant but 
suggested baghdad may be softening its line in the gulf crisis 
on sunday saddam complimented president francois mitterrand for 
offering positive ideas to resolve the crisis and called for 
replacing the language of threats and warnings with dialogue 
in an interview from the united nations dumas told the french 
television network la cinq we are obliged to say that no gesture 
has yet come from iraq that modifies the basic problems we simply 
note a change in tone 
in other developments today 
iraq challenged president bush to demand that israel dispose of 
its nuclear weapons arsenal in return for the removal of other mass 
destruction weapons in the hands of the arabs the statement was 
carried by the official iraqi news agency 
in jerusalem a faulty siren signaled air attack sending 
israelis scurrying into bomb shelters less than 24 hours after the 
government decided to distribute gas masks to the public 
it took a half hour before radio announcers broke into regular 
programs to calm hundreds of anxious callers with the news that the 
siren system went off by accident 
israel announced monday it would start distributing gas masks to

the navy sent the aircraft carrier 
independence into the persian gulf today as a show of strength in 
the continuing military buildup against the forces of iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
the pentagon said in a statement that the independence and the 
carrier battle group accompanying it will have an opportunity to 
become familiar with the unique operating conditions in the 
restricted waters of the gulf between saudi arabia and iran 
but it said the presence of the independence will also provide 
a visible demonstration of the operational capabilities of a 
carrier battle group to our friends and allies in the region 
no us carrier has entered the gulf since the uss constellation 
sailed there in 1974 
although the movement of one of our carrier battle groups into 
the persian gulf is unusual it is not unprecedented and is not 
meant in any way to increase regional tensions the pentagon 
said 
the independence carries some 75 aircraft including f14 tomcat 
fighters fa18 hornet strike fighters a6 intruder attack 
aircraft s3 viking antisubmarine warfare aircraft ea6b prowler 
electronic warfare aircraft e2c hawkeye airborne early warning 
aircraft and sh3 sea king helicopters 
the independence approached the gulf through the straits of 
hormuz monday night it had been positioned in the gulf of oman 
which connects to the persian gulf through the straits

alaskans will get more than 950 each from 
the state this year as their annual share of earnings from the 
112 billion oilwealth savings account 
the 95263 dividend announced monday is the secondlargest 
since the state began payouts from the alaska permanent fund in 
1982 it is 79 more than the 1989 dividend 
for a family of four this years dividends will total about 
3810 they are paid to virtually every man woman and child 
residing in alaska regardless of income 
the amount is based on a complex formula that considers the 
funds earnings over the previous five years the recent doubling 
of oil prices because of the persian gulf crisis did not affect 
this years dividend 
announcement of the dividend amount is widely anticipated in 
alaska where merchants hold dividend sales and car dealers 
accept the checks as down payments in the states poor rural 
areas the dividend is a major source of personal income 
the annual distribution of permanent fund dividends is widely 
recognized as an important element of the alaska economy said 
state revenue commissioner hugh malone when the 1990 payout is 
complete over 3 billion will have been put into the hands of 
alaskans since 1982 
the 1990 checks will be mailed starting oct 9 
state officials said they expected more firsttime applicants to 
be rejected because the residency period for eligibility was 
extended this year from six months to a year 
but the states rising population over the past two years was 
adding to the number of applications offseting most of the decline 
attributed to the eligiblity change 
the total amount of earnings made available for dividends this 
year was 48251 million the state estimated there would be 
506511 eligible applicants 
the permanent fund is a state trust created by voters in 1976 to 
ensure alaskans benefit from the states oil wealth long after the 
oil is gone it has saved 20 percent of the 332 billion in oil 
taxes and royalties received by the state since the huge prudhoe 
bay field went into production

taps and neartears marked the retirement of 
the last us dieselpowered attack submarine and the launch of a 
new era for the navy which now has an allnuclear underwater 
attack fleet 
past and present officers and crew of the uss blueback said 
farewell to the vessel monday during the ceremony at the submarine 
base on point loma 
we are here to close with honor the active life of the 
blueback said a chokedup cmdr thomas a grassi its time to 
say farewell to an era and to a gallant lady 
the blueback which was commissioned in 1959 never saw battle 
and most of the time it patrolled the pacific but it did its part 
for posterity 
it made the first underwater voyage from japan to san diego in 
23 days in 1989 the blueback was used as a soviet submarine in 
the film the hunt for red october 
its final trip will be to the navys submarine graveyard in 
bremerton wash 
grassi was the last of 15 blueback skippers the 215foot 
submarine is a floating hunk of cold black metal he said 
it has been her crew which made her alive 
taps sounded as the crew lowered the vessels commissioning 
pennant the banner was given to grassi who is retiring along with 
the sub 
the ceremony ended an era that began in 1912 when the navy 
launched its first dieselpowered submarine the skipjack the 
navys only diesel submarine still in service the dolphin is a 
noncombatant research ship 
the transition to a nuclear sub fleet began in 1954 with the 
nautilus 
defenders of diesel submarines contend they are quieter harder 
for an enemy to find and cheaper than their nuclearpowered 
counterparts 
navy officials argue that the newer nuclear models are faster 
and more efficient 
nuclear submarines offer the ability and the endurance to 
deploy on station for many days as opposed to the diesel which is 
less capable in a forwarddeployed role said navy spokesman lt 
greg smith 
diesel engines drove the blueback on the surface and 
highcapacity storage batteries powered electric motors when it was 
submerged

a judge today ordered striking temple 
university professors back to work saying that education is so 
critical that the right to strike must yield 
education is vital to the health safety and welfare of this 
nation and this community said common pleas judge samuel lehrer 
in issuing the backtowork order sought by the university the 
walkout began sept 4 the first day of classes 
the order which the union said would be appealed is to become 
effective at 8 am wednesday 
temple officials had said they would have to cancel 1900 
classes or more than 40 percent of those offered for the entire 
semester if professors werent back by this morning 
arthur hoskner the president of the union representing the 
1100 teachers librarians and others said last week a 
backtowork order would be honored today he said it would be 
appealed 
im sorry the judge made the wrong decision but we will 
appeal it hockner said the next step would be commonwealth 
court which may or not grant a stay to the order if the case is 
appealed 
the union represents 1100 teachers librarians and others its 
officials would not say how many of them are taking part 
a state mediator called both sides for a bargaining session 
monday night to see if something could be done before the courts 
stepped in but talks broke off just before 8 am today and robert 
harrington temples chief negotiator said there was no progress 
made during the night 
on sunday the union had overwhelmingly rejected the schools 
latest offer university officials have testified during hearings 
that the fourweek strike poses a threat to the public including 
the schools 30000 students 
without an injunction the cancellation of classes will affect 
6000 students now without any classes and 23000 other who have 
lost one two or three classes said temple lawyer john langel

there is no constitutional right to a college education and urged 
the judge to order both sides to the bargaining table the union 
presented witnesses who said that even if the strike goes on it 
would be possible for professors to make up for lost time

a judge on tuesday ordered the government to 
provide a fuller explanation of its decision to strip a former kgb 
general of his officers pension in retribution for his public 
criticism of the intelligence agency 
i hope to achieve one thing that other people based on this 
precedent will act more boldly and courageously in their attempts 
to restore justice and their human rights former spy oleg d 
kalugin told reporters after the courts decision which he called 
a victory 
i am satisfied this gives us a chance to dig deeper to find 
out something more about how the decision was made kalugin told 
reporters 
nikolai romanenkov presiding over a threejudge panel 
adjourned the proceedings until oct 23 and said the court would 
ask the council of ministers the soviet cabinet and the chief 
military prosecutor to explain their actions in kalugins case 
if the court meets kalugins request to restore his rank 
pension and honors it would be a landmark for citizens challenging 
official secrecy about government decisions 
i am sure there are thousands of these people in the soviet 
union i simply set an example for them kalugin said he said 
the case had no precedent in soviet law 
under reforms president mikhail s gorbachev introduced the 
soviet parliament has asserted greater control over the government 
but kalugin and other reformers argue that many officials continue 
to follow secret orders 
kalugin said after the hearing that the court by seeking 
further information from the government was pushing soviet society 
toward the stage where all secret acts illegal acts will be 
slowly gradually be done away with 
officials in the kgb whose predecessors in the 1930s arrested 
incarcerated and executed millions of citizens with impunity have 
told the soviet people that the days of terror are over 
but the kgb and the soviet leadership reacted harshly last 
summer after kalugin went public with his criticism of the agency 
which gathers intelligence abroad and is responsible for state 
security at home 
kalugin accused the kgb of tapping telephones and spying on free 
trade unionists clergymen and others who challenge communist 
authorities kgb spokesmen have denied the charges 
publicity surrounding the case helped kalugin win a seat 
representing the southern russian city of krasnodar in the soviet 
parliament last month 
shortly after kalugin began his public campaign against the kgb 
the council of ministers headed by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
issued an order stripping kalugin ofhis rank of majorgeneral 
gorbachev issued a decree revoking honors that kalugin won 
during a career that including a stint from 195870 in the united 
states kalugin has filed a separate civil suit against gorbachev 
viktor alexeyev chief of the kgb legal department told the 
court that the agency revoked kalugins military pension after he 
was demoted in accordance with a soviet law alexeyev said kalugin 
could receive a normal oldage pension when he becomes eligible in 
five years 
the judge rejected a motion by alexeyev to dismiss the case and 
the kgb attorney appeared shaken breaking into a sweat his hands 
shook as he read aloud from his legal papers before a bank of 
soviet photographers and television cameramen crowded into the 
courtroom 
kalugin and his attorney boris kuznetsov told the court that 
the kgb action was inhumane and a gross violation of the 
constitution and of human rights 
alexeyev told the court the kgb decision was based on a order 
the council of ministers issued june 29 
kalugins attorney requested and received a copy of the order 
noted that it was not signed by ryzhkov then asked is this a 
secret order 
alexeyev acknowledged that it was an internal order and shouts 
of good work rang out in the courtroom 
the judge rather than asking for silence broke into a grin 
alexeyev appeared angry as the judge and then a state prosecutor 
began to question him for details about kgbs actions in the case

men who habitually drank at least two alcoholic 
drinks a day were nearly twice as likely than abstainers to die 
before age 65 and the difference for women was threefold a study 
found 
even people who drank at lower levels than such heavier 
drinkers showed higher death rates than abstainers 
the study was based on a national sample of people who died in 
1986 
for women 407 percent of socalled heavier drinkers died 
before age 65 versus 132 percent of abstainers for men the 
figures were 423 percent versus 224 percent 
the numbers cannot be interpreted as indicating risks of early 
death because of the way the study was done cautioned study 
coauthor darryl bertolucci 
the study began with people who already were dead and worked 
backward in time to classify them on their drinking habits rather 
than starting with people of known habits and following them to 
find their risk of early death 
nonetheless the study does show a relationship that needs to 
be looked into he said 
bertolucci a statistician at the national institute on alcohol 
abuse and alcoholism presented the results oonday at the annual 
meeting of the american public health association 
the study used data on the drinking habits during adulthood of 
8303 men and 7158 women ages 25 or older the data was obtained 
several months after their deaths from nextofkin or other 
knowledgeable informants 
those who had drunk fewer than 12 drinks a year were classified 
as abstainers light drinkers were those who had averaged up to 
three drinks a week moderate drinkers were those taking four to 13 
drinks a week and heavier drinkers were those who took two or more 
drinks a day 
among men 33 percent of moderate drinkers and 32 percent of 
light drinkers died before age 65 for women the figures were 29 
percent and 26 percent respectively 
as expected cirrhosis of the liver was a more frequent cause of 
death in men for heavier drinkers than lighter drinkers or 
abstainers cancers of the trachea bronchus lung and esophagus 
increased with greater drinking levels for men and women 
similar increases were seen for suicide among women but deaths 
from traffic accidents were not related to drinking levels in 
either sex bertolucci stressed that the study focused on longterm 
drinking behavior while traffic deaths might be more related to 
how much a person was drinking just before the accident 
bertolucci said 252 percent of the men and 76 percent of the 
women in the study were classified as heavier drinkers 171 
percent of the men and 83 percent of the women were ranked as 
moderate drinkers 272 percent of the men and 231 percent of the 
women were light drinkers and 306 percent of the men and 61 
percent of the women were called abstainers 
the percentages of heavier drinking were higher than those found 
in a 1987 national survey that put 14 percent of men and 31 
percent of women in that category he said 
ian rockett an associate professor of public health at the 
university of tennessee in knoxville called the study valuable 
in an exploratory sense he cautioned that the drinking levels 
reported by the nextofkin may have been underestimates

the mayor said today he wants to hire more than 
7900 more police officers over the next 19 months as part of the 
effort to curb the citys escalating crime 
the officers would be part of a fouryear 19 billion 
anticrime program which would include 2950 new jail beds at the 
rikers island prison improvement of security at 150 schools and 
more officers on subway trains 
mayor david dinkins plan was released after police commissioner 
lee brown issued a report saying that by hiring more patrolmen 
redeploying other officers and hiring more civilians there would 
be an overall increase in the number of officers on patrol daily 
from 6640 to 10227 a hike of 54 percent 
the number of police on street beats would triple dinkins said 
the beefedup force would reduce the average response time to 
crimes by more than 50 percent to 90 seconds 
a rash of highprofile crimes riveted the citys attention this 
summer among the more noteworthy were a number of children hit by 
stray bullets the zodiac gunman who apparently picked his victims 
by birthdates repeated killings of cab drivers the killing of a 
prosecutor near the bonx courthouse and the fatal stabbing of a 
tourist who was defending his mother during a subway mugging 
the mayors program would be financed in part by a property tax 
increase that would cost the average single family homeowner 20 
more per year and a payroll tax that would cost a worker making 
50000 about 1 per week the first year 150 a week later 
the new officers wont be on the streets for some time the 
police academy can handle 2600 students at a time by splitting 
classes into two shifts each class lasts six months 
dinkins program also calls for 420 million over four years for 
the board of education to provide services to students at risk of 
dropping out in the hope of preventing crimes 
the mayor said he also wants the state to add five new prisons 
to house additional criminals expected to be arrested by the extra 
police officers

president bush and saddam hussein have toned 
down their rhetoric but private mideast specialists said tuesday 
theres no evidence either man is prepared to make significant 
concessions in the persian gulf 
i am marginally encouraged by what saddam and the president 
have to say but i dont think it would change my bets very much 
said geoffrey kemp of the carnegie endowment for international 
peace a research group 
the rhetoric had dropped slightly but we may be moving closer 
to war because there is no evidence that anyone is prepared to 
give he said 
saddam has given no indication hell pull his forces out of 
kuwait in fact us military sources say he has deployed about 
430000 troops to southern iraq and kuwait to defend the occupied 
territory 
and bush is a long way from cutting a deal with the iraqi leader 
hes repeatedly condemned several experts said 
even though tensions remain high the aircraft carrier uss 
independence and its battle group entered the persian gulf tuesday 
analysts said recent statements by saddam and bush underscore the 
caution with which they are proceeding to avoid what would surely 
be a bloody conflict 
they also appear to be keeping the doors open for some 
facesaving diplomacy although bush has insisted theres no 
flexibility in his policy 
saddam may be feeling the pressure of the un economic 
sanctions 
bush in a monday address to the un general assembly 
reiterated that iraqs aug 2 occupation of kuwait will not be 
allowed to stand but he said if saddam withdraws from kuwait 
that could help speed resolution of the iraqkuwait conflict and 
the dispute over israels seizure of arab lands during the 1967 
war 
bush was less confrontational but the substance was the 
same said richard murphy a former assistant secretary of state 
for the middle east the united states he said has long pushed 
for a solution to the arabisraeli conflict 
bush may have appeared to soften his tone to play to his 
international audience as well as to underline the us commitment 
to follow the un lead in isolating iraq murphy said 
he may also be sensitive to recent polls that show americans 
support bushs goals in the gulf so far but arent prepared for 
war some republicans have expressed jitters over the effect of the 
gulf policy on the nov 6 elections analysts said 
if we get involved in some interminable landlocked police 
action there are going to be some second thoughts said lance 
tarrance a republican political pollster 
one survey conducted for american talk security a bipartisan 
group of polling and consulting companies said nine out of 10 
americans dont want the united states involved in war 
murphy said saddam appears to be nibbling at a proposal 
french president francois mitterrand offered at the un last week 
mitterrand said if saddam withdraws from kuwait and meets other 
un demands the palestinian and lebanon questions can be 
discussed saddam has praised mitterrand for offering positive 
ideas to resolve the crisis and has said hell be in contact with 
the french 
since his annexation of kuwait saddam has repeatedly called for 
a broadbased resolution of arab problems he wants a peace 
conference to deal with israels 23year annexation of palestinian 
lands including the west bank and the golan heights and syrias 
14year occupation of lebanon 
allen gerson a former un official who is now a resident 
scholar at the american enterprise institute said no one knows 
what saddam is thinking but that the iraqi president must realize 
the foolishness of provoking the united states and its un allies 
the united states has about 170000 troops based in saudi 
arabia 
if he were rational he would go for a deal gerson said 
otherwise he will get wrecked the overwhelming odds are that if 
he doesnt then he is going to get destroyed 
hans binnendijk deputy director of londons prestigious 
international institute for strategic studies in london said in a 
recent article that saddam might withdraw from most of kuwait 
except for the southern part of the rumaila oil fields and the gulf 
islands of bubiyan and warbah 
saddam might try to declare kuwait a homeland for palestinians 
in a bid to garner support from other arab leaders who dont 
uniformly look with sympathy on the kuwaits wealthy ruling clan 
the alsabahs 
alexander george a stanford university professor now at the 
us institute of peace offered a scenario in which the alsabahs 
or their representatives return kuwait city but the iraqis would 
then hold onto the oil fields and offshore islands as a bargaining 
chip 
i am not advocating appeasement but these are important 
carrots he said 
but kemp said he doubts the united states would yield on the 
demand that the alsabahs who have been driven into exile in saudi 
arabia return to the emirate

building with a statement from the college saying it sympathized 
with the groups concerns 
the protest by members of adapt or americans disabled for 
attendant programs today had shut down some vital offices in the 
administration building but classes continued as scheduled 
about 200 activists seized the building monday and barricaded 
themselves in the office of president leroy keith 
they vowed at first to remain until health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan agreed to meet with them but they 
modified their demands today asking instead that keith write a 
letter to sullivan the former president of the morehouse school of 
medicine supporting their cause 
keith said he would not write or sign such a letter 
we have no business intervening in this situation where we 
have no authority he said 
later about 50 remaining members of adapt left the building 
carrying a statement written on keiths stationery but the 
statement was not signed and college officials refused to comment 
on whether they had anything to do with it or come out of the 
building 
even though they failed in their demand to get keith to write 
sullivan the demonstrators termed the protest a victory college 
students applauded the protesters as they left the building 
earlier today campbell gardett a spokesman for sullivan in 
washington said the department of health and human services had 
offered to have its regional director in atlanta meet with the 
protesters as dr sullivans representative 
the demonstrators said they felt the late martin luther king 
jr a morehouse alumnus would have approved of their protest 
this is a college that has always valued human rights said 
michael auberger a founder of adapt this is another minority 
that is trying to gain its human rights 
on monday the group expressed dissatisfaction that sullivan did 
not respond to their invitation to meet with them although he 
agreed to speak at an aids symposium at morehouse last week 
auberger said the problems of the disabled are as serious as 
aids he chose to ignore the issue 
georgia is one of 13 states that offers no statefunded care for 
disabled people outside of nursing homes it is one of eight states 
that provides no matching supplements for federal disability 
benefits said mark johnson of alpharetta a spokesman of the 
georgia branch of adapt

democrat foster campbell is attacking gop 
rep jim mccrerys strong antiabortion stance and support for a 
congressional pay raise as he seeks to put a new ending on a rerun 
of a tight 1988 race 
mccrery acknowledges that saturdays open primary could be 
close and has stepped up campaign advertising in the final days 
of the race but he makes no apologies for his views on abortion 
and accuses campbell of twisting the facts on the pay raise 
since mccrery and campbell are the only two candidates on the 
ballot the weekend voting will decide the winner of the 
congressional seat 
im gonna beat this guy says campbell a 43yearold state 
senator cattleman and insurance agent his positions are 
indefensible on abortion the voters view it as extremist and 
people who work for a living cant handle a vote for a 30000 pay 
raise and a vote against a 120anhour minimum wage increase 
mccrery 41 is completing his first full term he defeated 
campbell by just 1300 votes in an april 1988 special election to 
complete the term of buddy roemer who became governor 
campbell who was severely injured in an auto accident in the 
final month of the special election race didnt run in the fall 
election for the full term in that race mccrery handily beat 
adeline roemer the governors mother 
but now campbell 43 has fully recovered and is back on the 
attack 
campbell himself supported a bill prohibiting abortion except in 
cases of rape and incest and to save the life of the mother but he 
says mccrery goes too far in his opposition to abortion 
in a recent debate he called mccrerys vote for a measure 
prohibiting use of federal funds for abortions cold and 
callous 
campbells less restrictive views on abortion have brought him 
support from a large group of shreveport women in business and 
professions 
it was just time for us to take a stand on an issue that is 
going to be involved in next years state elections said judy 
williams a public relations and advertising executive a large 
number of women would have otherwise voted for jim mccrery 
mccrery responds that abortion is largely a state issue and 
defends his vote in congress against federally financed abortions 
i have voted against spending your tax dollars to perform 
abortions and will continue to vote against it he said in a 
recent debate 
go a step further jim campbell countered if a poor 
woman was raped you are saying she should not be able to have an 
abortion if she cant afford one even if shes a victim of rape i 
have two daughters i dont want the government coming into my 
living room making decisions about them 
mccrery says campbell isnt telling the whole story about the 
congressmans vote in support of a congressional pay raise 
he doesnt tell you i voted to take away 30000 of other 
income from special interests that i voted to restrict almost all 
other forms of outside earned income mccrery said it was an 
important bill to preserve the integrity of the country 
he says i voted against minimum wage but he doesnt tell you i 
voted for a 90cent increase and that is now the law not the 
higher wage he wanted throughout this campaign foster has milled 
you 
campbell responded you voted for the 30000 pay raise jim 
why not just vote for a stronger code of ethics campbell pledged 
that if he is elected ill give the 30000 pay raise to charity 
each year and document it

encouraged by confidencebuilding measures 
announced by the finance ministry share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange rebounded today in a record singleday surge 
the closely watched nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues 
climbed 267655 points or 1324 percent to 2289841 the index 
had lost 355597 points in the previous five sessions to close at 
2022186 on monday its lowest level in 3 years 
the previous record advance was posted a day after the black 
monday global stock market crash when the nikkei rose 203732 
points or 93 percent to 2394740 on oct 21 1987 
following the nikkeis fall below the 20000point level at one 
point monday finance minister ryutaro hashimoto announced his 
ministry would take steps to raise margin trading limits and cut 
futures and options trading hours in an attempt to support the 
market 
the support from the finance ministry boosted the markets 
sentiment i believe institutional investors as well as individual 
buyers now cant resist investing at the current low levels said 
toshiyuki nishiguchi a trader with daiwa securities 
the market today roared with panic buying said amy yip 
manager of equity sales at baring securities ltd customers were 
worried about missing the boat theyre afraid the markets going 
to pull back tomorrow and yet their hands and mouth cant 
function together theyre moving entirely differently from 
logic she said 
while market participants predicted monday that the nikkei would 
continue downward to 15000 points views are now calling for a 
pulling back to 23000 points or even to 25000 points yip said 
this just shows how very fragile investor sentiment is she 
said 
the foreign ministrys measures themselves werent what prompted 
buying today traders said they said the bullish mood resulted 
more from the psychological impact of the ministrys stance on 
supporting the market 
volume on the markets first section was estimated at 550 
million shares up from 428 million shares monday 
hashimotos show of support came after the nikkei index had shed 
1061613 points or 344 percent from its closing of 3083799 on 
aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait 
japan is highly vulnerable to unrest in the persian gulf because 
it imports 99 percent of its oil with 70 percent coming from the 
middle east 
in addition to the psychological effect of hashimotos 
measure the market weary of selling was prepared for an 
upturn said yoshiro inoue a dealer with nomura securities 
diplomatic efforts by countries to settle the gulf crisis 
slipping oil prices a surge in the dow jones industrial average on 
wall street overnight and a stronger bond market in japan were 
among the positive factors he said 
we believe todays rebound is an indication of sustained 
recovery as long as the middle east remains calm inoue said 
the dollar meanwhile declined against the japanese yen 
the dollar began the day at 13655 yen down 060 yen from 
mondays close after ranging between 13653 yen and 13710 yen it 
closed at 13673 yen down 042 yen 
the yens strength reflected overnight gains in new york and 
other overseas markets amid growing expectations of an easing of

in bond dealings the yield of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds closed at 8185 percent down sharply

sales of new homes fell 14 percent in august 
the government reported tuesday analysts said sales would have 
fallen further but for buyers who signed contracts before the 
effects of the persian gulf crisis were felt 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said buyers often rush to lock in on lowercost 
mortgages when they fear rates will rise following an event such as 
the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
but david f seiders economist for the national association of 
home builders suggested that september sales will be adversely 
affected by those made in august and by the rising rates that 
accompanied the oilprice shock 
thecommerce department said new home sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 550000 after edging down a revised 02 
percent in july however the july fall was much softer than the 
23 percent first reported last month 
the august decline was the sixth in eight months and more 
evidence of weakness in the housing industry sales during the 
first eight months of the year have plunged 136 percent below the 
same period of 1989 
many analysts expect sales to remain weak because of high 
mortgage rates consumer caution over adverse economic news and the 
persian gulf crisis and overbuilding in some areas 
seiders said the home builders now are forecasting 500000 sales 
this year compared to 650000 in 1989 but he said that forecast 
is contingent upon the federal reserve permitting interest rates to 
fall 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said fixedrate mortgage 
rates which fell to 984 percent during the first week in august 
began spiraling after the iraqi invasion and ended the month at 
1024 percent they remained at 1022 percent at the end of 
september 
the weak sales have contributed to sluggishness in the 
construction industry the commerce department reported on monday 
that overall spending was unchanged in august while residential 
spending fell 12 percent from july 
sales of lessexpensive existing homes on the other hand have 
been moving up for three months including a 21 percent advance in 
august according to surveys by the national association of 
realtors 
the commerce department said the median price of a new home 
edged up 02 percent to 120200 in august while the realtors said 
the median price of an existing home was 97000 the median means 
half of the homes cost more half less 
inventories of new homes in august were unchanged from julys 
77month backlog the department said 
the west posted the only increase in sales up 07 percent to 
139000 units after falling 35 percent a month earlier sales were 
unchanged in the northeast at 77000 units following a 72 percent 
decline in july 
sales fell elsewhere they were down 32 percent to 91000 units 
in the midwest after a 21 percent drop the previous month and off 
20 percent to 244000 units in the south which had registered a 
51 percent gain in july

a lawyer who bankrupted a ku klux klan 
faction with a 7 million civil judgment is going after another 
white supremacist group with a lawsuit on behalf of the family of 
an ethiopian who was beaten to death 
the 10 million wrongful death suit goes to trial oct 8 in 
another test of the idea of attacking racist groups through their 
wallets 
three skinheads confessed to bludgeoning mulugeta seraw to death 
with baseball bats 
the lawsuit contends tom metzger the founder of white aryan 
resistance incited the killing by sending agents to a portland 
skinhead group with a message of hate for blacks and jews metzger 
denies the charge 
the lawsuit will be argued by morris dees a lawyer for the 
alabamabased southern poverty law center he won a 7 million 
civil judgment three years ago against the united klans of america 
after two klansmen from mobile ala killed a 19yearold black 
man 
metzger a former kkk grand dragon from fallbrook calif and 
white aryan resistance are named as defendants along with 
metzgers son john and two of the men who confessed to killing 
seraw 
the case has drawn threats from a white supremacist group 
suspected in the sept 15 bombing of the federal courthouse in san 
diego the fbi is investigating the previously unknown group the 
holy church of the white fighting machine of the cross 
no one was injured in the explosion but a letter the group sent 
to knsdtv of san diego said it could not guarantee there would not 
be injuries in the future and it warned all concerned to drop 
the lawsuit in portland ore 
metzger said he had never heard of the group but added that 
other supporters would be in portland for a fundraising event 
during the trial 
civil rights groups also plan rallies and a march during the 
trial 
metzger symbolizes the rise of white hate groups in this 
country over the last 10 years said ron herndon a black 
activist in portland the trial and what happens to him will send 
a strong message one way or the other to the country 
the lawsuit claims that hours before seraw was slain two of 
metzgers agents spoke to the attackers and other members of a 
neonazi gang east side white pride 
dave mazzella and i told these skinheads that blacks and jews 
were the enemy of the white aryan race michael barrett said in 
an affidavit for the lawsuit 
we told them to use violence if they got the opportunity and 
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy we were telling them 
what tom and john metzger told us to say to skinheads we were 
organizing 
barrett said he had since quit the white supremacist movement 
in a telephone interview from california metzger denied he sent 
barrett and mazzella to portland 
seraw 27 was attacked nov 18 1988 by kenneth mieske kyle 
brewster and steven strasser members of east side white pride 
the three men and their girlfriends drove up as seraw was being 
dropped off by friends 
they deliberately went up there for the purpose of starting a 
fight police detective tom nelson said seraw was defending 
himself against brewster when mieske came up and blindsided seraw 
with a baseball bat 
the blow to the head knocked seraw to the pavement mieske 
smashed seraws head twice more splitting the bat lengthwise 
police said 
mieske admitted he killed seraw because he was black he pleaded 
guilty to murder and racial intimidation brewster pleaded guilty 
to manslaughter and racial intimidation and strasser pleaded 
guilty to manslaughter 
mieske was sentenced to life with a 20year minimum brewster to 
10 to 20 years and strasser to 20 years 
despite the confessions metzger contends the killing was in 
selfdefense weve been saying from the beginning that it was 
mutual combat provoked by the ethiopians he said

american companies surveyed before the persian 
gulf crisis said they planned to boost their overseas spending by 1 
percent in 1991 the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said a survey conducted in june showed 
that majorityowned foreign affiliates of us companies planned 
566 billion in capital spending next year up from 56 billion in 
planned expenditures in 1990 
but the department said the 1991 plans should be viewed with 
particular caution because the most recent survey was conducted 
before the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
developments in the middle east following the invasion may 
influence worldwide economic conditions investment opportunities 
and oil prices which may significantly change firms capital 
spending plans it said 
the 17 percent increase in 1990 spending plans was up from a 13 
percent planned increase reported in a survey last december actual 
capital expenditures in 1989 totaled 479 billion 
the level of capital expenditures indicates that us parent 
companies plan to maintain their recent emphasis on overseas 
operations the report said 
the largest increases were planned in germany up 18 percent to 
63 billion and japan up 15 percent to 26 billion 
even before the energy disruption of the persian gulf crisis 
the report said petroleum affiliates planned to increase spending 
by 2 percent to 159 billion in 1991 the increases include oil 
tanker construction and oil and gas extraction in canada norway 
nigeria and southeast asia 
petroleum firms attracted by host government incentives and 
potentially larger exploitable oil and gas reserves than those in 
the united states have been increasing their overseas spending 
relative to their domestic spending for exploration and 
development it added 
at the same time it said completed projects will result in 
spending declines in australia britain and the caribbean 
manufacturing affiliates plan to increase spending by 1 percent 
to 282 billion increases are planned in nonelectrical 
machinery transportation equipment and chemicals 
manufacturers have been attracted by several favorable 
conditions abroad increasing economic integration in the european 
communities movement toward marketoriented economic systems in 
eastern europe an improved investment climate in latin america and 
rapid economic growth in east asia it continued 
large investments in the european communities account for the 
bulk of the planned increase in spending on nonelectrical 
machinery mainly computers and transportation equipment 
computer manufacturing affiliates in the european communities 
plan to build facilities to produce a new generation of highspeed 
semiconductors and to meet rising demand for personal computers 
the department said 
automotive manufacturing affiliates in the european 
communities are planning extensive projects to reduce production 
costs and introduce product improvements in response to rising 
competition from japaneseowned firms and growing consumer 
demand it added 
in chemicals sizable investments are planned in japan where 
an affiliate is building a product development center it said 
spending declines related to project completions are planned 
in primary and fabricated metals other manufacturing mainly 
rubber and paper products electrical machinery and food products

nasa completed final preparations 
tuesday for the countdown of space shuttle discovery due to lift 
off this week with five astronauts and a plutoniumpowered sun 
probe 
the countdown clock was to start ticking at 330 am wednesday 
liftoff is scheduled for saturday morning 
a generator containing 237 pounds of plutonium238 was 
installed tuesday in the satellite tucked inside discoverys cargo 
bay the satellite called ulysses will use electricity generated 
from the decaying plutonium during its fiveyear journey in space 
technicians also repaired a broken wire in discoverys engine 
compartment that was preventing a liquid oxygen valve from opening 
environmental activists opposed to nasas use of plutonium have 
gone to court in an attempt to halt the launch a hearing is 
scheduled for thursday in washington dc before us district 
oliver gasch who refused to stop atlantis from lifting off last 
year with a plutoniumpowered satellite bound for jupiter 
the activists fear a challengerlike accident would scatter the 
deadly plutonium over florida and result in untold cancer 
fatalities they say nasas inability to fix the shuttle columbias 
hydrogen leaks calls into question the space agencys competency 
nasa tried four times in four months to launch columbia before 
stopping two weeks ago to turn its attention to discovery columbia 
is expected to remain grounded until late this year or early next 
year 
a newly repaired atlantis grounded by hydrogen leaks in june 
is scheduled to carry a secret military satellite into orbit in 
early november 
nasa officials insist the chances of plutonium being released 
into the atmosphere are extremely small and would pose little 
health risk even if it did there is no other way to get ulysses 
into an unprecedented orbit over the suns poles they said 
weve done everything we can to ensure safety said willis 
meeks nasas project manager for ulysses were ready and im 
optimistic were going to launch on the 6th 
after being released from discovery ulysses is to speed toward 
jupiter and use the giant planets gravity to be whipped into the 
proper solar orbit if discovery does not lift off by oct 23 the 
750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991 for the 
proper planetary alignment 
the fourday mission would be nasas first shuttle flight in 
nearly half a year discovery was the last spaceship to be 
launched its cargo was the hubble space telescope which later was 
found to have a flawed mirror 
meeks like everyone else at national aeronautics and space 
administration is counting on a successful flight by discovery to 
help get the beleaguered agency back on track 
it will be a boost for morale and a boost for nasa meeks

eightysevenyearold charlotte brooder likes 
having an occasional glass of wine with dinner and wouldnt mind 
having to pay slightly more for it 
but when it comes to medicare she has a message for president 
bush and congress dont mess with the rates 
trying to rein in the mushrooming budget deficit bush and 
congressional leaders have tentatively agreed to increase the 
medicare premium for 34 million americans many of whom like 
brooder rely on fixed incomes 
taxes on gasoline cigarettes alcohol and other luxury items 
also would rise 
but it is the provision raising the medicare premium that most 
bothers brooder a retired schoolteacher and librarian who moved to 
san diego from sheridan wyo in 1973 
brooder and other lowincome elderly living in the green manor 
highrise complex said in interviews monday that the burden of 
balancing the federal budget always seems to fall heavily on the 
poor and the elderly often they are one in the same 
i just dont like it said brooder who pays 240 a month 
for the onebedroom apartment i know they are trying to balance 
the budget but i just dont like the way they are trying to 
balance it i could probably get along fine but there are many who 
could not 
i like to go out to dinner and have a glass of wine every once 
in a while and i wouldnt mind paying the tax on it but thats my 
business and im probably going to have to keep my entertainment 
down said brooder a widow since 1961 
according to the budget plan medicare beneficiaries would pay 
more for the coverage that helps pay doctor bills an annual 75 
deductible would rise to 100 in 1991 and to 150 by 1993 
medicare insurance premiums would rise from 2860 per month to 
3350 next year and to 5430 by 1995 the american association of 
retired persons estimates 
the budget plan aims to save 60 billion in medicare outlays in 
the next five years half would be in reduced payments to doctors 
and hospitals the rest by taxing beneficiaries 
as in other places with a large elderly population talk around 
green manor is all about the budget and its impact on medicare 
from the crowd chatting on the lobby couch to the laundry room 
to the lounge the topic was the proposed changes in benefits 
many said the effects would be severe 
its going to hit people hard said irene hawkinson 69 who 
has lived in green manor the past four years with her husband 
eugene a retired meteorologist i just hope they keep the social 
security cost of living adjustments we dont need the jewelry or 
the liquor or the cigarettes 
green manor has 180 residents to live there they must be able 
to fend for teemselves and have an annual income of no more than 
20500 if single or 23000 if a couple 
the 13story highrise is owned and subsidized by a nearby 
congregational church rent is scaled to income there is a 
threeyear waiting list 
bob woodbridge 64 a retired drapery maker who moved from el 
paso texas in february said he supplements his 602 monthly 
social security check by washing cars and driving other residents

a former coal company executive 
testified today that suspended navajo chairman peter macdonald and 
his son sought a 4500amonth consulting contract for the son 
while the company was negotiating a coal lease 
the testimony by kenneth r moore former vice president of st 
louisbased peabodys western division came one day after 
attorneys made opening statements in tribal court in the bribery 
and kickback trial of macdonald and son peter rocky macdonald 
jr 
moore who retired from peabody in 1988 said the contract 
which peabody ultimately rejected was suggested on at least three 
occasions in late 1987 it was also mentioned in a letter that gave 
the amount of the payment at 4500 a month he said 
moore said he talked to a peabody attorney about the proposal 
who basically said it smells we decided not to do it 
during questioning by the defense attorney val jolley moore 
said he was not threatened by the elder macdonald in relation to 
peabody leases to mine coal on navajo land nor did macdonald 
express any bitterness or hostility when the proposal was rejected 
moore quoted macdonald as responding fine i understand 
on monday jolley had argued that the prosecution of the 
navajos suspended chairman is flawed because officials do not 
understand the traditional indian practice of a chief accepting 
gifts jolley said the prosecution was trying to apply nonindian 
notions of political decorum to macdonalds behavior 
theyve made a bunch of mud balls hoping that some of them 
would stick jolley said in his opening statement 
jolley said tribal ethics permit gifts based on a social 
relationship as well as campaign contributions he did not deny 
that macdonald had received loans and gifts from contractors doing 
business with the tribe but he did deny such acceptance violated 
any tribal laws 
ot a single vendor that gave money to peter macdonald sr 
ever received any agreement or understanding that peter macdonald 
sr would do anything on behalf of that contractor said jolley 
macdonald 61 said his political enemies had delayed the start 
of the trial in an attempt to worsen his chances at winning 
election to the new position of tribal president next month 
macdonald had previously accused the interim tribal government 
of using the trial to remove him from the nov 6 ballot and give 
the job of president to his opponent former chairman peterson zah 
in his opening statement prosecutor mark donatelli said 
macdonald had violated a public trust 
mr macdonald retreated into his outside world of cash 
condominiums and corrupt compromise he alienated the business 
community through a pattern of corrupt government said 
donatelli whose santa fe nm law firm was hired to investigate 
and prosecute corruption in tribal government 
clint hartwell manager of the citibank arizona branch here was 
the first prosecution witness hartwell verified microfilm copies 
of deposits into the bank account of denay inc owned by 
macdonald 
hartwell testified that checks were written to mrs macdonald 
from the denay account totaling nearly 104000 since 1986 
macdonald also received 20000 from the account but there are no 
bank records showing that denay paid anything to the internal 
revenue service or the arizona department of revenue hartwell 
said 
if convicted in tribal district court on all 45 counts of 
bribery conspiracy and ethics violations macdonald could be 
jailed for 23 years fined up to 22500 and barred from serving in 
tribal office for four years 
mondays was the seventh trial date set for macdonald and his 
son peter rocky macdonald jr legal maneuvering and other 
roadblocks had forced judge robert yazzie to abandon the previous 
dates 
the younger macdonald an unemployed lawyer who lives in san 
jose calif faces 11 counts of bribery and one of conspiracy

two activist groups asked the government 
tuesday to tighten regulations to make sure negative political ads 
clearly identify the candidate making the attack 
people for the american way and the media access project said 
many attack ads fail to adequately identify their sponsors in a 
concerted attempt to confuse and deceive voters 
the american public by and large does not like negative 
television commercials said art kropp president of people for 
the american way on the other hand they are effective if 
there is no connection made to the candidate who is paying for 
them 
candidates pictures should appear for at least four seconds and 
cover at least 20 percent of the tv screen the two groups said in 
a petition to the federal communications commission 
they also said text identifying the sponsor should appear for at 
least four seconds and measure at least 4 percent of the vertical 
height of the tv screen 
currently special discounted advertising rates are available to 
candidates whose commercials contain identifications that are 
readily legible and on screen long enough to be read by the average 
viewer 
but the two groups that filed the fcc complaint showed a tape of 
political commercials they say show that broadcasters are not 
meeting those standards 
the ads including some from hot governors races in california 
and texas feature tiny pictures and text identifying the source of 
the ads sometimes the sponsorship information appears for only a 
second or two often it appears against a backdrop of newspaper 
clips or alongside distractions such as a moving dog or moving 
text 
andrew jay schwartzman an attorney with the media access 
project said the current vague standards make broadcasters 
reluctant to reject ads as soon as one broadcaster in a 
community accepts a given ad the pressure becomes 
insurmountable he said 
both groups stressed that they are not promoting censorship or 
regulation of ad content negative ads will be a part of 
campaigns forever what were aiming for is basically truth in 
advertising kropp said 
he and schwartzman said the abuse is bipartisan and occurs at 
all levels with some of the worst cases occurring in local or 
primary races involving inexperienced and unknown candidates 
they said the problems arise mainly in negative spots because 
they work best with voters when the sponsoring candidate is not 
associated with the attack 
in positive commercials on the other hand the candidates 
happily appear standing in their air force uniform bouncing 
children on their knee or holding the hand of a senior citizen 
schwartzman said 
the two said they do not expect the fcc to decide on their 
petition before next months election but they want the agency to 
issue an interim notice reminding broadcasters of their 
responsibilities under current rules 
milton gross chief of the fccs political branch said the last 
such notice was issued in september 1977 he said the agency 
advises individual broadcasters of their obligations when specific 
complaints arise but has never received a broad complaint like the 
one filed tuesday 
people for the american way describes itself as a nonpartisan 
constitutional liberties group with 290000 members the media 
access project is a public interest telecommunications law firm

among the warnings broadcast to israelis on the 
radio tuesday was dont let the children play with the gas masks 
it was one of many reminders to israelis long used to air raid 
shelters in their basements and sonic booms from air force jets 
overhead that they now must face the possibility of an iraqi 
chemical attack 
in announcing monday that masks would be distributed to the 
entire population of 47 million the army was at pains to make it 
sound like a routine unhurried operation and not an emergency 
but the next morning sirens in jerusalem and a suburb of haifa 
sent some people in search of shelters while others made worried 
phone calls to authorities they were told the sirens went off by 
accident 
israelis woke up to a barrage of radio talk shows and newspaper 
articles on how to deal with the masks 
to those who wondered whether iraqi president saddam husseins 
threat was serious the reply from the experts was iraq probably 
will not attack israel but its best to be ready 
most callers to israel radio focused on what people should do 
with the sealed box containing a mask and syringe with a nerve gas 
antidote the answer was keep it in the closet away from the 
kids and dont open it except when ordered 
how they asked can we be sure the masks will work what about 
asthma sufferers and babies how does one protect the rest of the 
body 
in principle the gas only causes damage when it is breathed 
in through the lungs it should not hurt the skin said col 
david klivansky answering a question on israel radio 
klivansky added that in the sealed rooms that israelis have 
already been told to prepare for a possible gas attack you need 
only the mask 
the kits will be distributed at schools and notices mailed to 
citizens telling them where to pick them up 
yitzhak samuel who lives in the tel aviv suburb of ramat 
hasharon said his family already had received masks and felt safe 
we have them high up in the closet far from the kids he 
said on army radio we received lectures on a video and we are 
not afraid 
the daily yediot ahronot devoted three pages to the gas masks a 
picture showed a young woman demonstrating their use in the manner 
of an airline stewardess other photos showed protective tents for 
infants and special childrens masks 
a cartoon depicted israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
unwrapping a gas mask and advising a menacinglooking saddam 
dont panic 
one concern voiced by israeli officials has been that a decision 
to distribute gas masks might be read by saddam as a warlike move 
another fear is that it will scare the israeli public 
we can expect the public to behave in an adult manner now 
although the announcement about distribution in our view will 
raise the level of anxiety reserve brig gen aharon vardi a 
civil defense official said on israel television 
indeed signs of nervousness already are apparent 
in the past weeks while officials debated how to prepare for a 
chemical attack people rushed to buy sealing tape for their rooms 
and baking soda for homemade gas masks 
still officials are trying to make the gas masks a part of 
everyday life just like the constant appeals to be alert for 
suspicious packages that could be bombs 
as army spokesman brig gen nachman shai put it the public 
should accept the gas masks simply as another way of living in 
the holy land

williams said that is the wish of the unnamed host government

exercise which he said is intended to sharpen the skills necessary 
for a successful amphibious landing and to give those involved 
experience at working in a desert environment 
the pentagon meanwhile announced that us troop strength in 
the persian gulf region now tops 170000 and is at its highest 
level since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait

army reservists 4062 from the navy 3930 from the air force and 
678 from the coast guard 
all are in combat support roles 
no marine reservists are been alerted 
iraqi troop strength in and near kuwait remains at about 
430000 with 3500 tanks 2500 armored vehicles and 1700 
artillery pieces williams said 
he said iraqi forces remain in an essentially defensive posture 
with infantry forward and armored vehicles toward the rear of the 
zone

miss sutherland the 63yearold soprano known as la stupenda 
chose to make her last performance in her hometown appearing as 
marguerite de valois in giacomo meyerbeers les huguenots 
resplendent in a black floorlength gown miss sutherland was 
drowned in thunderous applause cheers and footstomping when a 
single spotlight illuminated her after the rest of the cast members 
took their bows 
they clapped from the wings before gathering behind her as 
brightly colored streamers and flowers cascaded ankledeep onto the 
stage from the audience 
miss sutherland tossed two of the bouquets into the orchestra 
pit before rendering a last solo a haunting understated version 
of home sweet home her husband richard bonynge who conducted 
the performance then came on stage to give her a kiss 
moffatt oxenbould the opera companys artistic director gave 
miss sutherland a trophy saying trophies are for winners and 
you are one of the most gracious winners of all time 
later a 12man cadre of bagpipers and drummers greeted miss 
sutherland at the regent hotel fans and guests lined the balcony

photographers assigned to the event lined up for autographs 
tickets for the opera house performance ranged up to 500 415 
us more than 400 patrons in tuxedoes and furs also attended a 
postperformance dinner that carried the same price tag 
but the enthusiastic crowd which included prime minister bob 
hawke and treasurer paul keating seemed to feel they got their 
moneys worth chatting excitedly about a onceinalifetime 
event as they lingered after the performance 
in a toast to miss sutherland hawke praised her hard work 
disciplined dedication and singleminded application 
in some ways tonight could be considered a sad occasion 
because we have seen the curtain come down on one of the greatest 
careers in the history of opera he said 
but in fact tonight should be an occasion for happiness and 
shared pride in the achievements of a truly great australian 
miss sutherland was a member of the royal opera in londons 
covent garden in 195259 in 1959 her performance in lucia di 
lammermoor won widespread acclaim

notes and amazing dexterity in trills and runs quickly became an 
international sensation

repertory from donizettis lucia to bellinis norma although 
her spunky marie in donizettis daughter of the regiment was 
among her mostadmired portrayals

the senate today endorsed president bushs 
efforts to deter iraqi aggression despite some members 
concerns that the move could be seen as giving bush broad authority 
to wage war 
the resolution of support passed by a 96 to 3 margin it 
followed an overwhelming house vote monday expressing similar 
sentiments 
this resolution is not an authorization for the use of force 
now or in the future senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine told his colleagues before the vote this resolution is 
not a blank check 
senators voting on the prevailing side said they believed it was 
important to send a signal of unity around the world by giving 
legislative support to bushs moves so far 
the resolution strongly approves the presidents leadership 
in winning approval of eight resolutions in the united nations 
security council which imposed a global trade embargo on iraq and 
called for the withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
it states the congress supports continued action by the 
president in accordance with the decisions of the united nations 
security council and in accordance with united states 
constitutional and statutory processes to deter iraqi 
aggression and to protect american lives and vital interests in the 
region 
sen edward m kennedy dmass joined sens bob kerrey 
dneb and mark hatfield rore in voting against the 
resolution sen pete wilson rcalif was not present 
kennedy called the language of the endorsement a blank check 
endorsement for future actions which abdicates congress 
wardeclaring power 
the house resolution adopted on a 38029 vote monday avoids 
any mention of future steps in the crisis 
this resolution most assuredly does not represent a blank 
check said rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the foreign 
affairs middle east subcommittee it does not support future 
actions except those actions that continue present policy 
hamilton and committee chairman dante fascell dfla said it 
is the responsibility of lawmakers to demonstrate formally how they 
feel about bushs policies in the middle east 
this is the most significant decision of the bush 
administration with regard to foreign policy and congress ought to 
speak its mind on it hamilton said 
opponents said the resolution abdicates congress responsibility 
and gives bush to many loopholes to wage a war 
im very concerned this will only provide a congressional 
public relations mandate for the president to accentuate a military 
resolution of this crisis rather than sustained diplomatic 
negotiations with all parties concerned said rep ron dellums 
dcalif 
the house version puts congress on record in support of 
diplomacy international sanctions and negotiations through the 
united nations to achieve bushs policy goals iraqs withdrawal 
from kuwait restoration of the legitimate kuwaiti government 
freedom for hostages and stability for the gulf region 
the united states shall continue to emphasize the use of 
diplomatic and other nonmilitary means in order to achieve those 
objectives and policies while maintaining credible united states 
and multinational deterrent military force the resolution 
stated 
like the house measure the senate resolution applauds bushs 
use of the united nations as a forum for international diplomacy in 
the crisis 
but it appears to further limit bushs future options by linking 
them to approval by the united nations 
congress supports continued action by the president in 
accordance with the decisions of the united nations security 
council and in accordance with united states constitutional and 
statutory processes to deter iraqi aggression and to protect 
american lives and vital interests in the region the senate 
version states

east germany spent a melancholy last day as a 
nation tuesday before passing into history leaving behind 40 years 
of communism and one brief dizzy fling as a free country 
bureaucrats emptied their desks and clasped hands in farewell 
the first freely chosen parliament held a wistful last meeting and 
the chief government spokesman said he was looking for work 
the museum devoted to the former nations history laid off some 
workers and began closing departments west germany shut its 
embassy in a country now part of its own 
east germanys oncesacred communist flag a red gold and black 
banner emblazoned with a hammer and drafting compass was spread on 
sidewalks and sold as souvenirs 
lawyers and bureaucrats once among the powerful elite stood in 
the last unemployment lines of an autonomous east germany 
east germany would have been 41 years old on sunday but instead 
acceded to west germany and transformed itself into just another 
five states of the mighty federal republic of germany or west 
germany 
phones rang at government offices tuesday but there was nobody 
home 
i hope for a new chance in the new germany im deeply moved 
by what has happened here said franz jahsnowsky a top foreign 
ministry official 
jahsnowsky who spoke in the ministry parking lot was the 
former chief of diplomatic protocol for ousted communist boss erich 
honecker 
he said he is not optimistic about a role in the new german 
government 
about 220000 government workers nationwide automatically went 
into employment limbo they will receive about 70 percent of their 
pay while west german officials decide how many to keep 
chief east german government spokesman matthias gehler would not 
hazard an estimate 
i know im out of work gehler said 
some government workers may get jobs after the new east german 
state governments are elected on oct 14 but tens of thousands are 
expected to be shut out 
very few people in the foreign ministry are expected to get 
jobs 
everyone thinks everyone in the foreign ministry had contact 
with state security secret police said eckhard trenck 40 who 
works in the press department 
many east germans said they welcomed unity but felt sad at the 
imminent end of their national identity and the only homeland they 
knew 
the soviet union carved the german democratic republic from the 
rubble of world war ii on oct 7 1949 
the nation was ruled by a succession of ironfisted stalinist 
governments until the protests that swept the east bloc toppled the 
old regime on oct 18 1989 on nov 9 the berlin wall was opened 
a communist caretaker government ran the nation until the first 
free elections of march 18 when the christian democrats of prime 
minister lothar de maiziere were elected on the promise of quick 
german unity 
the 400member parliament held an emotional final sitting 
tuesday after a rocky sixmonth tenure during which legislators 
battled west germany and among themselves over the terms and timing 
of unity 
only 144 lawmakers are to be added to the west german parliament 
that convenes for the first time on thursday the rest are out of 
work 
we have fulfilled our duties said sabinebergmann pohl a 
physician and president of parliament 
it was a sad time at east berlins museum for german history 
where 25 pensioners were laid off and about half of the 160 other 
workers were put on indefinite status 
the museum once a shrine to the old regime was turned over 
last month to the german history museum in west berlin which 
permanently closed some sections on tuesday 
it plans to empty the building by years end and move its 
artifacts to a wing of a new museum in the western side of the 
city 
a small group of employees was talking to a reporter tuesday 
when a woman came by with their layoff notices 
thats what democracy is to us snapped gerta kirchner 70 
i need this salary to survive 
west berliner christoph stoelzl the new head of the museum 
said pensioners are being laid off because west german law 
regulates how much outside income they can receive 
peter wensszlaw is a bit of a museum piece himself he was a 
lawyer in an east german legal system that no longer exists because 
east germany now has west german laws 
the nattily dressed wensszlaw 38 stood in an unemployment 
line he said he has no bitterness about the changes that moved him 
from a position of privilege to one of desperation 
i was a lawyer for 19 years and a communist party member 
he said my wife was a teacher and shes also out of work but 
there is a good thing happening here im optimistic 
wensszlaw said an employment counselor mentioned the possiblity 
of working as a tax adviser 
from a communist lawyer to a west german tax expert he 
said you cant think about ideology any more

the battle scars on the reichstag testify to 
germanys turbulent past and the old parliament buildings place in 
german history 
with the hoisting of germanys flag and the singing of the 
national anthem in front of the reichstag at midnight tuesday the 
old parliament building becomes the focal point of unification 
ceremonies 
on thursday the reichstag will be host to the first session of 
german lawmakers in nearly six decades as legislators from the west 
and east come together for the first time in the new united 
germany 
the sandstone edifice was heavily damaged in the last days of 
world war ii as german troops and soviet soldiers engaged in fierce 
fighting for the capital 
after handtohand combat red army soldiers raised a red soviet 
flag atop the reichstag in a famous world war ii photograph that 
symbolized the crushing of adolf hitlers third reich 
after the war the west german parliament met occasionally at 
the reichstag but never convened in full restoration of the 
building was completed in 1971 but the main hall where thursdays 
session will be held was deliberately left empty as a reminder of 
the unresolved german question 
germany got its first parliament in 1871 after kaiser wilhelm i 
unified the country and berlin became the capital the building and 
the parliament were called reichstag meaning imperial legislature 
the present reichstag building was completed in 1894 after 10 
years of construction 
a mysterious fire on feb 27 1933 just a month after hitler 
became chancellor gutted the building 
the blaze served as hitlers pretext to force passage of an act 
that allowed his government to make laws without reichstag 
approval 
the inscription dem deutschen volke to the german people 
was added to the building during world war i and is still visible 
over the main portal

among the thousands of bells ringing in the new 
united germany is one with a fitting inscription a 23000pound 
liberty bell given to berlin by millions of americans 
the liberty bell which hangs in the tower of berlins 
schoeneberg city hall about three miles from the brandenburg gate 
was presented to berlin on oct 24 1950 by the thenmilitary 
governor of germany us gen lucius d clay 
records show 17 million americans donated money to give the bell

a hijacked chinese jetliner cartwheeled 
into two parked jets at canton airport tuesday setting off a fiery 
explosion killing at least 127 people and seriously injuring 46 
others officials said 
the plane split the jets into pieces said a chinese man who 
witnessed the crash it was a horrible explosion the whole sky 
went red and the airport shook like an earthquake 
money passports watches and clothes were scattered along the 
tarmac the crash occurred at 9 am but ambulances wailed late 
into the night 
chinese officials western diplomats and witnesses provided 
conflicting accounts of the disaster and the resulting casualties 
a western survivor said there was a struggle in the cockpit of 
the hijacked boeing 737 as it landed at baiyun international 
airport causing the plane to careen into an empty boeing 707 and a 
boeing 757 full of passengers bound for shanghai 
other unconfirmed reports said two hijackers chinese men who 
wanted to force the plane to hong kong or taiwan exploded a bomb 
on the jet 
a caac spokesman wang chunfu said only one chinese man was 
responsible for the hijacking 
wang told a news conference 127 people died in the crash and 46 
people were seriously injured he said 100 people including the 
injured survived 
among those killed he said were foreigners and chinese from 
hong kong macau and taiwan he declined to release further 
details 
premier li peng went to the crash site near chinas main 
southeast city and visited survivors at hospitals 
the accident was the worst publicly acknowledged air disaster in 
china previously in 1982 a caac trident crashed in the southern 
city of guilin killing 112 people china rarely disclosed air 
disasters before the 1980s 
although it was a domestic flight from ziamen to canton at 
least two americans were on the hijacked plane us embassy 
spokesman sheridan bell said erin lynne thomas of oklahoma city 
okla was hospitalized in good condition with a broken limb he 
said she reported a second american woman had been sitting next to 
her but bell said the second woman was missing 
an airport security officer who only identified himself as 
chen said the pilot tricked the hijackers into believing they were 
leaving china but the hijackers realized the truth as the jet 
approached canton 
as the hijackers argued with the pilot chen said the plane 
circled the airport for about 40 minutes then it crashed 
witnesses said the 737 spun out of control down the tarmac 
sideswiping the empty plane before hitting the 757 
the plane was snapped in half like a match stick said a 
westerner who saw the crash scene all that was left of the 
fuselage was charred metal it looked like a crematorium 
the conflicting reports on the number of people killed or 
injured could not be reconciled immediately 
western diplomats said 104 people including 10 crew members 
were aboard the hijacked plane diplomats said they learned of only 
nine survivors including the american woman 
at least 150 people were aboard the boeing 757 the airport 
security official said he said he believed a large number of 
people were also killed aboard that flight 
tomohide yamamoto a businessman from japan said he was sitting 
in the 12th row of the boeing 757 
i think those who were sitting behind the 14th row couldnt 
have escaped from the plane he told japanese television only 
those who were sitting in the front were rescued after i got out 
of the plane no one came out 
the security official said that among the three planes only 
five people an airplane mechanic an air hostess an elderly 
woman a young woman and a man escaped unscathed 
we have at least 200 people dead or injured he said he 
said he believed the casualty tolls were higher than reported by 
the chinese media 
the security official said two hijackers exploded a bomb as the 
jet landed causing the accident officials from the boeing co 
which has an office at the airport also told us diplomats in 
guangzhou that a bomb was detonated in the plane diplomats said 
but a survivor speaking on condition of anonymity denied the 
report and said the crash was caused by a scuffle in the cockpit 
the hijacking and crash occurred as china was playing host to 
its first major international sporting event the asian games 
security forces nationwide have been on alert to prevent any 
incidents that might embarrass the government 
several hijackings once unheard of in communist china have 
taken place in recent years in april 1989 a hijacker blew himself 
up after he failed to force a domestic flight to taiwan

if rep lawrence coughlin has his way the 
coast guard would have the authority to shoot down aircraft 
suspected of carrying illegal narcotics 
on tuesday the pennsylvania republican presented the house 
merchant marines subcommittee with this scenario in which his 
legislation wmunist party official lashed out tuesday at a 
proposed law to limit the partys influence in the soviet military 
and police calling it a step toward lawlessness 
the national legislature approved the law in principle monday 
and began considering amendments tuesday final approval could come 
as early as wednesday 
the bill would establish procedures for forming new political 
parties and guarantee them equal rights with the communist party 
which agreed earlier this year to give up its constitutional 
monopoly on power 
yuri a manayenkov a member of the legislature and the partys 
central committee told reporters during a break in the legislative 
debate that the law would usher in the real transition to a 
multiparty system and create a good foundation for further 
democratization 
but he added i would like to say that not all the provisions 
in the draft law please us as communists 
in particular he objected to a clause that would require 
soldiers police officers and kgb agents to suspend active 
political participation in political parties including the 
communist party 
what does active political participation mean manayenkov 
said what are the exact concrete parameters there arent any 
so this would be in fact a step toward lawlessness 
the communist partys power and influence have waned in the past 
year as president mikhail s gorbachev created a powerful 
presidency and appointed a presidential council that assumed much 
of the authority formerly wielded by the partys politburo 
but the party has kept a strong hold on the military kgb 
security police and law enforcement agencies and manayenkovs 
comments indicated that communists are reluctant to give up that 
control 
manayenkov also said the party plans to hold onto most of its 
property officially valued at 78 billion there have been calls 
by local authorities in some cities for the party to turn over its 
buildings to the government 
maj gen mikhail s surkov a legislator and head of the 
political section of the soviet army in the transcaucasian region 
told reporters that soldiers could remain party members under the 
proposed law but he said all party meetings and other political 
activities would have to take place during nonworking hours 
surkov denied allegations that officers who have quit the party 
in recent months have been drummed out of the military of 480000 
communists in the military he said only 680 have voluntarily left 
the party this year and not one of them was forced out of the 
army afterward 
nikolai sazonov a leader of the democratic socialist faction in 
the legislature called for stronger measures to depoliticize the 
armed forces and law enforcement agencies 
he said his faction would propose an amendment to prohibit any 
party from giving orders to officials in the military police and 
kgb 
the current proposal is too vague he said the party 
wont give up control of the military and the kgb unless it has 
to

the moderator at the worldwide synod of 
bishops said tuesday there should be no debate on rules requiring 
priests to be celibate and forbidding the ordination of women 
the synod an advisory body attended by more than 200 bishops 
was called by pope john paul ii to discuss the formation of roman 
catholic priests 
the monthlong assembly which opened sunday with a mass in st 
peters basilica began its official working sessions tuesday 
the pope has made it clear he has no intention of changing the 
church position mandating priestly celibacy and an allmale 
priesthood brazilian cardinal lucas moreira neves the synod 
moderator appointed by the pope emphasized that these issues would 
not be up for debate at the meeting 
time is not sufficient to deal with certain questions such as 
celibacy of priests women priests priesthood for married men 
he told the assembly these issues have already been dealt with 
in a definite way in other forums 
some bishops however are expected to raise the question of how 
they can persuade more men to become priests without abandoning the 
celibacy rule 
one of the reasons cited for the decline in the number of 
priests is the requirement that they be celibate and forsake 
marriage 
earlier tuesday the international federation of married 
catholic priests held a news conference in rome to complain that 
the opinion of an important minority has no voice at the synod 
the organizations president bert peeters of belgium said the 
group had sent letters to all the bishops conferences represented 
at the synod to press for changes allowing ordination of women and 
married men 
peeters said his federation is represented in 26 countries of 
the 400000 priests in the world about 90000 are married he 
said the highest number is in the united states with 17000 
followed by france with 10000 peeters said 
the church does not permit members of the organization to 
celebrate the sacraments 
in his speech moreira neves who is archbishop of sao salvador 
of bahia said a greater effort must be made to prepare candidates 
for the priesthood 
the springtime of vocations experienced in many parts of the 
world could turn into a cold winter if proper formation is 
lacking he said 
if young candidates do not receive the proper training in 
seminaries the bishops who ordain them risk laying their hands 
on good and nice pagans 
young priests should be psychologically balanced and spiritually 
motivated and must dedicate their work to the good of the church 
moreira neves said 
otherwise they run the risk of throwing themselves into social 
work in the role of militants revolutionaries and labor leaders

the supreme court was urged tuesday to let 
oklahoma city children attend neighborhood schools even though that 
has brought back racial imbalance continued desegregation of 
public schools in hundreds of other american cities could be at 
stake as well 
lawyers for the bush administration and the oklahoma city school 
board said formerly segregated school districts should be allowed 
to escape courtordered integration plans once they achieve racial 
balance 
but a lawyer for some black parents in oklahoma city said 
returning to neighborhood schools in a city where whites and blacks 
live in different areas had turned back the clock to a time when 
blacks and whites were required to attend separate schools 
in an animated hourlong session all eight justices asked 
questions 
solicitor general kenneth starr the administrations top 
courtroom lawyer acknowledged that many of oklahoma citys 
neighborhoods are predominantly black or white but said the 
school board has no realistic control over where people choose to 
live 
school board lawyer ronald day argued that a federal judges 
finding in 1977 that the citys schools were fully integrated or 
unitary freed the board from continuing forced busing and 
other courtordered remedies until all city neighborhoods are 
integrated 
such residential segregation day said is a phenomenon over 
which this school board indeed no school board has control 
 
 
julius chambers the new york city lawyer challenging the 
neighborhood school plan told the court you should not let the 
school district in oklahoma city or in any other city reinstate 
the same assignment practices that caused segregation in the 
past 
at issue is whether oncesegregated school districts are under 
any continuing obligation to maintain racial balance in their 
schools once a federal court says they have achieved total 
integration 
but the high court also may have to say for the first time in a 
decision expected by july just what constitutes total integration 
justices harry a blackmun and anthony m kennedy posed 
questions about the definition of unitary and showed no 
indication that they agreed with the definitions offered 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and sandra day oconnor grilled chambers on his assertion that 
school desegregation should last as long as residential segregation 
exists 
at one point oconnor asked whether oklahoma city school 
officials would be required to comply with some kind of 
desegregation plan 100 years from now if blacks and whites 
still lived in predominantly onerace neighborhoods 
chambers said they would be 
justice thurgood marshall the courts only black member and the 
winning lawyer in the 1954 case that outlawed racial segregation in 
public schools engaged both starr and day in spirited exchanges 
referring to that landmark case marshall asked day what 
assurance do i have that the school board will continue to honor 
the constitution 
and the justice challenged an assertion by starr by stating 
the poor afroamerican kid is still in the same school it 
remains a segregated school 
before the courts 1954 ruling oklahoma citys public schools 
were racially segregated by law the school board was sued in 1961 
for continuing to operate a dual system and in 1972 massive busing 
was ordered 
but the same federal judge who had ordered the busing and other 
desegregation tactics ruled in 1977 that oklahoma city schools had 
achieved full integration 
eight years later city school officials returned to a 
neighborhood schools plan for children in kindergarten through 
fourth grade 
the racial balance that had been achieved through busing 
disappeared and some parents called the result resegregation 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals disapproved the oklahoma 
city neighborhood schools plan last year ruling that federal court 
supervision in such cases extends beyond the termination of the 
wrongdoing 
other federal appeals courts have ruled in cases from norfolk 
va and austin texas that a local school boards obligation to 
promote racial balance ends when the school district is declared 
fully integrated

the bush administration took another step 
tuesday to strengthen relations with chiles new democratic 
government by allowing the overseas private investment corp to 
resume operations there 
the announcement came during the first washington visit of 
president patricio aylwin since his march inauguration brought 
democratic rule back to chile aylwin met president bush at the 
white house tuesday 
opic is a quasigovernmental organization that facilitates 
investment by us firms in foreign countries 
the white house also disclosed that bush will travel to chile 
during a tour of five south american countries dec 2 to dec 8 
the united states barred opic activities with chile under 
aylwins predecessor military dictator gen augosto pinochet 
because of concerns about labor rights violations 
union leaders during the early pinochet years claimed that many 
labor organizers were killed by government factions 
following a review process it has been determined that these 
abuses have been eliminated white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said in a statement 
relations between the united states and chile now are moving 
ahead and making the transition from the pinochet era said 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson 
theres a lot of baggage from the past from the pinochet days 
that were trying to clean out this is a government we feel very 
strongly about and we want to make that clear in deed as well as 
word he said of the decision to let opic resume operations with 
chile 
pinochet remains head of the nations 60000strong military 
and aylwin recently ordered the general to cease his renewed 
involvement in politics 
bush expressed the united states strong support for chiles 
return to democracy and our commitment to close and cooperative 
relations with chile fitzwater said in a statement 
aylwin told reporters after their oval office meeting that he 
and bush also discussed the newly signed agreement to set up a 
uschile council on trade and investment to lay the groundwork 
for a future free trade agreement 
the administration currently has a proposal pending in congress 
for a free trade pact with mexico like the one the united states 
has with canada 
us officials want to conclude the agreement with mexico which 
would come at the end of 1991 at the earliest before moving ahead 
with stated intentions to open free trade with chile or other 
countries in the hemisphere officials said 
however the trade council and the opic decision are seen as a 
way the united states can encourage chiles return to democracy and 
pledge to end years of human rights abuses 
we would like to reward that both for our sake and theirs 
said timothy oleary spokesman for the us trade representatives 
office this is an important step toward enhancing our 
relationship 
bush announced in june in his enterprise for the americas 
initiative that he wanted eventually to see free trade throughout 
the hemisphere 
accords similar to the one reached with chile also have been 
signed with colombia and ecuador 
the accord sets up a bilateral council that would include 
private sector and government members to resolve trade disputes and 
questions relating to investment 
aylwin also pressed bush for inclusion of chile in the 
generalized system of preferences a system in which third world 
countries can get special trade benefits 
the chilean government is working on the remaining obstacles to 
obtaining gsp benefits which center chiefly on us industrys 
complaints regarding the lack of patent protection for us 
products 
aylwin told reporters outside the white house that he had also 
expressed to bush his commitment to human rights and to seeing 
justice done in the case of former chilean diplomat orlando 
letelier and an associate who were murdered in a car bombing in 
washington in 1976 
us authorities blame agents of the military government then in 
power

while a cincinnati art gallery and its director 
stand trial for obscenity the brooklyn museum is showing 
deliberately objectionable artworks funded in part by the 
national endowment for the arts 
museum officials culled the display of nude children embracing 
lesbians and homoerotic paintings from their own collection in 
response to what they call the current climate of censorship 
the exhibit the brooklyn museum collection the play of the 
unmentionable also includes three robert mapplethorpe 
photographs including a study of a nude black man twenty percent 
of the funding came from the nea and the rest from donations 
museum officials said 
the really mindbending discovery is that museums and private 
collections throughout the land are already replete of art which 
would send certain politicians and certain public pronouncers 
crazy said robert buck the museums director its already 
been this way for thousands of years art is a reflection of 
life 
nea spokeswoman virginia falck said tuesday the endowment was 
not aware of the nature of the exhibit and was looking into it 
the endowment has come under attack from conservatives for using 
government money to fund art projects they believe is obscene 
joseph kosuth considered one of the leaders in the conceptual 
art movement that began in the 1960s received an nea grant last 
spring for an unspecified exhibition giving just the briefest 
details of the kind of art that would be displayed he decided to 
comb the brooklyn museum for art that would illustrate what he 
believes is th fallacy of artistic censorship 
kosuth said he asked the curators of the museums six major 
departments to come up with artwork that could be considered 
objectionable by some 
it really shows the history of the culture of intolerance 
said kosuth were only organizing whats already there were 
showing that this is endemic to the whole cultural context and that 
a country shouldnt assault itself this way with this kind of 
debate 
the exhibit includes a broad range of paintings photographs and 
sculpture among the artwork displayed are rodins bronzes of 
lesbians embracing 19th century paintings of nude children and an 
18th century hindu painting of a man urinating into another mans 
mouth called intoxicated ascetics 
one of the seven photographs at issue in the obscenity trial of 
a cincinnati art gallery and its director shows a man urinating 
into another mans mouth the prosecution rested its case monday 
after jurors took their first look at the explicit pictures 
the brooklyn museum exhibit also includes a series by the 
contemporary photographer larry clark whose series teenage 
lust shows explicit photographs of sex acts as well as a photo 
of a nude brother and sister the boy is pointing a pistol at his 
sister who is tied up 
mapplethorpe would be considered mild compared with some of 
the work said kosuth 
the exhibit which opened sept 27 and runs until dec 4 is on 
display in the grand lobby 
it hits you right when you walk in said kosuth but there 
are signs up letting people know if they dont want to see it or if 
they dont want their children to see it 
juxtaposed between the artwork are quotations about art and 
censorship by historical figures such as adolf hitler joseph 
goebbels and george bernard shaw 
the quote from hitler reads artist does not create for the 
artist he creates for the people and we will see to it henceforth 
that people will be called in to judge its art shaws quote 
reads assassination is the extreme form of censorship

hi johnny were having three 
grandchildren not two michelle is having twins was the joyful 
message to one of more than 900 american hostages in iraq and 
kuwait 
youre in my thoughts constantly constantly constantly 
families of those trapped in the mideast began sending messages 
to their loved ones tuesday taping them on a hotline set up by the 
voice of america 
these are radio postcards said voa director richard 
carlson 
the families have been told to keep their messages personal to 
refrain from expressing political views and to avoid using last 
names so they dont tip off iraqi authorities searching for 
americans in hiding 
a state department task force has started calling the families 
and giving them the hotline number along with instructions on what 
type of messages to prepare 
the first calls to the hotline were poignant 
one to sergio from the west coast of mississippi said 
missy will be coming home for thanksgiving i pray youll be 
here too love mickey 
another was to bob from his loving wife sue assuring him 
the family was doing well she added were praying for your safe 
return we miss you very very much come home soon 
there were also some humorously cryptic messages this one to 
mike from jeff said the caller had spoken to mrs w in new 
york notre dame has won its first three games we think about you 
every day 
the 30second greetings will be aired starting thursday on the 
governmentowned radio network voa which since the gulf crisis 
began has increased its english and arabiclanguage programs to 24 
hours a day will broadcast the messages in three fiveminute 
segments during each hour of the stations morning news program 
on the first day the messages may be aired in a 15minute 
segment 
an estimated 600 to 700 americans mostly men are believed 
trapped in kuwait with another 300 to 350 in iraq most of their 
families were allowed to leave 
iraqi authorities have rounded up about 100 americans and moved 
them to industrial and military facilities as human shields to 
guard against us bombings 
the rest of the americans in kuwait are hiding from 
housetohouse searches by iraqi security forces state department 
officials say many of those captured were fingered by informants 
who led security forces to their hideouts 
in many cases iraqi troops broke down doors to get into 
apartments where americans were hiding in cramped quarters and 
suffering food shortages and uncertainty about their fate 
a special roundtheclock task force at the state department has 
been keeping in touch with the families in the united states 
relaying information about the hostages if they have it and 
providing moral support it has also begun referring families to 
support groups 
voa which broadcasts news and entertainment in 43 languages 
around the globe said this was a firstofitskind operation 
the only comparable project was a program of messages in pashto 
and urdu the languages spoken in afghanistan and pakistan to 
refugee families after the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 
within hours of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the iraqis 
began jamming voas arabic language service along with the british 
bbcs arabic service 
but the jamming has eased considerably in recent days and the 
englishlanguage broadcasts have not been disrupted at all 
the voa recently received permission from bahrain off the coast 
of saudi arabia to use mediumwave transmitters for its 
englishlanguage service providing the closest facility to iraq 
and occupied kuwait

louisiana officials should be barred from 
giving a mass murderer mindaltering drugs to restore his sanity so 
he can be executed the supreme court was told tuesday 
its fundamentally wrong baton rouge la lawyer keith 
nordyke argued in behalf of death row inmate michael owen perry 
the medications dont cure mr perry they may mask his 
insanity for a period of time so we can feel better about executing 
him nordyke contended 
but rene salomon an assistant state attorney general said the 
powerful drugs being given to perry are beneficial and salomon 
emphasized that louisiana has a strong interest in seeing perry 
cured so he can be executed 
at one point justice harry a blackmun said it doesnt seem 
to make much sense to cure a man only to execute him 
but justices antonin scalia and byron r white suggested that 
louisiana officials are doing nothing more than administering drugs 
routinely given to people suffering from perrys mental illness 
why is it outrageous scalia asked nordyke to say perry cannot 
turn down normal beneficial treatment solely to avoid execution 
nordyke said such treatment because of its punitive aim 
violates the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment 
and that administering it against perrys will violates his rights 
as well 
there is a fundamental right bottomed on human dignity 
nordyke contended he said no other state uses medication for 
punitive purposes 
but salomon said perrys right to some sort of 
selfdetermination has been greatly diminished by his status as a 
convicted criminal 
perry was convicted of killing his parents and three other 
relatives in their lake arthur home in 1983 
he was judged to be sane when he committed the crimes and 
mentally competent to stand trial he lost his sanity while on the 
states death row 
tradition and a 1986 supreme court decision bar states from 
executing anyone who is insane 
when justice anthony m kennedy asked nordyke whether it is 
against perrys medical interests to forcibly inject him with 
such drugs the inmates lawyer answered ultimately it will 
kill him 
i was talking about his interests prior to execution 
kennedy said 
justice thurgood marshall the only member of the court opposed 
to capital punishment under all circumstances asked salomon why 
state officials simply did not give perry enough mindaltering 
drugs to kill him 
it would be cheaper marshall suggested caustically

a submarine has retrieved the top half of the 
cargo door that ripped away from a united airlines jetliner last 
year sweeping nine people to their deaths a navy spokeswoman said 
tuesday 
the discovery ends a needleinahaystack search of the pacific 
ocean floor the sea cliff submarine recovered the bottom half of 
the door last week 
the sea cliff located and recovered the top half monday evening 
from 14100 feet of water 90 miles south of honolulu lifting the 
wreckage to the surface with its hydraulic jaws said pacific fleet 
spokeswoman sandy stairs 
stairs did not know how far the doors top half was found from 
the bottom half 
the threeman navy minisub and its support ship were expected 
to return to pearl harbor on tuesday 
the door will be turned over to the national transportation 
safety board which wants to know why it tore away from united 
flight 811 shortly after takeoff from honolulu international 
airport on feb 24 
the boeing 747 carried 355 passengers and was bound for new 
zealand shortly after takeoff the cargo door opened at 22000 
feet sweeping nine passengers from the plane the crew managed to 
return the disabled jet to honolulu 
after investigators examine the recovered debris parts of it 
will be sent to the boeing co in seattle for a more detailed 
review under board direction ntsb officials said 
a preliminary examination of the doors lower half showed the 
door had fractured lengthwise near the midspan latch the eight 
sectors of the latch lock were all in the locked position and were 
deformed 
the ntsb determined that faulty design of a locking mechanism 
probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the door was 
locked but wants to examine the door to confirm its findings 
the agency blamed united boeing and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to corect problems with the door 
it asked the navy to find the cargo door in hopes that 
examination could lead to better aviation safety rules

trade school officials upset by budget cut 
proposals that would eliminate many of their institutions from the 
student loan program began to search tuesday for other ways to 
save money 
the 500 billion deficitreduction agreement between the white 
house and congressional leaders calls for cutting 2 billion from 
the student loan program mainly by reducing loan defaults 
im pleased with the approach they took assigning the 
savings over the next five years said dallas martin president 
of the national association for student financial aid 
administrators it certainly is a much more manageable and 
realistic way to approach the problem 
the total of student loan defaults is 78 billion 
to trim 2 billion the budget negotiators would eliminate from 
the student loan program correspondence or home study programs and 
schools with default rates of 30 percent or more eligible students 
would be required to have a high school diploma or the equivalent 
and credit checks on students aged 21 or older would be required as 
a condition of a loan the negotiators proposed 
there clearly is going to be more scrutiny applied to the 
student loan program martin said of the recommendations there 
certainly are going to be needy students who are not going to be 
able to get loans its just going to require everyone to tighten 
up a little bit 
officials of the national home study council and the national 
association of trade and technical schools have been working on 
alternative budgetcutting strategies 
the trade school association plans to send a reform package 
to capitol hill on wednesday that will help reach the dollar goals 
with minimum damage being done to students said president 
stephen blair 
the guaranteed student loan program was established to make 
sure people who are unable to get bank loans still can get a 
loan said blair 
he said about half of the 650000 students attending the 
associations 13000 trade and technical schools are over age 21 
the education department last month called for close scrutiny of 
60 schools with high loan default rates ranging from 204 percent 
to 815 percent 
blair said the reform proposal will focus on improved 
student admission testing stronger refund requirements and delayed 
disbursements of student loans 
the national home study council sent a letter to the office of 
management and budget on tuesday saying that eliminating home 
study schools from the student loan program would not result in 
any significant default savings in the coming years 
the councils fourpoint plan includes requiring that 15 percent 
of a schools students not use the federal aid program and not 
granting financial aid that exceeds the tuition amount

uganda for over a halfcentury crossed into their homeland and 
attacked several villages state radio uganda said tuesday

unfortunate the raid occured when the two government were seeking a 
solution to the refugees continued stay in uganda

to go back to rwanda but these people could not wait for the 
outcome bahunga said

a colombian convicted of funneling cocaine 
profits into a 32 million global money laundering case was 
sentenced tuesday to more than 12 years in prison 
gonzalo mora jr was considered a key player in a complex ring 
involving the bank of credit and commerce international and six men 
associated with it one was manuel noriegas onetime personal 
banker 
everybody had a role to play said assistant us attorney 
mark jackowski mr moras role was to secure the funds to be 
laundered he controlled the pickups of cash 
mora who pleaded guilty in january to money laundering 
conspiracy and 33 specific money laundering acts was sentenced to 
12 years and seven months in prison to be followed by three years 
probation 
for stupid errors i have committed i see myself separated 
from my home and my family a tearyeyed mora told the judge i 
ask for your mercy and leniency 
us district judge william terrell hodges said he would credit 
mora for the two years he has already spent behind bars 
although mora also pleaded guilty to drug trafficking which 
carries a possible life sentence the judge agreed to dismiss that 
charge as he did with the other defendants since there was little 
evidence to support it 
prosecutors portrayed mora as a launderer with ties to the 
medellin cartel who organized pickups of cocaine profits from the 
streets of us cities and funneled them from smugglers to 
undercover agents posing as highstakes launderers 
mora 35 and the other defendants were accused of scheming to 
use fake corporations and complex wire transfers to launder 14 
million during the twoyear investigation the government said 
some 32 million in drug profits was processed 
defense attorney joel rosenthal argued that mora was nothing 
more than a smalltime journeyman money washer used as a pawn 
in the governments undercover operation 
government agents sought him out took advantage of him and 
set him up in this scheme rosenthal said adding that other 
defendants in the case heaped their wrongdoing on mora 
a sixmonth trial ended in july with five former bcci bankers 
and a colombian businessman convicted of conspiracy and various 
money laundering charges 
among the defendants was amjad awan miamibased assistant 
director of bccis latin american division who once told a us 
senate committee that he was noriegas personal banker and 
controlled some 25 million the fallen panamanian leader kept at 
bcci banks 
when sentenced nov 30 awan and the others face between 10 and 
30 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines 
before the trial began in january two divisions of the 
luxembourgbased bcci pleaded guilty to participating in the money 
laundering conspiracy and agreed to the biggest penalty ever 
slapped against a bank 
bcci one of the worlds largest financial institutions with 72 
offices worldwide forfeited 14 million it was accused of helping 
to launder plus another 1 million in interest 
in addition to the hefty fine bcci was put on five years 
probation under the federal reserve system and agreed to open the 
books to prosecutors investigating noriega

snipers fired at pedestrians tuesday as 
church bells tolled along the death river for at least 30 
supporters of rebel christian gen michel aoun who were killed 
during a candlelight march 
aoun and rival christian warlord samir geagea blamed each other 
for the sniper attacks and the slaying monday of demonstrators 
protesting a government blockade keeping food and other supplies 
from entering aounheld territory 
aoun said geagea and his lebanese forces militia were 
responsible for the horrific massacre and said president elias 
hrawis government was equally responsible 
geagea however accused aoun of engineering the bloodbath among 
his own supporters to win international sympathy 
at least 22 of those killed were shot and some others were 
trampled to death by frightened crowds said a police spokesman who 
requested anonymity at least 100 people were wounded in the 
gunfire 
snipers firing at pedestrians in the same spot of mondays 
carnage killed at least one civilian and wounded four police 
reported 
papal nuncio pablo puente issued a radio appeal to aoun and 
hrawi for a temporary truce pending a vatican effort to negotiate a 
compromise 
i ask for a 48hour respite to be able to meet the president 
and the general to mediate an accord which might not be ideal but 
will probably halt this deadly destructive madness puente said 
following puentes plea aoun proposed forming a national unity 
government to hold free general elections disband all militias 
and normalize conditions in lebanon 
we give the papal nuncio the 48 hours he requested our 
doors are open let him come forth and do what he wants aoun 
said 
there was no direct response from hrawi but a statement issued 
by his cabinet said the government remains determined to pursue 
efforts to smother gen aouns mutiny 
hrawi aoun and geagea are maronite catholics which has 
allegiance to the vatican and has dominated power in lebanon since 
independence from france in 1943 
the shootings on the demonstrators occurred on a highway bridge 
spanning nahr almaut or death river five miles north of beirut 
about 5000 aoun supporters gathered to protest hrawis weeklong 
blockade of gateways into aouns enclave home for 150000 
chrisians the government troops hope to pressure aoun and his 
15000 mainly christian soldiers into surrender 
in a radio address to the army aoun appealed for an uprising to 
overthrow hrawis government 
they call us mutineers you and i pride ourselves for 
rebelling against a government that starves its own people and 
squanders state wealth aoun said in the 10minute speech 
aoun and geagea fought a fourmonth war this year for mastery of 
the christian enclave that covers 310 square miles orth of beirut 
by police count 1046 people were killed and 2799 wounded in 
that confronation that left aoun and his troops trapped in parts of 
east beirut and the adjoining metn mountains with no air or sea 
outlets 
geageas 6000strong militia which gained control of more than 
80 percent of the christian area has joined with hrawi elected 
president by parliament nov 24 
aoun has rejected hrawis presidency 
syria has 40000 troops controlling 70 percent of lebanon under 
a 1976 mandate from the arab league to end the moslemchristian 
civil war now in its 16th year

a longfestering feud between the worlds two 
best chess players both from the soviet union has erupted on 
american soil theres more at stake than pride and 3 million in 
prizes 
garri kasparov 27 ended anatoly karpovs 10year world chess 
reign in 1985 on monday karpov 39 will try to wrest it back as 
the two meet for the first time in three years 
they warmed up for the battle at a news conference tuesday 
exchanging verbal jabs over the politics of chess and their nation 
kasparov founder of a democratic political party said he will 
play under the flag of the russian republic not the soviet union 
karpov often has been quoted as saying i have two loves 
communism and chess 
karpov represents the power authorities kasparov said in an 
interview published monday he was brezhnevs boy when brezhnev 
was in power and now is gorbachevs boy when gorbachev is in 
power 
i am indifferent under which flag he wants to play 
karpov replied tuesday insisting that his beliefs are independent 
of any party or leader probably somebody will try to make 
politics of this i came here to play chess 
years ago a chess analyst likened kasparovs agile bold 
demeanor to the dancer mikhail baryshnikov and karpovs 
methodical rigid style to former soviet leader leonid brezhnev 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals a brutal 
intellectual battle kasparov said but in my case with 
karpov its a fight between two different mentalities in russia i 
identify him with the system ive been fighting 
the two are as different in personality as they are in political 
leanings 
kasparov who beat deep thought a chessplaying computer 
in new york last january is talkative flamboyant and fluent in 
english a media darling who tirelessly publicizes chess 
karpov often is portrayed as a colorless introvert who tunes out 
the audience while playing with surgical precision but on tuesday 
he fluctuated between shy and outgoing he even hammed it up once 
presenting a copy of his book to kasparov 
i consider for this match the situation is very karpov 
said through an interpreter who couldnt think of the right word 
in english to finish his sentence 
unusual karpov interjected in english prompting laughter 
and applause 
kasparov won the world championship in 1985 and defended it 
against karpov in 1986 in 1987 their championship match ended in 
a tie under the rules kasparov retained his title 
the latest match will comprise 12 games in new york and 12 games 
in lyon france the latter beginning nov 24 
the winner will receive 17 million and the loser 13 million 
kasparov said his earnings will fund my private interests and the 
political interests of the world karpov said he will help 
victims of the chernobyl nuclear plant fire and promote chess in 
schools 
despite his outer confidence kasparov conceded that hes 
nervous 
its like a new mountain he said you have to climb this 
mountain you presume you will win if you lose its very 
painful 
he equates chess with creativity decisiveness and even athletic 
ability 
i can analyze a situation and find a solution with a minimum 
of information he said i think i have a strong will to fight 
very often youre dealing with your intuition 
kasparov a prolific author also plays soccer and tennis 
swims bicycles and jogs karpov favors billiards cards and brisk 
walks 
i believe its my brains rest if i do something else apart 
from chess said kasparov 
now back to the juicy stuff its written often that they 
despise each other how theyre asked do they really feel 
long pause nervous smiles 
they need an answer or what replied karpov 
do the yankees like the red sox offered kasparov

iraqi authorities have slowed processing of exit 
visas for some of the 5000 soviet workers caught there including 
870 oil workers and 372 builders of a thermal power station near 
baghdad a foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday 
spokesman yuri gremitskikh told a regular news briefing that 
iraq has promised to let all the soviets leave but an increasing 
number have asked to accelerate their return

been evacuated since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 but 5174 
remain that includes about 150 military experts training iraqi 
soldiers how to use and maintain sovietbuilt weapons 
regrettably the iraqi authorities clearly show tardiness in 
considering the documents submitted by the soviet side to issue an 
exit permit for several groups of specialists gremitskikh said 
he said iraqi authorities have been withholding for one week 
exit visas for 870 oilmen working in southern iraq and 372 workers 
at the yusifia thermal power station near the capital city 
it is a genuine concern he said more and more 
specialists demand that they be evacuated

a judge tuesday ordered striking temple 
university professors to return to their classrooms saying their 
29day walkout threatened the nations most precious commodity 
education 
union leaders appealed the ruling to state commonwealth court 
common pleas judge samuel lehrer said the strike by members of 
the temple association of university professionals damaged the 
education of some 29000 students and also harmed the public the 
walkout began sept 4 the first day of classes 
education is vital to the health safety and welfare of this 
nation and this community said lehrer who ordered the faculty 
to return wednesday 
temple had threatened to cancel 1900 of its 4700 classes that 
havent met since the strike began leaving 6000 students without 
any classes and 23000 others minus one or more classes union 
officials estimated that about 600 members joined the strike 
the union which represents 1100 teachers librarians and other 
academic professionals were meeting tuesday afternoon to decide 
whether to defy the order 
the strike is going to continue until our members decide to 
end it the associations president arthur hochner said before 
the meeting 
lehrer ordered the union officers defendants in the lawsuit 
filed by the university to make no statements or encourage any 
person to violate this order 
the judge said his decision was a tremendous responsibility 
but necessary in promoting safeguarding and nurturing our most 
precious commodity education 
temple lawyer john langel said he was pleased with the judges 
decision but dispeased theyd rather appeal than negotiate 
lehrer also ordered both sides to resume negotiations 
the university has told striking teachers that they will not be 
paid for the fall semester if they do not return to work it also 
had planned to cancel those classes tuesday the cancellation was 
delayed a day by the judges order so strikers could obey the 
injunction 
about 1500 of the private universitys students have withdrawn 
because of the strike there have been student rallies and sitins 
on campus 
the union on sunday rejected the universitys latest offer 
which included a 5 percent salary hike in a fouryear contract it 
also would have required members to contribute 260 a year toward 
health insurance 
the professors whose salaries average about 45500 want 7 
percent raises and do not want to pay for health care 
temple put its last offer into effect for those on the job 
prompting the union to file an unfair labor practice with the state 
labor board

lithuania and the soviet union agreed tuesday to 
conduct their economic and trade relations for 1991 as equal 
partners in a further stride toward independence for the baltic 
republic 
the first step has been taken and it was a major step and we 
did not lose our bearings lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis told a news conference after the kremlin meeting 
the talks headed on the soviet side by prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov were the first at such a high level since lithuania 
suspended its march 11 declaration of independence following the 
kremlins economic embargo against the republic 
a communique issued afterward also mentioned preparations for 
future negotiations that is a significant concession by the 
soviet side because president mikhail s gorbachev has maintained 
bilateral negotiations can occur only between two nations and 
not between the kremlin and a republic 
asked whether the kremlin has changed its view on independence 
for lithuania and is now willing to negotiate landsbergis replied 
wed like to think it is so yet further meetings will show if it 
really is so 
on the lithuanian side the communique said the republic will 
discuss addressing the opinions of various groups of residents 
a reference to the interests of the large russian population of 
the baltic republic who oppose independence the kremlin has 
alleged that lithuanias russian population has been the object of 
discrimination during the republics independence drive 
according to the communique the delegations agreed that their 
further activities will be conducted according to bilateral trade 
and economic relations for the year 1991 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene explained the 
agreement would mean closer economic cooperation with the 
soviet union based on more of a partnership principle rather than 
the previous practice of a republics rigid subordination to the 
central government 
the content of lithuanias trade agreements with the soviet 
union will depend on what functions the other republics delegate to 
the central government she said 
this does not mean that the lithuanian republic will delegate 
any functions of the governing of its economy to the soviet 
union she said and it does not mean that lithuania is going 
to sign the union treaty or be a part of the soviet economy 
the union treaty which is still being negotiated will define 
the relationship between the kremlin and the republics gorbachev 
has proposed a loose confederation with strong economic links but 
republics such as the baltics who are seeking independence say it 
does not go far enough 
the agreement reached tuesday would not affect any other 
bilateral pacts lithuania has struck with any of the other 14 
soviet republics she said 
mrs prunskiene said experts would soon begin work on 
lithuanias economic cooperation with the soviet union in 1991 in 
matters of foreign economic trade customs and tariffs and other 
issues 
landsbergis who led the republics delegation said that 
although the fourhour kremlin meeting was 100 times better than 
could be reflected in the communique he did not foresee rapid 
political independence 
probably well have to cover a long path of other such 
meetings before we can commence official negotiations and sign an 
appropriate protocol landsbergis said 
the agreement might not meet with universal approval in 
lithuania where sentiment is strong for complete independence one 
western diplomatic expert said 
moscow hopes it if it gets an agreement without territorial 
concessions it will be to its advantage said the diplomat 
speaking on condition he not be further identified 
but mrs prunskiene and landsbergis feel the negotiations 
convey legitimacy to the republics independence declaration of 
march 11 he said 
when mrs prunskiene and landsbergis report back to the 
proindependence lithuanian parliament they can expect reaction 
divided into three camps he said 
the most sympathetic group of lithuanian lawmakers believes in 
a stepbystep process and that an agreement for bilateral 
economic cooperation is useful and lends momentum for further 
negotiations 
the middle camp believes in the necessity for a political 
agreement but is generally sympathetic to the economic talks 
the third group the most radical says dont negotiate at 
all the soviet union is falling apart and all we have to do is 
wait 
lithuania and the soviet union agreed to set up a working group 
headed by soviet deputy prime minister vitaly doguzhiyev and 
lithuanian deputy prime minister romualdas ozolas who will draft 
proposals in two weeks to prepare for official negotiations the 
communique said 
the soviet union also agreed to increase pension payments to 
world war ii veterans in lithuania as of oct 1 he said 
commenting on the reunification of germany and its meaning for 
the baltic republics which were annexed by the soviet union 
following a secret pact between josef stalin and adolf hitler 
landsbergis said we hope that our independence also the 
independence of latvia and estonia would be the last steps of the 
second world war

the fivenation west african army sent 
to enforce peace in liberia attacked rebel forces led by charles 
taylor on tuesday and forced them to retreat toward this capital 
citys eastern suburbs 
the french news agency agence francepress quoted taylors 
rebels as saying their forces were pushed back nearly four miles 
and that the guerrilla army was threatened with encirclement 
task force soldiers advanced behind a barrage of heavy 
artillery backed by government troops and by a rival rebel faction 
under prince johnson who broke with taylor last february 
the force began the twopronged offensive monday night after 
taylors rebels attacked johnsons fighters and lobbed rockets at 
remnants of slain president samuel does army holed up in his 
presidential mansion 
the multinational army joined by does soldiers forced the 
rebels back from strategic positions near the mansion starting a 
retreat 
to the north of besieged monrovia task force soldiers were led 
across swamps by johnson rebels for an attack in which they seized 
taylors front line facing monrovia port the west african army has 
its headquarters in the port 
hundreds of civilians fled fighting that followed a weeklong 
ceasefire called by taylor 
the 5000member task force is the strongest in monrovia armed 
with fighterbombers tanks and armored cars johnson has pressed 
the force to take action saying he would launch an allout assault 
on the forces of taylor and doe unless it intervened 
similar threats led the task force to evacuate about 1000 
people from does mansion after johnsons men killed doe on sept 
10 
the economic community of west african states sent soldiers from 
nigeria ghana guinea gambia and sierra leone to monrovia on aug 
24 to enforce a truce in the civil and tribal war in which at 
least 5000 civilians have been killed 
refugees said in lagos nigeria that rebels from both factions 
in monrovia are merciless and seem to enjoy murdering civilians 
they said people in the capital are dying of starvation while 
others are slaughtered without reason 
george matey 28 of ghana said i have never seen human 
beings being killed as they are being killed in liberia they were 
just slashing peoples throats and it was fun to them all the 
streets were littered with bodies 
matey was among 7000 hungry and penniless nationals of nigeria 
ghana guinea and liberia who arrived monday from monrovia aboard 
the nigerian cargo ship river majidun 
an additional 10000 refugees mainly ghanaians and nigerians 
left monrovia by sea monday headed for takoradi in ghana and 
lagos 
task force soldiers initially said their role ruled out taking 
the offensive to the extent they did not fire a shot when johnson 
captured and wounded doe in a surprise attack on the west african 
forces headquarters 
johnsons men nightly watch a film of does last tortured hours 
the french newspaper liberation reported tuesday 
its africa editor stephen smith wrote he was among guests 
invited to view scenes bristling with horror blood clots 
from the torture zoom shots of a face disfigured by fear an 
anguished gaping grin twisted onto a mouth murmuring pitiable 
calls for mercy 
many in the audience had seen the film before and called for the 
operator to hurry over boring episodes smith wrote 
doe died at about 330 am on sept 10 and for two weeks his 
body was on display before it was taken to johnsons headquarters 
according to the film 
my men threw it in a hole back there behind the house 
smith quoted johnson as telling him 
johnson and does officers support a west african plan to impose 
a ceasefire and install an interim government of noncombatants to 
organize fair elections in this west african nation of more than 
17 million people 
taylor has opposed the transitional administration and declared 
himself president 
nigerian brig gen joshua dogonyaro the new task force 
commander asked the united states to persuade taylor to agree to 
talks a task force statement said tuesday it said dogonyaro made 
the appeal when he called on us ambassador peter de vos last 
friday 
de vos told reporters tuesday the united states was continuing 
its role of passing messages between the warring sides but would 
not otherwise intervene

neither rain nor sleet nor hail should 
keep the postman from delivering the mail and now not even traffic 
since the us postal service started using the rail 
traffic is so congested along a portion of interstate 880 that 
the postal service is moving its overnight express mail on the bay 
area rapid transit system 
the mail was transported on bart from fremont to the west 
oakland mailsorting center on a trial basis last month said 
spokesman dan demiglio 
the 25mile stretch of roadway takes 45 minutes to travel in 
typical commuter traffic and can take twice that on a bad day 
according to the california highway patrol 
the trip on bart averages 41 minutes 
although the postal service hadnt yet missed an overnight 
delivery a quality control team started to worry that the heavy 
traffic would cause problems demiglio said tuesday 
several hundred pieces of mail are moved on bart each day 
demiglio called the rail service an incredibly reliable system 
that helps reduce pollution in addition he said the postal worker 
who moves the mail is far less likely to be involved in an accident 
on bart

state house minority leader william r strong 
is running against his uncle but neither candidate is pulling any 
punches 
i love him but what am i supposed to do strong a 
republican said of his democratic opponent pearl strong 
the incumbents radio advertisements portray pearl strong a 
former state reresentative himself as a taxraising pawn of the 
frankfort democratic establishment 
the elder strong 68 describes his nephew as a political 
careerist who has turned his back on the mountains and their needs 
uncle pearl refuses to debate me on the issues begins one 
william strong ad maybe hes afraid because he knows the people 
dont approve of his past record which is why he lost the 1986 
primary by nearly 500 votes 
im sorry little bill pearl strong responds in another 
ad you have been debating for four years in frankfort and the 
people in the 39th district have not seen anything yet 
pearl strong said he decided to run because he thought his 
nephew was giving up the seat the elder strong who served as 
state representative from 1985 to 1986 and state senator from 1968 
to 1971 said he thought it would be best to keep the seat in the 
family 
but the younger strong 47 denies ever giving his uncle the 
impression that he would not run 
the campaign has already driven a wedge between the two 
until this fall the uncle used to stop by william strongs 
insurance office in hazard for a daily chat now he mails his 
insurance payments from his home 
william strong says nasty things about his uncle in his ads but 
when it comes to questions about their past he turns into the 
teenager who used to play baseball with his uncle in the former 
coal camp of darfork 
oh god yeah said william strong reminiscing that 
stuff was great that has nothing to do with this race 
what does he said is his opposition to tax increases and his 
uncles support of them 
the elder strong said his nephews vote against the 13 billion 
schoolreform tax increase cost the district several million 
dollars in state projects 
pearl strong said his nephews vote was in exchange for the 
republican leaderships support of an eventual bid for lieutenant 
governor william strong denies any deal was made 
but both men said that after november the election wont come 
between them no matter who wins 
when i played baseball everybody in a different uniform was 
my enemy until the game was over said pearl strong then we 
were friends

it may be the revenge of the nerds but four 
people suing a chic nightclub because they were allegedly denied 
admittance for not wearing trendy togs would prefer to think of it 
as justice for all 
the four argued tuesday in small claims court that they were 
rejected by a doorman at the mayan a former porno theater lately 
reopened as a club in a manner that violated state civil rights 
law they want damages of 250 apiece 
i think we were met at the door by a flippant and arrogant 
doorman plaintiff jeff stolzer told the court they just 
looked you over like you were scum 
municipal court commissioner diana wheatley took the case under 
advisement and said she would issue a ruling later 
sammy chao president of the company that owns the mayan denied 
discrimination and asserted that doormen choose from the crowd at 
the entrance to keep out troublemakers he denied there was a dress 
code 
the plaintiffs claim the problem is that the decisions are 
arbitrary if there had been a posted dress code they argued they 
would have been able to comply 
the plaintiffs are kenneth lipton 36 a personal injury lawyer 
specializing in dog bites tess dubrall 34 an accounting manager 
stephen ambrosini 33 an accountant and stolzer 35 who runs a 
termite company 
all waited in vain to get in the club when they tried to 
rendezvous there on may 19 
the san fernando valley residents claim a violation of the unruh 
civil rights act a state law passed in 1959 to end discrimination 
by businesses 
the commissioner was mostly interested in the mechanics of the 
entry process which was described as the doorman choosing from the 
crowd 
the places i go you can just walk in the commissioner 
remarked obviously this is a more popular spot 
chao said he hires doormen sensitive enough to see through a 
person and screen out people who are intoxicated dangerous or 
appear to have a dangerous attitude 
he said there was no discrimination on the basis of race or sex 
but that the number of people who could get in was limited for 
safety additionally room must be saved for private parties and 
people with reservations he said 
its not disneyland he said we have a limited time to 
provide the service if we run a firstcome firstserve we 
will soon be filled 
he also said the club was in a bad area it is not a 
particularly safe environment he said if a bum shows up 
youre not going to let him in 
the owner of vertigo another club came as an interested 
spectator 
jim colachis club is facing action by the state alcoholic 
beverage control department because its undercover officers were 
denied entry the abc has recommended a 30day suspension of its 
liquor license a hearing is pending 
colachis said his club never set out to be egalitarian and if 
it was firstcome firstserved loyal customers would be treated 
unfairly 
the state inspectors were not dressed properly he said 
it might have been nice for the beach but i dont think it 
would be appropriate for president reagans home or my 
establishment i want to encourage anything but mediocrity he 
said havent we become casual enough in america

eighteen demonstrators were arrested tuesday 
when they blocked traffic on a busy street to protest rules they 
say unfairly deny disability benefits to many women infected with 
the aids virus 
the aids activists said the social security administration in 
determining eligibility for disability benefits is ignoring many 
of the diseases and infections that are common in women infected 
with the virus 
the result is that many women with disabling conditions 
including gynecological disorders like pelvic inflammatory disease 
and chronic vaginal infections are denied benefits the protesters 
said 
these disorders are not on a list of infections and diseases 
used by the centers for disease control to define aids much of the 
list was compiled in the early days of the epidemic when most aids 
victims were white middleclass homosexual men 
but this definition misses the ailments and conditions common to 
women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which 
causes aids the activists said 
its time they stopped denying women said phyllis sharpe 
39 of new york who marched in the demonstration led by the aids 
coalition to unleash power known as act up 
sharpe who is infected with hiv and suffers from diarrhea 
shortness of breath and chronic vaginal infections is also one of 
several plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in new york monday on behalf 
of people disabled by hiv but denied disability benefits 
in addition to women others with hiv children drug addicts 
and poor people also have been unable to get benefits despite 
repeated hospitalizations for diseases not on cdcs list such as 
tuberculosis heart infections and kidney failure the lawsuit 
says 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king said officials 
awarding disability benefits are not limited by the cdc definition 
of aids 
officials can award up to three months of supplemental security 
income payments immediately upon request to people who have any of 
the aidsrelated conditions on cdcs list pending a final decision 
on the claim she said 
but social security officials also can and do give this 
threemonth presumptive disability status to people who are sick 
with hiv infection but have not progressed into aids she said in a 
statement 
we recognize our responsibility to continue to revise our 
procedures seek broader flexibilit improve our guidelines and 
instructions to insure that we and the state disability 
determination services eliminate all artificial barriers to 
assistance king said 
about 100 aids activists marched outside the department of 
health and human services headquarters building near capitol hill 
chanting slogans such as how many women have to die before you 
say they qualify and health care is a right not just for the 
male and white 
police arrested 12 men and six women who blocked traffic on 
independence avenue and 3rd street near the us capitol 
they were charged with demonstrating without a permit and 
obstructing traffic on capitol grounds

the mayor proposed a 18 billion battle plan 
against fear tuesday asserting that his plan to confront street 
and subway crime with nearly 8000 new police officers would 
reclaim the city from criminals 
but footing the bill for the safe streets safe city program 
would mean a hike in property taxes a payroll tax and a 25cent 
surcharge on lottery tickets sold in the city mayor david dinkins 
said 
we will flood the streets with an army of police officers 
our war against fear will return peace to our communities leaving 
us with safe streets in a safe city dinkins said in a city hall 
speech 
the plan follows a summer of bad publicity and stinging 
criticism about the citys escalating violence if approved it 
would put the most officers on the force in the citys history 
among the more noteworthy cases were a number of children hit by 
stray bullets the zodiac gunman who apparently picked his victims 
by birthdates repeated killings of cab drivers the killing of a 
prosecutor near the bronx courthouse and the fatal stabbing of a 
tourist who was defending his mother during a subway mugging 
the proposal would need approval from the city council and the 
state legislature in albany republican opposition threatened the 
payroll tax part of the package which would apply to outoftown 
commuters who work in the city as well as residents 
assembly speaker mel miller said he had some doubts about the 
constitutionality of the proposed surcharge on lottery tickets 
if given the legislative goahead the plan would not kick in 
for at least another six months while potential new police officers 
were trained and with the police academy operating at top volume 
it would take 18 months to get the proposed 7931 new officers 
walking a beat or riding a subway car 
key elements of the dinkins proposal include 2950 new jail beds 
at rikers island 420 million for educational programs to prevent 
pupils from dropping out and turning to crime assignment of a cop 
to every train at night and a 54 percent increase in the number of 
police on patrol each day 
fear is the ugliest of emotions dinkins said unchecked 
it may become the greatest criminal of all 
the plan would mean more cops walking beats dinkins wants the 
hiring of 1626 civilians to free officers from desk duty 
elimination of certain units and assignment of other agencies to 
certain emergencies such as heart attacks 
the plan calls for a property tax hike that would cost the 
average single family homeowner 20 more per year and a payroll 
tax that would cost a taxpayer who earned 50000 annually about 1 
per week the first year and 150 the next

state energy officials and industry 
representatives were told tuesday there are adequate supplies of 
heating oil for this winter but some worried about possible 
shortages if there is a glitch in the system or increased tensions 
in the mideast 
we dont think there is going to be a supply problem this 
winter calvin kemp director of the energy information 
administration said at a conference on this winters fuel outlook 
but kemp and other energy department officials cautioned that 
the supply picture could change if there are additional 
interruptions of crude oil supplies or a major problem at a 
refinery 
we see very very tight refinery capacity which leaves you 
vulnerable if a refinery should go down for some reason kemp 
said 
kemp and industry experts said that the supply of propane 
continues to be precarious because of demands for the fuel from the 
petrochemical industry and supply problems that could develop 
during the winter 
lawrence goldstein president of the petroleum industry research 
foundation which sponsored the conference also acknowledged the 
potential for heating oil supply problems 
the sytem is in a very tenuous balance were betting that 
everything that can go right will go right goldstein said at a 
news conference 
many of the scores of participants in the forum including state 
energy officials and heating oil retailers expressed worry about 
what might happen if there are problems at refineries or if oil 
supplies are further disrupted because of a flareup in the persian 
gulf 
we assume the system will work perfectly under the stress that 
it has been under and were just worried about a stressedout 
system not working charles guinn of the new york energy office 
said during a break in the proceedings 
george sterzinger of the vermont energy office said there is 
concern that if president bush draws on the strategic petroleum 
reserve some regions needing oil the most might not get it 
many of the state officials sought clarification from energy 
department officials on what the federal government might do to 
assure adequate supplies should a shooting war erupt in the middle 
east 
in a worst case scenario said julian wright deputy 
assistant secretary for energy emergencies oil would be drawn from 
the petroleum reserve and both the federal government and states 
would be expected to impose very strong conservation measures 
wright did not elaborate on what measures might be needed but 
he and other federal officials as well as most industry 
representatives rejected the possibility of either price controls 
or an allocation of supplies 
although crude oil prices have edged to within 40 a barrel in 
recent days industry experts said that much higher prices can be 
expected if hostilities erupt in the persian gulf 
if theres a shooting war prices would go up substantially 
said john lichtblau chairman of the petroleum industry research 
foundation he said he would not be surprises at prices in the 
60abarrel range and noted that some estimates have been as high 
as 100 a barrel 
it would depend how long a war would last and if saudi oil 
installations were damaged said lichtblau

the environmental protection agency fails to 
monitor the effectiveness of disinfectants and up to 20 percent of 
the products sold to kill diseasecausing germs may not work a 
government study says 
in a report released to congress on tuesday the general 
accounting office said the epa has not inspected the majority of 
laboratories that test disinfectants and that the agency lacks 
assurance methods to prove the germkillers are valid 
epas policy of let the buyer beware for disinfectants may 
be compromising public health and wasting consumer dollars the 
gaos richard l hembra said in a statement released with the 
report 
the gao report said estimates by the epas own experts are that 
an estimated 20 percent of all disinfectants fail to kill germs or 
viruses as they are supposed to and that tests in some states show 
that more than 40 percent of the compounds are ineffective 
americans spend about 1 billion a year on disinfectants to kill 
diseasekilling germs sterilize food preparation areas surgical 
tools and bathrooms and prevent infectious disease there are about 
4100 such products registered by the government 
the epa is directed by law to register disinfectants and to 
assure that they are effective but the gao said the agency depends 
on test data submitted by manufacturers and that the epa lacks 
assurance that the test methods and performance standards used 
are valid 
the report said it found the epa had inspected only a small 
percentage of the labs that test disinfectants and in factwas 
aware of only 12 of the 92 labs that had performed these studies 
after labs have been inspected the study said it takes the epa 
from five months to more than 2 years to process the reports 
even the methods of conducting disinfectant tests the report 
said are uncertain 
almost all of the eparecommended efficacy test methods and 
performance standards have been embroiled in scientific controversy 
for over a decade the report said the agency has done little to 
resolve these uncertainties and it inadequately managed a 
384000 study of the issue at the university of north carolina 
anne lindsay te epa official who supervises the disinfectant 
registration said her agency has monitored labs that do about 40 
percent of the testing she also said the agency is developing a 
reenforcement strategy to assure that manufacturers accurately 
report test data 
the gao report said that from 1977 to 1982 the epas own lab 
found that 42 percent of all disinfectant samples failed efficacy 
tests in 1982 the agency closed its lab and since then the epa has 
depended on industry selftesting lindsay said only one 
manufacturer has reported a batch of disinfectant that failed to 
pass the tests 
she said the epa generally agreed with the issues raised in 
the gao report and is attempting to improve the system

president bush urged top math and science 
teachers tuesday to take children lift them up inspire them 
broaden their horizons and aim them toward careers as scientists 
and engineers 
you discovered how to bring out the fun in science bush 
told 107 elementary teachers who gathered in the rose garden after 
receiving presidential awards for excellence in science and 
mathematics teaching you provide a model and an inspiration for 
elementary teachers everywhere 
youre also helping to meet a crucial national need said 
bush noting that three of the national education goals involve 
boosting student achievement in math and science by the year 2000 
statistics show that by 1995 eight of the 10 fastest growing 
professions will be based on science skills in mathematics and a 
college education will be needed for a majority of the 21 million 
new jobs created by the us economy by the year 2000 says the 
national research council 
by the year 2010 us industry will face a shortage of 560000 
scientists and engineers other statistics show 
for many students you represent their very first exposure to 
science and math which gives you a vital responsibility bush 
continued most kids who go on to become scientists or engineers 
first became interested in those subjects in elementary school or 
junior high most often the reason they do is because they become 
exposed to a teacher like you 
you are able to take children and lift them up inspire them 
and broaden their horizons and aim them he said 
the presidential awards program sponsored by the national 
science foundation and managed by the national science teachers 
association began eight years ago each teacher receives a 7500 
grant 
elementary teachers are included for the first time this year in 
the program middle and senior high school science and mathematics 
teachers will be honored in midoctober

the soviet union claimed some of the credit 
tuesday for german unification and said it hopes the merger will 
bring prosperity peace and stability to the former adversaries and 
europe as a whole 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev said profound internal 
democratic changes in the soviet union and east germany set the 
foundation for unification 
at a news briefing foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
said german unification took place not in the least as a result 
of many changes initiated largely by perestroika in the soviet 
union the unification of germany took place according to the 
aspirations of the german people taking into consideration 
legitimate interests of other states 
the soviet union initially balked at the idea of a united 
germany being part of the north atlantic treaty organization 
gorbachev and west german chancellor helmut kohl agreed this 
summer to eliminate nuclear missiles and weapons capable of 
carrying nuclear warheads from east germany 
west germany also promised to arrange longterm financial aid to 
help rebuild the soviet economy as well as generous payments to 
cover the withdrawal of red army troops in east germany 
the agreements paved the way for east and west germany and the 
four victorious world war ii allies to sign a treaty in moscow on 
sept 12 signifying there were no external obstacles to 
unification 
in a message tuesday to kohl and president richard von 
weizsaecker gorbachev congratulated the leaders and the german 
people on unification which he described as a great event the 
tass news agency reported 
unification could not have taken place if there had not been 
profound internal democratic changes in our countries if the right 
conclusions from the tragedy of the most horrible war had not been 
reflected in real life tass quoted the message as saying 
on this remarkable day i want to pay tribute to all those in 
my country and in your country who overcoming sorrows remembering 
losses and honoring the dead did not yield to prejudice and fears 
but persistently worked for the future making this peaceful and 
worthy solution of the german issue possible it said 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the treaty provides 
adequate guarantees for soviet security by limiting the size of 
germanys army forbidding offensive nuclear weapons on german 
soil forfeiting any german claims to territory it lost during 
world war ii and banning any revival of nazism 
thus an end has been put to the past and the ground has been 
laid for germanys future gremitskikh said tuesday let us 
hope that the german unification will be an integral part of 
european development 
gremitskikh said the soviet union and the united germany will 
enter a new phase of relations which we are hopeful will bring to 
both peoples and to the entire community a prosperous peace 
stability and well being 
tass noted some soviets are wary of a united germany but it put 
that concern in a new light 
there are quite a few people in the soviet union who feel 
bitterness about the loss of an ally the gdr but this is the 
choice of citizens of the gdr tass said 
we believe that we are not losing our ally but gaining a 
friend the news agency said

floridas only historically black 
public university will get 350000 from a subsidiary of british 
petroleum co a company that does business in south africa 
frederick humphries president of florida aampm university 
defended the gift tuesday saying the school was abiding by the 
same standards as other schools 
thirty schools applied for the grants which will mostly go to 
provide scholarships for minority engineering students florida aampm 
was one of four schools that got the 350000 grants 
the other schools were tuskegee university in alabama north 
carolina aampt state university two other historically black 
schools the fourth school was ohio state 
charles taylor a spokesman for clevelandbased bp america inc 
said he saw no contradiction in his company making donations to 
encourage minority education in the united states while its parent 
company does business in south africa 
we have had a long interest in what transpires in south 
africa taylor said from cleveland we share with all of the 
opponents of apartheid an abhorrence of that system and we have 
been aggressively opposing that system 
i wish that all american companies would get out of south 
africa humphries said but some do and some dont 
humphries said londonheadquartered bp co abides by the 
sullivan principles a code of ethics established in 1977 by a 
philadelphia minister who has now backed away from the guidelines 
as inadequate to dismantling apartheid 
the sullivan principles called on companies operating in south 
africa to among other thingts use fair employment practices and 
to train blacks and other nonwhites for management positions 
the minimum is the sullivan code and the maximum is i wish 
they were all out humphries said 
in 1986 the us antiapartheid act banned most new investment 
by american companies in south africa and put more restrictions on 
certain industries like computers 
since south africa has no oil reserves it is dependent on 
foreign companies for oil in 1988 bp sales in south africa were 
estimated at 90 million and its assets were estimated at 400 
million said donna katzin director of south africa programs for 
the interfaith center on corporate responsibility in new york 
companies wholly owned by british petroleum in south africa 
employ some 5000 workers companies in which bp has some interest 
employ 23000 workers katzin said 
i would say that bp is right up there at the top of the list 
with other oversea corporations that do substantial and strategic 
business in south africa katzin said 
british petroleum supports education of blacks in south africa 
and works to improve living conditions taylor said 
our position is simply that we believe that we can have more 
impact inside that system than a total withdrawal from it he 
said

the senate foreign relations committee on 
tuesday unanimously approved the treaty ending the postworld war 
ii division of germany and sent it to the full senate 
the committee had hoped the senate could act before the 7 pm 
edt unification of west germany and east germany but the senate 
recessed for the evening without action 
president bush congratulated germans on the historic unification 
of their country and said that 45 years of conflict and 
confrontation between east and west are now behind us 
at long last the day has come bush said in a written 
statement germany is united germany is fully free 
the committee voted 190 in favor of the treaty signed in 
moscow last sept 12 by britain france the soviet union the 
united states and east and west germany 
after senate approval president bush was to sign the treaty on 
wednesday 
members of the committee said that even though they voted for 
the treaty they still had reservations about a united germany 
nothing should stand in the way of the treaty but these 
sentiments need to be said and we will have to watch germany 
said sen rudy boschwitz rminn who was born in berlin and fled 
nazi germany at age 2 
boschwitz noted germanys involvement in wars and the holocaust 
germany is germany from the standpoint of its history and i 
think we need to have some recognition of that fact boschwitz 
said i have a mixed emotion about seeing it get back together 
again hopefully the feelings and mentality of the people have 
changed 
sen claiborne pell dri committee chairman said he shared 
boschwitzs thoughts 
i agree with him that we should all keep our eye on how things 
progress in germany said pell whose father former rep herbert 
c pell helped prepare for the nazi war crimes trials in nuremberg 
after world war ii 
the committee turned back an attempt by sen jesse helms 
rnc to amend the treaty uniting the two germanys with a 
statement reaffirming us rejection of the soviet unions 
annexation of the baltic states 
committee members agreed however to submit a parallel 
resolution saying the same thing rather than trying to put it in 
the treaty and delaying its ratification 
the state department doesnt want this due to the fact that it 
might offend the soviet union but i dont care about that helms 
said pointing out that it simply reasserts a position held by the 
united states for 50 years 
i dont think we ought to renege now he said adding that 
the soviets have been touting the treaty as a confirmation of 
soviet jurisdiction over the baltic states of estonia lithuania 
and latvia 
pell said the administration fears the amendment might serve as 
an example to the soviet union to add its own language to the 
treaty 
sen richard lugar rind said he and other committee members 
had written the president on friday expressing concern about any 
impact the treaty might have on the baltic states 
he said the president is expected during the signing ceremonies 
on wednesday to say that nothing in the treaty alters the us 
policy of rejecting the soviet unions annexations

the president of the dartmouth review 
resigned tuesday after the conservative offcampus weekly drew fire 
for quoting hitler in its masthead on a jewish holiday 
i will not be a part of this newspaper anymore i am not an 
antisemite said c tyler white who is also a student at 
dartmouth college the newspaper is not funded by the college 
student officials of the newspaper which has previously been 
decried as sexist racist and homophobic said the quote was put in 
by an unknown staffer without the authorization or knowledge of 
editors one called it sabotage 
but white said the newspapers official response failed to 
express the staffs regret or to assume responsibility for letting 
the quote be printed 
the editorinchief has failed in his job and now we all must 
wear the albatross of antisemitism because he wont take 
responsibility for the issues contents white said in a 
statement 
he is the third of the weeklys 24 members to resign because of 
the incident 
the edition distributed saturday on yom kippur the jewish day 
of atonement and judaisms most solemn day carried a quotation 
from adolf hitlers mein kampf 
the passage inserted without attribution in the reviews 
masthead said 
therefore i believe today that i am acting in the sense of 
the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am fighting for 
the lords work 
cheers and congratulations greeted the resignations at the 
student assembly office where students stacked petitions bearing 
more than 2000 signatures and planned a protest rally thursday 
the main message were trying to get across to the nation 
and the national media is that the dartmouth review in no way 
represents the campus said brian ellner president of the 
assembly which represents 3200 undergraduates 
in a statement editorinchief kevin pritchett blamed the mess 
on a tasteless prankster 
pritchett has said staffers were investigating how the quote got 
into print 
the review attacked administrators saying it is unfair and 
wrong to confuse our arguments with what is clearly a case of 
sabotage 
college officials also condemned the weekly president james 
freedman and other top administrators were to speak at the rally 
the newspaper which has been published since 1980 with backing 
from some of the nations most prominent conservatives has been 
vilified over the years for its views on women homosexuals and 
blacks 
william cole a black music professor resigned in august after 
the review had belittled him in print for seven years 
cole said his effectiveness was compromised by the attacks he 
filed a 600000 libel suit against the newspaper that was later 
settled out of court for no money 
review staffers also were involved several years ago in a 
sledgehammer attack on shanties erected on campus as part of a 
protest against enforced segregation in south africa several 
staffers were suspended

a un childrens fund official said 
tuesday that advancing drought in sudan could kill up to 1 million 
people and donor countries have not responded to calls for help 
i think we have the makings of a major humanitarian disaster 
a bombshell disaster that hasnt caught the attention of the 
world richard reid unicefs regional director for the middle 
east and north africa said 
he said 4 million to 5 million southern sudanese are threatened 
by drought worse than that which killed more than 250000 sudanese 
in 1988 
it is probable that unless there is focused and solid and 
rapid intervention we could lose at least 250000 and it could go 
up to the estimated 1 million that died in 1984 reid warned 
with unicef as the lead agency operation lifeline sudan saved 
more than 200000 lives last year when drought gripped sudan a red 
sea nation with a population of more than 25 million this year few 
donor countries have been offering help 
unicef collected about 67 million for the 1989 relief campaign 
this year we have received practically nothing less than 5 
million reid reported 
frankly there is up to now on the part of everyone involved 
in addressing this humanitarian need a hesitancy a semiparalysis 
a disarray and a lack of focus we certainly hope that will 
change 
diplomats said privately that distaste for the military junta of 
ltgen omar hassan elbashir which seized power from the elected 
government of sadek elmahdi last year is a major reason donations 
dried up 
us laws bar foreign aid to military juntas that oust elected 
governments 
and so that assistance was lost reid said and one by 
one donors have fallen off but were faced with a situation that 
really shouldnt have political markings and that is a situation 
in which the children are going to be the most affected 
the major cropgrowing areas have had no rain for more than two 
months he said 
the drought leaves vast areas of the country without food 
people weakened by starvation lose their resistance to disease and 
die particularly children under age of 5 
a disease like measles can spread through a village like 
wildfire and you have a mortality rate of up to 20 percent the 
unicef official said 
i remember that just before we began operation lifeline 
sudan we would go into huge districts in which we couldnt find a 
trace of children under age 5 they had all died 
a civil war between the islamic government in khartoum in the 
north and the sudan peoples liberation army in the mostly 
christian and animist southern three provinces has cut off relief 
deliveries in half of sudan 
reid said railroad engineers barge boatmen and truck drivers 
were afraid to carry grain shipments through the southern provinces 
without security guarantees that relief agencies cant provide 
elbashirs takeover added to the bureaucratic problems because 
new officials were named in key ministries such as transportation 
elbashir announced a ceasefire with the spla through the end 
of the year so children can be vaccinated but he said tuesday no 
reply has come from the rebels 
he is to meet secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
wednesday to discuss the situation 
the secretariat is the organizing agency this year for operation 
lifeline sudan

people in this little farming 
village in the thuringian forest once divided by a concrete wall 
and a death strip of communist patrols and guard dogs began 
dancing into unity late tuesday on the eve of east germanys 
demise 
president bush visited moedlareuths western section while vice 
president and dubbed the village little berlin because of the 
dividing wall 
the whole village of about a dozen homes and 60 people 
celebrated german unification smack in the center of the border 
that for 45 years kept them apart more than 2000 people from 
dozens of surrounding communities and even farther away jammed the 
narrow streets as germans officially united wednesday 
those from the eastern section of moedlareuth reckoned they had 
every reason to celebrate 
my cousins lived just 100 meters 330 feet away and i wasnt 
even allowed to wave to them from here recalled rudolf richter 
a 62yearold farmer whose house overlooks the remains of the wall 
moedlareuth was divided from 1945 until november 1989 
in 1952 border fortifications were installed the mill was torn 
down to prevent its being used as a hiding place for wouldbe 
escapees to the west 
vehicle and pedestrian traffic between east and west moedlareuth 
was halted 
a concrete wall 2160 feet long was added 1966 with an 
observation tower containing guards with shoottokillorders 
eastern residents were forbidden to wave to relatives on the 
western side two brothers who lived on opposite hillsides 
sometimes gazed at each other through binoculars although that 
also was banned by the communists 
visits might be permitted once a year for elderly people less 
for others but not to eastern moedlareuth a forbidden zone for 
nonresidents including east germans 
contact was so controlled moedlareuth residents had to ride 
three hours by train to visit relatives who lived within shouting 
distance 
at least two people escaped into the west despite the border 
fortificaton there is no record of anyone being shot trying to 
flee through moedlareuth 
on tuesday night laughter peeled through the night air 
firecrackers popped and beer flowed 
a rock band was brought in for the festival which was called 
dancing into unity 
many celebrants gazed at the nearly 1000foot section that 
remains of the wall officials want to keep it as a reminder 
other revelers inspected the abandoned observation tower or 
strolled down the death strip 
its unbelievable that this could happen to a village to 
people who love one another said bernhard lerch 33 an east 
german who fled with his wife and two children to west germany last 
fall before the revolution 
asked what unity means to him lerchs son 8yearold daniel 
replied freedom thats all

the army killed 85 maoist shining path 
guerrillas in three attacks in a remote cocarich jungle region 
north of lima col juan rivero military commander for the region 
said tuesday 
he said six soldiers were wounded in the clashes thursday in the 
upper huallaga river valley 280 miles northeast of lima 
according to military reports heavy fighting in the area the

the senate on tuesday overwhelmingly approved 
a resolution praising president bushs actions in the persian gulf 
and supporting continued deployment of us troops to deter iraqi 
aggression 
but the debate leading up to the 963 vote had nervous echoes of 
25 years ago when a similar act opened the way to escalation of 
the vietnam war 
senator after senator rose to say bush could not use the 
resolution as justification for future military moves in fact 
debate seemed aimed more at stating what the document was not than 
what it was 
this resolution is not an authorization for the use of force 
now or in the future said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine this resolution is not a blank check this 
resolution is not a gulf of tonkin resolution 
in 1964 congress approved a resolution giving president johnson 
the authority to retaliate for an attack on two vessels in 
vietnams gulf of tonkin the resolution later was used as 
authorization for a widening of the us war effort 
tuesdays vote came a day after the house approved a similar 
resolution on a 38029 vote senators said they thought it was 
important to send a signal of us unity by giving legislative 
support to bushs moves so far 
voting against the measure were sens edward m kennedy 
dmass mark hatfield rore and bob kerrey dneb not voting 
was sen pete wilson rcalif 
the resolution strongly approves the presidents leadership 
in winning approval of eight resolutions in the united nations 
security council that impose a global trade embargo on iraq and 
call for the withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
it also states the congress supports continued action by the 
president in accordance with the decisions of the united nations 
security council and in accordance with united states 
constitutional and statutory processes to deter iraqi 
aggression and to protect american lives and vital interests in the 
region 
kennedy called that language a blank check endorsement for 
future actions it is in effect a tonkin gulf resolution for 
the persian gulf that abdicates congress wardeclaring power 
kennedy said he was voting against the measure because it could 
easily be used by president bush as approval in advance by 
congress of military action against iraq up to and including the 
launching of an allout war 
but mitchell said the resolution speaks only to actions already 
taken 
future actions must be judged on their own merits in view of 
the circumstances at the time he said 
the constitution makes plain that only congress can provide a 
declaration of war the president of the united states has no legal 
authority to commit the united states to war mitchell said 
the senate then will be involved in future grave decisions 
should the crisis expand and the shadow of war approach 
but sen william cohen rmaine noted there had not been a 
declaration of war since world war ii 
there was none for korea none for vietnam none for grenada 
none for panama he said 
we are somewhat in a nomansland in the persian gulf under 
the war powers act which requires presidential consultation and 
congressional assent for deployment of troops in an area of 
imminent hostilities he said 
cohen said the gulf situation in which the most massive 
military forces of iraq and a multinational force are faced off 
is clearly a situation involving imminent hostilities 
a slight miscalculation by either side could lead to war he 
said 
and sen daniel patrick moynihan dny noted the crisis 
involves the united nations a situation not envisioned by those 
who ambiguously divided up the powers to make war in the 
constitution 
but there appeared to be a broad consensus that for any military 
action that goes beyond defensive and deterrent moves bush must 
come to capitol hill 
if the president decides he must attack iraq and risk tens 
of thousands of american casualties then he must do so with the 
approval of congress in advance in specific terms kennedy 
said 
the senate resolution was a nonbinding document that would not 
need to be signed into law by the president the version the house 
approved monday is one that would need white house approval and 
would become law 
meanwhile house speaker thomas foley said a 25member 
bipartisan house delegation would leave friday for a visit to the 
persian gulf the group will be in the region three or four days to 
oversee the multinational military buildup foley dwash said in 
a statement

a minister who complained about simulated oral 
sex in an art festival puppet show said tuesday he had met with the 
puppeteer and festival officials and was satisfied future shows 
wont be open to children 
in a joint appearance with puppeteer jon ludwig and officials of 
arts festival of atlanta the rev john norton said he acted 
hastily in contacting news organizations to complain about the 
sept 21 performance of zeitgeist a show for adults that 
included puppets simulating oral sex 
my complaint was not with the performance itself but with 
unaccompanied children having access to a performance with adult 
material said the methodist minister from marietta 
patricia gann executive director of the festival said she 
appreciated nortons suggestions for the future which will 
ensure that unaccompanied children will not have access to all arts 
festival activities 
tv evangelist pat robertson fueled the controversy last week by 
complaining that the national endowment for the arts which is 
under attack by conservatives in congress had funded the show 
frankie abourjilie vice president for public relations at 
robertsons christian broadcasting network in virginia beach va 
contended tuesday that the nea funded the puppeteer directly 
through funding of the center for puppetry arts 
ms gann denied robertsons assertions 
the festival did receive money from the georgia arts council 
which itself receives nea funds but the councils grant for 
theatrical products was spent entirely on other works and none went 
to ludwigs performance she said 
festival officials said the puppet show staged as a 
surrealistic morality play for adult audiences only was 
financed entirely by ticket sales and concession receipts without 
support from any government source 
norton without mentioning robertson by name complained tuesday 
that others had misconstrued his concerns 
we do not feel it is appropriate for us to be placed in the 
position of being connected with the greater issues others have 
attempted to draw us into he said 
norton ms gann and ludwig read statements at tuesdays news 
conference but refused to answer questions

the european community will provide almost 2 
billion in aid to egypt jordan and turkey as compensation for 
economic hardships stemming from the persian gulf crisis the 
italian foreign minister said tuesday 
the cohesion and the unity in the international community is 
stronger than before gianni de michelis said about opposition to 
iraqs seizure of kuwait 
de michelis said the european community would contribute 660 
million as a group with individual members providing a total of 
132 billion for a grand 
total of 198 billion 
turkey lost substantial revenue with by the shutdown of an iraqi 
oil pipeline through its territory jordan is burdened by an influx 
of refugees and egypt with the cost of keeping troops in saudi 
arabia to deter an iraqi attack 
most of the aid will be in the form of grants and some in 
loans de michelis said the european community also would consider 
assisting countries in eastern and central europe and elsewhere 
that are beset economically 
italy is chair of the 12nation group whose foreign ministers 
approved the assistance while attending a european security 
conference meeting here to prepare for a 35nation summit in paris 
nov 1921 
the 35 ministers who attended the preparatory session condemned 
iraqs invasion and occupation of kuwait 
these actions jeopardize the just and peaceful world order to 
which more cooperative european relations are making an important 
contribution they said in a resolution introduced by the united 
states that called for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal 
from kuwait 
two tentative decisions to help egypt jordan and turkey were 
made last month 
de michelis cautioned iraqi president saddam hussein not to 
attack israel saying there would be a strong reaction from the 
international community 
it is difficult not to foresee a military reaction in that 
case he said adding that his country would participate in any 
military action against iraq approved by the un security council 
but de michelis said more time should be taken to see if the 
curbs on trade approved by the security council produce an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait 
he said he concurred with president bushs statement to the un 
general assembly on monday that a pullout could set the stage for 
addressing the arabisraeli dispute 
we cannot accept saddam husseins attempt to link the 
problems de michelis said and we cannot reward aggression and 
invasion 
but he said we have always stated the fact that there are 
problems in the region that need solutions 
he listed them without elaboration as palestinian israeli and 
lebanese problems 
saddam insists hes being singled out for harsh treatment and 
that israels retention of territory lost by defeated arab nations 
in 1967 should be taken up simultaneously with iraqs territorial 
dispute with kuwait 
de michelis said bushs approach was rational and right and 
didnt reflect more flexibility toward baghdad

amputees who wear artificial feet can sense 
the floor with a new electronic device that was developed by a 
company here and made its national debut tuesday 
the sabolich senseoffeel system was developed by john 
sabolich president of the sabolich prosthetic amp research center 
it was demonstrated on the abctv program good morning 
america 
the system uses small pressure transducers implanted in the 
artificial foot to signal electrodes in the socket of the 
prosthesis the electrodes in turn stimulate the skin of the limb 
stump and transmit sensation to the brain 
the 1400 electronic system is powered by a standard 9volt 
battery and can be used by any lowerlimb amputee sabolich said 
its the most incredible thing said holly howard an 
abovetheknee amputee from tyler texas who is one of 20 people 
testing the device so far for the first time in 10 years i can 
feel my foot and know where it is 
sabolich said the invention he first conceived of eight years 
ago might also have the potential to reduce and even eliminate 
socalled phantom pain for amputees who feel discomfort as if from 
the missing limb 
the brain really likes to have information from the floor 
sabolich said when it doesnt have information from the floor 
the nerves sort of dangle and that increases phantom pain and 
doesnt let the person know where their foot is on the ground 
dr william n harsha an oklahoma city orthopedic surgeon 
asked to comment on the system said he had not known of it 
except in the research stage and john sabolich has been in the 
forefront of that 
i would think it would be of great benefit harsha said 
it would enable the patient to know where his foot iswhen he is 
walking going up and down the stairs each of these movements is 
different and requires different control

president francois mitterrand on tuesday ruled out 
a longterm french military presence in unified germany unless it 
comes within a new overall european defense framework 
the french leader made his comments in interviews with the 
german television networks ard and zdf hours before east and west 
germany formally unified on wednesday 
a big country like yours does it need foreign troops on its 
soil even friendly troops mitterrand asked 
at a sept 18 summit in munich with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl mitterrand announced france will withdraw half its 
50000 troops stationed in germany over the next two years 
the world war ii allied powers the united states soviet 
union france and britain give up their occupying rights in east 
and west germany with the unification 
but kohl has suggested he would like the western allies to 
continue a military role after unification even though all have 
announced intentions to quickly reduce troop levels 
if its judged necessary in the framework of european defense 
thats something else mitterrand said a new accord would be 
necessary we must speak clearly on this 
the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
will meet in paris next month to consider the future shape of 
europe since the democratic revolutions that swept eastern europe 
last year 
meanwhile european affairs minister edith cresson said france 
should launch an economic offensive to establish markets in 
postunification east germany 
we count on germany to play the game of competition 
fairly she said in a report to be presented to the government 
wednesday 
the report was made public hours before mitterrand replaced the 
outspoken cresson with elisabeth guigou a close adviser in a 
cabinet shakeup marking the start of a new legislative term 
cresson who caused an uproar last spring when she said japan 
was out to conquer the world with exports said she had asked 
to quit the government 
in the report on germany cresson said france has proved its 
good will and its solidarity by supporting german unification 
now she said france should be vigilant in ensuring that 
european community measures aimed at helping east germany do not 
provide west german businesses with unfair advantages 
cresson said french companies has encountered difficulties as 
they tried to move into east germany in recent months because of 
disorganization there and also because of abuses by west german 
firms 
she said some west german firms had found ways to pressure the 
east german government to their advantage

yugoslav leaders tuesday blocked 
slovenias move for a selfsufficient defense force and ordered the 
federal army to remain in the defiant region 
the presidency said the nations stability was treatened by the 
constitutional amendment passed friday by the slovenia parliament 
saying the republic was solely responsible for its defense 
in a statement the presidency said the slovenian move was 
designed to destroy the constitutional competence of the 
federation of yugoslavia which is beset by widening ideological 
and ethnic rifts among various groups 
this the presidency cannot and shall not permit said 
the statement carried by the state tanjug news agency 
in response to the decision slovenian president milan kucan 
said his republics military will fulfill only decisions and 
commands of the presidency of slovenia 
but in a speech on slovenian television he said the army would 
fully discharge its obligations as part of the armed forces 
of yugoslavia in case of war 
the collective presidency formed of representatives from each 
of the countrys six republics and two provinces is the highest 
body in the land it is also in charge of the armed forces 
the development sharpened the already intense conflict between 
federal officials and the westernmost republic seeking to make 
decisions independent of the central government in belgrade 
slovenia and croatia are the only republics led by 
democratically elected governments following elections earlier 
this year both want the nation changed into a loose confederation 
of sovereign states 
the meeting by the federal presidency was called to discuss the 
heightened tensions between communistruled serbia and croatia 
yugoslavias largest republics many of the estimated 500000 serbs 
in croatia claim to be victims of discrimination and harassment 
the presidency early wednesday demanded croatia withdraw special 
riot police from towns where members of the serb minority seized 
large amounts of automatic weapons from police armories last week 
the presidency also ordered croatia to release illegally 
detained serbs at least 27 people have been arrested and one 
croatian policeman was wounded in clashes with serb protesters 
since the arms were taken 
federal officials said the seized arms must be returned and 
barricades removed 
the situation in many area with mixed national population has 
seriously deteriorated the presidencys statement said 
president borisav jovic a serb now holding the annual rotating 
chairmanship of the presidency cut short his visit to the united 
nations to attend the session in belgrade 
tension between serbs and croats dating to the birth of 
yugoslavia in 1918 intensified this year after the first free 
elections in croatia since 1945 centerright parties trounced the 
communists in those elections 
croatias noncommunist leaders claim the unrest in their 
republic has been orchestrated by serbia to destabilize their 
republic and gain support for serbias hardline policies 
road and rail traffic was blocked tuesday in eastern sections of 
croatia 
barricades were set up by serbs across roads and railway lines 
to knin a serbiandominated city of 10000 people near the 
adriatic coast witnesses said 
the serb minority which makes up about 10 percent of croatias 
population proclaimed autonomy within the republic on monday and 
staged antigovernment rallies 
tanjug quoted the croatian interior ministry as saying its units 
were beginning to withdraw from serbiandominated areas of the

germany united with a burst of color under a clear 
moonlit sky wednesday to close out the most festive chapter of a 
remarkable year 
the two sides of berlin were linked by a river of people that 
stretched from alexanderplatz east berlins central square to the 
historic branderburg gate more than a halfmile away 
crowds estimated at more than 1 million swarmed down unter den 
linden east berlins main avenue and spilled onto the broad plaza 
at the base of the gate 
floodlights and fireworks lighted the sky as german unification 
took effect at midnight to a stirring chorus of the national 
anthem 
masses gathered from every vantage point to watch the center of 
the celebration at the reichstag the old german parliament 
building near brandenburg gate 
germans draped themselves in the red gold and black flag threw 
firecrackers and shimmied to the rock swing and jazz bands that 
lined unter den linden 
the gigantic party was heavily orchestrated and commercially 
sponsored compared to the mass demonstrations that brought down 
the communist government last year and the jubilant euphoria that 
followed the nov 9 opening of the berlin wall 
this was overdone all of this money said east german 
hartmut giese 46 from a place where the wall once stood in view 
of the brandenburg gate celebration 
but we need things like this to help bring us together to 
give us something to share he said 
on unter den linden a west berlin school teacher drew gawks as 
she leaned on the railing overlooking the spree river smartly 
dressed in black tights and a tailored soviet majors jacket and 
hat 
i wanted to see what it felt like to be an occupying power in 
east germany she said 
nearby a huge crane suspended an east germanmade trabant a 
tiny twocylinder car that was one of the first products spurned 
by east germans when their borders opened to western commerce 
west german youths fired at it with flareguns shredding the 
nowobsolete east german flag that hanged below it 
leftist radicals held small rallies throughout the city to 
protest unification about 200 blew whistles outside a police 
barrier at the schauspielhaus jeering arriving dignitaries

the senate voted 909 tuesday to confirm the 
nomination of judge david h souter to the supreme court the only 
dissenting votes came from liberals who fear he will oppose 
abortion rights 
the new hampshire jurist was approved less than 2 months after 
he was tapped as president bushs first nominee to the high court 
it was too late to put him on the court for the start of its 
session this week but age 51 hell probably participate in its 
rulings well into the next century 
the supreme court announced that souter would be sworn in as the 
first item of business next tuesday morning before the court 
begins the second week of its session 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said were obviously very pleased that congress confirmed this 
nomination we think judge souter will be an outstanding justice 
for many years 
fitzwater said bush hoped to attend souters swearingin 
souter watched the proceedings from a friends law office in 
concord nh 
hes just exactly the kind of person with a broad background 
that we need on the supreme court sen orrin hatch rutah said 
as debate on the nomination began i think he showed that he is a 
person of fairness hes willing to listen hes a person of 
independence 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said 
he supported souter but warned bush that the path of the next 
nominee might not be so smooth if the president moves further to 
the right wing 
i want to express the hope that the administration will not 
learn the wrong lesson from the lopsided senate vote on souter 
biden said a more doctrinaire conservative could well fall 
outside the sphere of acceptability he said 
souter becomes the 105th justice of the supreme court filling 
the seat vacated last summer by the retirement of justice william 
brennan 
in concord souter toasted the vote with champagne and friends 
and pledged to return the nations confidence in him 
i have been given much and much will be expected of me in 
return and i will make that return to you and i will make it in 
the fullest measure that i can souter said 
the courts spokeswoman toni house said chief justice william 
h rehnquist would administer the oath of office in private at 9 
am and would administer the oath in a public ceremony in the 
courts ornate courtroom 15 minutes later 
the first major case in which he will participate will be a 
sexbias dispute that will be argued before the justices wednesday 
oct 10 at issue is whether employers may exclude all women of 
childbearing age perhaps 20 million from some hazardous jobs 
there was little doubt souter would be a more conservative 
justice than brennan especially on matters of criminal law but 
souters position on social issues including abortion would be 
harder to predict 
during three days of testimony before the senate judiciary 
committee souter declined to say whether he believed the court 
should overturn its 1973 ruling in roe vs wade which legalized 
abortion he said he was openminded 
on issues including civil rights and religious liberty his 
testimony indicated a far more moderate viewpoint than his record 
would suggest 
sen herb kohl dwis a committee member said there appeared 
to be two judge souters 
fortunately the judge souter who testified before our 
committee did not seem locked to the past said kohl saying he 
was voting for that one and hoping the senate had not been 
deceived 
biden said he was troubled by souters refusal to declare 
support for abortion rights and by the judges mixed record on 
civil rights but biden joined the majority when his committee 
approved the nomination 131 and said tuesday he would do so again 
in the full senate 
hes about the best we can expect from my perspective from 
this administration said biden reflecting the outlook of many 
democrats 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine waited until 
just before the vote to announce his support judge souter 
reflected a reasoned approach and a sound understanding of the 
constitution he said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said he was unwilling to give 
souter the benefit of the doubt 
the senate is still in the dark about this nomination 
kennedy said 
souter he said has not met the test of a good faith 
indepth abiding commitment to the core constitutional values of 
the kind so obviously at stake at this turning point in our 
history 
sen alan cranston dcalif the senate majority whip said if 
because of souter the court overturned roe vs wade he would move 
legislation to create a federal statute legalizing abortion 
hatch an abortion foe said opponents were applying 
singleissue politics to their decisions 
i hope that the litmus test mentality is not used in the 
future hatch said it would make it almost impossible for any 
great nominee to make it on to the court and judge souter is a 
great nominee 
all nine voting against souter were democrats daniel akaka of 
hawaii brock adams of washington cranston bill bradley and frank 
lautenberg of new jersey quentin burdick of north dakota kennedy 
john kerry of massachusetts and barbara mikulski of maryland sen 
pete wilson rcalif did not vote 
souter of rural weare nh is a graduate of harvard college 
and harvard law school and a former rhodes scholar 
he spent most of his adult life working in the judicial system 
of his home state in jobs including attorney general trial judge 
and member of the state supreme court 
last april he was confirmed by the senate to the 1st us

on the western side of the oder river 
fireworks exploded and germans cheered wednesday as the flag of the 
united nation was hoisted 
but on the eastern bank poles were more subdued watching with 
a mixture of fear and resentment at new german attitudes and 
policies 
the ceremony marking the unification of germany was preceded by 
stonethrowing attacks by german youths on two polish buses picking 
up factory workers in frankfurt on oder the german city across the 
river from slubice 
two polish cars waiting to cross the border back into poland 
also were pounded by youths wielding sticks 
to me it seems horrifying said one passenger halina 
gawronska they come to us and we welcome them with open arms and 
then this we live together we know each other how could they 
there was always great friendship but now we dont know what 
is going on said a companion genewa kowalska 
the stonethrowers who appeared to be teenagers shouted 
progerman slogans shattered the windows of the buses and injured 
the two drivers 
some of the many poles who work in former east germany cities 
have expressed concerns they could lose their jobs due to new visa 
restrictions the deteriorating economic situation and progerman 
sentiments 
there has been hostility and suspicion along the border formed 
by the oder and neisse rivers since it was created after world war 
ii onethird of poland is land forfeited by defeated germany 
settled largely by poles thrown out of polish territory to the east 
annexed by the soviet union 
some germans have never relinquished claims to the former lands 
some poles with memories of german aggression and the 6 million of 
their countrymen killed during world war ii have eyed a resurgent 
german neighbor with distrust 
history has taught us to have some fears said leszek 
korczak of glogow waiting at the border to return to poland 
the western border of germany was a crucial issue for poland 
during the unification talks poland secured promises from the 
parliaments of the two germanys that the border would be made final 
in a treaty between poland and the united germanys new government 
at midnight fireworks began to explode over frankfurt on oder 
and the commanders of the polish and german border stations saluted 
the flag of the german federal republic 
earlier the german border guards had changed out of their grey 
uniforms into the dark green uniforms of the west german units 
the ranking polish official present slubice major wieslaw 
wrzosek called unification a new chapter in he history of 
europe a new chapter in relations between poles and germans 
some of the poles returning from germany expressed resentment at 
a policy requiring visas for poles visiting what had been east 
germany and berlin no visas had been needed for berlin and only 
an invitation for east germany 
poles always find some way to manage but this difficulty was 
not needed at all said korczak 
the new commander of the german border station ultun topp 
defended the visa policy which took effect wednesday 
the germanpolish line is now the new outer border between 
eastern and western europe he said 
we have to control it for all the people in the european 
community but i believe there will come a time when all the visas 
will fall away i hope so

this agreement will also raise revenue im not and i know 
youre not a fan of tax increases but if there have to be tax 
measures they should allow the economy to grow they should not 
turn us back to higher income tax rates and they should be fair 
everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have 
to contribute beyond their fair share our bipartisan agreement 
meets these tests and through specific new incentives it will help 
create more jobs 
its a little known fact but americas best job creators and 
greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies so our budget 
plan will smalland mediumsize companies a needed shot in the arm 
just as important i am convinced that this agreement will help 
lower interest rates and lower interest rates means savings for 
consumers lower mortgage payments for new homeowners and more 
investment to produce more jobs and thats what this agreement 
will do 
and now let me tell you what this agreement will not do it will 
not raise income tax rates personal or corporate it will not mess 
with social security in any way it will not put americas national 
security at risk and most of all it will not let our economy slip 
out of control 
clearly each and every one of us can find fault with something 
in this agreement in fact that is a burden that any truly fair 
solution must carry any workable solution must be judged as a 
whole not piece by piece those who dislike one part or another 
may pick our agreement apart but if they do believe me the 
political reality is no one can put a better one back together 
again 
everyone will bear a small burden but if we succeed every 
american will have a large burden lifted if we fail to enact this 
agreement our economy will falter markets may tumble and 
recession will follow in just a moment the democratic majority 
leader senator mitchell will offer what is known as the 
democratic response often a rebuttal but not tonight 
tonight the democratic and republican leadership and i all 
speak with one voice in support of this agreement tonight we ask 
you to help us move this agreement forward the congressional 
leadership and i both have a job to do in getting it enacted and 
tonight i ask for your help 
first i ask you to understand how important and for some how 
difficult this vote is for your congressmen and senators many 
worry about your reaction to one part or another but i know you 
know the importance of the whole and so second i ask you to take 
this initiative tell your congressmen and senatorsyou support 
this deficit reduction agreement 
if they are republicans urge them to stand with the president 
urge them to do what the bipartisan leadership has done come 
together in the spirit of compromise to solve this national 
problem if theyre democrats urge them to stand with their 
congressional leaders ask them to fight for the future of your 
kids by supporting this budget agreement now is the time for you 
the american people to have a real impact 
your senators and congressmen need to know that you want this 
deficit brought down that the time for politics and posturing is 
over and the time to come together is now this deficit reduction 
agreement is tough and so are the times the agreement is fair and 
so is the american spirit the agreement is bipartisan and so is 
the vote the agreement is real and so is this crisis 
this is the first time in my presidency that i have made an 
appeal like this to you the american people with your help we can 
at last put this budget crisis behind us and face the other 
challenges that lie ahead if we do the longterm result will be a 
healthier nation and something more we will have once again put 
ourselves on the path of economic growth and we will have 
demonstrated that no challenge is greater than the determination of 
the american people 
thank you god bless you and good night

israel on tuesday accepted germanys 
unification with some hesitancy tainted by the memory of the 
slayings of 6 million jews by the germans a halfcentury ago 
as jews we have mixed feelings we cannot forget our scars 
from the past what happened to our people during the second world 
war said prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner 
on the other hand there is a new reality now with which we 
have to live pazner said in a telephone interview 
pazner called on the new united germany to remember its debt 
to the jewish people and do all it can to act favorably toward 
the state of israel in bilateral ties and in the european and 
international arenas 
shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc was born in poland 
and lost his parents and other close family in the holocaust he 
emigrated to british mandatory palestine before the war 
some israeli leaders were more negative about the festivities in 
berlin 
parliament speaker dov shilansky a concentration camp survivor 
said in a statement read on state television 
on the day of united germany the people of israel should wear 
sackcloth douse their heads with ashes mourn and chant 
lamentations 
eliahu benelissar chairman of parliaments defense and foreign 
affairs committee said the unification of germany is happening 
too soon we should have raised our voices the voice of conscience 
against unification this we didnt do and it is too bad 
leaders of the yad vashem holocaust memorial museum called on 
germany to fight antisemitism neonazism and refrain from 
supplying arms to israels arab enemies

robert mapplethorpe took sexually explicit 
photographs to come to terms with his own troubled life an art 
historia testified tuesday at the nations first obscenity trial 
of a gallery and its director 
robert sobieszek curator of a new york photo museum said in 
videotaped testimony played for the jury that seven mapplethorpe 
photos at issue have as much artistic merit as others in his 
175picture retrospective 
the story was of a very full and rich artist who was 
interested in documenting what was beautiful and elegant on the one 
hand and tortured and troubled on the other said sobieszek from 
the george eastman house museum in rochester ny 
mapplethorpe who was homosexual began work on the show 
robert mapplethorpe the perfect moment after he was diagnosed 
with aids he died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in march 
1989 at age 42 
they reveal in a very strong forceful way a major part of his 
life said sobieszek a troubled portion of his life he was 
trying to come to grips with 
the contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie 
are on trial on misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and 
using children in nudityrelated material 
barrie may testify wednesday defense attorneys said 
the charges stem from the seven photos sobieszek referred to 
showing the exposed genitals of two children a man urinating in 
another mans mouth and anal penetration involving various objects 
the cincinnati gallery hosted the show for seven weeks ending in 
may 
if convicted of both charges barrie could be sentenced to one 
year in jail and fined 2000 the gallery could be fined 10000 
for conviction on both counts 
jurors heard depositions from beatrix mary nevill of london and 
claryssa dalrymple of new york city mothers of the girl and the 
boy in the photos they testified that mapplethorpe took the 
pictures in 1976 with their approval and exhibited them with their 
consent 
at issue is whether the seven mapplethorpe photos violated 
community standards of obscenity 
prosecutors who have completed their case sought to establish 
that contemporary community standards provide one criterion for 
defining obscenity 
defense attorneys said the exhibit drew more than 80000 people 
in cincinnati they want that considered as an indicator of 
community standards 
jerry stein an arts critic at the cincinnati post who gave the 
exhibit a favorable review testified that the photographs of the 
children are an innocent or nonsexual presentation 
judge david albanese refused to set aside a defense subpoena 
seeking testimony from owen findsen arts reviewer for the 
cincinnati enquirer the newspaper fought the subpoena 
defense attorneys said findsen would be called to testify 
wednesday 
jurors might begin deliberations wednesday the trial in its 
second week 
meanwhile police said tuesday they began issuing misdemeanor 
disorderly conduct citations for at least 30 people who 
participated in a sept 24 protest of the citys prosecution of 
barrie and the gallery 
most of the citations were issued anonymously in the names of 
jane doe or john doe as police attempt to identify 
protesters through police films 
police said protesters unlawfully blocked streets and tied up 
traffic without a parade permit

president bush asked americans tuesday night 
to support a demanding 500 billion package of tax increases and 
spending cuts everyone who can should contribute something 
the president said 
claiming rare unity with leaders of the democraticcontrolled 
congress bush said in a 10minute televised speech from the oval 
office that the package was written in eight months of blood 
sweat and fears fears of the economic chaos that would follow if 
we fail to reduce the deficit 
it is the best agreement that can be legislated now bush 
said of the compromise 
bushs address from the oval office was nationally televised 
but his message was primarily aimed 16 blocks away at congress 
where an initial vote on the plan may be held as early as thursday 
although the package generally has support among democrats 
lawmakers from bushs own party particularly in the house have 
balked at its tax provisions bush himself had to abandon his no 
new taxes pledge in the face of the growing deficit 
im not and i know youre not a fan of tax increases bush 
said but if there have to be tax measures they should allow the 
economy to grow they should not turn us back to higher income tax 
rates and they should be fair 
everyone who can should contribute something and no one 
should have to contribute beyond their fair share 
bush pointed out that the agreement had been hammered out by a 
bipartisan group the democratic and republican leadership 
tonight all speak with once voice he said and urged people to 
tell their congressmen they support the package 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine joined bush in 
urging passage of the fragile package saying the future of the 
nation is more important than partisan differences 
in a televised response mitchell acknowledged that democrats 
and republicans had deep differences over values and priorities 
that delayed an agreement for months the democratic leader called 
the agreement imperfect and warned that the compromise budget 
cuts and tax increases will demand sacrifice from all 
americans 
but if enacted it holds the promise of restoring a sound 
economy from which all americans will benefit mitchell said 
everybody who can should contribute something bush said 
everybody will bear a small burden but if we succeed everybody 
will have small burden lifted 
the alternative bush said is recession 
wavering republican lawmakers had told bush earlier in the day 
that the plan was in trouble and that a presidential address to 
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected 
gop support for the package with congressional elections just a 
month away 
bush also planned to push for the threedayold package which 
the white house negotiated with congressional leaders in a series 
of upcoming speeches around the nation 
the budget package would raise taxes on gasoline alcohol 
cigarettes boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and 
medicare recipients it also would reduce tax deductions for people 
who earn more than 100000 
bush earlier tuesday had pressed his case with skeptical and 
wavering house republicans 
he seemed to be making some headway and by late tuesday house 
gop leaders were beginning to feel more optimistic about their 
chances of rounding up support from most of their members weve 
made significant progress said house minority leader robert 
michel rill 
one opponent rep vin weber rminn agreed saying id 
guess right now it would be narrowly defeated by tomorrow it 
would be narrowly passed people are being moved onebyone 
bush said the budget deficit was a problem that has lingered 
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long 
likening the budget crisis to the persian gulf stalemate bush 
said our nation is standing together against saddam husseins 
aggression while at home another threat a cancer is gnawing 
away at our nations health 
the president said that ending deficit spending was simple 
common sense 
no nation can continue to do business the way the federal 
government has been operating and survive he said 
when you get a bill that bill must be paid he said 
bush said that the plan was not a magic act but contained 
true deficit savings and would put the nation on the path toward 
lower interest rates and a balanced budget 
everyone will bear a small burden but if we succeed every 
american will have a large burden lifted he said

physicists at princeton university say they 
have reached a milestone toward commercial use of the power packed 
in a hydrogen bomb a fusion reactor capable of producing as much 
energy as it consumes 
scientists say the breakthrough allows them to move toward 
developing fusion as an alternative energy to coal and nuclear 
power plants 
however they cautioned that the project which has already 
spanned 15 years and cost 1 billion faces several major hurdles 
including determining how to extract the energy from the reactor 
scientists said tuesday that the tokamak fusion test reactor in 
princeton could reach the break even point sometime after 1993 
but warned that commercial use remains decades away 
the researchers at the princeton plasma physics research 
laboratory have combined atoms of a heavy form of hydrogen called 
deuterium to form helium and energy 
the next step which the researchers hope to achieve in 1993 
would use deuterium and a radioactive form of hydrogen called 
tritium to generate large amounts of energy in the tokamak reactor 
a hydrogen bomb uses the same reaction to cause mass 
destruction 
dennis manos principle research physicist at the princeton 
labs said the reactor would eventually be able to generate 10 
million watts of power a day 
tokamak has attained 50000 watts and a record temperature of 
400 million degrees centigrade with the deuterium mixture he said 
its step one the first real threshold you have to get across 
to get an engineering device whose ultimate objective is to produce 
much more energy than you put in said robert sachs a physics 
professor at the university of chicago 
the atomic age began at the university of chicago in 1942 with 
the creation of the first selfsustaining nuclear chain reaction 
fusion creates energy by combining two hydrogen atoms into a 
heavier helium atom it differs from nuclear fission which powers 
conventional nuclear plants by splitting heavy atoms into smaller 
pieces 
proponents say fusion eliminates the danger of reacto 
meltdowns produces less radioactive waste and is produced from a 
readily available source hydrogen 
it is a potentially safer technology but it has a long way to 
go when you compare it with existing commercial fission 
technology manos said 
the soviet union the united states japan and the european 
economic community hope to develop a test reactor sometime after 
the year 2000 he said 
but there are other obstacles 
how to extract the energy from the reactor in a useful way is 
an engineering question no one has yet answered sachs said

i speak tonight not for the democratic party but for americas 
future 
for more than a decade the united states has endured budget 
deficits that sap our economic strength when you have a deficit 
there are only two things you can do cut spending or increase 
revenue this agreement does both 
it cuts spending military and domestic it raises taxes 
the president has asked you to support the budget agreement the 
democratic leadership in congress joins in that appeal we 
recognize that this budget demands sacrifice from all americans 
but if enacted it holds the promise of restoring a sound 
economy from which all americans will benefit 
the agreement is a compromise its not what the president 
working alone would have preferred its not what we democrats 
working on our own would have produced neither side got all it 
wanted 
and many are asking why did it take so long the answer is 
simple what delayed us for months is what has divided us for 
years democrats and republicans have deep differences over values 
and priorities 
we prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from 
the elderly but when the president asked us to join in rewriting 
his budget we agreed because the nation is more important than 
partisan differences 
when the president asked us to help work out a compromise he got 
our help now we hope that members of his party the republican 
members of congress will also set aside partisan differences as 
we have done and join us in doing whats right for our country 
two centuries ago the constitutional convention in philadelphia 
was drawing to a close the delegates had quarreled for months now 
they were to vote on a difficult compromise benjamin franklin 81 
years old rose slowly and said to his fellow delegates i 
confess that there are several parts of this constitution which i 
do not approve but i doubt whether any other convention may be 
able to make a better constitution for when you assemble men to 
have the advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble 
all their prejudices their passions their errors of opinion 
their local interests their selfish views from such an assembly 
can a perfect production be expected i consent to this 
constitution because i expect no better and because i am not sure 
it is not the best 
of course no budget can be compared with the constitution but 
franklins point applies every human work is imperfect and thats 
certainly true of this budget 
but its also true that for americas economic future we have 
to pass it with your help we will 
thank you and good night

the justice of gender in the locker room was 
supposed to be settled 12 years ago courts gave women 
sportswriters equal access to dressing rooms so they would have the 
same chance as men to do their jobs 
yet the issue of women in the clubhouse keeps making headlines 
denise tom of usa today was barred monday night from the cincinnati 
bengals dressing room hours after the national football league 
named an investigator to look into charges of harassment of boston 
herald reporter lisa olson 
we go into locker rooms not because we want to but because we 
have to wrote christine brennan a sportswriter with the 
washington post and one of pioneers who fought for equal access 
its not exciting or sexy or tantalizing its cramped and 
steamy and messy she said but most stadiums are too old to 
have a room big enough for all reporters and all players to meet 
for interviews so the only place we can do our jobs is the locker 
room 
about 500 women work as sports journalists according to the 
association for women in sports media they have the same right to 
do their jobs as women who drive trucks mine coal doctor the sick 
or practice law 
precedent was established in 1978 when a federal judge ruled 
melissa ludtke a reporter for sports illustrated could go into 
the new york yankees clubhouse barring her violated her 
constitutional right to equal protection under the law judge 
constance baker motley ruled 
in 1985 commissioner pete rozelle ordered all nfl teams to 
treat reporters equally in interview areas regardless of sex some 
teams like the dallas cowboys set up rooms where players could be 
interviewed others handed out bathrobes or towels to players 
major league baseball provided equal access that year too 
basketball and hockey already had set open policies the national 
basketball association schools rookies on how to deal with the 
media male and female 
but the going has hardly been easy for women in the world of 
jocks where clubhouses smell of sweat and salve and soiled 
athletic supporters but where reporters have to go for interviews 
in 1986 susan fornoff of the sacramento calif bee received a 
live rat wrapped in a shoe box from dave kingman of the oakland 
athletics joan ryan of the orlando fla sentinel once told of a 
player from a defunct football league who ran a razor up her leg as 
she conducted an interview 
earlier this year intern jennifer frey of the detroit free 
press was told by detroit tigers pitcher jack morris i dont 
talk to people when im naked especially women unless theyre on 
top of me or im on top of them 
when the newspaper complained tigers president bo schembechler 
wrote back no female member of my family would be inside a mens 
locker room regardless of their job description 
now former watergate investigator philip heymann has been named 
to look into charges that new england patriots players exposed 
themselves and made suggestive remarks to olson on sept 17 the 
herald reporter called it nothing less than mind rape 
tight end zeke mowatt was fined 2000 and apologized but 
denied making lewd gestures or comments he said the only thing he 
told her was you are not writing you are looking 
patriots owner victor kiam at first called the locker room 
incident a flyspeck in the ocean then told the paper it was 
asking for trouble by sending a female reporter into a football 
dressing room he was also quoted as calling her a classic 
bitch 
after the national organization for women called from a boycott 
of remington products inc which kiam owns he took out fullpage 
ads in the new york times the boston herald and the boston globe 
kiam apologized and said theres no excuse for what 
happened he also denied calling her a name 
she was booed at sundays game 
in seattle bengals coach sam wyche kept usa todays tom from 
the locker room because our guys dont want a woman to walk into 
a situation like that in the past wyche has closed the locker 
room to all reporters in violation of nfl policy and was fined last 
year 
commissioner paul tagliabue said wyche faces another fine for 
not letting a woman into the locker room 
if he wants to make a stand on he issue he can make a stand 
on the issue he will be fined very heavily for it if he wants to 
quit he can quit because he has been warned twice already 
tagliabue said 
tuesdays edition of usa today contained a column by 
sportswriter rachel shuster aimed at nfl brass she concluded 
weve earned our place in the locker room now just give us some 
respect and well do our jobs and let you do yours

senate majority leader george mitchell 
reinforcing an appeal by president bush tuesday urged passage of a 
500 billion fiveyear deficitcutting package he said could 
restore a sound economy 
mitchell in a televised appeal that followed bushs address to 
the nation said the two parties still have deep differences over 
values and priorities which delayed an agreement for months but 
the nation is more important than partisan differences 
the bipartisan budget proposal holds the promise of restoring 
a sound economy from which all americans will benefit mitchell 
said 
we prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less 
from the elderly mitchell said 
but when bush asked congressional democrats to help rewrite his 
budget mitchell said he got our help 
mitchell called the package imperfect and said neither 
side got what it wanted 
and he added we recognize that this budget demands sacrifice 
from all americans 
wavering republican lawmakers had told bush earlier in the day 
that the plan was in trouble and that a presidential address to 
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected 
gop support for the package with congressional elections just a 
month away 
the budget package would raise axes on gasoline alcohol 
cigarettes boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and 
medicare recipients it also would reduce tax deductions for people 
who earn more than 100000 
rep jerry lewis rcalif chairman of the house republican 
conference praised bush but attacked mitchell 
the president stepped up to the plate tonight and hit the ball 
clear out of the park he said his appeal to the american 
people will make the difference 
he called the upcoming votes on the package the most important 
of the bush presidency thus far and predicted a lastminute 
surge of support will win passage of the compromise 
in attacking mitchell lewis took issue with the majority 
leaders remark that democrats wanted higher taxes from the wealthy 
and less from the elderly 
the democrats sought increases on highincome taxpayers as the 
price for bushs plan to reduce capital gains both measures were 
dropped from the package 
george mitchells partisan shots at capital gains in his 
response was most disturbing lewis said he more than anyone 
else is responsible for the death of capital gains in the budget 
package

the two germanys ended 45 years of division with a 
blaze of fireworks and the pealing of church bells wednesday 
declaring the creation of a new german nation in the heart of 
europe 
near the ruins of hitlers citadel in the city that symbolized 
the cold war division of europe the german flag was hoisted to 
crown the dramatic rush to unify a germany divided by world war ii 
and the communist berlin wall 
rockets burst in the sky over berlin illuminating the 
warscarred reichstag building and the brandenburg gate the shower 
of fireworks also lighted the upturned faces of thousands of 
germans united in peace but troubled by the political and economic 
problems facing a united germany 
chancellor helmut kohl president richard von weizsaecker and 
former leader willy brandt stood in the glare of floodlights at the 
reichstag and joined in singing the national anthem as a vast party 
occurred across the land of 78 million residents millions of 
germans and a watching world joined the ceremony by television 
wednesday was declared a national holiday but late tuesday 
police in goettingen 66 miles south of hanover reported 1000 
leftist protesters opposed to unification rampaged through the 
city authorities said the radicals broke store windows and chanted 
never again germany and nazis out 
in berlin police detained seven people who were caught with 
paint and gas pistols another man was arrested in the kreuzberg 
district after a policeman was stabbed in the arm during a scuffle 
between police and about 500 youthful demonstrators 
in the northern port of rostock authorities evacuated 23 soviet 
jews from a refugee center because of fears the center could become 
a target of rightist radicals no incidents were reported 
at least four people were injured and more than 10 arrested in 
scuffles between police and demonstrators in schwerin where some 
celebrated unification with the nazi siegheil salute 
witnesses said police also reported clashes with youths in leipzig 
and hamburg 
the ceremony marked return of a united germany built on the 
ruins of adolf hitlers defeat in world war ii and the end of cold 
war antagonism that split europe into competing blocs led by the 
united states and the soviet union 
it came less than 11 months after the berlin wall was opened 
nov 9 1989 by a tide of democracy that swept away communist 
regimes across eastern europe 
fourteen schoolchildren from the former east and west germanys 
carried the huge 72squareyard german flag and hoisted it up the 
132foottall mast in front of the reichstag 
hundreds of thousands of people waving german flags crowded 
along the unten den linden thoroughfare and june 17th street that 
once were cut by the berlin wall 
fireworks exploded over the reichstag as a replica of the 
liberty bell donated to berlin by the american people pealed 
germany is one again germany is sovereign said german 
television fortyfive years after the unconditional surrender 
of nazi germany the two german states are united 
prime minister lothar de maiziere said of unification minutes 
before midnight what for most people had been only a dream has 
become reality 
then kurt masur directed beethovens ninth sympony as east 
germany ceased to exist to the deep chords of the ode to joy 
city authorities had banned demonstrations near the brandenburg 
gate the 200yearold monument that was a focus of celebrations 
the broad thoroughfares around the brandenburg gate were 
thronged with tens of thousands of people hours before the historic 
occasion and vendors sold food drinks and souvenirs 
dixieland jazz street musicians and organgrinders played music 
that rang in the chilly fall air 
searchlight beams waved in a cloudless sky and a tall crane 
dangled an old east german trabi car 50 feet in the air just 
south of the massive stone gate 
about 200 leftist radicals lined a police barrier outside the 
schauspielhaus blowing whistles and jeering at dignitaries 
arriving for a formal state ceremony hosted by the departing east 
german government 
the radicals chanted germany drop dead 
kohl 60 said in a statement to the frankfurter allgemeine 
newspaper that the new germany will help stabilize europe and that 
it would not be a restless reich like nazi germany which 
plunged europe into its most disastrous war 
the unification of germany is a european indeed a world event 
of historic rank kohl said 
several german newspapers published the approved verse of the 
national anthem to be sung in unified germany not the old 
deutschland ueber alles verse but the third verse which 
starts unity and justice and freedom for the german 
fatherland 
the verse admonishes germany to bloom not to be above 
all the old mission that frightens some europeans 
only a year ago the rush toward unity was barely starting east 
germans demonstrated for political freedoms and the right to leave 
their country the communist government opened the berlin wall last 
fall but was swept away anyway in a peaceful popular revolution 
east germans began to demonstrate for unification which was 
taken up by kohl and his government and eventually approved by 
moscow and the allies 
the soviets agreed to let united germany remain in nato and to 
remove their troops by the end of 1994 although germany is paying 
moscow 95 billion to finance the withdrawal the allies will keep 
troops in west berlin until the soviets leave 
the last formal steps to clear the way for unity were taken 
mostly by the foreign powers who defeated nazi germany and retained 
legal powers as occupiers in berlin 
in new york on monday president bush and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze were present for the signing of a 
declaration of a suspension of the allies special powers 
on tuesday morning allied generals from the united states 
britain and france signed a letter ceding their powers buglers 
played as the three flags were lowered for the last time at the 
allied headquarters 
maj gen raymond e haddock of the united states maj gen 
robert js corbett of britain and maj gen francois cann of 
france then went to west berlin city hall to deliver the letter to 
mayor walter momper 
we three commandants will shortly leave berlin and we shall 
carry with us a feeling of satisfaction that our collective efforts 
have been successful the berlin which we leave will be whole and 
free their letter said 
kohl said in a statement broadcast on television that germany 
thanked the western allies for their support and he also praised 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev saying he recognized the 
nations right to pursue their own path without this decision we 
would not have experienced the day of german unity so soon 
much work needs to be done kohl said 
particularly at this moment we germans must show solidarity 
toward one another the chancellor said a difficult path lies 
before us 
the mighty west german economy with a gross national product 
last year of 14 trillion has to rebuild east germany which had 
onefourth of west germans population but an economy only 
oneeighth as big in 1989 and failing fast in its last days 
east germanys work force of 9 million had 360000 out of work 
in august and 14 million were on socalled short work with an 
uncertain future

scientists say the humble potato may offer the 
world a second chance to support a population that is outracing its 
capacity to feed itself 
the first chance was the green revolution which started in 
the 1960s and kept millions alive by developing highyield strains 
of rice corn and wheat but never fully lived up to its promise 
at a conference here monday and tuesday on feeding the global 
village the potato was held up as a potential lifesaver for the 
half of the world that is hungry it was called a power food 
packed with protein and vitamin c potassium iron and magnesium 
the conference was told the potato is becoming a vital source of 
nutrition around the world it is grown these days in 126 
countries from the arctic and to the tropics atop mountains and 
in the desert 
even in china the worlds rice bowl it is not uncommon to see 
a youngster walking along eating a potato like an apple 
china has replaced poland as the worlds second largest grower 
of potatoes 
the soviet union is still first but this year there are fears 
that a breakdown in the harvesting system will deprive millions of 
a crucial part of the russian diet a bumper crop is rotting in the 
fields 
india is in fourth place in potato production and the united 
states is fifth 
americans eat five billion pounds of french fries a year said 
robert mercer an official of the potato board which represents 
the industry and the orient where theyre known as american 
fries is importing 800 million pounds of frozen raw potatoes a 
year 
the potatos foremost champion at the conference was researcher 
richard sawyer who says his interest was sharpened when he 
subsisted on stolen seed potatoes while a prisoner of war in nazi 
germany he is founder and director general of the international 
potato center in lima peru 
sawyer predicted the potato will launch a second agricultural 
revolution comparable to the green revolution 
he said this will buy time for the world to put population 
growth in harmony with food production 
potatoes are usually grown from a tuber chunk containing buds or 
eyes research at the potato center made it possible to grow 
them from seeds from the plants flower sawyer reported reducing 
the high costs of seed material that made the potato a luxury 
vegetable in much of the world 
i can hold in my hand enough true potato seed to plant a 
hectare 2471 acres whereas it takes 4000 pounds or more of 
tubers to plant the same area sawyer said 
meantime he said scientists have only begun to explore new 
varieties at the peru center he said germplasm seed material 
for about 175 varieties have been collected 
i am confident we have the ability to develop varieties which 
would have resistances to pests and diseases and eliminate 90 
percent of the present use of chemicals on production sawyer 
said what we dont have in the germplasm collection we will 
probably be able to produce through the new tools of 
biotechnology 
robert e rhoades a researcher in the philippines said farmers 
in the tropics can harvest potatoes within 50 days of planting a 
third of the time it takes in colder climates wherever 
temperatures drop at night potatoes can be grown he said 
the potato yields more nutritious food quicker on less land 
and under harsher climates than any major crop rhoades said 
since they grow so fast they can be planted in fields that are 
used at other times of the year to raise rice or wheat he said 
research has produced plants resistant to the blight that in 
1845 attacked the potato fields of ireland and northern europe and 
caused a third of irelands population of three million to starve 
to death and another third to emigrate many to america

us air force veterans involved in the spraying 
of agent orange and other herbicides during the vietnam war are as 
healthy as those not exposed to the chemicals air force 
researchers reported 
two studies reported in the oct 10th edition of the journal of 
the american medical association compared the mortality rates and 
physical health of veterans of operation ranch hand the unit 
responsible for the sprayings and air force veterans who served 
concurrently in other units 
an evaluation of cumulative and allcausing mortality revealed 
no statistically significant differences between ranch hands and 
comparison subjects said air force col william h wolfe 
coauthor of the studies 
the first study found a significant increase in digestive system 
disease deaths among the veterans but most were linked to 
alcoholism not to herbicidal exposure 
a second study comparing the physical health of 995 ranch hand 
veterans to 1299 other veterans found that the two groups 
reported similar health problems the study was based on physical 
exams administered in 1982 1985 and 1987 
the researchers reported that the few associations found between 
physical health and exposure to the herbicides were weak and 
inconsistent 
we are left with the interpretation that the few positive 
findings are not supportive of a hypothesis of adverse health 
effects in ranch hands the authors wrote in the journal

tuesday after a letter carrier reported the package as suspicious

prince william county police spokeswoman 
officils notified the county police the postal inspection 
service and a bomb squad from the nearby quantico marine base the 
small box was then xrayed which identified it as an explosive

several metal postal carts were placed around the package and 
it was detonated it in the parking lot giroux said no one was 
injured although giroux said the intended victim would have been 
quite devastated if it was opened as intended

its not too early to begin celebrating pbs 
10th season of the woodwrights shop where host roy underhill 
illustrates the ancient craft of woodworking with traditional 
american tools and a dry hip wit 
no power tools please 
its the difference between playing a stradivarius and a 
synthesizer underhill said both of them get the work done 
but theres a lot of difference in the playing and what you end up 
with the product is the process 
the 10th season premiere oct 20 features a rocking horse 
modeled on those of germanys franconia region where underhill 
shot two other shows that feature the districts traditional 
architecture and craftsmanship 
other woodworking projects featured will include traditional ash 
wood basketry the walking stick flute a revolving bookcase a 
colonial garden gate a musical balinese whirligig a kayak and 
wooden shoes 
and underhill closes out the season with his favorite thing to 
make a light wood garden rake split from white oak and hickory 
asked the origin of his love for woodworking with traditional 
hand tools underhill said i grew up in the mountains of 
washington dc its known as capitol hill now but back then 
there was no electricity no roads 
thats probably not true roy 
he acknowledged a boyhood with family connections to the 
smithsonian institution and its collection of americana but he 
insisted there were woods and deer inside the city limits of his 
boyhood a couple of decades ago 
he also acknowledged an undergraduate degree in theater 
directing from the university of north carolina at chapel hill 
that was followed by some adventurous homesteading in the 
mountains of new mexico and the ensuing graduate degree in 
traditional woodworking from duke universitys forestry school he 
said 
he came back from new mexico he said to make oldstyle wooden 
shovels and rakes but quickly found he couldnt make them fast 
enough to earn a living at it 
i was really faced with having to give it up and do something 
else or compromise and start making things by some kind of 
mechanical method that i really didnt want to do he said 
so he taught people how to do woodwork and he demonstrated his 
craft before groups it was slowly dawning on that that if i 
showed people how to do it then i could maintain its integrity 
then he realized that it could work on television the 
woodwrights shop was born 
today underhill is finishing his fourth woodworking book and 
his tenth year as master housewright at colonial williamsburg 
where the life of 18th century virginia is recreated in a living 
working museum 
the job is to build houses the same way or to discover the 
same way that they were built in the 18th century he said we 
put people to work with axes pit saws and oxen 
his latest project was the reconstruction of the big anderson 
blacksmith shops plans for the interpretation were based on 
archaeology library research and studies of simiar surviving 
buildings 
its detective work putting together the tools the wood all 
of the evidence he said this is how we learn about how people 
lived 
one of underhills favorite quotations is from the 
wheelwrights shop the 19th century memoirs of an artisan who 
said of his craftsmen they were friends with oak and iron and 
the grain in the wood told secrets to them 
its those secrets that speak to underhill he reveals them on 
his show patiently working the wood with his crafts traditional 
tools he explores reveals and connects with something basic and 
profound about humankind 
this is the fundamental stuff part of us since our ancestors 
started banging rocks on trees he said its fundamental to 
our language our culture our social structure our engineering 
its the same thing for a writer to understand latin the 
roots of the language the trees havent changed a cutting edge 
still works the same way its almost fundamental to human beings 
its that kind of inextricable element from our culture

rosa perez and carlos peri were building a life 
together he was working construction they had a nice apartment a 
new baby and a dream of going back to their native honduras to 
live 
in a few frantic moments the happy land fire changed all that 
carlos was killed along with 86 other people when a revengeseeking 
arsonist torched the illegal bronx social club early one sunday 
morning last march 
now rosas life is lawyers and lawsuits and waiting and being a 
single parent to her son now 10 months old 
im really at a loss without carlos says rosa as she 
lovingly strokes the boys head i had to move out of the 
apartment we had because i couldnt afford to stay there anymore 
sometimes i dont have enough money to buy milk for the 
baby the 23yearold mother says sadly in spanish when the 
babys father was here and alive life was not hard because he was 
very good 
but now it is very hard 
rosa is a plaintiff in one of 93 lawsuits prompted by the march 
25 fire thirtyseven lawyers represent victims relatives and five 
survivors of the blaze 
the buildings owner real estate tycoon alex dilorenzo iii 
faces dozens of suits alleging that he kept the building in 
substandard condition and therefore should be financially liable 
dilorenzo in turn claims that the lease holders jay weiss and 
morris jaffe didnt take steps to improve the building as was 
their responsibility 
the city had ordered dilorenzo to close the building in november 
1988 the city issued code violations for operating a social club 
without a permit failing to provide a least two exits on the first 
and second floor and having no emergency lighting no fire alarms 
and no sprinkler system 
despite the many violations the club continued to operate 
today the building is vacant a burnedout shell that draws the 
curious occasionally flowers are placed on the sidewalk in memory 
of the victims 
julio gonzalez 36 is charged with setting the blaze with a 
dollars worth of gasoline after a fight with his former girlfriend 
who worked at the club most of the victims were trapped on the 
second floor 
gonzalez was indicted on multiple counts of murder and arson and 
is undergoing defenserequested psychiatric evaluation while 
awaiting trial 
one of the plaintiffs attorneys norman liss says lawsuits 
like rosas should be settled quickly 
we feel that this is a case that cries out for justice liss 
says this is a very needy population we dont want to be 
talking about resolution of this case six seven 10 years down the 
road 
peter cross an attorney for dilorenzo and dilorenzos company 
clarendon place corp agrees that all sides are hopeful that 
this can be settled without prolonged litigation possibly within 
a year 
two factors may hinder a speedy resolution dilorenzos personal 
finances it has been reported that he faces numerous foreclosures 
and may not be able to pay his debts and public squabbling 
between dilorenzo and weiss the husband of actress kathleen 
turner 
dilorenzo said he never saw the violations issued by the city 
weiss whose corporation leased the happy land building from 
dilorenzo and then rerented it to the clubs operator said 
dilorenzo ran his buildings into the ground 
while some attorneys debate responsibilities others document 
how relatives and loved ones depended on money sent by the victims 
carlos peri worked as a carpenter mostly in construction 
earning up to 250 a week according to susan karten rosas 
attorney 
he not only supported rosa and their baby here he also sent his 
father in honduras 50 a month and sent his sister 100 whenever he 
could so she could attend school she says in povertystricken 
honduras even those relatively small amounts can go a long way 
under new york law the only person who can receive any money 
from a settlement would be the baby also named carlos but under 
victim compensation laws if relatives and loved ones can prove 
support they can file claims karten says rosa could qualify for 
up to 30000 
rosa seems nonplussed by all the lawyer talk 
she now lives with her mother and sister in the bronx where she 
says she and the baby both sleep on a sofa she receives welfare 
support for the child totalling about 140 a month 
her eyes grow vacant as she talks about happy land 
she remembers she didnt like the club when she had gone there 
with carlos in fact she and carlos had quarreled the night of the 
fire he wanted to go she didnt 
i told him you know i dont like to go there because the men 
there just grab you and dont even ask you to dance 
then he got angry and reprimanded me and said he wouldnt come 
back but before he left he played with the baby and he put the 
baby in the crib because the baby had fallen asleep in his arms 
and then he said now im leaving well see each other 
later but i never saw him again

larry wright wanted a drum set but his mother 
had money only for drugs so one day he took the subway down to 
times square flipped over a plastic bucket and began pounding it 
with battered drumsticks 
he hoped for coins maybe 10 or 20 but as strangers watched 
this sinewy youth whale away sweat pouring from his shirtless 
torso tiny bits of wood and plastic flying they proferred 
dollars instead of quarters 
by days end the kid from harlem who had never taken a music 
lesson in his life had made 300 
that was about two years ago he kept coming back day after 
day playing for hours at a time he played faster and faster 
built up his callouses and broke dozens of buckets 
he got some breaks appearances in music videos by phil collins 
fine young cannibals and jane child and a short documentary on 
public television 
this summer wright now 15 caught the eye of filmmaker spike 
lee who featured him in a levis jeans commercial playing his 
bucket and meeting his hero drummer max roach 
but last month at his moment of triumph the drug scene claimed 
his mothers life 
police say marilyn wright 34 was waiting in line to buy drugs 
when she was shot during the attempted robbery of a drug dealer in 
her apartment building on west 138th street she died in the 
hospital 12 days later 
detective john grenawalt who interviewed mrs wright in the 
hospital said there had been no arrest in her shooting he added 
incredulously to this day i have yet to get a phone call from 
her family 
the family seems to accept her death as an awful but not 
altogether surprising consequence of her drug use and the 
neighborhood they live in larry and his grandmother margaret 
cook still live in the building 
mrs cook was sitting on a folding metal chair on the sidewalk 
across from the building one day recently when she talked about her 
grandson she is a slight woman who holds her arms close to her as 
she talks 
larry gave most of his money to his mother she said as soon 
as he made it she took it and it was going to the dope man might 
as well tell the truth 
when larrys father bought him a drum set for christmas momma 
took care of it the grandmother said she chuckled at the 
absurdity i can talk about it i cant hurt her now shes 
resting 
some rich lady heard him and bought him a real expensive 
set she continued dont ask what happened to that one 
relatives and friends sitting with her nodded knowingly and joined 
the chuckling 
after his mother died larry appeared at her wake with his 
drumsticks and a bucket and set them down outside the door of the 
funeral parlor 
he didnt really realize what happened to his mom until he saw 
her laying down in a coffin said monte detioger 23 who 
befriended larry a year ago and now is his manager when i saw 
him looking at his mom he was crying he was like screaming 
inside 
drumming came early and easily to larry his mother used to say 
he began tapping on things when he was 3 months old his uncle 
bernard mercer says the baby always headed straight for mercers 
tambourines 
he was just crawling in diapers he couldnt walk yet or 
talk the uncle said hed bang on the tv screen hed bang on 
the wall on the refrigerator anything 
larry himself remembers tapping on floors when he was 3 later 
came table tops garbage pail lids trees bottles cups and 
eventually plastic buckets the fivegallon size used to package 
wallboard compound and other products 
which is what he was looking for on a recent day at 46th street 
and broadway he scrounged several buckets from a construction 
site knocked out the residue and was ready to warm up 
he tapped out various beats on the bottom of the bucket 
gradually playing faster and louder he threw in strokes to the 
side and rim to produce different sounds using his right foot to 
rock the open end of the bucket up and down against the sidewalk 
he created a thumping bass beat 
many drummers could imitate his rhythms with a little practice 
but larrys listeners marveled at his speed and precision 
at the point in his solo where a theater audience might applaud 
larrys new fans reached into their pockets most approached his 
bucket slowly and respectfully depositing a dollar as carefully as 
they would at church 
hes playing his insides out marveled a tourist from 
massachusetts a commuter from new jersey bought a can of coke and 
set it down next to the sweating larry a young woman said she had 
seen him on television and wanted to marry him others gave him 
kisses 
the kids a prodigy said a man from san francisco 
max roach agrees 
hes phenomenal the thing that fascinated me about him was 
the way he sequentially set up his rhythms to create music on that 
bucket the way he put his accents in you knew he wasnt just 
banging even though he would switch from eighth to 16th to 32nd 
notes it was still musical he said 
roach spotted him coming out of macys one day there was a 
crowd around him i heard these rhythms coming out and i stood 
there with the crowd for about 20 minutes i was really impressed 
the fact he had the strength that he could do this probably for 
hours and he made sense with it just that bucket hes very 
musical 
and quite unprepared for success 
detioger his manager describes wright as a street kid 
with little education or understanding of people 
he tries to be a man but hes not detioger said he 
doesnt know anything about life hes earning 200 a day banging 
on a bucket in times square he said look monte i dont need to 
go to school look at how i do 
since his mothers death though wright has returned to school 
for the first time in two years and says hes saving his money his 
goal he says is not to be in a band but to become a star soloist 
im good enough to become a star i know that he says 
im always playing my drums thats the only thing i think about 
i dont let nobody get to me and he adds if i didnt have 
that talent id probably be locked up somewhere 
in the background is the memory of his mother and her fate 
mercer his uncle says that for all her troubles marilyn wright 
forged a special bond with her son she was honest about her drug 
problem and warned him to stay clean 
hes my life she told an interviewer last year hes my 
whole world in reality however drugs always rivaled larry for 
her attention 
mercer recalls the scene at the hospital after she had been 
shot 
as they were getting ready to take her upstairs to her room 
she looked at all of us and said take care of my son then she 
started crying with this real cry like i never like she used 
to cry when she was a little girl

the budget deal reached by the budget summiteers 
comes with the claim of 500 billion in savings over the next five 
years but that claim doesnt mean overall cuts in government 
spending 
government spending will continue to grow by 55 billion in 
fiscal 1991 a 45 percent rise and by 222 billion in the next 
five years an increase of 184 percent it will be financed mainly 
by taxing rather than cutting 
confusion over this aspect of the agreement between the white 
house and congressional leaders afflicts not just the public but 
tax and finance experts and members of congress some of whom might 
have been directly involved 
in many instances the cuts referred to are reductions in 
planned or proposed spending rather than actual spending medicare 
spending for instance will be cut by 46 billion but grow by 
44 billion in fiscal 1991 
on a more personal basis the monthly tax that senior citizens 
pay to medicare will be increased but the revenues so generated 
are counted in the agreement as a spending cut 
in a scorching criticism of the agreement scott hodge and 
daniel mitchell of the heritage foundation who supplied these 
figures claim negotiatiors sought to blunt negative reaction by 
conspiring to cook the books 
that term is sometimes used by companies to hide financial 
shenanigans from auditors and shareholders or to paint a 
rosierthanreal picture hodge and mitchell suggest that this 
seems to have been a goal of the negotiators too 
they contend that the agreement is the most successful use of 
blue smoke and mirrors to date by the budget summiteers and that 
few senators and congressmen can figure out what it is they are 
asked to vote on 
they conclude that in spite of the blue smoke the glare and the 
shadows it is quite clear that congress cannot control its 
spending and that by means of higher taxes it seeks to shift the 
burden from itself to the taxpayer 
the affect they say might be enough to push the country into a 
fullblown recession but that isnt the way the summitteers see 
it instead of slowing the economy they assume it will spur it to 
much greater growth 
should that growth double this years growth rate in 1991 and 
almost triple that rate in 1992 fail to develop so also will 
some of the alleged savings but at least two other dangers must be 
considered too 
1 congress could begin almost immediately to offset any true 
cuts with new spending measures the danger is real massive tax 
cuts early in the 1980s were entirely offset by massive spending 
well before the end of the decade 
2 the agreement assumes that the federal reserve board will be 
so impressed by the negotiators efforts that it will adopt an 
easier money policy which would mean lower interest rates 
but hodge and mitchell argue the agreement could worsen rather 
than lessen inflation if inflation worsens interest rates arent 
likely to fall and they say 25 billion of the alleged savings 
assume lower rates 
these are the ingredients of a spirited discussion for congress 
during which some of the hazier aspects might become clearer and 
any dangers to the economy be reexamined without the blinding 
glare of mirrors 
potentially the political damage could be worse the 
foundation a conservative think tank has strongly supported 
presidents reagan and bush and has had much intellectual input and 
influence in their administrations 
while hodge and mitchell might not speak for the entire 
foundation their views were distributed by it and so far as is 
known they remain in good standing

the los angeles basin has the dirtiest air in 
the nation and its one of the most populous metropolitan areas 
in this profile the fifth part of the occasional series city 
faces city fears a researcher talks about working and living 
with smog 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as bob phalens minivan climbs a freeway 
ramp on his 10mile commute to work he scans the sky to the east 
looking for milehigh saddleback mountain barely visible through 
thick los angeles basin smog 
this is where i judge the air each day its pretty dirty 
today says phalen who can tick off the pollutants nitrogen 
dioxide ozone acids soot and cancercausing chemicals 
dirty air depresses me but it reminds me i have a job to do 
there are millions of americans breathing this stuff 
phalen a 49yearold biophysicist and inhalation toxicologist 
directs the air pollution health effects laboratory at the 
university of california irvine the campus is on the southern 
edge of americas dirtiest smog zone metro los angeles 
every day in the lab where he and his team of jeansclad 
scientists manipulate smog exposure chambers treadmills fake 
noses and pollutionbreathing mannequins phalen examines polluted 
air with the detachment of a scientist 
but he breathes it too and so do his wife and two sons 
phalen the scientist speaks of the dangers we breathe dozens 
of carcinogens in every breath they build up in the body because 
ozone impairs the lungs selfcleansing abilities 
in heavily populated areas one in 10 or 20 people suffer 
because of air pollution headaches increased asthma attacks 
worsening of bronchitis and more frequent respiratory tract 
infections 
the most serious problems air pollution produce are not 
immediate symptoms but the contribution to lung disease the 
american lung association has estimated air pollution is a 
contributing factor in about 10 percent of human deaths in urban 
areas 
so how worried is he for his wife kathy his sons robert 21 
and steven 18 and himself 
yes smog sometimes causes burning eyes headaches and chest 
tightness during exercise yes kathy phalen said smog is 
depressing hanging like a big heavy brown blanket over the 
area 
but phalen views life as a balance between risks and benefits 
even he doesnt know how chronic exposure to smog affects his 
familys health but the phalens dont intend to leave southern 
california 
we have excellent food wonderful climate a good educational 
system a solid economy he said we have good medical services 
and a relatively relaxed lifestyle all these things promote good 
health 
its certainly not worth moving to get away from the smog 
barely an hour past breakfast at the lab now phalen plunges 
his gloved hands into a plastic tub of saline solution and pulls 
out a blackened human lung 
this is the lung of a smoker he said this particular 
person died of a heart attack the lungs werent suitable for 
transplantation they were in bad shape 
the lungs were donated for research in phalens laboratory 
blue silicone rubber was injected into one lung filling the 
airways and gradually congealing 
phalen submerges the lung into a tray of lye a few days later 
the lung is dissolved what remains is a lung cast a blue rubber 
mold of the branching airways even tiny ones 
phalen studies casts of human dog and ferret lungs to learn how 
age and bad air change the passageways that carry oxygen and 
pollutants into the body 
most environmental risks are through inhalation he said 
each day you drink two quarts of liquid you eat two quarts of 
food but you inhale 15000 quarts of air 
here and in other urban areas are two strains of pollution 
primary pollutants emitted by cars factories and power plants 
and secondary ones including ozone a very irritating gas 
created when sunlight triggers reactions among primary elements 
he believes the health risks of air pollution must be reduced by 
developing more efficient transportation better emission control 
systems for cars trucks power plants and industry and better 
ways of destroying our wastes 
but phalen opposes confrontation politics hatred is the 
worst pollution he said and doesnt consider polluters bad 
guys 
air pollution is not created by malicious toxic polluters 
he said its created by our automobiles our industry and our 
generation of electricity its a consequence of our modern 
society and that society appears to be responsible for adding 
approximately 40 years to our lifespan when we compare ourselves 
with completely undeveloped countries 
again risks and benefits 
phalen got interested in the health effects of environmental 
contaminants years ago his masters and doctoral theses examined 
how silver from the walls of a nuclear reactor where an explosion 
occurred got into the lungs of rescue workers 
he had been steered toward a scientific career by an 
pharmacistuncle who admired einstein he showed me that through 
knowledge you can do something about a problem phalen said 
you dont have to just be a victim suffer and die 
which brings him to the role of his lab now to identify 
particularly hazardous pollutants and combinations of pollutants 
and target them for control 
john r holmes research director of californias air resources 
board said phalens 15member team is responsible for several 
breakthroughs including assessments of how human health is 
affected by mixtures of pollutants 
our air will be cleaner eventually as a result of what bob 
phalen and his colleagues have done and the nation will benefit 
too said holmes 
he credited phalen with finding that children absorb much higher 
doses of air pollution than adults and with showing how ozone 
hinders breathing which allowed california to justify the nations 
toughest ozone standard 
phalen and his colleagues invented many of the innovative 
testing tools used in the lab the fake noses for example 
polluted air is pumped through the noses rubber cylinders with 
carved channels to simulate breathing showing how much pollution 
reaches the lungs and how much is deposited inside the nose where 
some contaminants can cause nasal cancer 
we have 40 techniques for making smog including tanks of 
pollutants an ozone machine a diesel engine and a sootproducing 
propane burner he said 
rats and ferrets breathe the noxious air sometimes while 
walking on treadmills for studies on the effects of pollution and 
exercise 
phalens use of animals made him a target of the animal 
liberation front which raided his lab in january 1988 and stole 13 
beagles 
the raid ended his studies with dogs phalen acknowledged that 
40 beagles had been euthanized in one study but he called the raid 
ironic saying he always advocated humane treatment of research 
animals and either adopted or found homes for dozens of beagles 
whose research careers were over 
he has a former laboratory dog at home now until recently 
there was another one a 15yearold beagle slowed by malignant 
tumors and arthritis 
daphne was our friend and its painful to remember her not 
being alive said phalen who took the old dog to the lab one 
morning played with her one last time on the lawn then held and 
petted her while a technician put her to sleep 
afterward the dogs lungs were removed and injected with 
silicone rubber 
its a beautiful cast phalen said

some people march against world hunger 
some people give to charity others join the peace corps 
glenn hawkes he makes chili 
hunger is the next wall to fall said hawkes a longtime 
peace and antinuclear activist i wanted to start a company that 
would be dedicated to a single social cause eliminating hunger 
so hawkes a former elementary school principal and founder of 
parents and teachers for social responsibility took out a 35000 
mortgage on his house and started food 2000 inc which aims to end 
world hunger by the year 2000 
food 2000 makes a product called chili 2000 the chili which is 
packaged in a reusable glass jar is sold to stores across the 
country for every 12 jars sold one or the value of one is 
given away to a local hunger group 
socially responsible diners need not confine themselves to a 
diet of chili these days altruistic businesses now make cookies 
buttercruch candy tea salad dressing spaghetti sauce and other 
comestibles sell them to the public and then donate a percentage 
of their profits to heal societal wounds 
business was always the bugaboo of the peace activists but 
that was a horrendous mistake said hawkes being antibusiness 
slowed down any progress and cut off our strength 
hawkes was inspired by another vermont business ben amp jerrys 
homemade which regularly donates money ice cream and marketing 
expertise to causes 
the companys primary purpose is to use the power and 
creativity of business to be a force for social change said ben 
cohen one of the founders of ben amp jerrys and president of the 
separate community products inc 
community products makes rainforest crunch a buttercrunch 
candy the company buys cashews and brazil nuts straight from the 
brazilian indian growers building demand for the nuts and 
eliminating the middle man increasing growers earnings 3 to 10 
percent 
the company donates 40 percent of its pretax profits to 
organizations working to save the worlds rain forests 
another 20 percent goes to one percent for peace inc a 
nonprofit organization founded by cohen that wants the government 
to devote the equivalent of 1 percent of the us military budget 
to ventures that promote understanding between cultures 
the nuts that arent used in candy go into ben and jerrys 
rainforest crunch ice cream and the powdery residue that remains 
after the nuts are crunched soon will be used as an ingredient in 
chocolate chip cookies 
those cookies will be made be glassmans greyston bakery a 
company owned and operated by zen buddhists 
the bakerys goodies are available in 300 gourmet shops 
nationwide and its brownies are used in ben and jerrys fudge 
brownie ice cream it plans to use some of its profits to renovate 
buildings near its yonkers ny factory and turn them over to the 
homeless 
the ben amp jerry social action cluster is not alone a growing 
list of companies hope to prove that the path to grocery shelves 
and profits can be paved with good intentions 
newmans own inc actor paul nwman founded his company in 1982 
to market his gourmet salad dressing it also makes spaghetti 
sauce popcorn and lemonade donating 100 percent of its profits 
in 1989 the company gave about 7 million to 320 organizations 
with 600000 going to aidsrelated charities across the country 
thats what makes this business such a kick this mutually 
beneficial recycling from the haves to the havenots said 
newman 
the stash tea co of portland ore sells allnatural earl 
grey herbal peppermint camomile and other teas ten cents a 
package goes to unicef for oral rehydration therapy a solution of 
water sugar and salts that combat dehydration dehydration is the 
largest cause of death in developing nations 
information about the therapy is put on store displays and in 
the companys mailorder catalog response from the public has been 
solid 
we get positive feedback from the store managers as well as 
the customers said general manager thomas lisicki 
thousand stars inc like ben amp jerrys makes ice cream 
frozen yogurt and novelty bars and like ben amp jerrys this 
2yearold business is concerned about the rain forests 
one percent of the proceeds from most of the companys products 
go to two lobbying groups that advocate the accountability from 
corporations and governments for rainforest destruction 
from the companys base in junction city ore we see the 
destruction of logging if you live in la you dont see the 
lumber trucks carting the trees away said founder and owner mark 
brawerman we chose to focus on one area rather than be 
insignificant in several 
he questions why a fledgling company such as his should be one 
of a handful that contribute to social concerns where is the 
rest of corporate america 
but hawkes says there are changes blowing in the wind he said 
even the big corporations which do not have a primary agenda of 
social change are seeing that such practices sell 
its a neat example of capitalism he said some of it is 
going to be shallow of course but we ought to welcome even the 
most greedy enterprise that puts stakes in a service to society

a rebel group that came into existence 
during the former military regime is now baffling the new civilian 
government with indiscriminate attacks and an ideology that 
promotes marxism and sexual promiscuity 
officials say the lautaro front is composed of about 100 
hardcore commandoes and an estimated 5000 followers mostly 
youngsters recruited from big city slums and middleclass high 
schools who are too young to be legally prosecuted 
the group takes its name from lautaro a mapuche indian chief 
who fought the spanish conquerors of chile five centuries ago and 
police say it is unlike any other radical group in latin america 
the lautaro under the motto everything for the people not 
only promotes armed struggle and marxist revolution but also total 
sexual freedom police say the latter is a strategy to attract 
youth and that its working 
some of the groups strategies include robbing drug stores of 
condoms and contraceptives then giving them away at schools 
colleges and slums 
recently a commando of the front even took to distributing 
female underwear for free at a santiago college 
an alleged leader of the front identified only as felipe 
interviewed by a leftist newsgazine explained the groups approach 
to sex its our invitation to youth we urge them to be happy 
here and now we dont call this free sex we call it our sex 
the front often robs supermarkets and food trucks then hands 
out poultry milk and other supplies in slums 
still its a violent group authorities say it has killed at 
least 10 police officers in random attacks the last two years last 
august a commando sprayed a police bus with submachinegun fire 
leaving two officers dead one of the victims was an 18yearold 
rookie officer 
all cops are our enemies read a pamphlet left in the attack 
site 
the targets for the front attacks also vary greatly since the 
beginning of the year the front has claimed responsibility for 
most of the 46 bomb attacks against mormon chapels across chile 
causing widespread damage but no victims 
in leaflets found at the attacked chapels the front called the 
mormon church a tool of yankee imperialism 
police have been stymied in their investigation of the groups 
activities with one officer saying these are indeed very 
strange people 
speaking on condition of anonymity the investigator said 
once we arrested a front member during a supermarket robbery 
attempt after a week of fruitless questioning we had to give up 
the man simply wouldnt open his mouth 
another arrested guerrilla the officer said claimed 
responsibility for killing a police officer 
it was chilling he said he told us he had indeed shot 
the man and he added that immediately after the attack he went to 
the movies with his girlfriend 
interior minister enrique krauss said recently that the 
government is certainly worried about the group activities 
but he claimed it has been losing strength in recent weeks 
his justice colleague francisco cumplido warned though that 
there is a real risk in the fronts continued recruiting of 
high school students 
jorge roman president of the chilean high school students 
federation said the fronts recruiters aim mainly at students aged 
15 to 17 because according to the law they are juveniles and 
their legal responsibility is limited 
acting education minister raul allard said his office will 
launch a campaign of orientation to counter the fronts 
recruiting efforts in the schools 
explained claudio orrego president of the santiago catholic 
university students federation we must make young people to 
understand that violence is not democratic or heroic they must 
understand that the country is no longer under a dictatorship 
the lautaro front was organized in the mid1980s to fight the 
military regime of gen augusto pinochet to the chagrin of the 
elected civilian government it has remained active after pinochet 
was succeeded in march by president patricio aylwin 
the goverment change did not impress the front which has vowed 
to continue its struggle calling aylwin a bourgeois enemy 
another guerrilla group created to fight the pinochet regime 
the manuel rodriguez patriotic front has virtually ceased 
operations as a result of the new political situation in chile

every day gloyce qualls lives with a cruel 
choice she made six years ago she traded her fertility for her 
job she felt agony then she feels anger now 
i regret it all the time she said its something i had 
to do to keep my job i wouldnt do it again id tell them take 
this job and shove it 
mrs qualls works at milwaukeebased johnson controls inc the 
nations largest auto battery manufacturer whose policy of barring 
fertile women from potentially risky jobs has triggered debate from 
the factory floor up to the us supreme court 
on wednesday labor and business clash in the high court over 
big issues civil rights privacy safety women in the workplace 
and some say big stakes by one estimate 20 million jobs could 
be offlimits to females 
its an enormously important case said ellen vargyas an 
attorney at the national womens law center we have women moving 
into the work force making some gains it could be a major 
setback 
international union et al vs johnson controls called 
possibly the most important sexdiscrimination case in decades 
focuses on one fourletter word lead the raw material used in 
auto batteries is a potential hazard to fetuses and the basis for 
johnsons 8yearold fetal protection policy 
that policy doesnt encourage women to have themselves 
sterilized and in fact johnson says it strongly advises against 
it but mrs qualls said she had a tubal ligation to qualify for a 
highersalary job because i needed the money frankly 
johnson says banning women who can bear children from jobs in 
highlead areas is protection but the united auto workers 
representing many of the workers says its prejudice 
it violates civil rights the uaw contends and relegates women 
to lowerpaying jobs with little chance for promotion 
its plainly sex discrimination said joan bertin of the 
american civil liberties union in new york city if you have a 
health and safety problem you fix the workplace not the worker 
if something made your spleen become infected at work you wouldnt 
say well only take workers who dont have spleens 
men some of whom work with their wives at johnsons 13 battery 
plants also face lead hazards workers note 
if it was health they would be concerned about all people 
argued judy seymore a milwaukee worker i think the woman is a 
scapegoat 
in fact one man is a named plaintiff in the classaction suit 
he sought to reduce his lead levels because he intended to become a 
father 
scientists have linked reduced male fertility and high lead 
exposure but johnson notes that there are no conclusive studies on 
a fathers impact on a fetus 
johnson which has spent 15 milion on improvements from 
197985 argues conditions are safe for men and women but not for 
unborn children 
doctors say low lead levels can cause premature babies and minor 
birth defects while high doses can be devastating 
we think it would be wrong to knowingly expose fetuses to 
physical harm that is the no 1 overwhelming issue why that policy 
is in place said johnson spokeswoman denise zutz the goal is 
for there not to be a single tragedy 
the ban applies to all fertile women not just those pregnant 
because lead can remain in the body long periods zutz said 
johnson also dismisses accusations it is motivated by fears of 
lawsuits 
having shareholders it would be wrong of us not to be aware 
of that concern zutz said but adds thats not johnsons guiding 
principle 
they were acting out of the purest motives said stephen 
bokat general counsel at the us chamber of commerce one of 
several business religious and industrial groups supporting 
johnson it wasnt somebodys idea to get rid of women 
if not the intent its the result workers claim they say 
theres little incentive to join johnson since fertile women now 
hired are ineligible for topscale jobs at the companys 13 plants 
located in california delaware florida illinois kentucky north 
carolina michigan missouri ohio oregon texas vermont and 
wisconsin 
though johnson says fewer than 20 women were transferred when 
the policy became mandatory and that all retained their salaries 
workers say they lost overtime shift differentials and promotion 
opportunities 
i have been denied the pay potential i am capable of earning 
because i am a woman said catherine voeltner a 32yearold 
milwaukee worker three years ago she said some men in lead areas 
earned 9 to 10 an hour while she made 550 and had more 
seniority 
it makes me mad very mad said voeltner an 11year johnson 
veteran a lot of women out there are losing 100 a week in 
takehome pay thats a lot of money when youre trying to raise a 
family 
other women say theyve been stripped of their dignity 
virginia green a bennington vt worker was 50 and long done 
with childbearing when she was transferred to a glorified laundry 
job was i angry youd better believe it she said she 
considered sterilization but said her doctor told her it was too 
dangerous 
this isnt the first protest of such rules at least 15 major 
corporations have fetal protection policies and lawsuits have been 
filed by hospital technicians factory and auto workers the aclu 
says among the companies with such policies are general motors 
corp monsanto corp and dupont 
in 1983 the aclu reached an outofcourt settlement in a 
discrimination suit against the american cyanamid co on behalf of 
several women workers at a west virginia plant 
five women were sterilized to keep their jobs in a paint 
pigments section which closed within two years of their surgery 
the aclus bertin said 
betty riggs then a 26yearold mother facing divorce and 
helping to support her ailing parents is haunted by her 
sterilization 
ive wished a 100 million times i could change what 
happened she said me and my second husband could have had a 
family of our own we never will they deprived us of a normal 
family life 
gloyce qualls 41 has similar feelings 
sometimes i see a lady pregnant my age i get mad at myself 
for doing it she said sometimes i feel bad and i say well 
i did what i had to do 
mrs qualls is unclear whether staff reductions or the policy 
prompted her transfer from a highlead area but whentthe chance 
arose to return to that department she couldnt if she were 
fertile 
she was in her mid30s and about to be married to a man with 
four children though they wanted a baby together and she had 
received some money to compensate for the transfer bringing home 
less than 200 a week wasnt going to make it it wasnt going to 
pay the bills she said 
her husband ike who also works at the plant her friends and 
sister opposed surgery 
its very unfair she now says bouncing her granddaughter 
on her knee the company ought not to have nothing to do with 
your body

these controversial choice and reproduction issues already have 
been debated in court with conflicting rulings 
this year the california supreme court upheld a ruling against 
johnson in which a lower court said in part we are in an era of 
choice a woman is not required to become a victorian brood mare 
but in 1989 the 7th circuit court of appeals supported johnson 
saying it is reasonably necessary to the industrial safetybased 
concern of protecting the unborn child from lead exposure 
judge frank easterbrook dissented in that ruling being appealed 
to the high court he called it likely the most important 
sexdiscrimination case since the 1964 enactment of title vii 
which barred sexual bias in employment 
some business leaders say the potential impact is exaggerated 
but mrs seymore disagrees 
im not fighting only for me she said this is for all 
women

by choice or necessity plants that use little 
water are growing enormously in popularity in the southwest where 
drought and soaring water costs drive home the message of current 
or potential water shortages 
but be warned they dont become droughtresistant until theyve 
become established in your landscape which may take a couple of 
years 
so while their reputation for needing little care and little 
water is well justified you cant just bring one home from the 
nursery dig a hole put it in and you and the plant live happily 
ever after 
start by doing some research for longterm satisfaction check 
first the vast amount of shade and color possible then be sure the 
plant is suited for the location being considered 
will it eventually become too large for available space if it 
sheds leaves seed pods and other litter will this be a problem 
such as around a pool or patio can it reasonably be expected to 
handle environmental stress sun wind heat or cold it must 
tolerate in the contemplated site 
take your time in this study reference books talk to experts 
a species ideal in one part of your landscape may prove a nightmare 
elsewhere unlike some clothes one size definitely doesnt fit all 
situations 
fall normally is the best time to plant most trees and shrubs in 
warmarid areas strange as this may sound to newcomers accustomed 
to snow and freezing temperatures 
not too much top growth may show initially but the root growth 
will get the plant ready for the tripledigit temperatures and 
drying winds of the following summer early spring is the next best 
time for planting especially for coldtender ones 
a newly installed plant should be watered about every other week 
in cooler weather and once or twice a week through the warmest 
months for the first year or two if its making satisfactory 
growth and looks healthy back off to determine whether 
supplemental watering still is required 
if the plant seems to start suffering apply an inch or two of 
water and see if this helps if it does wait about a month to see 
if another watering is needed once droughtresistant plants are 
established watering can be reduced dramatically 
in general overwatering is a serious problem for 
droughtresistant plants once established they simply cant 
handle constantly moist soil but natural rainfall may not be 
sufficient in some years either 
wilted foliage usually is a good indication of too little water 
sometimes the leaf color becomes dull it takes practice to 
determine such nuances 
new plants should be watered before they reach this stage a 
good rule to remember established plants probably wont die from 
lack of irrigation they just wont grow very fast or look as well 
make sure to apply water slowly and deeply as a rough rule of 
thumb one inch of water on the surface will wet the soil one foot 
deep thus deep slow watering promotes root development at lower 
soil levels which helps minimize plant problems in hot weather 
deep watering also works to flush soil salts from the root zone 
this is important since salt content of aridregion soils normally 
is quite high 
once droughtresistant plants are established do you 
automatically turn off the water in certain cases yes for 
example if a tree has reached its desired size and can get by on 
natural rainfall stop watering it 
when fertilizing remember that nitrogen is the one element 
consistently missing in most arid region soils most 
droughtresistant plants once established need little if any 
fertilizer as in watering once established are the key words 
a small amount of slowrelease fertilizer following label 
directions helps at planting time then if the plants are putting 
on the growth and providing the landscaping effect you want they 
probably dont need any 
after all many are native to areas where soil nitrogen is low 
owing to sparse vegetation where little organic matter is recycled 
into the soil many experts believe that stimulating growth through 
fertilizer reduces the lifespan of many aridadapted plants and as 
plants increase their growth rate they require more water and more 
maintenance such as pruning 
ammonium sulfate is an inexpensive readily available fertilizer 
containing 21 percent nitrogen and 24 percent sulfur as a general 
rule 2 ounces of ammonium sulfate a year is sufficient nitrogen 
for even a goodsized shrub under warmarid conditions 
the sulfur also lowers the ph a most important consideration in 
areas with alkaline soil such as much of the southwest

a sigh of relief sounded on wall street after 
the bush administration and leaders of congress finally compromised

accord was that it exists 
i think the financial markets are grateful that the issue is 
going to be put behind us for a while said david h resler 
chief economist at nomura securities international inc

overall economy

the gannett foundation has rejected a 540 
million bid from the gannett co to buy its 10 percent block of the 
media giants stock 
martin f birmingham chairman of the foundations finance and 
investment committee said monday that the foundation gannetts 
largest shareholder had authorized the investment firm of salomon 
brothers to seek other offers 
the current depressed market price of gannett stock does not 
represent the true value of the company birmingham said it 
would be irresponsible for the trustees to accept this 
unsatisfactory at the market bid 
the bid dated sept 14 was 3387 per share for a total value 
of about 540 million 
the foundation had told the company that no substantive talks 
with interested third parties would take place as long as serious 
negotiations were going on with the company 
douglas h mccorkindale gannett cos chief financial officer 
agreed the companys stock was undervalued because of the recent 
downturn in advertising revenue 
despite the foundations rejection gannett co was still a 
ready willing and able buyer of the stock he said 
mccorkindale said gannett was not worried that having such a 
large block of stock up for grabs could make the company a 
potential takeover target because financing a takeover in todays 
market is much much more difficult than it was two three or four 
years ago 
he cited the decline of the junk bond market that financed a 
number of takeovers in the 1980s 
he also noted that gannett has a shareholder rights offering 
plan that would kick in after somebody acquires 15 percent of the 
stock the plan would make it prohibitively expensive for a suitor 
to acquire more shares 
john morton a newspaper analysts with lynch jones amp ryan in 
washington agreed that gannett co was the most likely buyer to 
pay a premium over market price 
if they the foundation couldnt get the price they wanted 
from gannett i think its unlikely theyre going to get it from 
anybody else said morton 
its not as though gannett is a company thats considered a 
prime candidate for a takeover takeoverprone companies normally 
are those that have not satisfied their shareholders with financial 
performance over the years you cannot say that about gannett he 
said 
gannett stock closed at 3287 monday up 2 on the new york 
stock exchange 
the foundation had told the company that no substantive talks 
with interested third parties would take place as long as serious 
negotiations were going on with the company 
birmingham said the company made its bid for the foundations 
block of nearly 16 million shares after foundation officials asked 
for its best offer in writing 
he said the market value of the stock was about 800 million at 
the thirdquarter high a year earlier 
since last year many factors have contributed to the decline 
of gannett stock including the companys first down quarter since 
it went public in 1967 and its gloomy predictions about 1990 
earnings overall birmingham said 
the foundation was established in 1935 as an independent entity 
with controlling ownership of the company since the company went 
public the percentage of ownership by the foundation has declined 
to its current 10 percent

the securities and exchange commission will 
get new powers to curb penny stock abuse and fine lawbreakers under 
a reform bill passed unanimously by the house 
the same bill was passed by the senate last week paving the way 
for it to be signed into law by president bush 
the house also unanimously passed another bill monday that would 
enhance the secs ability to cooperate with foreign securities 
regulators in the investigation of international fraud cases 
we have begun to reverse the rapacious and deregulatory 1980s 
with proper legislative protections for the small investor said 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house subcommittee 
that oversees the sec markey was one of the penny stock bills 
sponsors 
while these bills wont make us forget the 1980s were the 
decade of greed they will at least begin the process of making the 
1990s a safer decade for the small investor he added 
sec chairman richard c breeden who lobbied hard for the reform 
bills said he was pleased they passed because they help the sec 
protect the markets stability and deter fraud by providing more 
flexibile enforcement 
an earlier senate version did not contain a penny stock 
provision but was similar in most other ways to the securities 
enforcement and penny stock reform act passed by the house on july 
23 a compromise bill including penny stock provisions was passed 
unanimously by the senate last week after a month of negotiations 
between house and senate staffers 
the new bill will give the sec the authority to bar crooked 
promoters and consultants from selling penny stocks highly 
speculative securities that sell for a few dollars or less 
while not illegal penny stocks are prone to fraud and are 
considered to be very risky at best they are usually not traded on 
any stock exchange and thus information amount them is hard to 
come by 
the bill also would tighten disclosure requirements for some 
types of penny stocks 
it also would 
give the sec the power to order alleged wrongdoers to cease 
and desist illegal activities without first having to go to court 
and obtain a restraining order 
widen sec authority to seek court orders barring convicted 
securities law violators from serving as officers or directors of 
companies with publiclytraded stock 
enact numerous reforms in the selling of penny stocks 
authorize new civil penalties for securities violators of up 
to 100000 per violation for an individual and up to 500000 for 
companies and other entities 
previously the sec had the power to impose fines only in 
insider trading cases for other violations such as fraudulent 
sales techniques the agency had no midlevel sanction it could 
only enjoin violators from repeating their activities or revoke 
their license which some have called the regulatory equivalent of 
the death penalty 
mondays vote follows house and senate approval of another 
reform bill last week that will allow the sec to regulate the 
controversial computerized strategy of program trading in times of 
extreme market turbulence 
that bill also would give the sec authority to monitor large 
stock trades and the parent holding companies of brokerages it 
would also allow the agency to close the markets with the 
presidents approval in market emergencies

the jeweler cartier is crying foul the elderly are worried and 
a liquor distributor says bootleggers are apt to move in on his 
territory because of the new taxes and cutbacks in the proposed 
500 billion deficitreduction plan 
bush sure made a big deal about reading his lips didnt he 
grumbled curtis sine a barber in ottumwa iowa 
the plan unveiled sunday calls for 134 billion in new taxes on 
gasoline alcohol tobacco airline tickets and other luxury items 
and includes 105 billion in spending reductions for benefit 
programs such as medicare 
some around the country shrugged off higher taxes monday saying 
the deficit must be brought under control sine wasnt one of them 
it sounds terrible but frankly id like the other guy to pay 
for it i think generally thats how people think he said 
mark sherman owner of spirit world liquor store in omaha neb 
said people are going to drink less and drink better the actual 
gallonage we sell is going to go down 
and jack hooper president of the tennessee wine and spirits 
co a major distributor said bootleggers will benefit from the 
higher alcohol tax we run the risk of making legitimate 
businesses more expensive he said 
the taxes would be used to dig politicians in washington out of 
a hole which they dug through fiscal irresponsibility said 
virginia gov l douglas wilder 
the individuals who will bear overwhelmingly the burden of 
this agreement are the majority of americans the hardworking 
middle class and americans in need the poor among us he said 
joe crosby 71 of el paso texas said hes one of those 
people 
im a disabled im on social security and medicare theyre 
hurting me when they do all of that he said 
ralph destino chairman of swanky cartier said smaller jewelry 
makers and retailers will be hurt this notion that somehow or 
other taxing jewelry is in the soak the rich category just isnt 
borne out by the facts in this country he said 
bernard hargrove who sells boats at his red river marine in 
heber springs ark complained of new fees on boats thats 
ridiculous lets charge them an annual fee to play golf or go 
watch a football game or whatever he said 
mando guerra a patron at midtown lounge in el paso texas 
wasnt concerned about the higher alcohol taxes but said his 
grandmother receives medicare benefits its going to hurt a 
whole lot of old people he said 
the agreement would boost the federal gasoline tax from 9 cents 
per gallon to 21 cents by next summer 
look at this im already paying 166 said richard 
coleman a printer from west haven conn who was pumping premium 
unleaded at a station the state has the nations highest state tax 
at 22 cents a gallon theyre hitting the middle class again 
truckers cried foula lot of these truck drivers operate just 
down to the bare teeth now as far as profit margin is concerned 
this is gonna hurt em bill gussett said from the flying j truck 
stop in la grande ore 
higher gas taxes dont worry bob muscatell who sells motor 
homes and recreational vehicles in santa clara calif 
ive always taken the position the rv buyers are not concerned 
about the cost of the gasoline he said even if gas costs 2 
a gallon and you want to go on a trip with your family its still 
cheaper than flying and other means of transportation 
ford motor co and chrysler corp said the gasolinetax increase 
is difficult but good for the country 
the nation needs a meaningful budgetreduction package said 
susan shackson ford director of public policy development is 
this the best one probably not but we are where we are i would 
say at this point lets get on with it

the united auto workers turned their attention to 
ford motor co today after the unions contract with general motors 
corp won overwhelming approval from the uaw rank and file 
the uaw hopes to get ford to adopt the contract with little or 
no change negotiations with ford were to resume today for the 
first time since aug 28 when the union chose to focus on gm to 
set a pattern contract for the industry 
we want to get on with this thing ford spokesman dick routh 
said monday 
workers at gm factories and offices in 29 states ratified the 
threeyear pact 86032 votes to 21461 the union said monday only 
a third of the 300000 members eligible to vote cast ballots last 
week and sunday 
the light turnout reflected satisfaction with the agreement 
former uaw vice president irving bluestone said 
when people are upset thats when they come out to vote in 
droves he said 
its expected that ford will be able to sign a parallel 
contract perhaps within a couple of weeks 
under the gmuaw agreement gm will spend up to 41 billion to 
guarantee the income of laidoff workers the contract also calls 
for a 3 percent raise the first year and lumpsum payments of 3 
percent in the following years 
reports have said that if the incomeguarantee provision is 
carried over to ford it could cost that company about 14 
billion ford however streamlined its work force several years 
before gm and might have smaller obligations 
the story might be significantly different when the talks shift 
to chrysler corp possibly by the end of the month 
chrysler is in the worst financial shape by far of the big three 
and has said the gm agreement seems expensive later this month 
chrysler is expected to report what could be a thirdquarter loss 
of more than 200 million 
the big three contracts cover about 463000 workers in all the 
contracts expired sept 14 but their terms were extended while 
talks continued

support of the deficitreduction package but the amount of the 
decline is likely to disappoint the bush administration and not be 
enough to keep the country out of a recession private economists 
predict 
these analysts said rising inflationary pressures from a 
doubling of oil prices will severely limit the feds maneuvering 
room despite administration contentions that interest rates need to 
fall swiftly in order to stave off an economic slump 
the feds top policymakers gathered in washington today for a 
key meeting of the federal open market committee or fomc the 
panel composed of fed board members in washington and fed regional 
presidents meets eight times a year to map the course of interest 
rates 
while the results of the closeddoor deliberations are not 
released for six weeks many economists said they expected a vote 
by the fomc to nudge shortterm interest rates down by onefourth 
of a percentage point 
for his part president bush on monday reminded the federal 
reserve of his keen interest in seeing lower interest rates and he 
predicted that the weekend budget deal once enacted by congress 
would trigger rate declines 
i would look to the federal reserve to lower the rates 
once they see that a sound budget agreement has been put into 
effect bush told reporters in new york 
both the administration and congressional negotiators are hoping 
to complete action on the budget cuts and tax increases by oct 19 
although the legislative outcome was far from certain 
many analysts said final passage of the deficitcutting package 
would likely be the trigger for fed rate cuts although some said 
the reduction could come sooner especially if fridays report on 
the unemployment situation for september shows widespread weakness 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has pledged several 
times to support a credible deficit reduction package indicating 
that the central bank would move to offset the negative effects of 
lower government spending and higher taxes by reducing interest 
rates 
greenspan has got to ease if he doesnt he is telling the 
financial markets that he doesnt view the deficit agreement as 
credible said david wyss chief financial economist at 
drimcgraw hill 
but wyss and other economists said they were not looking for 
much more than a 025 percentage point drop in the federal funds 
rate the rate now 8 percent is the interest that banks charge 
each other on overnight loans 
some economists said that while small a 025 percentage point 
drop would likely prod commercial banks to lower their benchmark 
prime lending rate to 95 percent 
the prime rate which is used as the base for setting many 
consumer and business loans has been at 10 percent since january 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said markets 
should not expect anything beyond a small easing move on the feds 
part because of the rising inflationary pressures buffeting the 
us economy 
the fed is being tossed back and forth by the iraqi event 
sinai said it wants to ease because of an impending recession 
but aggressive easing is very hard to do as long as the inflation 
threat is as great as it is 
sinai and other economists said they viewed a recession starting 
this year as all but inevitable despite the feds belated move to 
lower interest rates 
the handwriting is on the wall the fed has already waited too 
long if it had hoped to avoid a recession said david jones an 
economist at aubrey g lanston amp co 
jones said he was looking for the first downturn since the 
198182 slump to begin in the next three months and to last for a 
full year 
many analysts said they looked for further rate cuts by the fed 
early next year as the extent and severity of the recession become 
known 
an economic downturn would call into question the economic 
assumptions underlying the new budget agreement and make the 
agreements deficitequalscutting 
goals that much harder to obtain 
the administrations new forecast predicts the overall economy 
as measured by the gross national product will grow by 13 percent 
in 1991 nearly double the 07 percent gnp rate forecast for this 
year 
but economists noted that the economic outlook was based on an 
assumption that oil prices will average 2415 per barrel in 1991 
far lower than current average of nearly 40 per barrel

for global economies an empty barrel of oil can 
be as scary as the loaded barrel of a gun 
no shots have been exchanged yet in the persian gulf but war 
jitters have nearly doubled the price of crude oil to almost 40 a 
barrel since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
in new york the stock market fell 15 percent to its lowest 
point in 16 months before rebounding somewhat monday after the 
federal budget compromise was reached the tokyo market is even 
worse plummeting about onethird and reaching a level below that 
of the 1987 crash before regaining part of the loss today in 
london stocks are down about more than 10 percent 
so what happens if the real thing breaks out and bullets start 
flying in the worlds richest oilfields what if iraqi missiles 
strike pipelines pumping stations oil ports or tankers in saudi 
arabia what if poison gas or germ warfare scatters oilfield 
workers 
it is not just thousands of lives that are at stake in a 
shooting war there is a risk of a real cataclysm for the global 
economy said christopher flavin vice president of research at 
worldwatch institute a policy research organization 
worldwatchs projected casualty list means worldwide gas 
rationing the financial collapse of developing countries outright 
failure of the economic reforms in eastern europe and a severe 
shock to the world banking system 
many experts believe doomsday anxieties are unfounded because 
iraq is unlikely to knock out saudi exports the iraqis repeatedly 
tried but failed to cripple irans kharg island loading terminal in 
an eightyear war and iran had nothing resembling the usled 
hightech shield protecting saudi arabia 
but iraq has vowed to fight the mother of all battles the 
strait of hormuz could become choked with mines terrorists could 
unleash hit squads and kamikaze pilots could fly missions against 
oil terminals or tankers 
and even though iran fought a bloody war with iraq iranians are 
again shouting death to america so who knows what they might 
do 
grab the financial flak jackets 
the world bank estimates a shooting war would boost oil prices 
to 65 a barrel worldwatch said war could bring 80 prices and 
the former saudi oil minister among others said it might even hit 
100 
superexpensive oil would trigger a financial chain reaction the 
immediate spike could mean gas pump prices of 250 a gallon or 
higher soaring electric bills and higher airline fares prices 
would climb on oilbased products such as plastics 
pharmaceuticals synthetic clothing and asphalt 
there would also be the likely double whammy of recession the 
united states the worlds biggest oil user has 6 percent of the 
worlds population and 3 percent of its oil reserves but consumes 
26 percent of its oil 
in a pinch people are less likely to make major purchases such 
as cars houses major appliances and discretionary clothing 
a shooting war hits the consumer section very hard said 
roger brinner chief economist for drimcgraw hill theres a 
double blow to the economy from oil price shocks the direct hit of 
weaker purchasing power and a confidence shock 
we were near a recession we didnt need another shove in that 
direcion brinner said 
one other nasty effect of recession is joblessness 
saddam hussein is going to throw a lot of people out of 
work said joel popkin a consultant and inflation expert in 
washington 
popkin figures that every 10 increase in the price of a barrel 
of oil means a 1 percent increase in the consumer price index just 
in higher fuel costs plus another 1 percent over six to nine 
months in ripple effects 
if the conflict is protracted without a definite conclusion 
oil prices are likely to stay around 40 for a year popkin said 
the country would definitely be cast into a recession of some 
magnitude not just a shallow dip 
complicating matters are budget and trade deficits the savings 
and loan bailout and shaky banking 
edwin rothchild of citizen action a washington consumer group 
said of the aftershocks of a shooting war youre talking about 
stagflation of enormous proportions its going to be a disaster 
worldwide 
two oil shocks in the 1970s caused gas lines hoarding limited 
rationing and trucker discontent 
but the united states is more dependent than ever on foreign 
oil it imports half its daily consumption of 16 million barrels a 
day onefourth of the imports come from the persian gulf a 
powderkeg atop twothirds of the worlds oil reserves 
sixtyfour percent of japans oil and 42 percent of europes 
oil excluding great britain comes from there 
there is one buffer a 590 million barrel reserve in salt 
caverns of louisiana and texas which president bush has tapped to 
calm jitters the reserve equals 73 days of all imports 
japan also has an oil reserve and has done a much better job 
since the 1973 embargo virtually all the countrys energy is 
imported but it has reduced its dependency on oil for energy from 
77 percent to 57 percent by developing nuclear power and 
conserving 
japan is the most efficient energy user among developed 
countries according to one western analyst the united states uses 
25 times the commercial energy per person than japan

apple computer and sony corp are discussing ways 
to expand their business ties a move which analysts expect will 
lead to a strong alliance between the two divergent hightech 
companies 
officials from the two firms however refused tuesday to 
confirm reports that they are negotiating an agreement for sony to 
make personal computers in japan to be marketed under apples name 
a sony official confirmed that the companies were engaged in 
talks but said final details on the products and production volumes 
were not yet decided 
sony now produces computer disk drives and displays for apple 
at a board meeting held in tokyo last week apple chief 
executive officer john sculley told reporters that his company is 
seeking further ties with japanese firms as it tries to expand its 
still limited presence in the japanese market 
apple was particularly interested in miniaturization sculley 
said he also said his firm lacked a lowpriced portable booksize 
computer in its product line 
booksize computers are one of the fastest growing segments of 
japans computer market 
sony known best for its audiovisual and electronics devices 
has been unsuccessful in its attempt to break into the personal 
computer market said darrel e whitten an analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
a tie with apple could give it access to the american companys 
advanced multimedia computing expertise and an opportunity to study 
programming he said 
in turn apples achilles heel has been its manufacturers 
cost and an agreement with sony would give it greater control 
he said 
chuck goto a technology analyst for sg warburg securities 
japan said computer hardware makers such as apple have become 
more dependent on integrated circuit technology one of sonys 
strengths the japanese company also could offer experience in 
converting analog to digital processes he said

the house has sent legislation to president 
bush that would reinstate limits on commercial advertising on 
childrens television shows 
the bush administration opposes the legislation saying it would 
create new and extremely serious first amendment problems 
involving free speech 
the bill was approved on voice vote monday in the house without 
dissent it also has been approved by the senate 
the legislation would limit commercial advertising during 
childrens programming to 10 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 
minutes an hour on weekdays 
rep edward j markey dmass said too many stations now allow 
for 13 minutes to 17 minutes of advertising during each hour of 
childrens programming 
the bill also would require the federal communications 
commission in renewing the licenses of television stations to 
weigh how well broadcasters are serving the educational and 
informational needs of children 
and it would establish a federally funded national endowment for 
childrens educational television to subsidize the production of 
childrens programming the endowment would be funded at 2 million 
in 1991 and 4 million the next year 
the legislation would effectively reverse the reagan 
administrations deregulation of the commercial content of 
childrens tv programming in 1984 
similar legislation was passed by both the house and senate two 
years ago but it was vetoed by president reagan after congress had 
adjourned 
the limits which we propose are reasonable said rep john 
bryant dtexas i trust the support of various groups will 
persuade our president that this bill fits into his program as a 
kinder and gentler president who responds to family concerns 
the house energy and commerce committee estimates that the 
average child spends 10000 to 15000 hours in front of a 
television more time than in school and is exposed to more than 
200000 tv commercials by the time he or she reaches age 18 
prior to the fccs deregulation in 1984 broadcasters had 
followed industry guidelines limiting ads in childrens programming 
to 9 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on 
weekdays 
proponents said the commercial restrictions are necessary 
because many children are unable to discriminate between ads and 
programs until they reach the age of 4 or 5 and are unable to 
recognize an advertising pitch as such until they are 7 or 8

november contracts in late morning trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange contracts for crude delivery in later months

inc in hoboken nj said todays move down was a continuation 
of the sharp decline monday when oil fell by more than 2 per 
barrel traders sold oil on the belief that antagonists in the 
middle east standoff were offering hints of a diplomatic solution 
to the gulf crisis 
traders said increased opec production and the us decision to 
tap its strategic reserve have also helped push prices lower 
people are starting to realize that actual supply levels 
arent any lower than they were a year ago or before the crisis

xerox corp today announced a new product 
intended to revolutionize the office as much as the modern copying 
machine it introduced 31 years ago 
the new machine is a combination highquality printer image 
scanner and fax machine that costs 220000 and is aimed at large 
corporations universities and other businesses that produce 
numerous documents 
xerox says the machine called the docutech production 
publisher will replace offset printing presses and save companies 
time and money in producing forms reports and other documents 
however a model that will allow the docutech to connect to 
desktop computers will not be available until the second half of 
next year disappointing some industry analysts 
nancy erskine an analyst at the research firm gartner group 
inc in stamford conn said companies will need the networked 
version of the machine to truly take advantage of its features 
also many companies lack the wiring between desktop machines that 
would be necessary for them to connect with docutech she said 
xerox predicts a huge market for docutech and says it already 
has tested the machine at 28 companies and universities 
xerox said creation of docutech is a bid to put the copying 
machine at the center of computer networks even though it will be 
next year before that can happen xerox calls the machine its most 
important development since it introduced the automatic plain 
paper copier in 1959 
once the entire system is released the soupedup copier would 
allow computer users to push a button and order up magazinequality 
reproductions of a 50page computerized report or to fax a document 
to another computer user 
in addition the machine can electronically scan in paper 
documents that then could be stored in a computer or manipulated on 
a computer screen 
the device is considered a gamble by xerox which has been 
disappointed in the past by making technological breakthroughs only 
to lose the market for them to competitors 
for example xerox invented the personal computer the 
userfriendly graphical software to run it and the computer 
control device called the mouse only to see them enrich 
competitors who marketed them better 
eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc said the 
research on docutech cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
the people that have seen it are very impressed he said 
but he added the market potential for the expensive device is 
uncertain especially in light of the sluggish economy 
docutech represents an entry by xerox into the fledging market 
for imaging systems which scan paper documents and photographs 
to turn them into computer language that can be stored 
electronically in much less space

general electric co officials said they 
plan to lay off 450 to 500 hourly workers at its appliance 
manufacturing complex in louisville by jan 2 because of the 
nations softening economy 
company spokesman jim allen said the economy has forced a change 
in ges sales forecast for the rest of this year and for 1991 
allen said the economy would have to make an unlikely turnaround to 
forestall the job cuts 
were looking at a major appliance industry finishing this 
year 3 to 5 percent down and falling off another 3 to 5 percent in 
1991 allen said monday 
housing starts at their lowest level in several years are a 
key reason for the sluggishness he said 
consumer polls indicate fewer people expect to buy such durable 
goods as the refrigerators ranges washers dryers and dishwashers 
produced at the companys appliance park plant 
allen said the appliance divisions sales already have begun to 
bear out that pessimistic forecast 
theyre starting to drop off he said this is not just a 
thing were forecasting were experiencing it 
allen said employment at appliance park is now about 10800 
8800 hourly and 2000 salaried that is just under half of its 
peak employment which was about 22000 in 1973 
much of the plants business is tied directly to the housing 
industry and rises and falls with it

a judge on tuesday rejected gerald ronsons appeal 
of his 92 million fine in the guinness scandal case saying rich 
men must not be beyond punishment of the law 
justice denis henry rejected ronsons claim that the fine the 
largest in british history was too great and could not be paid in 
nine months as the court demanded 
ronson 51 was found guilty last month along with former 
guinness chairman ernest saunders and stockbroker anthony parnes 
of fraudulently engineering guinness 1986 takeover of a scottish 
distiller 
punishments are after all intended to be punitive and the 
court must ensure that a mans wealth and power does not put him 
beyond punishment the judge said at a hearing 
ronson 51 will have another chance to appeal the fine through 
the appeal court 
saunders 55 was sentenced to five years in prison and parnes 
45 received 2 years in jail for their part in the case which 
involved boosting guinness shares during the companys takeover of 
the firm distillers 
saunder and parnes are also appealing their fines

president bush said today he would give a 
televised address to the nation at 9 pm edt tonight to press his 
case for a 500 billion deficitcutting package 
bush announced the speech himself at a meeting with a group of 
business leaders as the white house launched a major effort to sell 
the bipartisan package unveiled on sunday 
earlier he met with a group of skeptical and undecided 
republican house members some participants at the meeting said 
that several lawmakers urged bush to give a televised address to 
the nation 
this budget agreement is our last best chance to get the 
federal budget deficit under control bush told the business 
leaders you can pick the package apart but you cannot 
realistically put a better package together 
bush said it was important for congress to act and act soon on 
this vital legislation 
i dont want to sound sanctimonious about this but i was 
elected to govern he said 
the white house said bushs speech to the nation would last 
about 10 minutes 
although bush campaigned against new taxes and for a lower 
capital gains tax rate he said the philosophy i was elected on 
runs out of gas in terms of votes in the united states congress 
earlier lawmakers who met with the president said that deep 
divisions remain in congress on the measure 
im undecided sos the nation said rep robert dornan 
rcalif after the first of three sessions between bush and gop 
lawmakers 
rep mickey edwards rokla said bush had not changed his mind 
and he still was likely to vote against the package 
but rep thomas coleman rmo said he was persuaded by the 
president to support the package its the only ball game in 
town he said if this goes down youre going to see chaos 
he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that some 
republicans up for reelection told the president that supporting 
the package will be tough but they promised to consider it 
it has opposition he conceded we need time to work it 
fitzwater said that for all americans the proposed agreement 
is paying the bills and paying the bills is never fun 
fitzwater earlier said that bush would make a strong pitch for 
the bipartisan budget accord unveiled over the weekend 
well be talking in very strong terms to all the members about 
how important this is fitzwater said 
hes going to be twisting arms and cajoling and telling people 
that if you are not supportive of this we ask you to take another 
look and think anew fitzwater said 
in its twoday life span the plan has drawn barbs from 
lawmakers democrats and republicans wary of voting for a record 
amount of tax increases and spending cuts in an election year 
fitzwater also said bush also planned to give speeches around 
the country in the coming weeks 
hell be all over the place fitzwater said 
the president will go to the nation he will go around the 
country in one speech after another and lay out whats in this 
package fitzwater said 
missing from the list of those invited to the white house today 
was one of the most outspoken critics of the compromise house 
republican whip newt gingrich rga 
however fitzwater said that nothing should be read into the 
fact that gingrichs name had been omitted 
bush already talked to gingrich the spokesman said and well 
talk to him again 
were talking to everybody fitzwater said there are a 
lot of people who disagree with this a lot of people have trouble 
with it and they need to be convinced and were doing our best 
the deficit must be dealt with and its not an easy fix 
fitzwater said 
everybody knew this deficitreduction agreement was an ugly 
duckling said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee nobody expected it to sprout wings and fly like 
a swan 
but bush put an optimistic face on prospects of approval it 
will all work out everybody will do whats right he told 
reporters 
congressional leaders planned a series of votes over the next 
three weeks to etch the compromise plan into law but reluctance to 
support the package comes from members of both parties 
rpublicans are leery of its 134 billion in new taxes on 
gasoline alcohol tobacco airline tickets incomes of the wealthy 
and other items they also complained that defense cuts of up to 
182 billion were too deep and that domestic programs were not 
pared enough 
numerous democrats dont like the packages 105 billion in 
spending reductions for benefit programs such as medicare and the 
fact that many of the taxes such as those on gasoline and alcohol

farmers should prepare themselves for lower 
target prices as congress looks for ways to cut the agriculture 
budget by 13 billion over the next five years farm organization 
officials say 
government officials said monday that the cuts would be painful 
although no one could give details yet on how the cut agreed to by 
white house and congressional negotiators to reduce the deficit 
would be accomplished 
we want the target prices to stay at the current levels but 
it would be difficult if not impossible to make the magnitude of 
cuts they have to make without doing something on the target 
prices said don lipton media relations director for the 
american farm bureau federation 
they said they were going to freeze target prices but 
theres no way with this budget agreement that can happen said 
david senter national director of american agriculture movement 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who helped negotiate the agreement 
said agriculture has taken a tough hit 
any cut in usdas budget is painful for our farmers and 
ranchers said agriculture secretary clayton yeutter however 
we have no oter alternative as a country but to reduce our federal 
budget deficit 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt 
said we will all have to make deep and painful cuts in many 
important programs to pay for a deficit caused by the sampl scandal 
and the freewheeling economic policies and tax giveaways of the 
1980s 
unfortunately the people who had the party arent the ones 
paying the tab said leahy 
yeutter said farmers would be willing to take their share of the 
cuts as long as they are fair 
in the short run these budget reductions coupled with rising 
fuel costs will squeeze agriculture hard he said we will have 
to tighten our belts and that is not easily done but in the long 
run we will all be better off if we can restore fiscal sanity to 
this nation 
the cuts will be as fair as possible said leahy who also 
chairs the housesenate conference committee working on the 1990 
farm bill 
the farm bills approved by the house and senate call for 54 
billion in spending on commodities subsidies over the next five 
years 
under the budget agreement that figure must be cut 25 percent 
with about 13 billion coming out of the budget for the 1991 
fiscal year which began monday 
the problem this year is that all but about 292 billion of the 
amount budgeted for fiscal 1991 is payment on expenses carried over 
from 1990 that cannot be eliminated 
that means it might be back to the drawing board on commodity 
support programs in the farm bill said several aides close to the 
process 
we dont want to see target prices dropped but wed rather 
see target prices go down than loan rates go up said lipton of 
the farm bureau 
loan rates are the amount farmers can borrow from the government 
by using their crops as collateral thus the loans are a support 
or a guaranteed floor price for the commodities 
farmers have the option of forfeiting their crops collateral 
and canceling the debt if market prices are low or paying off the 
loan and selling or using the commodities when market prices 
improve 
the administration and others favoring marketoriented programs 
say high loan rates result in government ownership of surplus 
commodities that should be moving into export at world prices 
lipton said the agriculture industry as a whole wont suffer 
extremely if cuts are made its not as dependent on government 
programs as it was in the mid80s he said 
lipton said many farmers no longer participate in government 
programs either because their farms are so big they can sustain 
themselves even when market prices are low or because they are 
smaller speciality operations 
however leland swenson president of national farmers union 
said the 13 billion slash in usda programs would throw the farm 
sector into a tailspin 
farmers are facing disastrous grain prices higher input costs 
as the result of oil prices and now 13 billion in cuts that will 
come directly out of farm income under the 1990 farm bill 
structure swenson said 
youve got some new variables to work with now the mideast 
situation falling wheat prices and now budget cuts have all come 
to roost since the farm bill passed the two houses he said

these controversial choice and reproduction issues already have 
been debated in court with conflicting rulings 
this year the california supreme court upheld a ruling against 
johnson in which a lower court said in part we are in an era of 
choice a woman is not required to become a victorian brood mare 
but in 1989 the 7th circuit court of appeals supported johnson 
saying it is reasonably necessary to the industrial safetybased 
concern of protecting the unborn child from lead exposure 
judge frank easterbrook dissented in that ruling being appealed 
to the high court he called it likely the most important 
sexdiscrimination case since the 1964 enactment of title vii 
which barred sexual bias in employment 
some business leaders say the potential impact is exaggerated

general motors corp has begun pitching 
its new saturn car to the public in an effort to increase its 
visibility before it finally hits the road 
commercials produced by hal riney amp partners of san francisco 
began airing last week during prime news and latenight slots in 
the southeast and california 
basically were trying to sell the saturn story ahead of the 
product said donald hudler saturn vice president of sales 
service and marketing 
the saturn is an important development for gm the nations no 
1 automaker which made the car to win back a chunk of the market 
lost to japanese competitors 
the project has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception 
eight years ago originally introduced as a boxlike subcompact car 
to sell for 6000 to 8000 it now has more interior room more 
features and will sell for 10000 to 12000

mercedesbenz dealer ray latka says customers 
have begun pestering him to rush their orders through one 
connoisseur plans to stock his wine cellar while a spirits 
merchant is struggling to hold down the price of dom perignon 
champagne 
everybody whos anybody is trying to find ways to cope with 
upcoming tax increases on luxury goods 
merchants who cater to the carriage trade complain that the 
governments proposal to hike taxes on bigticket items including 
expensive cars yachts jewelry and furs as well as wine and 
liquor discriminates against their wellheeled clientele 
though they protest many are bracing themselves for a flurry of 
sales as customers weigh the costs and benefits of putting an extra 
case of champagne or a pair of sapphire earrings on their tabs for 
the upcoming holidays 
the taxes if approved could begin taking effect jan 1 as part 
of a federal budget agreement reached over the weekend 
in all likelihood there will be a measurable increase in the 
sales of jewelry above 5000 before the end of the year simply 
because buyers will recognize that such items will cost more next 
year ralph destino chairman of cartier inc said tuesday 
for jewelry plans call for a 10 percent tax on the amount over 
5000 that means buyers would pay 6100 for a diamond brooch 
that sells for 6000 today historically there has always been 
an upward blip on the eve of any new tax increase destino said 
david h resler chief economistat nomura securities 
international inc plans to stock my wine cellar for the next 
three years adding that consumers might stock up on 
easytostore items 
for home liquors inc the pickup in sales was pretty 
significant when higher taxes took effect in new jersey in the 
1980s said bill kenny who manages the companys astor wines amp 
spirits store in manhattan 
the government wants to raise the tax on wine by 22 cents a 
bottle and boost the tax on a bottle of 80proof liquor by 24 
cents 
but kenny said that just because the tax goes up at the 
retail level there will be discretion over whether we want to 
increase prices the price of dom perignon a topoftheline 
champagne that sells for 810 a case is just too crucial to 
raise he said particularly at holiday time when corporations 
and wealthy individuals buy clusters of cases at a time 
kenny envisions tremendous work ahead since he will have to 
decide on an individual basis whether to raise the price on a line 
of wine or liquor or whether the store will cut its profit to keep 
prices attractive to customers 
because many luxury goods are imported their price is also 
dictated by the value of the dollar which has taken a hit this 
year against most foreign currencies a year ago kenny said a 
case of dom perignon sold for somewhere in the 700s 
at continental motors inc a mercedesbenz dealership in 
suburban fairfield conn salesman latka said several customers 
want him to rush their orders through to make sure they beat the 
increase even though it could be modified 
when connecticut raised taxes by a half a percentage point a few 
years ago latka said mercedes sales jumped 20 percent and that 
could happen again 
the average price of a mercedesbenz is 50000 making it 
liable to the proposed tax which hits the amount of the purchase 
price in excess of 30000 
this is something very much biased against luxury cars 
latka said but he said the decision to buy a mercedes is probably 
based more on the fortunes of the stock market than the level of 
taxes 
the tax increase is not expected do much to bolster furriers 
who have been suffering from weak sales amid a lackluster economy 
and a publicity campaign waged by antifur activists 
furthermore most furriers contend that a decent fur can be had 
for about 5000 while the tax only applies to the amount above 
that level you can find a lot of good things at that price 
said tony marinakos of marinakos furs in beverly hills calif very 
stylish mink linx and sable coats though generally sell for 
about 10000

nervous traders took their profits late in the day and ended the

profits from the twoday advance while they could

the dollar dropped against all major currencies 
in uneventful us trading tuesday after moving mostly higher 
overseas 
gold prices skidded on european and asian markets but gold 
gained modestly in the united states as the previous days selloff 
here subsidied 
currency dealers could not put their fingers on precisely why 
the dollar weakened in the united states but they said trading 
volume was light indicating sellers lacked conviction 
a widespread belief that us interest rates eventually will 
move lower as the economy struggles to stay out of a recession was 
offered as a possible reason for the diminished demand for dollars 
lower us interest rates would make returns on 
dollardenominated holdings less appealing and could steer money 
into higheryielding foreign investments 
the chances that us rates will fall have risen since white 
house and congressional negotiators reached agreement on a fiscal 
1991 budget 
another slide in oil prices tuesday helped ease inflation fears 
and also possibly curbed interest in dollars the contract for 
november delivery of light sweet crude tumbled 314 a barrel to 
3395 on the new york mercantile exchange unleaded gasoline and 
home heating prices also closed down sharply 
if the slide continues the oil price retreat is expected to 
give the federal reserve board greater leeway to relax its monetary 
policy the central banks mission is to promote economic growth 
while keeping inflation at bay 
the dollar moved ahead against most of its foreign counterparts 
in european trading centers but earlier in asia the dollar lost 
ground 
in tokyo the dollar fell 042 yen to a closing 13673 yen 
later in london the dollar was quoted at 13700 yen in new york 
the dollar traded at 13672 yen down slightly from 13675 yen late 
monday 
the british pound fetched 18890 late in london the same as 
mondays late rate in new york it cost 18930 to buy one pound 
up from 18830 late monday 
other dollar rates late in new york compared with mondays late 
quotes included 15495 german marks down from 155735 12885 
swiss francs down from 12960 51915 french francs down from 
52195 116075 italian lire down from 116725 and 115265 
canadian dollars down from 1153825

apple computer inc plans to offer 
cheaper versions of its macintosh machine as part of a strategy to 
win market share that chairman john sculley hopes will help the 
company withstand a recession 
the plan begins with three new macintosh computers to be 
introduced oct 15 accompanied by a 40 million advertising 
campaign 
the macintosh classic comparable to the popular 2569 se 
model will carry a list price of about 1000 and a street price 
as low as 700 to 800 according to sources close to apple 
the other two models available with color monitors will be 
listed at about 3000 and 5000 or several thousand dollars less 
than comparable macintoshes in the current line 
the basic strategy is to go after a larger share of the 
market sculley said at a preview of the campaign we have no 
sacred cows as far as pricing this means that this will be the 
most aggressive pricing that apple has ever had 
in a weak economy as the united states certainly is in its 
a lot more reassuring to be introducing three major products at 
price points that are going to be extremely affordable 
critics of apple have long complained that its macintosh line 
which ranges from 1799 for the macplus to 11000 for the fx is 
too expensive apples gross margins on those products is about 50 
percent one of the highest in the industry sculley said 
as a result apple has racked up profits but stagnated with only 
about 9 percent of the desktop computer market inexpensive 
clones of international business machines corp personal 
computers have dominated the low end of the market 
the windows software program from microsoft which gives ibm 
computers the look and feel of the macintosh also has forced 
apple to examine how it can distinguish itself 
for us to be really successful in the 1990s we want to have 
much more than a 9 percent share sculley said he declined to say 
what share of the market he is aiming for or what gross margins 
hell be satisfied with 
apple which does nearly half of its business outside the united 
states is introducing its new computers simultaneously in 121 
countries the company expects the computers to be a hit especially 
in japan where apples business has been doubling annually 
part of our business has been extremely strong sculley 
said weve continued to gain market share with our 
highperformance modular macs in business while we clearly had 
some need for freshening up at the low end of our product line the 
high end is very resilient and strong 
apple will adjust its prices throughout its macintosh line but 
it is not abandoning its top models 
i want to make sure this isnt seen as a flipflop as if 
were now only in lowend systems said michael spindler apples 
chief operating officer we dont want to divest from markets we 
want to invest to make this a much broader growth business for 
apple 
he said the company will pull all the stops out go a little 
bit overboard in manufacturing the new machines in anticipation 
of strong demand 
if you have a brand new product in which you believe it 
doesnt make sense to run it tight spindler said 
sculley said the new products and new strategy are among the 
most important events in his eight years with the company 
he said apple is also working on several notebooksize 
computers 
miniaturization is one of the major themes were focusing on 
in research and development he said i think thats going to 
be extremely important in the 1990s 
sculley acknowledged criticsim that apple has failed to come up 
with a lightweight portable the portable mac is a bulky heavy 
machine that seems almost antiquated compared to competitive 
models 
while apple has started late in some of these areas we can do 
a lot more than just catch up sculley said we see this as a 
chance to get real differentiation in the 1990s 
he said miniaturization is evident in the new desktop models 
that apple will show off 
it means extremely high reliability because we have fewer 
components on the board he said the reliability of the new 
products we think is going to be significantly higher than anything 
thats been brought out 
were basically saying this is the year of the new customer 
and we are reaching out to people who have never experienced apple 
before many of those people dont know an awful lot about personal 
computers and we want their first experience to be extremely 
satisfying so the product reliability is important

meanwhile even as bush called for public support for a measure 
designed to chart the way to a balanced budget he signed 
legislation extending the nations borrowing powers 
he signed a bill extending the national debt limit of 32 
trillion through saturday congress is expected to vote then to 
extend it further 
earlier tuesday bush sought to win over a group of house 
republicans who were either undecided on the package or leaning 
against it some 35 members came though the white house indicated 
about 60 had been invited 
im undecided sos the nation said rep robert dornan 
rcalif after the first of three sessions between bush and gop 
lawmakers 
bush giving a preview of the evening television address told a 
group of business leaders at the white house that he knew the 
deficitfighting package would require sacrifices 
this budget agreement is our last best chance to get the 
federal budget deficit under control bush said 
to all the people that disagree and the people on the 
sidelines that are rushing out and having their press conferences 
and the critics let me say this you can pick the package apart 
but you cannot realistically put a better package together 
he also apologized to the business group that in the course of 
forging the compromise he had abandoned his call for a cut in the 
capital gains tax 
the philosophy i was elected on runs out of gas in terms of 
votes in the united states congress bush said 
the most vociferous opposition to the plan hammered out by white 
house and congressional leaders has come from bushs own party 
rep mickey edwards rokla said bush had not persuaded him 
and he still was likely to vote against the package 
but rep thomas coleman rmo said he would support the 
package its the only ball game in town he said if this 
goes down youre going to see chaos 
with the first votes on the package scheduled for as early as 
wednesday both sides were scrambling to line up support 
congressional leaders pondered letting the senate take the first 
vote on an outline of the plan 
support for the package is viewed as stronger in the senate if 
only because only one third of the 100member senate is up for 
reelection this year while all 435 house seats are up for grabs 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said letting the senate 
cast the initial vote would put heat on the house 
it was bushs fourth televised speech from the oval office he 
also addressed the nation to announce his drug strategy to 
announce the invasion of panama and to announce his persian gulf 
policy

a major credit rating agency tuesday 
downgraded unisys corps debt and preferred stock saying the 
countrys thirdlargest computer maker has dim prospects for 
sustaining any improved profits 
unisys spokesman peter hynes said the firm was dissappointed by 
moodys investor service incs downgrade of about 52 billion 
worth of securities 
hynes cited the companys decision last week to suspend its 
common stock dividend as evidence of its efforts to maintain credit 
quality the firm decided it would pay off debt with the 40 
million normally paid each quarter to holders of common stock 
dividends will continue to be paid on preferred stock unisys 
said tuesday 
unisys based in nearby blue bell pa wants to reduce its debt 
by 600 million to 800 million this year the company owed 36 
billion on june 30 down from a peak 41 billion in the middle of 
1989 
moodys noted that unisyss management has taken steps to 
improve its financial flexibility 
improvements however have been moderated by the ongoing 
challenges of the slowed growth and the increasing margin pressure 
that are endemic to the industry moodys said in a release 
on monday unisys announced a new strategy to shift the 
companys core business away from large mainframe computers which 
are being pushed out of the market by cheaper faster and more 
powerful desktop computers 
the new plan is to market software that can integrate unisys 
equipment and incompatible equipment made by ibm and other rival 
companies hynes said 
the result would be computer networks that can share information 
regardless of the make or size of the machines making it possible 
for customers to build upon existing equipment

president bush asked americans tuesday night 
to support a 500 billion package of tax increases and spending 
cuts that demands sacrifice from all everyone who can should 
contribute something the president said 
claiming rare unity with leaders of the democraticcontrolled 
congress bush said in a 10minute televised speech from the oval 
office that the package was written in eight months of blood 
sweat and fears fears of the economic chaos that would follow if 
we fail to reduce the deficit 
it is the best agreement that can be legislated now bush 
said of the compromise this deficit reduction agreement is 
tough and so are the times 
bushs address from the oval office was nationally televised 
but his message was primarily aimed 16 blocks away at congress 
where an initial vote on the plan may be held as early as thursday 
although the package generally has support among democrats 
lawmakers from bushs own party particularly in the house have 
balked at its tax provisions bush himself had to abandon his no 
new taxes pledge in the face of the growing deficit 
im not and i know youre not a fan of tax increases bush 
said but if there have to be tax measures they should allow the 
economy to grow they should not turn us back to higher income tax 
rates and they should be fair 
everyone who can should contribute something and no one 
should have to contribute beyond their fair share 
bush pointed out that the agreement had been hammered out by a 
bipartisan group the democratic and republican leadership 
tonight all speak with once voice he said and he urged people 
to tell their congressmen they support the package 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine joined bush in 
urging passage of the fragile package saying the future of the 
nation is more important than partisan differences 
in a televised response mitchell acknowledged that democrats 
and republicans had deep differences over values and priorities 
that delayed an agreement for months the democratic leader called 
the agreement imperfect and warned that the compromise budget 
cuts and tax increases will demand sacrifice from all 
americans 
but if enacted it holds the promise of restoring a sound 
economy from which all americans will benefit mitchell said 
everybody who can should contribute something bush said 
everyone will bear a small burden but if we succeed every 
american will have a large burden lifted 
the alternative bush said is recession 
wavering republican lawmakers had told bush earlier in the day 
that the plan was in trouble and that a presidential address to 
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected 
gop support for the package with congressional elections just a 
month away 
bush also planned to push for the threedayold package which 
the white house negotiated with congressional leaders in a series 
of upcoming speeches around the nation 
the budget package would raise taxes on gasoline alcohol 
cigarettes boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and 
medicare recipients it also would reduce tax deductions for people 
who earn more than 100000 
bush earlier tuesday had pressed his case with skeptical and 
wavering house republicans 
he seemed to be making some headway and by late tuesday house 
gop leaders were beginning to feel more optimistic about their 
chances of rounding up support from most of their members weve 
made significant progress said house minority leader robert 
michel rill 
one opponent rep vin weber rminn agreed saying id 
guess right now it would be narrowly defeated by tomorrow it 
would be narrowly passed people are being moved onebyone 
bush said the budget deficit was a problem that has lingered 
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long 
likening the budget crisis to the persian gulf stalemate bush 
said our nation is standing together against saddam husseins 
aggression while at home another threat a cancer is gnawing 
away at our nations health 
the president said that ending deficit spending was simple 
common sense 
no nation can continue to do business the way the federal 
government has been operating and survive he said 
when you get a bill that bill must be paid he said 
bush said that the plan was not a magic act but contained 
true deficit savings and would put the nation on the path toward 
lower interest rates and a balanced budget 
a congressional study released tuesday showed that the poor 
would be hit hardest by the package the rich would feel its 
increases the least the increased taxes and reduced benefits would 
take an average 2 percent of the earnings of americans with the 
lowest incomes according to the survey by the house ways and means 
committee

a government support package helped propel tokyo 
stocks to their biggest oneday jump in history tuesday but left 
uncertain prospects for an extended rebound from the worst market 
decline in more than 30 years 
the closely watched nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues 
leaped 267655 points or 1324 percent to 2289841 after the 
ministry of finance announced emergency measures to shore up the 
ailing market 
the market receded slightly in early trading wednesday on profit 
taking before resuming its climb as the nikkei posted a 
33116point gain in the morning session 
as the largest singleday gain ever tuesdays market eclipsed 
the 929 percent rebound posted a day after the stock market 
crashed three years ago when the nikkei rose 203732 points to 
2394740 
the support from the finance ministry boosted the markets 
sentiment i believe institutional investors as well as individual 
buyers now cant resist investing at the current low levels said 
toshiyuki nishiguchi a trader with daiwa securities 
the unprecedented jump came after a ninemonth meltdown that had 
erased nearly half the markets value the equivalent of 21 
trillion since the end of last year the protracted slide was the 
worst since the korean war in the early 1950s market observers 
said 
the foreign ministrys measures themselves were minor 
adjustments but because they sent a message of support to the 
markets their psychological impact was considerable 
the measures were aimed at spurring buying and reducing market 
volatility they included easing restrictions on the purchase of 
stock on credit and shortening the hours for futures and options 
trading 
on monday before finance minister ryutaro hashimoto signaled 
the governments intentions market watchers had been predicting 
the nikkei would plummet below the 15000 mark after the market 
began to rally some were calling for a return to 23000 or even 
25000 
this just shows how very fragile investor sentiment is said 
amy yip manager of equity sales at baring securities ltd 
the nikkeis comeback began late in monday trading on comments 
from hashimoto indicating that the government was about to act to 
stem the markets slide the nikkei which had slipped more than 
1200 points to below 20000 rebounded to cut the days loss to 
76164 points 
the surge picked up momentum tuesday volume was estimated at 
550 million shares up from 428 million shares monday 
talk about herd mentality this market has gone 
completely and utterly bananas paul muller manager of 
international equity sales at schroder securities japan ltd 
said before tuesdays trading ended 
the rise was accelerated by panic buying according to yip 
customers were worried about missing the boat she said 
theyre afraid the markets going to pull back tomorrow 
theyre moving entirely differently from logic 
dealers said the runup was fed by a socalled short squeeze 
in which traders who had sold borrowed shares had to buy them back 
to avoid serious losses 
the short squeeze is on schroders muller said everyone 
had been expecting it and it came with a vengeance 
some traders believed the market had bottomed out and was ready 
for a change 
in addition to the psychological effect of hashimotos 
measure the market weary of selling was prepared for an 
upturn said yoshiro inoue a dealer with nomura securities 
diplomatic efforts by countries to settle the persian gulf 
crisis falling oil prices a surge in the dow jones industrial 
average on wall street monday and a stronger bond market in japan 
were also among the positive factors he said 
in bond dealings bond prices advanced as the yield on the 
benchmark 10year japanese government bond closed at 8185 percent 
down sharply from 8475 percent the previous day 
we believe todays rebound is an indication of sustained 
recovery as long as the middle east remains calm inoue said 
before the rebound the nikkei index had shed 1061613 points 
or 344 percent from its closing of 3083799 on aug 1 the day 
before iraq invaded kuwait 
japan is highly vulnerable to unrest in the gulf because it 
imports virtually all its oil with 70 percent coming from the 
middle east 
because the economy remains susceptible to outside shocks some 
doubted the lasting impact of the ministrys initiatives but many 
felt they would give the market a healthy shortterm boost 
the principal change would increase the credit limit for 
investors buying stock on margin the measure would allow investors 
to count 80 percent of the value of their holdings as collateral 
for stock purchases up from 70 percent 
a second measure aimed at easing market volatility reduces the 
time allowed for futures and options trading by 20 minutes to four 
hours and 10 minutes as in the united states traders in japan 
have been hedging their stock bets with counterbalancing trades in 
stockindex futures and options some critics say those strategies 
have contributed to the markets uneasiness 
the third measure loosens reporting requirements for big 
insurance companies investing in stocks which could spur more 
buying by those companies

stock exchange posted its largest singleday increase ever 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues added 33116 
points or 145 percent ending wednesday mornings session at 
2322957 the index gained 267655 points tuesday 
the market got off to a slow start wednesday with the nikkei 
losing 13905 points on profit taking in the first 15 minutes of 
trading 
volume on the morning session wednesday was estimated at 300 
million shares up from an estimated 200 million shares tuesday 
morning 
advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 580 to 131 while 
98 issues remained unchanged about 30 percent of all shares were 
left unpriced at the end of the session due to lack of sufficient 
sell orders to match buy orders traders said 
the market rallied tuesday on lower oil prices and moves by the 
finance ministry to spur buying and reduce market volatility the 
changes included easing restrictions on the purchase of stock on 
credit and shortening the hours for futures and options trading 
while the measures were minor adjustments they had a strong 
psychological impact on the market tuesday 
in the foreign exchange market the dollar fell slightly to 
13632 yen in the morning session it opened at 13633 yen down 
040 yen from tuesdays close it ranged between 13632 yen and 
13658 yen by late morning 
currency dealers said the dollar declined against the yen 
because of falling oil prices 
lower oil prices will support the yen because it is considered 
to have a more positive impact on the japanese economy than 
elsewhere said yasushi nishikado of daiichi kangyo bank 
he added that the dollar is expected to stay in the 135 to 136 
yen range until friday when us unemployment figures for september 
are announced 
in bond dealings the yield on the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds rose to 8280 percent from tuesdays 
close of 8185 percent their price fell to 8241 points from 
8281
