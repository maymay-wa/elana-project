president bush must put a line in the sand 
to head off further funding cuts for star wars say the missile 
defense systems hardcore backers who seek a sharper 
administration view of the programs purpose 
these republican lawmakers who bristle at use of the term star 
wars rather than the formal strategic defense initiative say bush 
must act now as house and senate negotiators thrash out the defense 
budget for fiscal 1990 
we need them to weigh in on this conference sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo a member of the senate armed services committee 
said in an interview last week 
the administration has to put a line in the sand on what is 
not acceptable to them said rep john kasich rohio a member 
of the house armed services committee unless the administration 
is willing to come out and do something its going to continue to 
go downhill 
star wars introduced six years ago by thenpresident reagan as 
a nuclearage antidote to a strike against the united states has 
suffered a series of blows in recent months 
in early august the house slashed 18 billion from president 
bushs request of 49 billion for the program in fiscal 1990 the 
vote was 248175 reflecting waning support for the program 
last month vice president dan quayle said the reagan 
administrations sdi astrodome approach to protect the united 
states was political jargon star wars opponents cited these 
comments as an indication the administration does not have its 
heart in the program proponents say the vice presidents remarks 
were taken out of context 
quayle recently has moved to emphasize his support for the 
program in a public broadcasting system interview last weekend 
the vice president urged congress not to cut star wars funding 
bush has said little about star wars but quayle insisted the 
president is a strong supporter of the strategic defense 
initiative 
last week the senate slashed 900 million from bushs proposal 
but later reversed field and restored 600 million that move was 
viewed not as an increase in support for star wars but rather the 
senates attempt to strengthen its bargaining position with the 
house 
during negotiations house conferees have pushed for a star wars 
budget around 35 billion far below the 41 billion spent on the 
program in fiscal 1989 the senate has favored a total closer to 
the 43 billion approved last week 
in the wake of these events the republican disenchantment shows 
up in various forms 
wallop criticized the contact between the pentagon and congress 
saying their congressional liaison is less than competent they 
the administration are being told things that basically guided 
them elsewhere 
the general tenor of their legislative liaison is to be a 
supporter once the crisis has arisen those of us trying to help 
have been frustrated by that the wyoming republican said 
pressed for specific names wallop declined to identify them 
john dewey who handles legislative issues for the sdi 
organization at the pentagon said his office has been very 
supportive right along we havent given up by no means nobody 
in our organization gives that impression 
another pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified said he was a little taken aback by the senators 
comments and emphasized that weve worked the heck out of it and 
will continue to 
wallop said this week would be an ideal time for the 
administration to indicate the total fiscal 1990 budget it will 
accept for star wars and he expressed his confidence that a former 
wyoming lawmaker defense secretary dick cheney will make that 
point clear 
its hard to fight for people who dont have a target over 
which to fight the senator said 
another sdi supporter rep henry hyde rill said he was 
looking to cheney and quayle to keep the program highly visible 
when asked if the administration has done enough to promote the 
program hyde after a long pause responded probably not 
without administration support the program will languish 
said hyde who fears a substantial budget cut would emasculate 
the program 
rep jon kyl rariz a member of the house armed services 
committee said he was not disappointed by the administrations 
efforts on behalf of star wars but said now is the time to weigh 
in

consumers may soon be paying higher prices for 
prescription drugs as more generic products are pulled from the 
market and costconscious buyers are left with fewer lowpriced 
options some industry observers say 
dozens of drugs have been recalled in the wake of allegations 
and admissions of cheating on safety tests required for food and 
drug administration approval 
the scandal is likely to produce a shakeout in the industry and 
result in more rigorous safety testing required for approval some 
generic drug makers and industry observers say this will force 
prices up but others say the industry will remain competitive 
enough to withstand the financial pressures without price increases 
a more immediate concern for consumers however is the possible 
effect of the recalls 
the costs to pharmacists are going up for selected products 
but not overall said steve grote vice president of purchasing 
for the american association of retired persons pharmacy service 
the biggest impact of generic drug recalls may be seen by 
patients taking the high blood pressure drug dyazide or its generic 
version 
one of the drugs two clones was removed from the market earlier 
this year when its maker vitarine pharmaceutical inc admitted 
cheating on safety tests to win fda approval now the fda is trying 
to remove the other generic version from the market saying its 
maker bolar pharmaceutical co inc misrepresented test data to 
the agency 
bolars product is about half the price of dyazide and its 
removal from the market would mean higher prices for some 
consumers at least until another generic version can win fda 
approval 
bolar agreed to recall another drug an antibiotic used to treat 
urinary tract infections after the fda said the company cheated on 
product safety tests the drug is nitrofurantoin sold under the 
brand name macrodantin by norwicheaton pharmaceuticals 
generic drugs which account for about onethird of all 
prescriptions nationwide now offer consumers savings averaging 50 
percent to 70 percent over their brandname counterparts 
but some in the industry say the gap will narrow as the fda 
toughens regulations and as the industry itself consolidates 
the prices for generics will show a gradual increase but 
still will be substantially below brandname drugs said john h 
klein president of zenith laboratories in northvale nj 
klein who with an investor group took the company out of 
bankruptcy last year and anticipates generic drug sales of 36 
million to 40 million this year also predicts an end to cutthroat 
pricing in the generic industry as companies realize that setting 
prices below costs to gain market share is unprofitable 
the fda has no formal proposal for tougher regulations but 
agency officials have been discussing the need for more staff the 
possibility of imposing user fees on the generic industry for new 
drug application filings and more rigorous safety testing 
all of those things will affect the cost of the generic 
drug said henry f blissenbach director of pharmacy programs 
for united healthcare corp a minneapolisbased manager of health 
maintenance organizations 
but an official at rugby laboratories in rockville center ny 
disagrees 
martin zeiger executive vice president and general counsel of 
rugby a privately held generic drug maker said to be the largest 
in the country with about 500 million in annual sales said the 
additional costs would not be enough to raise prices 
its a very competitive industry he said we dont see 
the prices increasing at all 
analysts anticipate some generic manufacturers will not make it 
through the scandal hemant k shah a pharmaceutical analyst at 
hks amp co says more than half of the top 20 generic drug makers 
who account for 90 percent of the generic business will disappear 
within five years 
but still the prices of generics probably are not going to 
rise because six or 10 companies are still enough for some form of 
pricing pressure he said

this warbattered city is cautiously 
coming to life again after six months of fierce artillery battles 
beirutis are picking up the pieces of their lives under a 
ceasefire that took hold sept 22 but for many the memories of 
the nightmare that killed 900 people will not go away 
schoolteacher mona khoury ate so much to calm her nerves during 
the fighting between syrian and christian forces that she cant get 
into her dresses now 
housewife samia iskandarani cant listen to the radio any more 
because it reminds her of fearfilled nights tuned to news flashes 
in her bunker another woman got hooked on sleeping pills during 
the shelling 
while some people are having problems adjusting to a life 
without the fear of pulverizing bombardments many are having fun 
while they can 
the beaches that once were the playground of the middle east are 
crowded again restaurants and bars are so full that customers have 
to make reservations 
in moslem west beirut two weeks ago when the city was largely 
deserted before the ceasefire there was only one bar open 
movie theaters are open screening action movies to people who 
by any stretch of the imagination should have had their fill of the 
real thing 
few people believe that the ceasefire will last or that 
lebanese legislators meeting in taif saudi arabia to seek a 
settlement to the 14yearold civil war will succeed 
the lebanese are grateful for the ceasefire but after seeing 
hundreds of ceasefires collapse many consider this one nothing 
more than a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers 
they are returning to a normal life slowly and cautiously if 
living amid the ruins with tightly rationed electricity and water 
can be called normal 
i can only sleep if i take sleeping pills said young sunni 
moslem woman who identified herself only as ghada its the only 
way i can overcome my fear of being surprised by a shell during my 
sleep its a carryover from the fighting 
ms iskandarani a moslem said she has an aversion to radios 
these days 
theyre a reminder of the horrible days and nights we spent in 
the shelter waiting for news flashes to tell us where the shells 
were falling schools offices and banks have reopened 
traffic around beirut is so heavy during the day that one 
driver stuck in a traffic jam joked with the driver of the car 
next to her i wish the war was still on it kept the streets 
clear and id be home by now 
the moneychangers are back on hamra street the badly damaged 
center of the old commercial district in west beirut mostly they 
gather around a pile of stones outside a fastfood store prompting 
local wags to dub the busy thoroughfare wall street 
samer osseiran proprietor of the uncle sam pub across from the 
american university of beirut said he wont remove the sandbags 
piled high outside his bar until a peace settlement is signed 
sealed and delivered 
business is booming but i dont trust this truce he said 
echoing the feelings of most beirutis if theres no settlement 
ill add more sandbags 
newspapers which a few weeks ago carried ads for 24hour 
delivery of sandbags and cement blocks to protect your homes 
shops and offices now advertise repair services 
people are making only essential repairs to their damaged 
houses enough to make them habitable many are replacing broken 
windows with transparent plastic sheets 
why should i waste money fixing the whole place up said 
jihad ali whose house in the seaside ein mreisseh neighborhood of 
west beirut took a direct hit from christian artillery 
i dont believe in this ceasefire those deputies in taif 
should be slaughtered for all the good theyve done in the last 14 
years he said as he bought a lottery ticket 
first prize is 15 million lebanese pounds 30000 enough 
money to get out of this damned country 
most of the 13 million beirutis 90 percent of the citys 
population who fled the fighting are settling back in their homes 
and students are returning to school the american university 
reopened on monday 
many of those who stuck it out have found theyre suffering from 
an unexpected problem weight gained down in the bunkers 
ive just woken up to the fact that i put on 10 kilgrams 22 
pounds said ms khoury during the fighting i ate like a 
glutton i found comfort in eating 
she said she didnt realize how much weight she had gained 
because she was always dressed in shelter clothes long loose 
flowing dresses 
but i learned the awful truth when i tried out a dress to go 
to back to school i couldnt do up the zipper 
colorful billboards advertising cosmetics and perfume have gone 
up again along the battered boulevards the joggers are back 
weaving through american universitys shellcratered gardens 
overlooking the mediterranean 
the shell craters and bulletpocked walls along west beiruts 
seaside boulevard are being patched up and many of the coffee 
vendors are back in business with their colorful umbrellas small 
tables and rickety chairs 
strollers gather for coffee during the day at night rats still 
dart out of huge piles of rotting garbage across the street 
uprooted palm trees and gutted vehicles still litter the 
corniche that runs around the rocky ras albeirut peninsula jutting 
into the mediterranean 
they are a reminder of the ferocious christian barrages that 
sought to silence syrian artillery which took their toll on ships 
carrying fuel and weapons to the christians in their beleaguered 
enclave across the bay

the death toll from last weeks nursing home 
fire rose to 11 on monday with the deaths of two more elderly 
residents who had suffered smoke inhalation 
meanwhile investigators said the fourstory buildings 
automatic alarm system malfunctioned when the fire broke out 
thursday at the hillhaven rehabilitation and convalescent center 
nine residents were killed and 98 of the 161 residents were 
injured the residents who died monday were ettie f cunningham 
88 and katherine f hansthorn 97 hospital spokeswomen said 
authorities said the fire was started when an elderly man who 
was smoking in violation of regulations accidentally tossed a match 
onto a mattress the nursing home built in 1969 did not have a 
sprinkler system 
norfolk fire marshal carl h welch said investigators determined 
monday that the buildings automatic alarm system didnt work 
properly the system should have automatically sent an alarm to the 
fire department through mgi security services inc 
the alarm never left the building welch said after 
investigators checked the security companys records were still 
trying to determine what the problem was 
had the system worked properly welch said firefighters would 
have been able to respond quicker the fire was reported by four 
calls to the 911 emergency number welch said the response time was 
four minutes 
jeffrey mckain a vice president for the tacoma washbased 
hillhaven chain said virginia secretary of health and human 
resources eva s teig and several other state and local officials 
toured the building monday 
hillhaven officials had hoped to reopen monday but mckain said 
it appeared the nursing home would not reopen until wednesday at 
the earliest because officials want written reports from the fire 
marshal and the building inspector

senate democrats fear that billions of dollars 
in proposed child care tax subsidies for lowincome families could 
be lost in the fight over a proposed capital gains tax cut for the 
wealthy 
the proposed child care tax writeoffs for families earning less 
than 25000 are part of a broad deficit reduction bill that in 
its house version includes a cut in the capital gains tax rate for 
the rich 
the senate version also includes the new child care benefits 
but senate democrats and republicans are haggling over how to also 
provide a similar break for betteroff taxpayers 
the chambers leaders from both parties planned to resume talks 
today on resolving the stalemate after making weak stabs at it 
through the weekend 
republicans and a handful of senate democrats want to fulfill 
president bushs campaign promise last year to cut the tax on 
capital gains profits made from selling stock real estate and 
other property 
democrats are countering with a proposal to encourage savings by 
middleand upperincome families by providing a tax break of up to 
330 if they save 2000 a year in individual retirement accounts 
looming over the negotiations is an oct 16 deadline unless 
congress completes work on a deficitreduction plan by then 
automatic acrosstheboard reductions will be triggered in most 
federal spending programs 
we dont have an agreement yet but everybody in there today 
thought we should get one senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas told reporters on sunday 
child care legislation is of the highest priority in this 
congress a far higher priority than a capital gains tax cut 
said senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine we dont 
want that to fall between the cracks 
senate leaders are searching for a way to strip away from the 
big deficitreduction bill numerous provisions that are popular 
with lawmakers but do nothing to reduce the deficit 
democrats are trying to cut the capital gains tax cut from the 
deficitreduction bill but the child care provisions then could 
come under the same knife 
both the senate and house have approved slightly different child 
care measures that would rely on 11 billion to 135 billion in 
earned income tax credits for lowincome families over the next 
five years to provide more than twothirds of the new benefits 
republicans generally favor the taxcredit approach but the 
plans approved by the house and senate also include at democrats 
insistence 175 billion in new direct subsidies for child care 
plus a doubling of the current head start program for preschool 
children 
even if senate leaders are successful in stripping away the 
extraneous provisions and wrapping them together in a new bill 
they still must seek agreement on the measure with their house 
counterparts 
the house already has passed its own deficitreduction bill in 
addition to a capital gains cut it includes repeal of catastrophic 
health coverage for retirees restoration of the fairness doctrine 
that requires broadcasters to air all sides of an issue and 
extension of several expiring tax breaks for a variety of interests 
unless the housepassed deficit plan also is pared back 
senators could be at a heavy disadvantage when they negotiate with 
house members on final details of the bill

the army major who led the 
unsuccessful coup against gen manuel antonio noriega was buried 
monday and opposition leader guillermo endara ended a 19day hunger 
strike 
several reports have said an enraged noriega personally shot 
maj moises giroldi 38 to death minutes after the coup attempt 
against the panamanian leader ended a week ago 
relatives of giroldi said he was shot once in the neck and twice 
in the chest his mother eloisa cried they murdered him and 
flung herself on the coffin 
the major led an uprising oct 3 and captured noriega who 
commands the panamanian military and controls the government but 
gave up when loyalists counterattacked while us troops looked on 
from a few hundred yards away 
officials of the panamanian defense forces said eight officers 
and two sergeants were killed they have not explained the 
circumstances or responded to reports that some were slain after 
surrendering 
defense forces spokesman maj edgardo lopez grimaldo on monday 
said noriega met with his general staff to begin reshuffling 
military units that hesitated during the uprising or openly opposed 
him 
the spokesman also said us helicopters tried to intercept 
forces loyal to noriega flying into panama city from rio hato but 
wavered apparently because they had not been given specific orders 
they tried to dissuade the machos de monte the company that 
now guards defense forces headquarters but there was no decision 
to say you cannot pass he saidlopez grimaldo did not describe 
what action the helicopters took 
in another development the civilian cabinet met with president 
francisco rodriguez to approve emergency laws first proposed by 
noriega last week and aimed at stifling military and political 
dissent 
they include a military code reforms to the penal code labor 
laws to make it easier to fire disloyal public employees and 
economic laws to encourage investment 
endara meanwhile ended his fast and entered a clinic to 
normalize my bodys system 
a medical bulletin said his conscious process was excellent 
and his conversationcoherent but he was suffering from 
progressive debilitation 
the opposition leader has urged panamanians to delay paying 
taxes and utility bills and to shun the government lottery and 
casinos on which the government has depended for much of its 
revenue the past 18 months 
the united states has applied economic sanctions against panama 
since federal grand juries in florida indicted noriega in february 
1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering 
noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a us plot 
to retain control of the panama canal after 1999 when it is to be 
turned over under treaties signed in 1977 
at a news conference endara said he felt his hunger strike was 
a success he said the opposition did not approve of the coup 
because it represented noriegaism without noriega not a 
movement toward democracy 
capt leon tejada another rebel was buried at the same small 
red stone church over the weekend he had one bullet wound in the 
right temple said tejadas mother esther who was at the church 
again for giroldis burial 
about 100 people attended the funeral mass for giroldi 
they were good friends mrs tejada said my son had just 
come back from un duty in namibia last saturday on tuesday he 
told his wife he had to go to headquarters and would return later 
to go see his baby girl 
we did not hear anything until wednesday when they said on 
television that he was dead we picked up the body 
giroldis widow and three children did not attend they have 
been under us army protection at fort clayton since the coup 
the washington post reported tuesday that the united states has 
flown about 40 panama coup participants family members or noriega 
opponents to miami including mrs giroldi her two sons her 
father and other family members 
the group included 14 military personnel according to the 
paper which quoted unidentified bush administration sources 
defense forces officials say the rebels surrendered after nearly 
five hours of negotiations with noriega who was their hostage at 
defense forces headquarters 
sen jesse helms rnc and several us newspapers have said 
noriega personally shot giroldi in the final moments of the doomed 
uprising 
endara the oppositions presidential candidate in may took 
refuge in the vaticans embassy after soldiers beat him and threw 
him out of his office thursday shortly before the assault noriega 
claimed he had evidence the united states planned to install endara 
as president 
foreign observers said endaras ticket won the may 7 election by 
a 31 margin but noriega had the results annulled may 10 us 
officials have said they consider endara the legitimate president 
of panama

agriculture department scientists are still 
out to bash cockroaches when they can regardless of some who say 
live and let live 
the departments agricultural research service says theres a 
school of thought that suggests scientists ought to let up on the 
repulsive insects and concentrate on other pests 
defenders of cockroaches contend that unlike bloodfeeding 
arthropods such as mosquitoes ticks and fleas the cockroaches 
are only incidental disease transmitters says regina wiggen 
associate editor of the agencys agricultural research magazine 
thus the roach revisionists argue the risks that attend 
cockroach control may outweigh the benefits to be gained by 
maintaining a roachfree home she said 
but scientists at the departments imported fire ant and 
household insects research laboratory in gainesville fla remain 
skeptical and theyve been studying roaches since the 1940s 
wiggen writing in the current issue of the magazine admitted 
cockroaches have never been irrefutably incriminated in the 
natural transmission of disease organisms to humans 
but theres plenty of circumstantial evidence to tie the roach 
to cases of typhoid fever and other diseases caused by salmonella 
bacteria wiggen said theyve also been implicated as carriers 
of clostridium perfringens staphylococcus aureus and polio 
wiggen added roaches are notorious scavengers they eat 
contaminated food and waste then carry microorganisms in their 
digestive tracts releasing them on the surfaces they contact 
release occurs through vomiting excreting wastes and laying eggs 
on human food 
a female cockroach can produce tens of thousands of offspring a 
year in one study by the usda agency scientists checking 
lowincome housing in florida turned up 20000 cockroaches in each 
apartment 
there is also an esthetic dimension to the matter of food 
cleanliness wiggen said quoting william e currie of the 
environmental protection agency who described roaches crawling 
out of the drain across the counter and onto the cream pie 
entomologist richard j brenner of the agencys gainesville 
research center said in a related article that some 4000 species 
of cockroaches are known to scientists only about 50 species are 
considered pests but those are enough to prompt americans to spend 
an estimated 15 billion annually on pesticides to control 
cockroaches 
a goal of the gainesville research is to find longterm 
solutions so brenner is using electronic sensor and computers to 
help study cockroach behavior 
cockroaches thrive in areas of stagnant air and high humidity 
anything else tends to dry them out he said also a cockroach 
behaves differently in a group than it does when alone 
some cockroaches prefer attics while others such as the german 
cockroach primarily inhabit walls 
once scientists determine the conditions cockroaches need to 
thrive brenner said it may be possible to manipulate the 
environment around the home to repel them 
the bottom line is safer more effective means of controlling 
cockroaches and ultimately preventing infestations he said 
meanwhile cardboard hotels liquid doses of chemicals 
spray and other weapons continue to be used by homeowners 
a new slowacting insecticide sulfuramid was developed by usda 
scientists to use against fire ants and was also found to be 90 
percent effective against household ants and roaches 
sulfuramid was used as a wetting agent to coat baits with a 
potential insecticide for fire ants says retired entomologist 
clifford s lofgren 
when the ants were killed not only by the test bait but also 
by an nontoxic control bait coated only with the wetting agent we 
realized we had stumbled onto a new class of compounds for 
controlling them he said 
the epa recently approved sulfuramid which is sold by griffin 
corp of valdosta ga under an exclusive license from the 
commerce department for use against household ants and roaches

a former engineer at the rocky flats nuclear 
weapons factory contends the plant operator knew for several years 
of possible accumulations of radioactive plutonium in the 
ventilation system but failed to investigate 
james stone a utility design engineer at the site near denver 
from 1980 to 1986 said in a telephone interview monday that the 
operator rockwell international corp ignored the repeated 
warnings he voiced as early as 1984 
they just said forget it were not going to do it stone 
said 
stone had no firm evidence of plutonium accumulations in air 
ducts but his suspicions were proven correct by a team of 
independent investigators who last friday told the energy 
department they found 11 pounds of plutonium in air ducts linked to 
gloveboxes or work chambers in which plutonium is manually 
processed 
the presence of plutonium in the ducts is considered a hazard 
because under certain circumstances it could lead to an 
uncontrolled nuclear reaction such a reaction could in extreme 
cases release lethal amounts of radioactivity 
the investigators said the plutonium they found did not present 
an immediate health danger because it was not being released to the 
environment but they criticized rockwell for not having 
investigated earlier on the basis of stones reports 
rocky flats is owned by the energy department and makes 
plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads 
rockwell had contended prior to the investigation by experts 
from scientech inc an engineering and management company based in 
idaho falls idaho that there were no accumulations of plutonium 
in any ductwork at rocky flats 
ed heintz a rockwell spokesman said monday he could not 
comment on stones allegations because they might be linked to an 
fbi investigation of possible violations of environmental laws at 
rocky flats he said the company was not prepared to comment on the 
scientech findings because it had not studied the final report 
which is highly critical of rockwells safety procedures 
the fbi began investigating rocky flats last june but no 
indictments have been handed down so far 
the independent investigators were sent to the weapons plant in 
july by energy secretary james d watkins who is attempting to 
resolve uncertainties about operational safety and waste management 
at rocky flats and other weapons plants 
stone said he realized the probability of plutonium deposits in 
the ventilation system in 1984 while he was helping plan a 
renovation of building 881 a former site of uranium and plutonium 
processing that now is used as a laboratory and computer center 
stone said rockwell did not act on his advice that the hundreds 
of feet of stainless steel ducts be sandblasted or cleaned in some 
other way to remove any plutonium buildup 
it wasnt part of the original scope of their work so they 
werent going to do it he said 
roger mattson a vice president of scientech and leader of the 
rocky flats investigation said in a telephone interview that 
rockwell shut down several of the gloveboxes after the discovery in 
august and began taking steps to correct the problem 
mattson said its still an open question as to whether 
plutonium deposits have accumulated in the ductwork at building 
881 where stone had been working 
stone contended in an august 1986 lawsuit against rockwell that 
he had been fired five months earlier in retaliation for having 
raised numerous health and safety issues including the risk posed 
by the plutonium deposits stones lawyer hartley alley said the 
suit is scheduled to go to trial later this month

federal housing officials say theyre honoring 
most loan commitments they made in a 35 million spending spree in 
a multifamily loan program on the last day of fiscal 1988 
more than 100 loans from the section 312 loan program were 
approved that day sept 30 1988 in an apparent rush to spend 
the money before it was transferred to another program at the 
department of housing and urban development according to agency 
records and auditors 
hud auditors determined most of the loans were approved despite 
incomplete applications and processing but were told by the 
departments attorneys the government must keep its funding 
promises in all but a few cases 
where commitments were made they were honored but hud will 
not be making conditional commitments in the future department 
spokesman jack flynn said 
the section 312 program has not received new funding for several 
years but continues to make loans using payments on outstanding 
loans roughly 200 million was available for the program in fiscal 
1988 
in the final month of the budget year section 312 loans 
totaling more than 40 million were approved including 107 
totaling 353 million on sept 30 according to hud records 
seven of the loans later were canceled including the largest a 
61 million loan to convert a closed hotel in spokane wash to 
apartments 
there is nothing in the documents to suggest political 
favoritism was involved in the yearend loan approvals but the 
auditors and other hud officials said intense competition within 
hud for the shrinking federal housing allowance likely was a factor 
in the hasty approvals 
the auditors also raised questions about program management 
saying regulations requiring proper documentation and other checks 
before making loan commitments were ignored 
those criticisms mirror others levied at hud by auditors and 
congressional investigators who blame lax agency management for 
many of the problems being exposed in congressional hearings and 
internal reviews 
huds inspector general reviewed 19 of the biggest loans made in 
the final month of the 1988 fiscal year those for more than 
500000 and found 11 were approved on the final day in all 19 
cases the obligations totaling 29 million were improper because 
the necessary approval requirements had not been met the auditors 
concluded last month 
the auditors attributed the rush to spend the money to congress 
decision that any section 312 money not spent at the end of the 
fiscal year was to be transferred to the community development 
block grant program that program falls under a different hud 
department and provides loans and grants to projects designed to 
benefit low and moderateincome citizens 
we believe that most of the obligations were recorded because 
the staff wanted to obligate the available section 312 funds 
before they were reallocated to the community development block 
grant program the auditors concluded in a report late last month 
several hud officials interviewed in recent weeks said 
conditional approvals for section 312 loans had been a common 
practice for years with officials committing money to the projects 
before developers completed their applications 
but such approvals will no longer be given because of the 
concerns raised by the inspector general and huds legal counsel 
flynn said 
the spokane loan was canceled because a regional hud official 
who granted the project waivers didnt have the authority to do so 
according to hud records the six other canceled loans totaled 51 
million

an electrical fire broke out 
in an elevator shaft on the aircraft carrier uss forrestal on 
monday night and four sailors suffered minor injuries putting it 
out a navy spokesman said 
at this moment we believe the fire to be out navy spokesman 
bert byers said at 1215 am tuesday i believe it took place in 
one of the forward elevators just forward of the ships 
superstructure 
two people suffered cuts and bruises and two suffered smoke 
inhalation all four were treated at the naval stations 
dispensary byers said 
the fire erupted just after after 830 pm aboard the ship 
docked at mayport naval station near jacksonville the fire was 
primarily confined to a machinery room inside the shaft of an 
elevator that raises aircraft to deck level said cmdr tim taylor 
there was quite a bit of smoke he said 
he couldnt say where or when the ship was to be deployed next 
at full capacity the ship carries 148 officers and 2810 
enlisted men plus 2480 officers and men in the air wing for a

the air wing was not on board monday leaving a crew of about 
2500 to 3000 sailors on the ship a spokesman said 
the 1086 footlong forrestal which is based at mayport was 
the first us aircraft carrier launched after world war ii and the 
first designed to operate jet aircraft 
now the third oldest us carrier on active service the 
forrestal has been modernized several times since it was launched 
on dec 11 1954 it underwent a major refit from january 1983 to

neither bees nor rocks nor fastdrying 
cement could stop county officials from placing a marker at the 
states geographic center 
about 40 people attended a ceremony saturday to install a brass 
us geological survey marker at a spot four miles up the devils 
gulch trail south of cashmere 
but the siting was no simple matter 
on the day before david warby cashmere centennial chairman 
and randy king pushed a wheelbarrow carrying a portable generator 
toward the site the generator was to power a drill which would 
make a hole for the anchor spike 
but a sharp rock flattened one of the wheelbarrow tires and as 
the two stashed the generator in the brush they set it down on a 
nest of bees 
they left hurriedly on saturday they retrieved the generator 
after spraying the bees with insecticide 
their hard luck persisted though at the site 
someone mixed up fastacting cement for anchoring the plaque 
sooner than expected and officials had to work fast to get the 
marker in place 
there was no time for speeches 
we just said this is the center of the state as near as 
anybody can tell warby said

the price of a ticket to trinity 
repertory theaters production of summerfolk tonight should 
spark precurtain murmurs thats because theatergoers are paying 
what they want 
the objective is to give everyone an opportunity to come to 
the theater said e timothy langan managing director of the 
theater company that has won many national honors 
the normal ticket price is 24 based on similar experiments by 
others in baltimore and san diego langan said he expected people 
tonight to pay 3 or 4 
but thats ok he said the whole purpose of this is for 
someone to be comfortable in coming to the theater 
patrons can offer a price as low as they want the only rule is 
they must pay something he said langan wont turn down offers of 
more than 24 
id love to see that he said there is a great pressure 
to produce quality shows and then the discussion gets into money 
and then theres pressure on ticket prices 
trinity has set aside 5000 from a sponsorship grant from rhode 
island hospital trust bank to cover projected losses

michael bishop was unsure about becoming a 
doctor and harold varmus wrote his thesis on dickens not dna but 
today the pair share the nobel prize in medicine 
the two microbiology researchers at the university of california 
at san francisco celebrated their award on monday by toasting each 
other with french champagne at a news conference at the university 
then they headed to candlestick park to watch the san francisco 
giants win the national league playoff series against the chicago 
cubs 
the 50member nobel assembly of the karolinska institute 
swedens largest and oldest medical university cited bishop and 
varmus for their discovery of a collection of normal genes that can 
cause cancer when they go awry 
in 1976 their research showed that normal genes that apparently 
control cell growth can undergo alterations that lead to the 
uncontrolled growth that is cancer 
their work has led to the discovery of more than 40 different 
genes that can cause cancer and is leading to better ways to 
diagnose cancer and predict who is at risk as knowledge of the 
genes increases researchers hope to find ways to block them if 
they become deranged stopping the growth of the cancerous cells 
the research helped scientists understand how cancer begins and 
it widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which 
govern the normal growth of cells the assembly said 
varmus called the research by him and bishop a cornerstone in 
understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer 
bishop and varmus were optimistic about the practical 
applications of their work but they were cautious about 
forecasting a cancer cure 
this is just another step in whats a long journey bishop 
said its very difficult to predict when a full view of the 
cancer cell will be at hand 
varmus saluted other researchers in the field saying we all 
stand on the shoulders of those who came before us 
but dr dominique stehelin a french researcher who carried out 
experiments overseen by bishop and varmus in the 1970s said 
bitterly monday that he was disappointed about not being included 
in the nobel prize 
this work belongs to me he said and i dont know why the 
scientific community refuses to attribute the discovery to me 
bishop and varmus called stehelins work crucial to their 
research but referred questions about the prize to the nobel 
committee 
we didnt nominate each other varmus said 
varmus said he abandoned plans to become an english professor 
and his studies of 17th century literature to attend medical 
school after learning that writer gertrude stein enrolled at john 
hopkins medical school after being told that medicine opens all 
doors 
gradually he found that he enjoyed being in the laboratory more 
than the clinic and his research career began 
my mother died of breast cancer but i dont know if that in 
itself caused me to study the cause of cancer theres hardly 
anybody in this room who is not touched by cancer somehow varmus 
said 
bishop said he was interested in science in high school and 
decided to become a doctor but he said that by the time i 
finished college i wasnt so sure i wanted to be a doctor 
it was a rural pennsylvania doctor robert kough who became his 
mentor and convinced him that his calling was in medical research 
kough director emeritus of hemotology at geisinger medical 
center in danville pa said bishops spark was recognized not 
only by me but by his professors by everybody who came into 
contact with him 
bishop a native of york pa holds degrees from gettysburg 
college and harvard varmus a native of oceanside ny has 
degrees from amherst college harvard and columbia 
both said they dont expect their lives to be dramatically 
altered because of winning the nobel prize 
its the only job ive ever had since putting on roofs in high 
school bishop quipped 
i like my life the way it is and i hope it stays that way 
varmus said the danger is youre supposed to be smarter today 
than you were yesterday and im not

the congressional friends of animals 
the caucuses plan to serve as forums for debate and 
clearinghouses of information on bills such as ones to make it 
illegal to break into laboratories and destroy documents prohibit 
certain lethal testing of laboratory animals and require special 
labels on cans of tuna that were caught in nets that endanger 
dolphins

east germanys communist leaders 
have found a new scapegoat to explain away mounting protests for 
reform and the refugee exodus the culprit is western news media 
worldwide television broadcasts of police beating people 
protesting for democratic reform in east berlin leipzig and 
elsewhere have pushed the communist government to bitter 
denunciations 
one party newspaper condemned the gang of western reporters 
while east berlins official news agency accused western 
journalists of working in cooperation with the demonstrators 
during protests police roughed up journalists smashed cameras 
confiscated film and ordered some photographers and television 
crews to leave the east german capital immediately they also 
detained at least two journalists before letting them go several 
hours later 
until recently large street protests were a rarity in a country 
whose government traditionally blamed its woes on western agents 
and an allegedly unfriendly government in bonn television footage 
of unrest was scarce 
but over the last month that has changed 
an exodus of at least 50000 east germans to west germany since 
sept 11 emboldened those left behind to speak out and protest 
during a weekend visit by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
east germanys 40th anniversary 
gorbachev attracted dozens of western correspondents and 
television crews anxious to know what he told east germanys 
hardline leader erich honecker who has rejected the reforms 
embraced by some east bloc allies 
consequently the many foreign journalists accredited to cover 
gorbachevs visit were on hand to hear the thousands of east 
germans who want reform 
in east berlin and five provincial cities police over the 
weekend beat and arrested hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
protesters 
east germanys leaders were angered the first broadside came on 
sunday after thousands of protesters filled east berlins main 
square 
in the evening hours of oct 7 troublemakers tried to disturb 
the peoples celebrations for the 40th anniverary of the gdr east 
germany the state news agency adn said in cooperation with 
western news media they banded together in the alexanderplatz 
east berlins main square and nearby areas and called out slogans 
against the republic 
among the slogans the protesters chanted was gorby gorby 
help us 
the east german government tried to clamp down on reporting 
sunday declaring whole areas of the capital offlimits to 
photographers that included a lutheran church that has become the 
focal point for east germanys growing opposition movement 
wherever the gang of western reporters went especially the 
television crews certain types showed up seconds later and started 
trouble the communist party youth newspaper junge welt charged 
but as if to balance hostility to the western news media the 
newspaper also said that its own photographers camera had been 
smashed in the weekend clashes 
the nations official newspapers printed sundays adn dispatch 
calling the prodemocracy demonstrators troublemakers 
west germany lodged an official protest against the east german 
interference with the western journalists but the east german 
governments diplomatic mission in bonn rejected the allegations 
west germanys ard television network also lodged a protest 
saying the east germans interference with its reporters work 
violated international rules and regulations including the 
helsinki accords

today a week after the african state normalized ties with the 
nationalist government on taiwan 
the official xinhua news agency said liberias ambassador to 
china j christopher ricks was summoned to the foreign ministry 
this morning to be told of the chinese decision 
liberia is the second nation this year following the west 
indies island state of grenada to normalize ties with taiwan a 
step which always leads to a severing of ties with the beijing 
government 
beijing which regards taiwan as a renegade province refuses to 
accept dual recognition of the governments in china and taiwan 
a foreign ministry official told ricks that liberias decision 
ran counter to principles set forth when the two countries 
established relations in 1977 when liberia recognized the peoples 
republic as the sole legal government representing china 
under such circumstances the chinese government cannot but 
suspend its diplomatic relations with liberia as of today xinhua 
quoted the ministry official as saying 
taiwans foreign minister lien chan in announcing the 
establishment of relations with liberia said the diplomatic 
victory was achieved because we are making more progress 
politically economically and socially than communist china 
china now has relations with 137 countries compared to 25 for

for many residents of 
st croix the resort island raked by hurricane hugo and then 
plundered by looters life is still chaotic 
three weeks after one of the centurys most destructive storms 
struck the us virgin islands on its way to puerto rico and the 
carolinas most of st croixs 56000 inhabitants still have no 
electricity or telephone service running water is just beginning 
to be restored 
thousands of houses schools and churches are destroyed and 
some beaches are fouled by sewage and fuel oil 
health officials have raised concerns about the possibility of 
epidemics caused by contaminated water a lack of refrigeration 
poor sanitation and millions of mosquitoes breeding in stagnant 
water 
a tent hospital in christiansted is the only one on the island 
admitting patients 
the looting has long since stopped but 1000 military police 
deployed by president bush to help restore order still patrol the 
streets with pistols and m16 rifles a curfew remains in effect 
scores of supermarkets and hardware appliance and clothing 
stores stand in ruins their shelves emptied by looters 
we dont have anything to eat we dont have any stores to go 
to said lillian santos a mother of seven children ranging in 
age from 10 months to 20 years as she stood in a red cross food 
line in the eastern port town of frederiksted 
we need rice we need corn flour she said i try not to 
get depressed i just have to think things are going to get 
better 
st croix about 70 miles east of puerto rico was by far the 
hardest hit of the us virgin islands although st thomas and st 
john also suffered substantial damage when hurricane hugo hit on 
sept 17 
three people were killed on st croix where winds of up to 216 
mph stripped the once lush landscape of its foliage from the air 
towns on the 84squaremile island look as if they were bombed 
dr carlton hodgson director of the frederiksted health center 
said he and 13 other doctors have treated nearly 5000 patients for 
stormrelated injuries such as nail punctures broken bones and 
burns 
hodgson said he was beginning to see patients with psychological 
problems caused by hugos devastation 
a typical case he said was a man depressed over the loss of 
rare vases collected over a lifetime the thought of having 
something to leave as a legacy is not there anymore hodgson said 
the territorial government has estimated damage to the virgin 
islands at 500 million but lt gov derek hodge said he expected 
the figure to rise to 4 billion damage to the giant hess oil 
refinery in st croix alone was 100 million he said 
the bush administration has alloted 11 billion for hurricane 
relief in north carolina and south carolina puerto rico and the 
us virgin islands 
hodge said he believed it would take up to two years for st 
croix to recover fully from the hurricane 
this is going to be a long one said gerald connolly who is 
directing the federal emergency management agencys relief 
operation in the territory i think well be in the 
fullsteamahead recovery program for six months we may still be 
building some houses after that 
federal officials say 6300 houses in st croix about onethird 
of all homes were heavily damaged or destroyed hodge said most of 
the homeless were staying with relatives but that 500 remained in 
shelters 
tap water started flowing to st croix homes on thursday but 
was being rationed while repairs continued officials said it would 
take at least six months to fully restore electricity and 
telephones 
there is extensive damage to hotels guesthouses restaurants 
and marinas and the outlook for tourism is bleak 
however nine of st croixs 13 hotels say they hope to reopen 
by the start of the winter tourist season in december meantime 
hundreds of workers have been laid off and there is concern some 
businesses might never reopen 
some businesses said they were ruined by looters who went on a 
fourday spree and stole everything from food and building supplies 
to lawn mowers and tvs 
fbi agents are searching homes for stolen goods and the us 
attorneys office is investigating allegations that members of the 
national guard and the local police force were involved

an obscure chapter of world war ii 
history is emerging from beneath the frigid gemclear waters off 
the aleutian islands where divers made a hightech survey of 
japanese wrecks 
a japanese submarine six other vessels and what may be the hulk 
of an american b17 bomber were painstakingly charted by divers who 
braved 35degree waters off kiska and attu islands last month 
the relics were measured and filmed so the national park service 
can preserve the story of the bloody battle to drive the japanese 
from the only american soil held by foreign soldiers since the war 
of 1812 
from sept 5 to sept 22 a team of about 30 navy and national 
park service divers working in 20minute shifts off the uss 
safeguard explored the sandy bottom of kiska harbor 
they found the 243foot submarine resting in 80 feet of water 
said park service archaeologist susan morton 
it looked like it sustained direct bomb damage morton said 
the conning tower was blown off and was sitting in the water 
nearby other than the conning tower damage it was in good shape 
the desolate windswept islands which lie in the nearly 
uninhabited chain that stretches west from alaska presented 
imperial japan with a potential base for bombing runs on the 
airplane plants of seattle a 12hour flight to the southeast 
japanese soldiers took attu and kiska in june 1942 building 
roads and even a firefighting water system that remain intact 
us forces stormed attu on may 11 1943 retaking the island in 
a 19day bloodbath which left 549 dead it took three months to 
root out the last of the japanese on the treeless island only 28 
of the 2650 japanese defenders were captured the rest were killed 
or committed suicide 
on kiska 200 miles to the southeast japanese forces carrying 
only personal gear and rifles slipped off the island in bad weather 
on july 28 unaware allied forces bombarded kiska and came ashore 
aug 15 despite the lack of an enemy garrison the invasion force 
sustained more than 300 casualties with most falling to booby 
traps or shootouts between nervous troops 
the park service already protects the islands surface as a 
historical preserve now the wrecks beneath the islands waters 
will be nominated for protection under federal historic landmark 
laws morton said 
the survey team aboard the safeguard started by probing the 
bottom of kiska harbor by sonar and marking each wreck with a buoy 
then a 1by2foot remotecontrolled submersible with a video 
camera was sent down to inspect with sonar contacts if the find 
was worth inspecting divers made detailed measured drawings 
the team brought plans for ships it expected to encounter and 
as the drawings were brought to the surface they were entered into 
a computer morton said we had uptotheminute 
computergenerated measured drawings she said 
while the divers worked other members of the team started an 
inventory of the rich japanese and american military historical 
sites on the island itself some structures had collapsed others 
were obscured by more than 40 years of vegetation 
a lot of the japanese roads still are in good shape there are 
miles and miles and miles of communication lines both american and 
japanese morton said 
the japanese abandoned more than 50 structures including shinto 
shrines 6inch coastal guns 25mm and 75mm antiaircraft weapons 
and piles of other equipment 
the diving team planned to work off both kiska and attu but 
days of 50knot winds and 25foot seas at attu delayed that part of 
the survey until at least next year morton said and more work is 
needed at kiska where more submarines and destroyers are known to 
have been sunk 
the projects charts will be available to the public morton 
said and a commercialgrade video should be available in the 
spring

a prison parolee with a history of sexual 
assaults pleaded guilty to kidnapping an 11yearold girl and told 
authorities he accidentally ran over her with his car and buried 
her in a georgia forest 
the prosecutor who negotiated the plea bargain monday said he 
hoped eventually to file murder charges against charles 
blassingame who agreed to help investigators find the body of 
tammy lynn maciulis missing for two years 
i just totally cant believe he accidentally ran her over with 
his car said marinette county district attorney tim duket the 
prosecution reserves the right to charge him with firstdegree or 
seconddegree murder if in fact he takes us to the body and 
through scientific or forensic evidence it can be proven the death 
was not of an accidental nature 
blassingames plea in marinette county circuit court is the 
latest twist in a bizarre story of a prison correspondence that 
brought the georgia sex offender to live with a marinette woman and 
her teenage daughter 
blassingame 43 had been living with the woman in the same 
apartment complex as tammys family for about three weeks when he 
and the girl disappeared july 10 1987 
prosecutors maintained that blassingame kidnapped tammy 
intending to assault her the defendant said he left town before 
dawn that morning and was driving south on us 41 when he 
discovered the girl in the back seat of his car 
he said tammy asked him to take her to her fathers home near 
chicago but worried because of his criminal record he made her 
get out of the car while driving away he said he accidentally 
hit her 
then he says he put her body in a duffel bag drove south and 
eventually buried her in some woods outside dalton ga 
the prosecutor who labeled the story incredible originally 
charged blassingame with kidnapping and enticing a minor for 
immoral purposes in tammys disappearance he also was charged with 
attempted seconddegree sexual assault on his girlfriends 
16yearold daughter 
the latter two counts were dropped in the plea bargain which 
calls for blassingame to serve 25 years in prison on the kidnapping 
charge if the body isnt found blassingame has agreed to plead 
guilty to extortion in an unrelated case and serve a additional six 
years 
circuit judge john hoffmann accepted the agreement but delayed 
sentencing until after the search for the body 
authorities said tammys mother phyllis nicklaus assented to 
the terms of the agreement 
according to the prosecutor blassingame has at least four 
sexrelated convictions paroled after serving about seven years of 
a 30year term in one of the cases blassingame went to wisconsin 
in midjune 1987 because of a romance with tammys neighbor his 
prison pen pal duket said they struck up a correspondence through 
a penpal advertisement in a magazine he said 
the relationship soon soured duket said noting that the 
couples prison correspondence would have been used as evidence if 
the case had gone to trial 
the prisoner asked for pictures of his pen pals daughter in a 
swimsuit 
duket recalled the contents of the prisoners letters saying 
he wanted the woman to adopt a girl between 7 and 11 he 
asks whether the womans daughter is a virgin or not because 
hes going to be her father after all

delegates who dissolved the countrys 
ruling communist party ended a fourday congress today after voting 
to keep their old leader but picking a reform slate to fill other 
top posts 
a closed session chose rezsoe nyers chairman of the dissolved 
party late monday as president of its successor the hungarian 
socialist party which professes to now embrace constitutional 
democracy 
the vote followed debate in which key reformers opposed to some 
of nyers beliefs including his support for continued party 
influence in the workplace reluctantly shelved reservations to 
avoid a possible split 
reformers want a clear break with the past and that includes 
depoliticizing the workplace where under traditional oneparty in 
the east bloc the leaders of party cells organized in the workplace 
have been de facto bosses 
the congress also elected a 25member national steering 
committee to replace the communist party politburo 
among its members are key reformers imre pozsgay and premier 
miklos nemeth who belonged to the old partys collective 
leadership 
but the two were not chosen as vice presidents to nyers an 
indication that most of the 1200 delegates were unwilling to 
completely part with the past the new partys statutes had 
foreseen two vice presidents and liberals proposed pozsgay and 
nemeth 
however the clearly reformist makeup of the steering committee 
the partys executive body was expected to please some liberals 
unhappy with the choice of nyers 
despite the partys commitment to multiparty democracy 
reformist delegates expressed fear that the it does not differ 
enough from its predecessor to attract much support among the 
people 
the choice of nyers was likely to increase anxieties among 
leading reformers that their party will fare poorly in hungarys 
first free national elections in 41 years which have been promised 
by june 
in its last two hours after midnight the congress approved the 
following resolutions all falling short of the wishes of the most 
committed reformers among the delegates 
start of discussions in parliament about the fate of 
partycontrolled assets accrued illegally during its predecessors 
41 years in power 
informal support of the largely volunteer workers militia 
formerly controlled by the communist party and facing dissolution 
if it decides to give up its paramilitary character and become an 
emergency aid organization during fires floods and other 
catastrophes 
declaration of oct 23 the start of the 1956 nationalist 
uprising that was crushed by soviet tanks as a day of national 
reconciliation 
earlier nyers tired but clearly elated told reporters that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had been the first to 
congratulate him 
gorbachev conducts very fast diplomacy he said they gave 
me his telegram within two hours of my election 
the national steering committee list contained names of 
reformers only including some former politburo members such as 
foreign minister gyula horn missing were the names of other less 
reformminded politburo members 
politburo member karoly grosz the most conservative of the old 
partys collective leadership was among those not elected to the 
new body but he had said previously that he would not seek a 
senior post 
the new leaders were elected just hours after the party adopted 
a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break with a 
past that advocated the leninst dictatorship of the proletariat 
delegates overwhelmingly approved striving for a 
constitutional state based on a multiparty system where the source 
of power is the will of the people expressed in free elections 
the party changed its name in a vote on saturday 
before monday nights secret vote for its new leaders there 
were serious ideological rifts among the three top candidates in 
the collective leadership 
but nemeth said earlier to be siding with pozsgay against 
nyers told reporters going into the congress hall for the vote 
that the danger of a split has been averted 
nyers criticized by some reformers for not being a strong 
advocate of barring oldstyle communists from the new party 
repeated that there would be no purge 
we will part from certain people but it should be a friendly 
parting he told reporters after his election 
the congress has rejected radical reformers demands that 
diehard marxists be barred from the new party stipulating instead 
that all accepting its orientation in writing could become members 
reformers were further embittered sunday when nyers declared 
that he backed continued political organizing in the workplace 
which pozsgay opposes 
the congress subsequently voted for the motion to continue 
organizing at factories and in offices despite reformist protests

politicians who claim to fight on 
behalf of family values in battling abortion and promoting 
prayer in school may be off target according to a study released 
today 
politicians and pundits of various stripes have attempted to 
coopt the term family values in pursuit of their own agendas 
said the study on the american family which included information 
from 1200 randomly selected respondents 
the survey was commissioned by massachusetts mutual life 
insurance co 
the respondents were presented with 28 value statements and 
asked how well the term family value described each one 
topping the list of responses were love and emotional support for 
family members respect for others and taking responsibility for 
ones actions 
being in favor of prayer in school ranked 25th and 
opposing abortion ranked 27th 
it tells us that our legislators really dont know what 
theyre doing said dr lee salk who was hired by 
springfieldbased massachusetts mutual to review the study 
findings theyre all paying lip service to something theyve not 
really examined 
salk said a true political family value might be granting 
paternity leave or employers giving time off for parents to attend 
school functions 
the study said americans are changing the way they define 
family but family is still the center of their lives 
by 3to1 americans defined the family as a group of people 
who love and care for each other over the traditional 
definitions of people related by blood or marriage 
eightyone percent of the respondents listed family as one 
of their top two sources of pleasure with friends the next 
most mentioned source 
people cherish the family and they cherish it because of their 
own experience even when their experience has been less than 
perfect said dr albert solnit of the child study center at yale 
university one of the advisers to the study 
even with the rate of divorce and even with the rate of 
remarriage the expectation of being able to love someone and being 
able to be cared for by someone is universal solnit said 
while family was a top source of pleasure to americans it also 
was a chief source of worry the survey found fiftyone percent 
said providing financial security for their families was one of the 
things they worry about most 
americans also believe that the root cause of social problems is 
found in the family with the largest group 20 percent blaming 
the problems on parents failing to discipline their children 
but the question of whether the american family is actually in 
decline drew a paradoxical response that salk described as im 
ok but everybody else out there is not 
more than half of respondents gave a negative rating to the 
quality of american family life but 71 percent said they were at 
least very satisfied with their own family life 
the survey said that might mean respondents werent willing to 
speak honestly about their own problems or that the declining 
american family is a myth fueled by widespread media reports of 
crime and social ills 
the survey was part of massachusetts mutuals american family 
values program initiated in 1988 to get a better understanding 
of the family their basic market said spokeswoman eva dion 
the program included discussions with family experts an 
analysis of media issues discussion with four focus groups of 
families in baltimore and denver and a random telephone survey 
conducted in june the margin of error for the sample was less than 
35 percent

by the time firefighters arrived at the 
schoolhouse flames were shooting from the windows the blaze one 
of hundreds started each year by juveniles in the houston area was 
the creation of 13yearold samuel 
the seventhgrader had gone to the school for shelter from the 
rain once inside he flicked his cigarette lighter until it 
ignited books 
now five months after counseling and participation in a 
nationally recognized houston fire department program called cease 
fire samuel says hes glad he was caught 
i tell other kids not to do things like that he says i 
can do better than what i had been doing i tell them not to do the 
bad stuff i learned the bad stuff the hard way 
samuel and about 1500 other juveniles ranging in age from 10 
to 16 and their parents have gone through the program the 
brainchild of houston fire marshal eddie corral 
the program puts out more fires than a fire truck said 
corral a 32year fire department veteran and marshal since 1981 
cease fire is marking its eighth anniversary this week in 
conjunction with national fire prevention week earlier this year 
the us fire administration cited the houston program as one of 
the nations most successful and innovative juvenile fire 
prevention pilot programs 
the majority of us arson crimes are committed by children who 
cause more than 11 billion in damage per year corral said 
he said about 50 percent of houstons arson fires were set by 
youths at the time of the programs inception now he estimates 
that juvenile arson amounts to about 10 percent of all arson crimes 
cease fire also has held 12week courses at various neighborhood 
community centers upon graduation each young person is given a 
badge and acts as a junior fire marshal in neighborhoods thousands 
have attended the classes he said 
now however corral said he is scrambling for funds the 
programs counseling service had been supported by 100000 in 
federal grants but no federal funding will be available in the 
next year 
he said he will seek private funds and continue parts of the 
program 
researchers at the university of texas school of public health 
meanwhile have applied for a grant to study the case histories of 
the 1500 juvenile arsonists who have been through cease fire 
corral said he hopes the study will renew interest in his program 
our highest priority is to get our message to kids early 
enough so they refrain from experimenting or playing with fire 
corral said prevention is the key to fire protection

republican gubernatorial candidate j 
marshall coleman accused democratic foe l douglas wilder of 
pandering to womens fears by attacking his strong antiabortion 
stance 
during their first televised debate monday night coleman said 
state law allowing unrestricted firsttrimester abortions would not 
change if he becomes governor 
you know that it is a false fear coleman said 
but coleman didnt say he would veto any repeal measure only 
that the state general assembly would not pass such a bill 
wilder charged that coleman was trying to turn the clock 
back on abortion 
the battle over abortion has heated up since july when the us 
supreme court upheld restrictions placed on abortion by the state 
of missouri 
coleman a former state attorney general and wilder the 
lieutenant governor are vying to succeed democrat gerald l 
baliles who is barred by the state constitution from seeking 
reelection wilder is trying to become the nations first black 
elected governor 
coleman has said repeatedly he would allow abortions only when 
necessary to save the mothers life wilder said coleman refuses to 
rule out signing a bill banning abortions for victims of rape or 
incest 
coleman would say only that there will be no law restricting 
abortion in cases of rape or incest when i am governor 
he said wilders attacks have been insensitive to women and an 
effort to gain politically from a highly emotional issue 
but wilder said i trust the women of virginia and thats the 
difference between you and i

surgery to remove 7yearold jamie fiskes 
enlarged spleen enabled doctors to inspect the liver the youngster 
received at 11 months they liked what they saw 
jamie whose fathers desperate appeal for a liver donor six 
years ago helped shape the nations organ transplant policy was in 
critical but stable condition after mondays surgery 
dr john najarian chief of surgery at university of minnesota 
hospital said jamies other organs looked perfectly fine 
during the threehour surgery 
her liver is as normal as we can possibly hope for it to be 
it looks perfectly normal he said 
the girls longrange prognosis is excellent he said adding 
that he has felt all along that she could live a normal life i 
feel even more convinced now than before since we now have had an 
actual opportunity to see her liver najarian said 
najarian said doctors are satisfied that the enlarged spleen was 
the cause of internal bleeding which had hospitalized the 
youngster three times in the past month 
the spleen was seven or eight times the normal size he said or 
about the size of a melon a normal spleen for a youngster that age 
is about the size of a lemon he said 
najarian performed jamies liver transplant at the same hospital 
when she was 11 months old that operation followed her familys 
nationally televised pleas for a liver donor 
their efforts ultimately led to the national transplant act of 
1984 which created a national computer system used to match donors 
with recipients 
najarian said mondays spleenremoval surgery left the youngster 
without a very important source of fighting infection because 
of that he said she was given a vaccination to guard against 
pneumoniatype illnesses and will have to take daily penicillin 
tablets the rest of her life 
hopefully shell do well and be out of here in a weeks 
time he said its hard to predict 
jamie has survived longer than any of the 200 other liver 
transplant patients at the university since 1968 najarian said 
she was born nov 26 1981 with biliary atresia a condition in 
which the livers bile ducts are blocked months later the fiskes 
learned that only a liver transplant could save her life 
jamies father charles said after the operation that he and 
his wife marilyn were looking forward to tickling jamies toes 
when the anesthesia wore off the fiskes live in bridgewater mass 
shes as healthy as she can be considering the fact that she 
was dying back in 1982 he said

four divers experimenting in longterm 
underwater survival have plunged into a 74day mission to test 
breathing compounds that might eventually be used in orbiting space 
stations researchers say 
the divers who submerged on monday will live in a capsule 
simulating dives up to 980 feet deep until dec 21 in the operation 
directed by the french navy and the maritime expertise co or 
comex of marseille comex said 
a team of 24 scientists will gauge the reaction of the divers to 
a hydrogenoxygen breathing compound researchers hope will allow 
people to stay under water longer and at greater depth than the 
traditional hydrogen oxygen and helium 
they are also testing a heliumoxygen blend though the 
hydrogenoxygen blend is the focus of the experiment 
the 313 million experiment dubbed hydraix also will 
measure the physical and psychological effects of long submersion 
comex said 
the results could help submarines reach lower depths and 
eventually aid in the development of manned space stations 
according to the national center for space studies 
the divers whose identities were not disclosed will work seven 
hours 30 minutes daily and communicate by telephone with their 
families once a week they will also receive televised newscasts 
the experiment calls for the men aged 28 to 33 to spend the 
first three days at 33 feet under water on a mixture of helium and 
oxygen 
they will then be lowered to 230 feet and be fed a mixture of 
hydrogen and oxygen which will be raised in pressure over eight 
days until simulating a depth of nearly 1000 feet after 20 days 
helium will be introduced and hydrogen phased out until the divers 
are breathing a heliumoxygen compound

people gather at a fruit stand 
speaking in low voices they are talking about a newspaper photo of 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
the picture was taken wednesday the day after noriega survived 
a coup attempt he stands at a window at panamanian defense forces 
headquarters waving to a crowd 
behind the general is an image not a person and they cant 
make it out some panamanians do not rule out supernatural 
intervention on noriegas behalf 
it is said the general has a haitian spiritual advisor that he 
worships african gods clearly they are powerful for he has put 
down two coup attempts in 18 months and fended off the united 
states which wants him out of office 
many rumors roam the streets of panama where people fear the 
general so much they are afraid to let it show 
on oct 3 noriega was captured and held for five hours by 
rebels but he survived retained his post as head of the defense 
forces and his grip on power in panama 
now it is said the general will stop at nothing and panamanians 
fear nothing will stop him 
blows for the undecided noriega said two days after the 
uprising lead for the enemy and silver for the friend 
officially ten rebels died in the uprising eight of them 
officers but there are rumors of trucks loaded with the corpses of 
fallen mutineers 
some reports say noriega personally shot the leader of last 
weeks abortive coup you are a dead man he is supposed to 
have told maj moises giroldi who withered and dropped his gun 
a list is being made of the disloyal the government employees 
who do not enthusiastically support the general 
the list the list the list noriega said when he announced 
the purge names names 
on the day of the coup attempt people thought the military 
strongman had fallen they waved handkerchiefs or honked horns to 
celebrate while some danced in the streets a few church bells 
rang 
but noriega didnt fall and now hes taking down names 
two days after the coup attempt noriegas gunmen dispersed a 
crowd around opposition leader guillermo endaras office and sent 
him running with blows 
i did not hear anything it is not good for me to hear 
anything said a street vendor plying his trade a few yards away 
a homeowner lets in a stranger who wants to borrow a telephone 
when he realizes the stranger is a journalist his finger comes 
down on the button to cut off the call in midconversation no 
politics here he says 
some taxi drivers wont pick up journalists it would be bad for 
business to be seen with a reporter who may want to go to unsafe 
places such as the cemetery where giroldi was buried monday 
one fallen rebel was refused burial in his family parish the 
priest a defense forces chaplain had a choice between god and 
noriega he chose the general 
noriega has taken on god before his troops teargassed churches 
when dissent was still public 
people avoided mass the sunday after the coup just in case 
giroldis widow did not attend his burial monday she and her 
threee children were hidden at a us military base fort clayton 
after the coup the washington post reported today they and 36 
others were flown to the united states over the weekend 
they murdered him giroldis mother cried throwing herself 
on the casket she said he had been shot once in the head and twice 
in the chest 
a wreath of red carnations lay at the foot of the altar from 
your old friends it said no names 
the opposition which once rallied tens of thousands in streets 
and won the may 7 elections noriega later annulled sat out the 
uprising 
wed just have been supplying the bodies christian democrat 
leader ricardo arias calderon said later 
the truth is we are all afraid another opposition leader 
said 
even the unkind nickname noriega earned because of his 
pockmarked skin pineapple face has taken on new meaning the 
pineapple people say is the toughest of tropical fruits it 
doesnt fall it has spines 
panamanians made their feelings about noriega clear in may 
balloting the united states also insists he has to go 
youll have to kill me first he said facing the mutineers 
he has made that perfectly clear 
the united states says the rebels werent prepared to take that 
step nor were they prepared to hand noriega over to face us drug 
trafficking indictments

hurricane hugo put a lot of people out 
of work temporarily but shouldnt cause longterm damage to the 
economy the mayor said 
also monday army troops arrived to help cart away mountains of 
debris and smashed appliances and furniture left in the storms 
wake 
unemployment in south carolina jumped from 45 percent to more

our goal is to have our tourism economy back to full steam as 
quickly as possible so that jobs that have been lost can be 
replaced riley said 
growth will continue he predicted as thousands migrate to the 
area to retire or work in the beach resorts 
charleston was booming more than it had in 100 years and the 
reasons for that boom have not changed the mayor said 
the rev jesse jackson suggested that unemployed youths be given 
federal job training so they can help rebuild the region 
the silver lining in the cloud is the chance to train and 
retrain people jackson said monday in greenville lets train 
our youths to do the work 
jackson said he met last week with us labor secretary 
elizabeth dole and she was receptive to the proposal 
about 250 engineers and soldiers from fort stewart ga were 
expected to hit the streets today in charleston berkeley and 
dorchester counties to help clean up they brought 13 frontend 
loaders and 40 dump trucks 
riley said he hoped much of the debris could be cleared in two 
weeks although army officials werent as optimistic 
we could have people cleaning up for the next six months 
said lt col jim scott district engineer for the charleston 
district of the us army corps of engineers 
the army will remain in the state for another week while the 
corps arranges with private contractors to complete the work 
streets throughout the region known as the lowcountry are 
littered with piles of leaves broken limbs and logs from felled 
trees some piled so high they obscure the view of the houses 
beyond 
refrigerators and other appliances are piled up along the 
streets in lowlying areas and islands that flooded during the 
storm 
no one knows how much debris may be strewn along streets and 
highways but riley said 1000 truck loads a day are moved out of 
charleston alone 
the federal government agreed last week to pick up the tab for 
the entire cost of removing the debris that will save the state 
and local governments as much as 50 million riley said

a jury convicted a man of planting 13 
bombs around a southern indiana city in a plot that prosecutors 
said stemmed from a lifelong rivalry with a state legislator 
i know im innocent god knows im innocent a 
biblecarrying john m hubbard iii told reporters as marshals led 
him from the courthouse 
the jury deliberated just over three hours monday before 
returning guilty verdicts on 29 counts in us district court 
family members who sat in the courtroom including hubbards 
wife julie began to cry as the verdict was read hubbard also 
wiped away tears 
we love you and still believe in you hubbards mother opal 
kramer told him as he was being led away 
hubbard turned to her and said let the world know 
hubbard 32 and jerry a conrad 42 were arrested may 17 and 
charged in connection with the 13 bombs that were found july 5 
1988 beneath bridges and behind buildings in the city of salem 
conrad who worked with hubbard at a salem factory was 
convicted on all counts following a trial last month 
the charges against hubbard included conspiracy illegal 
possession of dynamite 14 counts of making bombs and 13 counts of 
attempting to destroy bridges and buildings used in interstate 
commerce 
prosecutors contended hubbard was motivated to place the bombs 
around salem because of his lifelong rivalry with state rep frank 
newkirk jr a democrat from salem he resented him for a 
lifetime of accomplishments that he thought frank newkirk jr had 
that mr hubbard didnt assistant us attorney robert stanley 
powell said during closing arguments 
he described hubbard as a guerrilla fighter in his own mind 
he wanted the thrill of being able to see the fear and the 
panic on peoples faces about the bombs and the chaos he had 
created in salem powell said 
watts rested his case without calling any defense witnesses the 
attorney said he felt the government had not proved its case 
against hubbard beyond a reasonable doubt 
he told jurors the governments case was riddled with 
mistakes and based on circumstantial evidence 
watts said he was uncertain whether the case would be appealed 
judge sarah evans barker set no date for sentencing 
hubbard who has been in custody since his arrest in may faces 
up to 285 years in prison

for the first time in the soviet history 
lawmakers have voted into place a legal framework that gives 
workers the right to strike 
but the complex measure passed by the supreme soviet legislature 
on monday also bans strikes in almost a dozen strategic sectors of 
the economy 
only 12 of the chambers more than 400 deputies voted against 
the bill with 10 members abstaining the official tass news agency 
reported 
the supreme soviet reconvened today to consider price 
stabilization measures tass said inflation has only recently been 
acknowledged to be a problem in the soviet union 
the need for a labor law became urgent this summer when hundreds 
of thousands of coal miners went on strike for better working 
conditions and political reform 
the law was also needed to curb the now commonplace stoppages 
provoked by ethnic conflict thousands of russian workers in 
moldavia and estonia walked off the job recently to protest laws 
they viewed as disciminatory 
although strikes were not expressly forbidden by soviet law the 
few stoppages that occurred before president mikhail s gorbachev 
came to power were brutally suppressed 
gorbachev has not moved to crush labor unrest but has warned 
that widespread strikes threaten to undermine his efforts to 
overhaul the economy to make it more marketoriented and encourage 
greater democracy in politics 
he backed the righttostrike law which prohibits strikes that 
create a threat to peoples lives and health 
it also bans stoppages by workers in railroads public 
transportation civil aviation communications energy defense 
government bodies law enforcement and roundtheclock production 
industries the agency said 
in addition the law forbids politically or ethnically motivated 
strikes tass said 
only with all other options exhausted does the union have the 
right to strike to launch a legal strike a union must first give 
a conciliatory commission comprising representatives of both 
labor and management five days to resolve the dispute if that 
fails arbitration has seven days to work things out before the 
union may call a walkout 
lawmakers of the supreme soviet which was a mere rubber stamp 
for decisions of the communist leadership until gorbachevs reforms 
gave it real power contested many of the laws provisions monday 
and voted on some 50 proposed amendments 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov suggested that some 
form of political strike be considered legal but his proposal was 
defeated tass said several deputies complained that too many 
sectors of the economy were prohibited from striking under the new 
law those sectors can appeal to the supreme soviet with their 
complaints 
the law follows an emergency measure passed by the supreme 
soviet on oct 3 banning strikes until the general law could be 
passed 
the coal strikes over the summer paralyzed much of the crucial 
coal industry and ended only after the government conceded to 
virtually all the miners demands 
the miners had sought more consumer goods and more local control 
over their industries 
although he expressed sympathy for the miners gorbachev has 
said repeatedly that such strikes could lead to anarchy and 
economic disaster

prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party opened its annual fourday conference today amid 
fears of a currency crisis and with its popularity at an eightyear 
low 
mrs thatcher told party members at a preconference dinner in 
the northwest seaside resort of blackpool late monday the 
economy is stronger than ever living standards are higher than 
ever 
but newspaper headlines today spoke of crisis 
the london times wrote tories gather in blackpool as shares 
and sterling slump referring to the british currency 
the independent read fears of crisis as pound plunges 
sterling collapse triggers sharp fall in share prices 
the financial times britains leading business daily said 
substantial selling on fears that interest rates will not be 
raised further 
the pound was down early today by 1 cent and 4 cents lower than 
it was before lawson raised the british equivalent of the prime 
rate by 1 point to 15 percent on thursday 
the interest rate rise was necessary and this government 
always does what is necessary and always has said mrs thatcher 
who attended monday nights dinner with lawson 
lawson ordered the increase following interest rate increases in 
west germany and five other european countries it was britains 
11th rise since the rate stood at 75 percent in june 1988 
the pound fell heavily on foreign exchange markets following 
weekend reports that mrs thatcher and lawson were at odds over the 
interest rate increases designed to support the currency and hold 
down inflation 
but conservative party chairman kenneth baker insisted in an 
interview monday with the british broadcasting corp that there was 
no split in cabinet ranks 
higher interest rates make the british currency more attractive 
to foreign investors and curb inflation by making credit more 
expensive for consumers but business leaders have warned that high 
rates could send the economy into recession 
the latest interest rate increase has pushed up the cost of 
monthly mortgage payments for homebuyers adding to the growing 
unpopularity of mrs thatchers government 
new opinion polls show the conservatives 7 to 11 points behind 
labor they suggest voters are increasingly disenchanted with 
63yearold mrs thatcher and many are opposed to almost all her 
latest programs 
particularly unpopular the polls show is legislation to sell 
off the water and electricity utilities to private enterprise a 
new property tax and a shakeup of the free national health 
service they are cornerstones of the third fiveyear term mrs 
thatcher won in june 1987 
the economy meanwhile has taken a turn for the worse the 
trade deficit hit a record 361 billion in august and inflation 
has risen to an annual rate of 73 percent 
the conference follows a highly successful opposition labor 
party gathering last week labor adopted a new more centrist 
platform and ditched its policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament 
which cost the party votes in the last election 
the conservatives who have trailed labor for four months in the 
opinion polls are falling further behind in their most consistent 
slump since a 1981 recession 
police marksmen scanned the blackpool seafront from the roof of 
the conference hotel tight security has surrounded conservative 
conferences since the irish republican army blew up mrs thatchers 
hotel in brighton southern england during the 1984 party 
convention killing five people

china has tightened border security in an 
apparent effort to prevent people from fleeing to this british 
colony during a dispute over repatriation of illegal immigrants 
police said today 
china refused for the first time sunday to take back 70 people 
who immigrated illegally to the territory the move came in 
apparent retaliation for hong kongs allowing a chinese swimmer who 
had sought political asylum in the colony to leave for the united 
states 
no illegal immigrants have been returned since a hong kong 
spokesman said discussions to resolve the deadlock have proceeded 
through normal diplomatic channels but refused to elaborate 
the territorys government has routinely sent back all illegal 
immigrants from china since 1980 the sudden refusal by communist 
china to accept them has brought anxiety to capitalist hong kong 
which reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that police 
believe china has stepped up patrols along the border to prevent 
people from escaping after its june military crackdown on the 
studentled prodemocracy movement 
chinas crackdown caused concern among hong kong residents for 
their own freedoms after 1997 
government radio quoted unnamed police sources as saying chinese 
border patrols appeared to have doubled in strength they were also 
more heavily armed than usual police said 
it was not immediately clear what effect the added chinese 
security would have 
hong kong police reported 49 illegal immigrants were caught in 
the 24hour period that ended at 5 am today a total that a 
police spokeswoman described as normal 
meanwhile hong kong governor sir david wilson urged the 
resumption of normal arrangements for repatriation of illegal 
immigrants as soon as possible 
its much better if we can get back to normal handling of 
matters on the border because that is the way to make sure that 
confidence is maintained in hong kong he told reporters 
more than 12000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated to 
china so far this year

the united nations cut its food 
rations to the largest cambodian refugee camp because some of its 
aid had been diverted to guerrillas fighting inside cambodia 
relief sources said today 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the food 
aid to the site 2 camp inside the thai border had been decreased by 
nearly 20 percent following disclosures that refugees were selling 
or otherwise diverting the food to the military 
site 2 houses more than 180000 followers of the khmer peoples 
national liberation front one of three major guerrilla groups 
fighting the vietnambacked government in cambodia 
the front recently launched an offensive against the cambodian 
army from its bases along the thaicambodian border and claimed to 
have scored major successes 
a spokesman of the un border relief operation robert burrows 
said that regular rations to the residents of site 2 had not been 
reduced but the agency has however regretfully decided to 
suspend further delivery of administration workers rations and 
some of the social rations pending clarification of their use he 
said 
administraion rations are given to cambodians at the camp who 
help distribute food to the general population or otherwise help 
with administration of the camp social rations are special food 
supplies given to certain wellidentified groups such as 
singleparent families 
relief officials note that diversion of food medicine and other 
humanitarian aid provided by aid agencies to the refugees has been 
going on since the program began a decade ago 
some said officials have privately been especially critical of 
the aid being supplied the khmer rouge guerrillas who exercise 
rigid control over the civilians under their control 
human rights organizations have cited numerous human rights 
abuses at the khmer rouge camps where monitoring of international 
aid is far more difficult than in camps run by the other two 
factions in the threemember guerrilla coalition 
vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 and says it withdrew the last 
of its troops last month

thousands of protesters who threw rocks and fired slingshots to 
demand freedom for political prisoners on taiwans national day 
officials said five policemen were treated in hospitals for 
injuries and one protester was slightly injured 
as the government held its own parade and rally nearby the 
demonstrators clashed with about 2000 police clad in riot gear and 
backed by water cannons and barbedwire barricades 
the clashes failed to disrupt the parade and rally which were 
held to mark the 1911 uprising that led to the fall of chinas last 
dynasty the qing an estimated 250000 spectators were on hand 
president lee tenghui briefly addressed the rally which was

through human walls formed by police 
riot police with shields and truncheons charged them but the 
protesters quickly regrouped to confront the officers again 
television footage showed a man in a yellow shirt running close to 
the police line and lobbing a large rock into their midst

secretary of state james a baker iii has 
invited the foreign ministers of israel and egypt to washington in 
the next two weeks to seek a formula for israelipalestinian peace 
talks officials said today 
the israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
baker presented a proposal to israeli foreign minister moshe arens 
and egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid they did not 
elaborate on the substance of the proposal 
the us invitation came after israels 12member inner cabinet 
rejected a proposal by the centerleft labor party to accept an 
egyptian call for talks with a palestinian delegation in cairo the 
plan was defeated by the rightwing likud bloc 
the palestinians criticized israel saying it had blocked the 
peace process 
the israeli officials said details of the us plan were 
discussed in a series of telephone calls since last friday and 
followed up with a written proposal relayed by us ambassador 
william brown 
speaking sunday on nbcs meet the press baker indicated the 
united states was actively involved in the middle east peace 
process 
were not involved by getting on an airplane and flying over 
to the middle east but the suggestion that were not involved im 
sorry is simply not accurate baker said 
asked if he was personally involved in deciding who would 
represent the palestinians in peace talks baker said let me 
simply say that we have sent such a message its been sent to 
both capitals he said washington was working with language to 
try and bridge the gap between israelis on the one hand and 
palestinians on the other 
the makeup of a palestinian delegation has been a major problem 
israel objects to the particpation of the plo which it views as a 
terror group 
initial reaction to the baker proposal was positive from both 
labor and the likud headed by prime minister yitzhak shamir but 
likud officials indicated more study was needed before israel could 
accept the us plan or even the call for a threeway meeting 
avi pazner a senior aide to shamir confirmed that a threeway 
meeting in washington was one idea under consideration but he 
declined to give details 
shamir who plans a visit to washington in midnovember said in 
an interview published in the liberal daily haaretz that he 
welcomed us involvement in the peace process but he also 
reflected the fears of his rightwing likud that israel could be 
pushed into an indirect dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization 
bakers proposal calls for a meeting within two weeks by us 
israeli and egyptian officials to discuss the makeup of a 
palestinian delegation and an agenda for the proposed cairo talks 
likud hawks who plan a meeting wednesday opposed bakers plan 
outright saying a meeting with palestinians in cairo was a ruse to 
start negotiations with the plo 
labors minister of energy moshe shahal said in an interview 
that his party would accept the us proposal he also said the 
rejection of the us proposal could lead labor to break up the 
coalition government

a threeeyed alien and a robot landed in the 
russian city of voronezh zapped a boy with a tube and made him 
disappear a soviet daily reported today quoting supposed 
witnesses 
the newspaper following up on an earlier report by the soviet 
news agency tass assured skeptics that something did in fact 
happen 
the purported landing of a ufo in voronezh is the latest bizarre 
tale to appear in the staterun soviet media under the policy of 
glasnost or openness the media recently have told of other 
sightings of unidentified flying objects and space invaders 
tass not known for its sense of humor informed the world 
monday that scientists had confirmed that an alien spaceship 
carrying giant people with tiny heads had touched down in voronezh 
a city of more than 800000 people about 300 miles southeast of 
moscow 
as many as three aliens left the spacecraft described as a 
large shining ball or disc and went for a stroll in the park tass 
reported a tass duty officer later contacted by telephone stood by 
the story 
it is not april fools today he said 
sovietskaya kultura was the only major national daily to print 
anything today about the supposed ufo indicating that more 
prestigious papers such as pravda may have wanted nothing to do 
with such a topic 
sovietskaya kultura said its coverage was motivated by the 
golden rule of journalism the reader must know everything 
of course its hard to believe in what happened in the 
town it said in its report from voronezh its even more 
difficult to explain 
the daily published by the communist partys policymaking 
central committee quoted witnesses as saying the aliens landed on 
a warm evening on sept 27 
at 630 pm it said boys playing soccer saw a pink glow in 
the sky then spotted a deep red ball about 10 yards in diameter 
the ball circled the park disappeared then reappeared a few 
minutes later to hover over the park it said 
the paper said a crowd rushed to the site and people clearly 
saw a hatch open in the lower part of the sphere through the 
opening it said people could see a threeeyed alien about 10 feet 
high clad in silvery overalls and bronzecolored boots and wearing 
a disk on his chest 
sovietskaya kultura quoting witnesses then gave this sequence 
of events 
the ufo landed two creatures one apparently a robot exited 
the hatch a boy started screaming with fear but when the alien 
looked at him with eyes shining the boy fell silent unable to 
move the onlookers screamed and the ufo and the creatures 
disappeared 
about five minutes later they reappeared the alien had what 
appeared to be a gun a tube about 20 inches long it pointed the 
tube at the 16yearold boy and the boy disappeared 
the alien went inside the ball which immediately took off at 
the same time the boy reappeared he was not identified 
sovietskaya kulturas voronezh correspondent e efremov gave 
obvious credence to the witness accounts 
children and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been 
questioned by police workers and journalists he wrote there 
are no discrepencies in the description of the sphere itself or 
the actions of the aliens moreover all the children who became 
witnesses to this event are still afraid even now 
efremov said scientists from the local branch of a nationwide 
group that investigates abnormal phenomena were probing the 
landing 
meanwhile genrikh silanov head of the voronezh geophysical 
laboratory threw doubt on the initial tass report that quoted him 
as saying the aliens left behind two pieces of rock that cannot be 
found on earth 
the rock they described as extraterrestrial is in fact a piece 
of iron ore which could easily have originated on earth 
silanov said in a telephone interview 
he said there indeed was a landing site or something 
resembling one in voronezh but the symmetrical depressions also 
could result from the leak of an underground pipe or cable an 
underground reservoir or another geological feature 
dont believe all you hear from tass the spectroscopist 
advised we never gave them part of what they published 
shortly thereafter the phone connection was cut off

if you think the person ahead of you is going to 
talk on the pay phone forever you may be right and you may be 
the reason 
a study by barry rubak a psychology professor at georgia state 
university suggests that people talk longer on pay phones if 
someone else is waiting its not just your imagination 
humans are just like animals they defend their space in 
public territory we place personal value on space and when we are 
challenged we defend it rubak said in todays atlanta 
journalconstitution 
he said most callers dont stretch out their conversations 
simply to be annoying rather the person waiting may distract the 
caller thereby lengthening the phone call he said 
rubak and his students used questionnaires and observed callers 
at pay phones at three hospitals atlantas hartsfield airport a 
train station in west germany two shopping malls a mass transit 
train station in atlanta and two convenience stores in rural 
western georgia 
the study showed calls in airports tend to be the shortest 
partly because the pressures of departing flights overpower 
territorial tendencies

the americal civil liberties union is 
taking up the ku klux klans fight to join a north carolina litter 
program in which groups adopt a highway to keep clean and get a 
road sign with their name on it 
two weeks ago the department of tranportation denied a kkk 
request to join the adoptahighway program saying a kkk sign 
could prompt more littering 
james shields state aclu director on monday said the state 
apparently agrees with sen joe mccarthy and with the government 
of communist china in claiming that people have to pass some 
political litmus test in order to participate in government 
programs 
if government is able to decide who gets to participate in a 
program based upon government approval of their views government 
is doing a very klanlike thing shields said 
the invisible empire knights of the ku klux klan in rockingham 
county wanted to remove trash from a 34mile stretch of highway in 
reidsville 
a youth group with the national association for the advancement 
of colored people was allowed to adopt a highway 
if people would think about the issue for what it is a civil 
rights issue rather than looking at the name or any mythological 
hearsay about the klan common sense would tell you whats right 
for one should be right for the other said rocky chapman 
exalted cyclops of the kkk chapter 
shields said the aclu will ask the transportation department to 
reconsider then sue if necessary 
in a statement a department spokesman said he was not surprised 
by the klans move

the recent us seizures of almost 36 tons of 
cocaine may be the result of the colombian drug crackdown as 
traffickers move the drug out of an unsafe haven officials say 
but others say the timing of the huge busts may simply be 
coincidental the drugs seized may have come to the united states 
through mexico or may have been in this country before the 
crackdown began aug 18 in colombia they say 
were seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaines 
coming out because its not safe to leave it in colombia 
anymore transportation secretary samuel k skinner told 
reporters at a dock in new orleans where the ship zedom sea was 
taken after six tons of cocaine were seized from it in the gulf of 
mexico 
while drug traffickers used to send out cocaine in smaller lots 
as a security measure theyve now begun moving it out in huge 
shipments skinner said thats because of the pressure from the 
government in colombia he said 
the colombian crackdown begun one day after the assassination 
of a leading presidential candidate who was a critic of the drug 
trade has resulted in sweeping arrests and the seizure of millions 
of dollars of drug traffickers assets one accused moneylaunderer 
has been extradited to the united states 
the traffickers vowed to wage total war against the 
government and have been blamed for 157 bombings that have killed 
11 people and wounded 200 
us officials in the past two weeks seized 20 tons of cocaine 
from a warehouse in los angeles nine tons from a house in texas 
five miles from the mexican border six tons from a ship in the 
gulf of mexico and 1 tons near puerto rico the 20ton seizure 
was the largest ever in the world while the nineton bust is the 
second largest in us history 
these seizures certainly indicate the traffickers are taking 
substantial risks and they are moving vast quantities of their 
drugs out of the country for whatever reasons they have but one of 
them must be their perception that it is not safe down there 
said drug enforcement administration spokesman frank shults 
they are taking substantial risks and we are taking advantage 
of that he said 
several years ago cocaine came into the united states primarily 
on private aircraft the shipments were much smaller and the loss 
of any load cost the traffickers much less 
as we became more effective in targeting that method of 
transit they have changed shults said these are businessmen 
we feel that they are weighing the risks and have decided they 
have got to move these drugs 
but there also are reasons to believe that the huge busts may 
have nothing to do with the situation in colombia for example 
there is no indication how long the 20 tons of cocaine seized in 
los angeles had been in that warehouse 
los angeles district attorney ira reiner said the group arrested 
in connection with that seizure had been operating the warehouse 
for two years 
during that time reiner said authorities estimate 60 tons were 
processed through the warehouse in addition to the 20 tons just 
seized 
in texas department of public safety spokesman mike cox said 
the home in cameron county about five miles above the rio grande 
river hasnt been used very long as far as we can tell but he 
added we think this is the second large load intended to go out 
of the house we missed one load 
although the house was purchased in september the month after 
the colombian crackdown began texas officials dont have any 
hard evidence the huge seizure resulted from colombian drug 
traffickers pushing their wares out of their own country cox said 
since the standard method is to leapfrog it from colombia to 
mexico and from mexico to the united states it could have been 
stockpiled in mexico for a time he said officials still have 
not identified the owner of the house he said 
the cocaine itself obviously came from colombia he said noting 
that some of the dope was wrapped in newspapers from bogota he 
said

the supreme court today agreed to resolve a 
dispute over taped evidence in the federal prosecution of nine men 
accused of robbing 72 million from a wells fargo depot in 
connecticut six years ago 
the justices said they will decide whether all the tape 
recordings made during courtauthorized electronic surveillance of 
the defendants may be used as trial evidence 
a federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not be 
used as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeeping 
quickly enough 
prosecutors say members of an organization in puerto rico known 
as los macheteros or the machete wielders were involved in the 
sept 12 1983 robbery in west hartford conn 
nineteen members of the organization were indicted by a federal 
grand jury in connection with the crime 
evidence linking nine of the men to the connecticut robbery was 
discovered during an investigation of a rocket attack on the fbi 
office in hato rey puerto rico 
during that investigation courtauthorized electronic snooping 
was conducted at six different locations in puerto rico between 
april 1984 and august 1985 
after their indictment the nine men sought to have all tape 
recordings obtained during the surveillance ruled inadmissible as 
trial evidence 
us district judge t emmet clarie in hartford after an 
eightmonth hearing last year suppressed 378 tape recordings made 
at two of the six locations one defendants apartment in 
levittown puerto rico and the home of two other defendants in 
vega baja puerto rico 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the suppression 
order last may 5 ruling that government agents waited too long 
after the taping sessions had ended to have the tapes sealed and 
preserved as evidence under a judges directions 
while we eschew any thought of automatic suppression on the 
basis of time alone we do not believe that any satisfactory 
explanation has been offered for this long delay the appeals 
court said 
it found a 118day delay in one instance and an 82day delay in 
the other 
in the appeal acted on today justice department lawyers argued 
that the tape recordings should not be suppressed because of delays 
in having them sealed if they are proved to be unaltered originals

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the death sentence of arizona murderer jimmie wayne 
jeffers convicted of killing his exgirlfriend in tucson 13 years 
ago 
the justices said they will review a ruling that although 
upholding jeffers murder conviction declared his death sentence 
unconstitutional 
jeffers was convicted of the oct 20 1976 killing of penelope 
cheney in a tucson motel 
prosecutors said jeffers had been told that ms cheney had 
provided police with information about his heroin trafficking 
trial testimony indicated that jeffers injected ms cheney with 
a massive amount of heroin and then choked and beat her while she 
was unconscious because he was worried the overdose would not be 
fatal 
a state judge sentenced jeffers to death after ruling that the 
murder was especially heinous and depraved jeffers conviction 
and sentence was upheld by the arizona supreme court and the 
nations highest court refused to hear his appeal in 1983 
jeffers then sought help from a federal judge and subsequently 
appealed the judges denial to the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals 
by a 21 vote in 1987 the appeals court struck down jeffers 
sentence while unanimously upholding his murder conviction 
the appeals court relied in part on a 1980 supreme court 
decision that limited the use of an outrageously or wantonly 
vile horrible or inhuman aggravating factor in sentencing 
such a factor may be applied only to cases in which victims were 
tortured before death the high court said in 1980 
the 9th circuit court ruled that jeffers death sentence must 
be struck down as arbitrary because we are unable to find a 
principled means of distinguishing the depravity of jeffers 
conduct from that of some convicted arizona murderers who 
received life sentences 
in the appeal acted on today arizona prosecutors contended that 
the appeals court showed too little deference in setting aside a 
state courts finding of the especially heinous and depraved 
aggravating circumstance 
the case is ricketts vs jeffers 89189

a strike by boeings 57800 machinists went into 
a seventh day today with a pledge of economic support from about 25 
other unions 
the machinists asked for help in case the strike at the worlds 
biggest and busiest manufacturer of passenger jets runs long said 
tom baker president of machinists local 751 
no contract talks were scheduled 
none have been held since the machinists including 43300 in 
the seattle area rejected a threeyear contract and walked out 
oct 4 the strike also affects plants in wichita kan portland 
ore and several other sites 
the unions that voted support represent 125000 workers in 
washington state their leaders met monday 
this was a real upbeat meeting baker said people are 
willing to do whatever they can do monetarily theyre going to 
form a hardship fund that type of thing 
the support did not involve refusal to cross picket lines all 
of boeings unions have contracts that prohibit sympathy strikes 
larry kenney president of the washington state labor council 
said the hardship fund would help strikers with mortgage payments 
and other bills he said the other unions also promised to set up a 
temporary employment center 
this is a classic labor dispute because the issues are clearly 
defined kenney said is the company going to use its economic 
leverage or are the employees going to use their economic leverage 
thats what its all supposed to be about 
boeing officials said they did not know how to interpret the 
show of union support 
i still dont think anybody at this point knows how long a 
strike it will be said spokesman paul binder 
a company that advertised for aircraft maintenance workers was 
deluged by hundreds of jobseekers including boeing strikers 
intertec aviation co of phoenix said its recruiters visit to 
everett on sunday was planned before the strike 
boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began and 
hopes to deliver 92 more by the end of the year 
five consecutive years of record orders have given the company a 
backlog that stretches into the late 1990s that backlog was behind 
machinists demand for better wages and lower mandatory overtime 
boeing offered a raise 4 percent followed by 3 percent raises 
in 1990 and 1991 and annual bonuses of 8 percent of gross earnings 
this year and 3 percent in 1990 
mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours per 
quarter to 160 hours and the costofliving formula improved 
boeing earned 356 million on sales of 907 billion for the 
first half of 1989 and had profits of 614 million on sales of 
1696 billion in 1988

the supreme court today overturned a fine 
against a pennsylvania newspaper for publishing conversations of a 
bookmaker whose telephone was tapped by police 
the justices ordered a state court to reconsider a 1000 fine 
and 17409 in lawyers fees imposed against the easton express 
the newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcripts 
accidentally placed in public court records 
the high court said the case should be restudied in light of the 
justices ruling last june that spared a florida newspaper from 
having to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published 
an express article on april 7 1982 related a conversation 
between bookmaker alfred boettger of forks township pa and a 
bettor on college football games who owed him money the bettor 
permitted state police to tap his phone in return for protection 
the wiretap transcripts were placed in a court clerks file and 
a reporter for the newspaper was permitted to see them and take 
notes on the conversations 
boettger who pleaded no defense to bookmaking charges and was 
fined sued the newspaper he said it violated his privacy and a 
1978 pennsylvania law designed to protect people from unauthorized 
disclosure of information obtained through wiretaps 
boettger withdrew his privacy claim but was awarded the 1000 
plus legal fees by a state jury that decided the express had 
violated the 1978 law 
the pennsylvania supreme court upheld the jury award last march 
it said the 1978 law permits police not news organizations or the 
general public to reveal wiretap information 
there is no justification to allow the media a unique 
prerogative to trespass where the general populace is barred the 
state court said 
it said the privacy interests the 1978 law are intended to 
safeguard outweigh freepress rights 
only when the protected information is disseminated either 
through an order of court unsealing it or through its use as 
evidence in an open court proceeding does the medias interest rise 
above those of the state and its citizens the state court said 
the express with support from leading news organizations said 
the state court ruling conflicts with the justices ruling last 
june 
in that ruling the high court threw out a 97500 award won by 
a rape victim whose name was published by the florida star a 
weekly newspaper in jacksonville the victims name was obtained 
from a report posted by mistake in a sheriffs department press 
room 
the justices said then we do not hold that truthful 
publication is automatically constitutionally protected we hold 
only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it 
has lawfully obtained punishment may lawfully be imposed if at 
all only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest 
order 
among those supporting the easton express appeal were the 
american newspaper publishers association the american society of 
newspaper editors the national association of broadcasters and the 
reporters committee for freedom of the press 
they argued that if the news media can be punished for 
disclosing accessible trustworthy and newsworthy government 
records and court files speech would be chilled to the point of 
being frozen solid 
the case is easton publishing co vs boettger 89265

the supreme court today refused to order a 
program for the handicapped in missouri to take back a 33yearold 
mentally retarded man who is a carrier of hepatitis 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that dennis 
kohls ouster from the program did not amount to illegal 
discrimination against the handicapped 
aside from his retardation kohl is blind and an active carrier 
of the hepatitis b virus according to court records he frequently 
exhibits maladaptive behavior such as biting and scratching 
hepatitis b is one cause of hepatitis an infection that 
primarily affects the liver although the transmission of hepatitis 
b is not fully understood most medical experts agree it is 
transmitted through body fluids 
kohl lived at the woodhaven learning center in columbia mo 
for three months in 1984 until he was discharged the center is 
run in conjunction with the woodhaven school which provides 
educational and vocational programs for handicapped people 
kohl was dismissed from the missouri programs because he is a 
carrier of a contagious disease 
both the learning center and school receive federal funding 
making them subject to a 1973 federal law protecting handicapped 
people from bias 
but the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled that kohls 
dismissal was not a violation of the 1973 law 
the costs of inoculating all staff members and patients at the 
facilities to protect them against catching hepatitis from kohl are 
too high to be reasonable the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for kohl and his parents 
argued that the appeals courts ruling conflicts with a 1987 
supreme court decision that people with contagious diseases are 
protected by the 1973 law 
the justices two years ago said recipients of federal aid may 
not discriminate against people with contagious diseases if those 
people are otherwise qualified to work or take part in some 
program or activity 
the 1987 decision said a person who poses a significant risk 
of communicating an infectious disease to others will not be 
otherwise qualified if reasonable accommodations will not 
eliminate that risk 
kohls appeal said the 8th circuit court ignored medical 
judgments about what represents reasonable accommodations in 
his case 
in the face of a national aids epidemic and the hysteria it 
has engendered the 8th circuits misinterpretation of the 1987 
high court ruling erodes the substantive protections provided by 
the 1973 law to both contagious individuals and the public 
itself the appeal said 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly viral 
disease that can kill its victims by destroying their immune system 
and leaving them vulnerable to other diseases 
the case is kohl vs woodhaven learning center 89240

lebanese lawmakers were reported to be 
moving closer to a peace agreement but fighting broke out today in 
their divided nation a sign that any accord reached here would 
have to be accepted by the warlords battling for supremacy 
in beirut sniper fire exchanges along the citys dividing green 
line claimed the first combat fatality since an arab 
legauebrokered truce halted six months of bloodshed on sept 22 
police said 1st lt abdulrahman aslan a shiite moslem was 
killed and three soldiers were wounded in a clash between maj gen 
sami khatibs moslem troops and christian army units in the chiyah 
district 
the casualties brought the overall toll to 930 killed and 2744 
wounded since march 8 when fighting broke out between the 
christians and an alliance of syrian troops and their moslem allies 
conference sources in taif speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that hardline christian lawmakers were backing away somewhat 
on their demand that syrian forces withdraw before christians agree 
to political reforms in lebanon 
they said the lawmakers conceded that an immediate syrian 
withdrawal would allow moslem militias to take control of moslem 
regions now controlled by the syrians 
the sources also said that a committee working on a draft 
proposal for political reforms has completed its recommendations on 
the future powers of the president traditionally a maronite 
catholic 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem formed the 
committee of seven christians and seven moslems on monday to speed 
up work toward a settlement by today the committee had been 
enlarged to 18 members 
under the proposed reforms the president would continue to have 
the right to summon cabinet sessions he also will be able to 
decree special amnesties but not general ones as before 
parliament bills will automatically become law if not ratified 
by the president within 15 days previously no law could take 
effect unless endorsed by the president 
moslems have been demanding that presidential powers be 
curtailed as part of a political reforms agreement that would give 
them an equal share of power with the christians 
christians then considered the majority have dominated the 
government parliament and judiciary since independence from france 
in 1943 but moslems now are believed to make up a majority of the 
population 
a threeman arab league committee had presented the 63 
parliamentarians gathered in taif with a draft peace plan the 
legislators have been studying the proposal since sept 30 and 
making their own recommendations 
the main obstacle that has threatened to undermine the peace 
conference was syrias 40000 troops in lebanon 
the arab committee has proposed a phased syrian withdrawal from 
the beirut area to be completed in two years with total pullout 
depending on israel ending its occupation of south lebanon and the 
conclusion of a syrianlebanese security pact 
the christian legislators consent that an uncalculated syrian 
withdrawal would spur more turmoil has raised speculation that a 
compromise was in the works possibly based on narrowing the 
twoyear period for a withdrawal from beirut that was envisaged by 
the arab committee

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether a texas man who murdered a deputy sheriff 10 years ago may 
raise the issue of his mental retardation in a new attack on his 
death sentence 
the courts decision expected sometime in 1990 could clarify 
the scope and retroactive effects of its decision last june 26 
that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers but only 
if jurors were allowed to take a defendants mental condition into 
consideration 
the justices agreed to hear the appeal of john henry selvage 
and fashioned the sole question selvages lawyers and texas 
prosecutors are to debate in the coming months 
the question is whether there was a legitimate cause for selvage 
not raising the issue of his mental retardation at some earlier 
stage 
the justices also asked the lawyers to consider whether if no 
legitimate cause existed whether barring selvage from making the 
claim now would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice 
selvage was convicted of killing albert garza a harris county 
sheriffs deputy during the july 30 1979 robbery of a houston 
jewelry store 
the case is selvage vs lynaugh 876700

soichiro honda the 82yearold founder of 
honda motor co tonightst japanese inducted into 
the automotive hall o becomes the firf fame 
in less than 30 years mr honda built an auto company that 
has stood toetotoe with all other manufacturers and has competed 
successfully said robert mallon chairman of the hall 
he changed the way americans viewed imported cars and altered 
forever the role of the import in our domestic market 
selections to the hall of fame a nonprofit organization 
founded in 1939 are made by its board of directors made up mostly 
of auto executives the bonds keating has said were a normal method 
of corporate 
finance and were portrayed to potential investors as uninsured 
instruments 
keating bought lincoln in 1984 through risky direct investment 
in real estate and investment in other corporate junk bonds he 
turned a sleepy savings bank with 1 billion in assets into an 
aggressive thrift whose assets had grown to 54 billion by 1988 
the bond sales began about the same time keatings troubles with 
regulators began 1987 a time when lincoln apparently desperately 
needed capital to stay afloat 
the federal home loan bank of san francisco examined lincoln and 
found it was in danger of failing keating took his case to 
washington he persuaded sens alan cranston dcalif dennis 
deconcini dariz john mccain rariz don riegle dmich and 
john glenn dohio all of whom had received large campaign 
contributions raised by keating to meet with regulators and press 
keatings case 
in a twohour april 1987 meeting the senators defended keating 
as a major employer who ran profitable operations 
deconcini asked that regulators grant forbearance on new 
directinvestment regulations and glenn said you should charge 
them or get off their backs according to notes taken by william 
black a regulator with the san francisco bank who attended the 
meeting 
in an unprecedented move the federal home loan bank board 
ordered supervision of lincoln transferred from san francisco to 
washington and a new examination conducted keating celebrated 
with a champagne party at his phoenix headquarters 
many investors could have been spared ruin had regulators 
actions not been delayed two years by political influence said don 
mikami a fountain valley calif dentist who invested 25000 
the bonds never would have been sold to california 
investors mikami said it was a mad scramble those last two 
years to get money in the coffers of american continental 
four of the five senators now say they regret the appearance of 
political influence created by the meeting but insist there was 
nothing wrong with trying to help a constituent 
if i knew then what i know now i would not have done any of 
what i did said deconcini who returned keatingrelated campaign 
contributions after the justice department filed its racketeering 
suit 
the question is was i abused the answer is yes 
mccain said he is now embarrassed that he attended the 
meeting riegle returned campaign contributions glenn said that 
upon learning regulators had made referrals to the justice 
department he bowed out of further keating discussions 
cranston who solicited keating for a 400000 contribution for 
his nonpartisan voter education project after the meeting with 
regulators has no regrets about trying to help a california 
institution with thousands of employees and depositors who was 
having a rough time with red tape and delays by the federal 
bureaucracy spokesman murray flander said 
added cranstons chief of staff roy greenaway the things we 
know now about the sale of the bonds and the confusion created 
that whole issue is something we never knew about then 
cranston has asked the general accounting office to examine 
whether federal or state regulators were responsible in any way for 
the bondholders plight and if so whether the government could 
compensate them out of federal savings and loan insurance funds 
bondholders say that may be their only hope 
the regulators allowed this to go on said attorneyinvestor 
rosenberg 
even the chance of recovering some money after protracted 
litigation bankruptcy proceedings or washington policymaking is 
of little comfort to the elderly victims bondholders say 
these people need their money now said ms kane the 
leisure world resident who organized with other bondholders to try 
to get their money back they need to go into nursing or 
boardandcare homes now they have medical bills now they dont 
have time to wait

pope john paul ii visited the 
heartland of indonesian culture today celebrating mass in tropical 
heat in a region that blends buddhist hindu and moslem traditions 
in a meeting with religious leaders the pope cautioned against 
any violation of religious freedom in this overwhelmingly moslem 
nation there have been signs of pressure on the roman catholic 
church by islamic extremists 
religious freedom is enshrined in indonesias constitution and 
it is up to the state to ensure that religious freedom is indeed 
a fundamental human right one which should be enjoyed by all 
religious communities as well as individuals the pope told the 
religious leaders 
vatican officials said the pope was reflecting the concerns of 
indonesias bishops over two proposed laws viewed by the minority 
church as unconstitutional 
one would require islamic instruction in all public and private 
schools including catholic ones the other would give legal 
recognition to several hundred islamic courts 
the church considers indonesia a generally tolerant country 
despite the small numbers of catholics only 5 million compared 
with 157 million moslems 
for the mass today about 150000 people many wearing yellow 
and white baseball caps the vatican colors jammed the 
indonesian air force academy grounds 
barefoot javanese women in sarongs strewed rose petals in the 
popes path as he walked along a red carpet after changing for the 
mass 
the pope speaking from an alter flanked by a vintage world war 
ii fighter plane emphasized the importance of local tradition in 
the roman catholic church 
remember you build up the universal church when you bring to 
it the unique riches of the indonesian culture the pope said 
speaking in english 
he made a onehour flight from jakarta the capital to the 
southern edge of java on the second day of his pilgrimage to the 
worlds most populous moslem country 
the vatican estimated that catholics make up only about 2 
percent of the more than 17 million people in the diocese of 
jogjakarta but the crowds were large and enthusiastic 
tens of thousands arrived before dawn hours before the mass 
walking on dirt roads covered by dense tropical vegetation 
a javanese orchestra called a gamelan accompanied the choir with 
drums cymbals and gongs 
jogjakarta is surrounded by temples set in rice paddy fields 
the borobudur temple is considered one of the worlds greatest 
buddhist monuments in 1983 it was damaged by moslem extremists 
also nearby is a temple complex dedicated to shiva the hindu 
goddess a sign of the ancient indian tradition

the supreme court today agreed to use the case 
of a convicted california robber to dispel some uncertainty over 
when items seized in a police search may be used against criminal 
suspects 
the court said it will hear an appeal by terry brice horton 
sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery illegal 
firearms possession and other charges 
horton was convicted in a holdup on jan 13 1985 of erwin paul 
wallaker the treasurer of a san jose coin club 
wallaker was returning home from a coin show with two briefcases 
containing 10000 in cash and 20000 in coins 
he was accosted by two people wearing halloween masks who 
stunned him with an electrical device and also stole jewelry from 
him 
wallaker told police he recognized hortons voice a distinct 
southern drawl 
the police searched hortons home and found an uzi a revolver 
two stun guns and keys for handcuffs none of those items was 
listed in the court warrant that authorized the search 
the warrant did describe the items stolen from wallaker but 
they were not found by police 
horton argued that the seized items should not be used as 
evidence against him even though they were in plain view 
he said the items were not discovered inadvertently by police 
the police expected to find weapons in his home and came there 
looking for them he said 
also he argued the police could not show a sufficient 
connection with the items and holdup 
horton relied heavily on a 1971 supreme court case which allowed 
police to use evidence found in plain view only if discovered 
inadvertently 
but a california appeals court permitted the items police found 
in hortons home to be used against him 
the state court said the 1971 high court ruling on evidence 
found in plain view was endorsed by only four justices not five 
of the nine and therefore does not establish a national precedent 
also the state court said of the police conduct in searching 
hortons home there is no indication that they used the warrant 
as a pretext to conduct a general exploratory search of hortons 
residence 
the case is horton vs california 887164

authorities have released a un relief 
plane its crew and its passengers nearly three weeks after they 
were detained following an emergency landing in northeastern 
uganda officials said today 
army commander salim saleh said the twinengine c119 fairchild 
its two american pilots two british passengers and three kenyan 
crewmen were released friday 
tarcis kabwegyere minister of state for foreign affairs said 
the foreigners and the aircraft were expected to leave for nairobi 
on wednesday un officials who have not released the names of 
those aboard the plane were not immediately available for comment 
the plane made an emergency landing sept 22 in kaabong in 
northeastern uganda after running out of fuel in bad weather it 
was trying to return to lokichoggio kenya after delivering 
emergency food and other supplies to southern sudan as part of a 
un relief operation 
kaabong is about 50 miles south of lokichoggio which has served 
as a staging point for the uncoordinated relief effort 
the united nations has been airlifting food and supplies from 
kenya to southern sudan since april in an effort to stave off 
massive famine deaths 
saleh said the ugandans detained those on board the plane 
pending finalization of investigations in which they confirmed 
the plane did indeed make the unauthorized landing due to an 
emergency 
government officials said earlier they held the plane to 
determine whether its crew and passengers had any ill 
intentions 
last year a kenyanregistered plane delivered military 
equipment and supplies to rebels fighting the government of 
president yower museveni the goods were seized by the military

nasa today reported an engine 
problem that could ground space shuttle atlantis beyond thursdays 
launch date even if antinuclear activists lose their court 
challenge to stop the flight 
us district judge oliver gasch began hearing arguments today 
in washington from attorneys representing nasa and three citizens 
groups seeking to halt liftoff because atlantis will be carrying a 
plutoniumpowered space probe 
shuttle test director mike leinbach said overnight checks found 
that a controller on one of the three main engines was giving a 
faulty fuel pressure reading the device controls the engine during 
the liftoff burn 
experts were analyzing the situation to see if the controller 
had to be replaced a task that could take five or six days 
a decision was not expected until late in the day today or 
wednesday 
sources said that after the first low pressure reading four 
more tests were conducted and the problem did not repeat itself 
leinbach said other countdown tasks were proceeding normally 
despite four inches of rain overnight the main job today was 
loading fuel aboard the shuttles powerproducing fuel cells 
the countdown ticked toward a liftoff at 129 pm thursday with 
the galileo spacecraft on board 
opponents sought a temporary restraining order because galileo 
which atlantis five astronauts are to dispatch toward jupiter 
carries two generators fueled by 494 pounds of plutonium 
they contend an explosion like that which destroyed the shuttle 
challenger in 1986 could scatter plutonium over heavily populated 
eastcentral florida 
nasa responds that in tests empty plutonium containers have been 
blown up shot at and burned to determine how they would survive 
all kinds of accidents they have withstood pressures far greater 
than those produced in the challenger accident the agency reports 
similar devices have been carried on 22 other us spacecraft 
without a problem 
were going to count down to a launch on thursday unless we 
are told to stop nasa test director ron phelps said monday as 
the countdown started 
about 25 people held a brief demonstration at the space center 
monday staging a mock countdown and then collapsing in mock death 
when a woman sprinkled powder representing plutonium 
they said that if they lost in court they would attempt to stop 
the liftoff by infiltrating the launch area in a nonviolent 
occupation 
were going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the 
court doesnt prevent the launch said bruce gagnon coordinator 
of the florida coalition for peace and justice one of the three 
groups that filed suit 
reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough 
more than 200 security guards armed with m16 assault rifles and 
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140000acre space center 
to stop any infiltrators and the center also will be guarded by 
helicopters and boats 
only a 10minute launch window exists on thursday and nasa 
officials are concerned that time could easily be lost dealing with 
protesters who might penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat 
plane or on foot 
the five astronauts assigned to the mission flew to the kennedy 
space center monday from their training base in houston for final 
launch preparations they were to be briefed today on the flight 
plan and progress of the countdown 
the commander is donald williams the other crew members are 
pilot mike mcculley and mission specialists ellen baker franklin

protected by thousands of soldiers and police 
the presidents of peru colombia and bolivia met today in this 
small desert town to discuss a common strategy for dealing with the 
regions cocaine lords 
the meeting was expected to include criticism of president 
bushs emphasis on militarystyle repression of the cocaine trade 
both peru and bolivia have called for increased economic aid 
from the united states to provide alternate sources of income for 
the hundreds of thousands of peasants who grow coca the raw 
material for cocaine 
todays gathering took place under heavy security to defend 
against feared attacks by the fanatical shining path guerrilla 
group which works in alliance with cocaine traffickers in perus 
cocagrowing highland jungles 
perus president alan garcia received presidents virgilio barco 
and jaime paz zamora this morning at an air force base in pisco 45 
miles northwest of here then flew with them by helicopter to ica 
where they were to meet for two hours and issue a joint communique 
there was no word late this morning on details of the closed 
meeting 
meanwhile a bomb exploded in a nearby city where ministers of 
eight latin american nations are planning another highlevel 
meeting in ica that is to follow todays gathering 
the bomb exploded before dawn today in the northern city of 
trujillo 350 miles north of lima where ministers of five latin 
american nations were preparing the agenda for a meeting of eight 
latin american presidents 
no group claimed responsibility for the attack which caused 
minor damage to a government building half a mile from the hotel 
where the ministers were meeting 
ica a remote town of 350000 people 185 miles southeast of 
lima has limited road access and was chosen for the meetings 
because it affords better security than the capital government 
officials said 
an army battalion was guarding the towns two entrances while 
about 3000 police officers were in charge of security at the plush 
las dunas hotel where the meetings are being held 
security was stepped up after shining path guerrillas launched 
attacks in ica and the surrounding area in the days preceding the 
summit 
presidents carlos salinas de gortari of mexico carlos andres 
perez of venezuela julio sanguinetti of uruguay jose sarney of 
brazil and carlos menem of argentina will join garcia and barco in 
discussions of drug trafficking the failed coup in panama latin 
americas foreign debt and ecological damage to the amazon 
but most attention has focused on todays drug summit which 
was expected to produce a demand for greater us economic aid to 
colombia peru and bolivia 
peruvian officials have been sharply critical of bushs emphasis 
on repression to halt cocaine trafficking rather than economic 
development that would encourage peasants to shift to crops other 
than coca 
peru and bolivia produce more than 90 percent of the worlds 
coca colombian drug cartels turn semirefined coca paste from peru 
and boliva into pure cocaine and smuggle it into the united states 
and europe 
hundreds of thousands of peasants make their livelihood from 
growing coca in peru and bolivia and officials in both countries 
say coca cannot be eradicated without providing the growers with an 
alternative source of income 
bush recently announced 261 million in aid to colombia peru 
and bolivia to fight the cocaine trade but most of it is in 
military aid 
its not a problem of donating some helicopters sometimes 
very old helicopters or donating rifles or bullets its an 
economic problem garcia said recently it would be enough to 
offer a good price and a guaranteed market for the products that 
could substitute for coca

the supreme court today agreed to resolve a 
conflict over federal laws authorizing extra prison time for some 
criminals 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by arthur lajuane 
taylor who said he improperly was sentenced to 15 years in prison 
after pleading guilty in federal court in missouri to illegal 
firearm possession 
the judge increased taylors sentence because of his previous 
felony convictions 
taylor argued that the judge improperly based the enhanced 
sentence on his prior convictions for the nonviolent crime of 
second degree burglary 
taylor said under missouri law burglary in the second degree 
includes breaking into an empty building where there is no 
potential for violence 
but the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled in january that 
breaking into an empty building has potential for violent harm to 
innocent people the building owner may return or a neighbor may 
investigate the appeals court said in upholding taylors sentence 
taylor had two previous convictions for second degree burglary 
in missouri and one robbery conviction 
at issue is the interpretation of laws congress passed in 1986 
against drug abuse and career criminals the laws permit those 
convicted of three previous felonies to be given longer sentences 
because of their past crimes 
but congress deleted a definition of burglary creating 
confusion over its use as a basis for enhanced prison terms 
the justice department said congress despite the omission 
intended to retain a broad definition of burglary 
but horton argued that since there is no specific definition of 
burglary in the federal laws congress meant the common law 
definition to apply under that theory he said the courts should 
accept the definition used in the state where the alleged crime 
occurs 
also horton said the 8th circuit courts interpretation will 
mean longer sentences for many inmates threatening more 
overcrowding in the nations prisons 
horton said other federal appeals courts disagree with the 8th 
circuit courts interpretation 
the case is taylor vs us 887194

more than 19 months largely over territorial rights to the 
azerbaijani enclave of nagornokarabakh

mainly by ethnic armenians 
almost all the supplies that come to armenia from other parts of 
the soviet union have to go through azerbaijan first

economic blockade that has been strangling armenia for nearly three 
months and nagornokarabakh for even longer about 400 trains with 
60000 cars have been reported idled on the tracks in the region 
in the past 24 hours authorities did manage to push 1748 rail

remains strapped for fuel tass said quoting a speech by deputy 
premier lev voronin to the supreme soviet legislature 
voronin said transport in armenia and azerbaijan is still 
difficult due to blownup bridges and continuing strafing of 
trains 
much of the cargo that does arrive in armenia on its main rail 
artery through azerbaijan has been damaged beyond repair pravda 
reported today 
factorybuilt temporary houses for victims of last years 
armenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal broken glass 
and crushed window frames it said 
prefurnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction project 
arrived with ovens sinks pipes and beds ruined and they simply 
cannot be restored pravda said

supplies in nagornokarabakh the regions of martuninski and 
gadrutski have been cut off since a bridge was blown up saturday

six journalists have been killed and 10 
kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas in colombia 
over the past six months a colombian publisher told a meeting of 
the interamerican press association 
the colombian press continues to be trapped in crossfires 
between the government and guerrillas and drug lords which it is 
battling said enrique santos of the bogota newspaper el tiempo 
this occurs in a country where there exists a policy of free 
press and a goverment that is respectful of criticism but not of 
real guarantees for their full exercise santos said monday in an 
address to the associations annual meeting 
about 450 editors and publishers from the united states canada 
latin america and the caribbean are attending the iapas 45th 
general assembly in this northern industrial city 
eduardo ulibarri vice president of the associations press 
freedom and information committee singled out colombia and panama 
as the two most critical cases this year 
jorge hernandez of the daily newspaper el colombiano of 
medellin colombia home of the medellin cocaine cartel said at a 
seminar that he and his colleagues are afraid were scared to 
death 
reporters for el colombiano have been killed and bombs have been 
found in the newspapers offices 
after the colombian government declared war on the countrys 
cocaine barons in august drug gangs declared total war on the 
journalists who had helped expose them 
santos said that as a result the colombian press omits the 
names of judges and magistrates that handle narcotics cases and the 
names of government officials on the front lines of this 
struggle 
to protect journalists newspaper stories about drug traffickers 
do not carry reporters bylines and reports about terrorist 
activities have been played down to avoid playing the terrorists 
game santos said 
the permanent climate of terrorism psychological and real 
has obliged the press to take exceptional measures to protect 
itself he said 
santos said 10 journalists were kidnapped for several days in 
may and june by marxist guerrillas of the national liberation army 
to pressure them into publishing messages from the organization 
luis gabriel cano editor for the daily bogota newspaper el 
espectador that was bombed last month by drug traffickers urged 
the iapa to find a way to combat this tremendous flogging 
we must all look for a solution so we dont have a press 
dominated by the narcoticstrafficking mafia he said 
cano whose brother was killed in 1986 by drug traffickers told 
the group that colombian journalists receive death threats against 
themselves and their families and require bodyguards 
he said newspaper advertisers also have been threatened by the 
drug lords 
reporting on nicaragua cristiana chamorro of la prensa of 
managua said that despite official promises of press freedom 
reprisals by that countrys leftist sandinista government are 
common against the news media 
la prensa nicaraguas only opposition newspaper is owned by 
her mother violeta chamorro the opposition coalitions 
presidential candidate for february 1990 elections 
cristiana chamorro said president daniel ortegas promise two 
years ago to permit the creation of an independent television 
station remains unfulfilled a nicaraguanborn reporter was 
expelled from the country and radio stations are censored or forced 
to broadcast government news 
the situation has improved for journalists working in paraguay 
and chile publishers from these two south american countries 
reported 
several newspapers that were closed at the beginning of the 
current military government of gen augusto pinochet are now in 
circulation emilio filippi of the santiago newspaper la epoca 
said 
but he said manuel cabieses editor of the ultraleftist 
magazine punto final has been charged with presumed offenses 
against the president cabieses has been charged in court but 
has not been arrested 
the magazine banned since late president salvador allendes

east german leader erich honocker today compared 
the prodemocracy uprising in china with the unrest in east germany 
and criticized what he said was a campaign to defame the communist 
countries 
municipal officials took a softer line in the east german city 
of leipzig however allowing 70000 protesters to rally for reform 
in the city center 
the official tolerance of mondays peaceful march for an end to 
authoritarian rule contrasted sharply with the violence police used 
to break up similar demonstrations over the weekend in six east 
german cities 
despite the new tolerance in leipzig honecker gave no 
indication that he is about to change his governments course 
in a meeting with chinese vice premier yao yilin he said 
any attempt of imperialism to destabilize the socialist 
construction or to slander its successes and achievements is now 
and will be in the future nothing other than fruitless charging of 
don quixote against the evermoving blades of a windmill the 
official news agency adn quoted him as saying 
adn said honecker and yao recalled the events of last june in 
beijing when troops crushed the chinese prodemocracy movement 
in this respect there is a fundamental lesson to be learned 
from the counterrevolutionary revolt in beijing and the present 
defamation campaign against the gdr east germany and other 
socialist states adn said 
that statement appeared to signal honeckers willingness to 
crush dissent if necessary 
also today manfred stolpe deputy director of the lutheran 
church federation said there were working groups of government 
and church officials who were discussing the current unrest in east 
germany 
but he denied a west german radio report that said highlevel 
talks had been held between church leaders and government officials 
meanwhile hans otto furian a lutheran church provost in east 
berlin said in an interview that positive developments in our 
nation can only come about if a new orientation breaks through 
the communist party must give up its grip on total power he 
said it cant happen with anything less 
over the weekend hundreds of people were arrested in east 
berlin leipzig dresden and other cities by clubswinging police 
west german television said many already were sentenced to jail 
terms of up to six months 
leipzig an industrial city of 500000 has been the scene of 
several clashes in recent weeks as police moved to crush 
demonstrations stirred in part by an exodus of disillusioned 
citizens to the west 
after two nights of clashes in east berlin many feared police 
would also use violence to break up mondays peace march in leipzig 
but beforehand officials of the leipzig communist party 
promised to push for a talks between citizens and the government 
we all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue 
socialism in our nation the officials said in a statement 
the message was read over leipzig state radio during services at 
four city churches and over loudspeakers during the demonstration 
witnesses said 
police and paramilitary troops watched the leipzig march but 
did not intervene christoph wonneberger pastor for the lukas 
lutheran church in leipzig said he was surprised by the restraint 
he told west germanys zdf television network that some 
demonstrators even began conversations with paramilitary troops 
when the crowd was dispersing 
west german radio also reported peaceful demonstrations monday 
in dresden plauen and halle 
there is no indication however that the government intends to 
soften its tough stand against the reforms sweeping such east bloc 
allies as hungary poland and the soviet union 
but mondays demonstrations were far different from the weekend 
marches across the country of 166 million people when police 
marched into crowds of demonstrators and hit chased and arrested 
hundreds 
protesters paraded through leipzig on monday shouting we need 
freedom democracy and no violence witnesses said on 
condition of anonymity 
the march was the largest single protest in east germany since a 
1953 workers uprising was put down by soviet tanks 
earlier monday chancellor helmut kohl of west germany denounced 
the east german government as rigidly authoritarian and said 
relations with east berlin cannot prosper under present 
conditions 
also 18 lutheran leaders issued an appeal in east berlin 
calling on the government to implement democratic reforms and 
urging all sides to refrain from violence 
at least 50000 east germans have fled west in recent months 
either over hungarys newlyopen border to austria or after seeking 
refuge in bonns embassies in prague czechoslovakia and warsaw 
poland 
the exodus deeply embarrassed the government on its twoday 40th 
anniversary festivities which were attended by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev hinted that he favors for east germany the types of 
reforms he is overseeing in the soviet union

the soviet union is still providing vast 
amounts of weapons and other support to the afghanistan 
government and the white house said tuesday that it seems likely 
soviet advisers are still involved in the fighting 
moscow has said its last troops were withdrawn from afghanistan 
in february 
the new york times reported in tuesday editions that a 
confidential bush administration intelligence report said soviet 
advisers wearing afghan uniforms were launching scud missiles at 
rebels 
it seems a likely conclusion but i cannot be more specific 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said about soviet 
involvement 
our position is still the same that the soviets are supplying 
vast amounts of weapons and money and support to the afghanistan 
government and we similarly are staying involved on that basis but 
i cant get into people and so forth 
asked if the united states believed the soviets have withdrawn 
fitzwater said we feel theyve withdrawn from afghanistan yes 
but soviet aid is still going back in 
the times said american intelligence agencies prepared the 
report for the state department and the white house 
since the soviet pullout moscow has continued massive shipments 
of arms food and fuel to buttress the government of president 
najibullah the united states in turn has kept up military 
shipments to guerillas trying to oust najibullah 
us intelligence officials had predicted an quick victory for 
the rebels once the soviet troops left but the guerillas have 
gained little ground and have been beset with infighting 
the united states furnished an estimated 600 million in 
military aid to the afghan rebels last year and more than 23 
billion over the past nine years

pope john paul ii said tuesday that 
religious freedom must be preserved in this overwhelmingly moslem 
nation where there have been signs of pressure on the small roman 
catholic minority 
religious freedom is enshrined in indonesias constitution and 
the state should make sure it is is indeed a fundamental human 
right one which should be enjoyed by all religious communities as 
well as individuals the pope told a group of islamic and other 
religious leaders 
vatican spokesmen said john paul was reflecting concerns of 
indonesias catholic bishops about two proposed laws the church 
considers unconstitutional 
one would require islamic instruction in all public and private 
schools including catholic institutions and the other would give 
legal recognition to hundreds of islamic courts 
the church considers indonesia generally tolerant but views the 
proposed laws as signs of growing pressure by islamic 
fundamentalists on roman catholics who number only 5 million in a 
nation of 157 million moslems 
foreign missionaries told reporters tuesday in jogjakarta a 
city in central java where the pontiff pope celebrated mass that 
fundamentalists threatened harm to local residents who provided 
housing to catholic pilgrims 
nonetheless an enthusiastic crowd of more than 150000 
assembled in sweltering tropical heat for the mass on the grounds 
of the indonesian air force academy 
barefoot young women in sarongs strewed rose petals in john 
pauls path as he walked on a red carpet he spoke from an altar 
flanked by world war ii fighter planes 
jogjakarta considered javas cultural heartland is surrounded 
by temples set in rice paddies the borobudur temple considered 
one of the worlds great buddhist monuments was damaged by moslem 
extremists in 1983 
a temple complex dedicated to shiva the hindu goddess also is 
nearby 
the official news agency antara reported from flores on the 
popes schedule for wednesday that a woman dropped dead in front 
of a statue of the virgin mary in gelora samador stadium where he 
is to say mass 
she was described as a descendant of a local king no cause of

the supreme court today allowed the use of an 
antiracketeering law against 26 abortion opponents for incidents 
at a philadelphia clinic 
the justices over one dissenting vote rejected arguments that 
use of the racketeering law violated the protesters freespeech 
rights 
the protesters were sued successfully by operators of the 
abortion clinic 
similar lawsuits each invoking the federal racketeering 
influenced and corrupt organizations act rico have been filed 
against antiabortion activists in cities such as pittsburgh 
chicago and brookline mass 
antonio califa an american civil liberties union lawyer in 
washington recently wrote the aclu believes that civil ricos 
potential for chilling first amendment rights of expression is 
enormous 
the concern centers on the possibility political protesters will 
be labeled racketeers and held financially liable for doing 
nothing more than expressing their views 
but in upholding a 108000 award against the 26 philadelphia 
protesters last march the 3rd us circuit court of appeals said 
their actions went beyond constitutional rights of speech and 
protest 
the protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfully 
entered the northeast womens center in philadelphia according to 
trial testimony protesters threw medical supplies on the floor 
damaged equipment assaulted the clinics employees and harassed 
patients 
an assistant district attorney who witnessed a demonstration 
testified that the demonstrators activity rose to a frenzy and 
that he delayed leaving the center out of fear for his phsyical 
safety the appeals court noted 
it added civil rico could appropriately be applied to 
defendants intimidation and harassment of the center resulting in 
the destruction of its property 
michael mcmonagle executive director of prolife coalition of 
southeast pennsylvania said this is one battle in a long war we 
intend to continue our efforts to nonviolently save children and 
mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities this case will 
not deter that one bit 
the 26 protesters are members of the coalition 
edmond a tiryak attorney for northeast womens center said 
this decision shows that our society will not tolerate the use of 
fear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will on 
women seeking abortion services 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide whether a texas man who murdered a deputy 
sheriff 10 years ago may raise the issue of his mental retardation 
in a new attack on his death sentence 
the courts decision expected sometime in 1990 could clarify 
the scope and retroactive effects of its decision last june 26 
that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers but nly if 
jurors were allowed to take a defendants mental condition into 
consideration 
agreed to use the case of a convicted california robber to 
dispel some uncertainty over when items seized in a police search 
may be used against criminal suspects 
the court said it will hear an appeal by terry brice horton 
sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery illegal 
firearms possession and other charges 
overturned a fine against a pennsylvania newspaper for 
publishing conversations of a bookmaker whose customers telephone 
was tapped by police 
the justices ordered a state court to reconsider a 1000 fine 
and 17409 in lawyers fees imposed against the easton express 
the newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcripts 
accidentally placed in public court records 
the high court said the case should be restudied in light of the 
justices ruling last june that spared a florida newspaper from 
having to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published 
agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of nine 
puerto rico men accused of robbing 72 million from a wells fargo 
depot in connecticut six years ago 
the justices said they will decide whether all the tape 
recordings made during courtauthorized electronic surveillance of 
the defendants may be used as trial evidence 
a federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not be 
used as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeeping 
quickly enough 
in the abortionprotest appeal acted on today lawyers for the 
26 protesters decried an unprecedented and dangerous expansion 
of the federal law primarily aimed at fighting organized crime 
under the 3rd circuits interpretations of rico martin 
luther king was a racketeer when he trespassed on private property 
and conspired with others in an attempt to change the business 
policies of owners of segregated lunch counters the appeal 
contended 
so too is anyone participating in a sitin against apartheid 
with the goal of changing the investment policies of a 
university the appeal said arguing that no rico violation 
should be found if no economic profit motive exists 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case so 
the court could consider whether a profitmaking element is needed 
for rico prosecutions four such votes are needed to grant review 
lawyers for the clinic urged the justices to reject the appeal 
and accused the 26 protesters of deceptively trying to portray

a jury has concluded that a defective 
football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a 
severe brain injury and has awarded the young man 112 million 
the helmet made by the bike athletic co was unreasonably 
dangerous leading to acute bleeding within the brain of richard 
austria then 16 a multnomah county circuit court jury decided 
monday in an 111 vote 
austria now 20 has severe irreversible mental and physical 
impairments and requires 24hour care 
it apparently was the first time that an injury case involving a 
bike helmet has been presented to a jury bike has been in the 
helmet business since 1976 
mark r bocci an attorney for austria and his parents john and 
perla austria said several other cases against bike had been 
settled out of court without disclosure of payments 
bocci and james m pippin also representing the austrias 
contended that the bike air power model helmet worn by austria had 
not been adequately tested before the company marketed it 
bike and the kendall research center which tested helmets for 
bike are both liable for damages both are subsidiaries of 
colgatepalmolive corp 
charles peery a seattle lawyer for bike told jurors last week 
that helmets similar to the one worn by austria are used by 80 
percent of the players in the northwest and alaska from junior 
high school teams to professionals 
the air power model contains a bladder at the crown of the 
helmet that is inflated with air other padding includes foam 
strips called sizers that come in various sizes 
lawyers for the austrias contended that the air power model for 
large heads did not meet national testing standards although 
smaller helmets did pass the tests they said detailed company 
testing records were blank between 1981 and 1984 
peery argued that no helmet could eliminate the risk of a 
subdural hematoma bleeding in the brain caused by a blow and 
contended there was no proof that a football injury caused 
austrias hematoma 
peery said austria had ignored advice from his physician not to 
play football while he suffered headaches 
jurors concluded that austria was 2 percent at fault thus 
reducing the total award of damages from 1140 million to 1119 
million bocci said austria would need 52 million to provide for 
daily care the rest of his life 
william mitchell a portland lawyer representing bike said 
there was a strong chance of an appeal

lawyers for three environmental groups argued 
today for a court order stopping thursdays scheduled launch of a 
nuclearpowered probe from the space shuttle on the ground there 
is a very high probability of an accident 
but lawyers for the national aeronautics and space 
administration countered that the 15 billion sixyear mission to 
jupiter carried very low risks and that even a few days delay 
would force the agency to drop some of its scientific objectives 
us district judge oliver gasch took the case under advisement 
after hearing 2 hours of argument and did not indicate when he 
will rule the countdown for the flight began monday morning 
the environmental groups led by the florida coalition for peace 
and justice asked gasch for a temporary restraining order and 
preliminary injunction against the launch scheduled from the 
kennedy space center at 129 pm edt thursday 
even if the suit is dismissed an engine problem discovered 
overnight could delay the launch several days should repairs be 
needed nasa said 
the fundamental issue in this case is whether the defendants 
adequately complied with environmental laws edward lee rogers 
argued for the environmental groups our concern is that for the 
first time 50 pounds of plutonium are being sent off into space 
from the space shuttle where there is a high probability of an 
accident 
rogers said government studies show that the statistical 
probability of a shuttle accident is one in 78 and that the galileo 
mission which involves the space probe looping around earth twice 
for momentum each provides further opportunity for mishap that 
would spread plutonium pollution 
if ever a case needs to comply fully to the letter of the law 
this one is it he said 
rogers said nasa which claims the possibility of an accident 
causing plutonium contamination to be extremely remote has 
insufficient historical data on which to base such a conclusion 
columbus didnt have much experience either said judge 
gasch 
he wasnt going to contaminate the world either rogers 
replied 
steven frank a justice department lawyer arguing the case for 
the space agency said the two nuclear generators aboard galileo 
are similar to the 38 that have flown previously on 22 missions 
none on the space shuttle 
although three of those flights had accidents he said only one 
resulted in any dispersal of plutonium and that it acted as it 
was designed to do at the time in 1964 since then the nuclear 
generators have gotten better shielding

members of a small club get to sample 
international foods normally forbidden to them under strict jewish 
dietary laws thanks to a hotels executive chef who experiments 
and adapts recipes 
the kosher dining club with more than 200 members gathers 
every six weeks at the sheraton inner harbor hotel for meals 
prepared by chief jim lawson 
among other things the dietary laws set in the old testament 
require that animals be slaughtered in a specific way forbid the 
mixture of dairy products with meat and forbid eating shellfish 
and clovenfooted animals such as pigs 
cooking for the club is always a challenge lawson said 
ive always got to work from nonkosher recipes and kosherize 
them 
for example for a meal that featured scandinavian food lawson 
had to substitute the hams and cheeses common to the nordic diet 
with corned beef fish and appetizers without dairy products 
it takes a lot of investigation and experimentation to come up 
with a winner and still keep it kosher he said 
and on mexican night a consultant from the mexican embassy in 
washington even complimented the food lawson said 
he kept saying that he couldnt believe how authentic it 
was he said 
lawson said many of his recipes are also healthconscious low 
in cholesterol and light in texture differing from the sometimes 
heavy traditional jewish food 
i guess you can call this kosher nouvelle said lawson who 
began his training in a kosher hotel kitchen in minnesota 
the kosher dining club was the brainchild of henry zetlin who 
runs the kosher catering service at the hotel every six weeks 
since he called together some friends for the first meal in 1986 
he goes to the library to research a country and writes to its 
embassy for suggestions on authentic recipes 
the sheratons kitchen carries the certification of the orthodox 
union whose monitoring assures guests that the service is kosher

strict new traffic regulations and higher 
fines went into effect in the worlds largest city this week but 
they seem to have had little effect on the normally chaotic traffic 
at the major intersection of paseo de la reforma and avenida 
insurgentes a pollutionblackened statue of cuauhtemoc mexicos 
last aztec king presided over a scene even more confusing than 
usual 
there isnt any change in the traffic said roman tejeda a 
48yearold physicist in an orange volkswagen the only change is 
going to be in the attitude of the police theyre going to rob 
more from people 
illegal turns and mass jaywalking were out of control 
motorists generally disregarded seatbelt requirements and 
policemen could do precious little about it they had no ticket 
books 
for weeks street vendors have been hawking copies of the 1989 
federal district transit regulations prepping mexico citys 19 
million residents for the tenfold increase in traffic fines that 
went into effect monday 
some drivers and pedestrians werent aware that the regulations 
took effect this week ive seen them selling the booklets in the 
street but i didnt know the new rules were in effect already 
said driver sara arriaga 
the mexico city council published the new rules in august in 
addition to stiffening fines for such offenses as running red 
lights illegal turns or jaywalking the new rules add a few 
offenses to the list among them driving without a seatbelt and 
necking while driving 
until monday the fines for violations ranged from 100 to 500 
pesos 4 cents to 20 cents the new regulations provide fines 
equaling one to five times the minimum daily wage or 360 to 18 
were just briefing drivers inviting them to respect the new 
rules and not commit infractions said transit officer basilio 
haro as a van tried to pull an illegal left at the 
insurgentesreforma traffic circle 
good afternoon youre obstructing the turnout you have to be 
careful because the new regulations are in effect haro told the 
driver 
the fine for the turn once four cents is three days minimum 
wage or 24000 pesos about 9 but haro couldnt write a ticket 
because his old ticket book based on the former regulations has 
been taken away and he doesnt expect to get a new one for 15 days 
violations went on all around him 
a pair of young vendors on the street corner said they sell 
about 40 copies of the new regulations a day at 3000 pesos or 
120 each 
a 32yearold insurance company employee who stopped to buy a 
copy said she wanted to be know her rights in order to avoid police 
extortion 
the fines were insignificant before said margarita 
barragan now that theyre higher theyre going to increase the 
bribes she said and turned to cross the street in the middle of 
the block 
a retired policeman who was chatting nearby with an onduty 
colleague denied the charge bribes have always been encouraged 
by the lawbreakers so they wont have to go out of their way to pay 
fines he said he refused to give his name 
a taxi driver waiting on the curbside for a fare said he used 
his seatbelt for the first time ever monday because he had a 
little more fear of the police 
but he said he didnt think the rules would make much difference 
its not going to be worth much because you cant change a 
populations future from one day to the next with a rule said 
santiago guerrero you need conscience and education about 
traffic safety 
at one point on the traffic circle a pedestrian in a 
pinstriped suit ignoring crosswalks crossed in front of another 
cop the 21yearold salesman said he knew about the new rules and 
thought they would improve safety if everyone would follow them 
but said noe villada to tell the truth i hadnt thought 
about it

us congressmen on tuesday complained 
to european officials that a plan to limit the broadcast of 
american and other foreignmade tv programs amounted to just a 
plain old trade barrier 
the legislators part of an 11member delegation wound up a 
fiveday trip with a stop in brussels to visit the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the european community 
rep richard gephardt dmo said the legislators held a 
spirited exchange with officials of the 12nation trading bloc 
about the new measure that presses local tv stations to air a 
majority of europeanmade entertainment programs 
we feel very strongly about this issue said gephardt who 
is the majority leader of the house of representatives 
its especially troubling for americans to see a product that 
we do have some skill in and some advantage to be closed down 
to any extent he said 
rep howard berman dcalif said its a question of access 
in one of the few areas where the united states has maintained a 
positive balance of trade 
another californian republican robert lagomarsino described 
the move as just a plain old trade barrier that could lead to 
some fairly severe consequences 
the bush administration had lobbied strongly against the plan 
which was approved last week by foreign ministers of the community 
nations the united states argued the move would hurt the european 
earnings of the american film industry and might violate 
international trade rules 
the plan was part of the communitys move to create a single 
market of 320 million consumers in late 1992 by that date the 
dozen nations are scheduled to remove the many trade barriers 
restricting the free flow of people money goods and services 
the tv measure spelled out the conditions under which 
broadcasters in europe would be able to transmit channels 
throughout the community 
as part of that it said governments must ensure that a majority 
of transmission time be reserved where practicable and by 
appropriate means for europeanmade programs 
gephardt said the community officials explained the measure was 
a goal and not a hard and fast rule 
the community officials according to gephardt said even 
though this is their statement that it doesnt mean in reality it 
is going to happen 
officials said last week the measure was a political commitment 
not a legal obligation 
berman said american film producers were not asking for a 
certain share of the european market 
were asking for the traditional factors which affect 
programming decisions that is consumer interest to be the test 
for what happens in posteurope 92 television programming he 
said 
us officials have argued that the plan amounted to a local 
content provision which refers to measures requiring that a 
certain percentage of a product be produced domestically 
the surge in imports of american tv programs has prompted some 
european politicians to urge imposition of quotas contending 
european culture was being threatened

conservative party leaders on the 
defensive as their annual conference opened tuesday insisted 
thatcherism wont slow down despite slumping poll ratings and fears 
that soaring interest rates will bring on a recession 
would the critics prefer us to do too little too late said 
party chairman kenneth baker addressing 9000 delegates at the 
winter gardens a former opera house in this north england resort 
this is not the time for fretting or poring over opinion 
polls this is not the time for being fainthearted added baker 
to applause from prime minister margaret thatcher 
she was seated beside him with other party leaders on a podium 
bedecked in blue the tory color and carrying the slogan of the 
fourday conference the right team for britains future 
employment secretary norman fowler announced the government will 
introduce legislation to curb the unions including a total ban on 
sympathy strikes and unspecified regulations against wildcat 
strikes 
the conference opened at a time of economic uncertainty 
following an increase of interest rates to 15 percent last week a 
slump in the value of the pound and inflation of 7 percent 
the departure from the conference of chancellor the exchequer 
nigel lawson the chief financial official sparked speculation 
that yet another interest rate rise was imminent in london the 
treasury issued a statement saying lawson had left to work on his 
speech to the conference due thursday 
the economic problems have strengthened the revamped labor 
partys fourmonth lead in poll ratings the conservatives are at 
least seven points behind their worst rating since a recession in 
1981 
the proposed new moves against the unions are the latest in a 
battery of unioncurbing laws passed since mrs thatcher won power 
in 1979 and follow a summer resurgence of union militancy 
strikes included weekly shutdown of the london subway system 
the government blamed shadowy groups of militants although the 
strikes were official and called after the union arranged secret 
ballots of members as required by law 
we have fought to get our industrial relations reforms 
through said fowler we will not give up now 
in his keynote speech baker defended the controversial program 
mrs thatcher is pursuing during the third fiveyear term she won 
in 1987 it includes selling the water and electricity utilities to 
private owners an unpopular new property tax and a shakeup of the 
free national health service 
he was greeted with the repeated applause traditional at the 
usually welldisciplined conservative party conferences which have 
no policymaking powers and are aimed mainly at rallying support 
outside the conference center some rankandfile legislators 
renewed calls for slowing down particularly in the privatization 
and property tax plans and generally rethinking policies 
were getting things wrong at the present time we have to 
say weve made mistakes said legislator sir rhodes boyson

thousands of signwaving chanting 
demonstrators ringed floridas capitol today as the legislature 
convened the nations first special session on abortion since a 
landmark us supreme court ruling in july 
lawmakers gaveled the session to order shortly after 1 pm to 
take up antiabortion legislation pushed by republican gov bob 
martinez in the wake of a high court ruling giving states greater 
power to restrict abortions 
prochoice activists marched to the capitol with antiabortion 
demonstrators lining the route no trouble was reported although 
there was jeering and yelling from both sides 
senate president bob crawford and house speaker tom gustafson 
both democrats said martinezs proposals would get a full hearing 
in committees but they said the legislation is unlikely to pass 
i dont believe a session called to restrict abortion is a 
wise expenditure of time gustafson said 
uniformed officers have maintained tight security at the 
capitol patrolling corridors and guarding the doors to the senate 
and house chambers 
you are being heard on this issue martinez told a cheering 
crowd of 7000 antiabortion activists in a rally outside the 
capitol on monday night 
more than 1000 babies could be saved by pending legislation 
whose voices we wont hear whose cries will not be acknowledged 
martinez said as the crowd chanted prolife prolife 
martinez called the session in july in response to the supreme 
court ruling in the missouri case webster vs reproductive health 
services the ruling prompted efforts in several states to impose 
limits on abortions 
among the governors proposals are a ban on the use of public 
money and facilities for abortions and expanded regulation of 
abortion clinics measures intended to make women think twice about 
having an abortion would require doctors to tell patients about the 
development of their fetuses and require women more than 20 weeks 
pregnant to be tested to see if the fetus could survive outside the 
womb before an abortion is performed 
floridas antiabortion movement suffered a setback last week 
when the state supreme court struck down a 1988 law that required 
girls under 18 to obtain the consent of a parent or a judge before 
getting an abortion the court ruled the law violated a privacy 
clause in the state constitution

this countrys communist leaders have 
moved toward political change by discarding the communist party and 
creating a new party dedicated to democratic reforms 
the communist party officially called the hungarian socialist 
workers party when it was reorganized after the 1956 revolution 
decided saturday to become the hungarian socialist party and 
adopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the country 
the delegates to the party congress then named rezsoe nyers who 
headed the communist party as president of the new party 
with the same leader a slightly different name and the same 
membership as the old party it remains unclear what directions the 
new organization will take 
the hungarian communist party was modeled on the soviet 
communist party in which the party elite made all the major 
daytoday decisions and the general membership had little say in 
formulating policy 
a communist party believes in the efficency of central economic 
planning and all property is stateowned in an effort to end 
exploitation of the working masses 
one important aspect of communism is that it concerns itself not 
only with the economy but with almost every aspect of society 
including political life education and public information 
however under the 32year leadership of janos kadar the 
hungarian party allowed some small private enterprise in the 1970s 
and was relatively tolerant of dissent 
in the past year the reformist communist leadership took steps 
toward transition to a more democratic society by advocating free 
elections and a market economy 
the program of the newly founded hungarian socialist party makes 
no mention of marxism and accepts a market economy that includes 
private ownership 
socialist parties in the west have favoured some state influence 
in the national economy stressing it is necessary to ensure public 
welfare and national health programs a point also emphasized by 
the new hungarian party 
the new party also has adopted western socialist ideals such as 
guaranteed human rights and freedom of movement and freedom of 
conscience 
the partys program advocates a social market economy 
rejecting democratic centralism and favoring selfgovernment 
it wishes to compete for support among the electorate along with 
other parties and no longer relies on its leading role in society 
being secured in the constitution 
the party accepts the fact that there is a plurality of 
interests in society and rejects the notion that there is a single 
correct line on everything

security has been tightened for attorney 
general dick thornburgh and drug policy coordinator william 
bennett but officials declined tuesday to directly link the 
measures to colombias crackdown on drug traffickers 
it was a combination of threats in the area of terrorism both 
from domestic concerns and from international areas also 
narcoterrorism was a part of it fbi spokesman milt ahlerich 
said about the increased security for thornburgh 
the attorney general has been using an armorplated limousine 
which cost more than 100000 for three or four weeks said 
justice department spokesman david runkel he also has been using a 
basement entrance at the department instead of the streetlevel 
door he had been using runkel said 
both ahlerich and runkel declined to say whether colombias war 
on drugs was a specific factor colombia began a crackdown on drug 
traffickers in midaugust 
there has been since midaugust a heightened concern for 
security runkel said he would not say whether there had been 
any specific threats against thornburgh 
the us marshals service has assigned a permanent security 
detail to protect bennett said spokesman bill dempsey 
the security dempsey said was not solely because of the 
colombian situation but partly the result of it 
the marshals service which is responsible for protecting 
federal courthouses is tightening security in jurisdictions where 
colombian drug traffickers face charges 
we are taking necessary security steps throughout the country 
but we are not going into a discussion of degrees of what we are 
doing specifically dempsey said 
one colombian has been extradited to the united states on 
charges of laundering money for the medellin cartel since the south 
american government began its crackdown 
three other colombians wanted on us charges are awaiting 
extradition

the supreme court on tuesday agreed to referee 
a bigmoney battle over patent rights for medical devices 
the court said it will hear an appeal by eli lilly and co of 
indianapolis seeking reinstatement of a 267 million award 
against medtronic inc of minneapolis eli lilly said medtronic 
infringed on patents on a device implanted in patients to correct 
potentially fatal heart rhythms 
at issue are provisions of a 1984 federal law that reduced 
patent infringement protection for drug companies 
a federal appeals court here interpreted the law to apply to 
medical devices as well as generic drugs the appeals court last 
march threw out the 267 million judgment a lower court awarded 
lilly 
the 1984 law is aimed at helping generic drug manufacturers 
seeking to place their substitutes for patented brandname drugs 
on the market as soon as patents expire 
the law permits the generic drug firms to get information from 
the federal food and drug administration and apply to the fda for 
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patents 
also as long as the purpose is related to its application to 
the fda the generic drug companies are allowed by law to make 
use or sell a patented invention prior to the patents expiration 
the appeals court here said the clear intent of congress was 
to create an fda experimental use exception for research 
activities no persuasive reason is suggested why congress would 
create an exception with respect to those activities for drugs 
only the appeals court said 
eli lilly with support from other major medical companies and 
patent holders said the ruling could undermine health care 
research and development of lifesaving devices 
the companies said the pace of costly innovative research will 
be slowed because patent holders will fear their work soon might be 
copied 
but medtronic said eli lilly is distorting economic reality 
medtronic said the value of the heartimplant devices it tested 
is less than 415000 by contrast it said eli lilly is expected 
to sell more than 100 million worth of the devices before a 
twoyear extension of its patent expires on oct 26 1990 
notwithstanding the limited nature of medtronics 
fdacontrolled testing lilly contended that the testing gave 
medtronic a headstart towards an entry into the commercial 
marketplace medtronic said 
it added that if lillys interpretation of the 1984 law is 
correct it is up to congress and not the supreme court to correct 
the problem 
medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac 
disturbances painlessly with lowenergy electrical impulses as a 
substitute for the higherenergy shocks that accompany the lilly 
device 
lillys appeal to the high court was supported by sen orrin 
hatch rutah sponsor of the 1984 legislation and rep carlos 
moorhead rpa floor manager of the bill in the house 
the case is eli lilly vs medtronic inc 89243

four mexican aliens were found dead this 
morning in a railmounted trailer that had been fumigated with a 
toxic chemical police said the trailer had been plastered with a 
warning it was being fumigated 
they apparently died of asphyxiation said lt jack williams 
a southern pacific inspector found the victims about 815 am 
after a brakeman noticed a door open said sgt john burney the 
container 40 feet long 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide was half 
filled with boxes of tortilla flour 
authorities said they were not certain if fumigation played a 
role in the deaths but burney said the victims had suffered 
diarrhea and vomiting symptoms he said can be caused by the 
fumigant usually used on flour autopsies were scheduled 
the trailer carried an 8by10inch sticker with skulls and the 
warning in spanish and english danger this trailer is being 
fumigated 
officials of the flour producer azteca milling co of edinburg 
said they did not know exactly when the trailer was treated with 
pesticide but that the aliens must have broken into the container 
after it was fumigated 
a contractor had fumigated the flour with phostoxin an aluminum 
phosphate pesticide before the trailer was sealed and loaded on a 
flatcar in harlingen said jorge trevino azteca quality control 
manager 
obviously they had to break into the car because they are 
sealed before they are put on the train said gonzalo garcia 
azteca traffic manager 
aluminum phosphate can produce a poisonous gas in enclosed 
containers and should not be breathed according to the houston 
fire department 
the train left harlingen at 1240 am said steve abeyta a 
southern pacific trainmaster the morning was cool with 
temperatures at victoria in the mid50s 
they put a hole in the roof about the size of a half dollar 
apparently one of them had a buckle knife he used to poke the 
hole williams said another police officer said the men 
apparently made the hole for ventilation 
burney said officers suspect other illegal aliens may have been 
hiding in another trailer and opened the door then fled when they 
saw the bodies 
the trailer was in between switching areas in victoria a town 
of 45000 about 125 miles southwest of houston 
since 1980 there has been a string of incidents in which 
illegal aliens have been found dead after crossing into the united 
states 
in 1987 18 mexican men suffocated inside a locked boxcar after 
crossing the border into a freight yard in el paso a smuggler had 
locked the men inside the insulated car which later was parked for 
hours in the desert sun

czechoslovak authorities to grant an exit visa to dissident 
playwright vaclav havel who is due to receive a prize at the book 
fair sunday but west german chancellor helmut kohl indicated it 
was not likely havel would get a visa 
peter weidhaas director of the 41st annual fair the largest in

states where rushdies book has been published and drawn protests

weidhaas who said he was speaking for all the publishers 
gathered in frankfurt appealed to irans leadership to revoke 
the death call against salman rushdie his publishers and 
booksellers 
neither german nor foreign publishers are displaying the british 
authors book published last year some exhibitors feel simply 
uneasy if such a book is around weidhaas said 
in february ayatollah ruhollah khomeini put a 52million 
bounty on rushdie whose the satanic verses was banned in 
moslem countries because they said it blasphemed islam 
khomeini who died in june also urged moslems to kill rushdies

stands weidhaas said

publishing in czechoslovakia has been awarded the annual 
friedenspreis peace prize by west german publishers

publishers friedenspreis is support and encouragement for him in 
his distress kohl said in officially opening the book fair 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has urged his 
czechoslovak counterpart several times to let havel come accept his

the united states has airlifted to miami some 
of the leaders of the failed military coup in panama and is 
treating them as refugees the white house said today 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the group 
included coup members as well as their relatives 
we have a number of refugees in miami that were flown in 
fitzwater said i cant identify who they are or where they are 
for personal safety reasons he said the action was taken under 
president bushs authority 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 42 
panamanians were flown to miami and admitted on humanitarian 
grounds some are relatives of maj moises giroldi a top coup 
leader killed after the takeover failed she said 
giroldis widow adela bonilla giroldi was conspicuously absent 
monday from her husbands funeral in panama city 
the washington post reported that those given refuge also 
included capt javier licona believed to be the highestranking 
participant in the coup to escape capture and capt francisco 
alvarez who was arrested and jailed last year for taking part in a 
failed 1988 plot against noriega 
alvarez was said to have been released from jail three weeks ago 
ms tutwiler said the panamanians are being received by the us 
catholic conference and the us immigration and naturalization 
service is prepared to review aplications for political asylum if 
such requests are made 
meanwhile fitzwater continued to defend the us role and the 
decision not to send in us military forces to help depose 
panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
amid charges that the administration was operating in a void of 
information the spokesman said bush had plenty of information 
he made the decision that he thought was best and the decision we 
still think is right we dont have any questioning about the 
correctness of that decision 
fitzwater seemed to back away from administration complaints 
about congressional interference in foreign affairs particularly 
in panama 
saying that bush wants a good relationship with congress he 
said we dont have any specific complaints 
asked if the united states was planning additional economic 
sanctions against panama to increase pressure on noriega fitzwater 
said we dont have any plan to do that 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said a review of the 
events during the coup now reveals that there was confusion and 
dissension among the coup plotters and that there was some 
argument about what to do with noriega 
williams said it is now clear that giroldi the coup leader 
had no intention ever of turning noriega over to the united 
states and that an officer who wanted to turn noriega over to the 
united states argued with giroldi about it 
the spokesman declined to identify the officer or say where he 
is now 
williams said the officer was one of those who met later with 
maj gen marc cisneros second in command of the us forces in 
the area 
but williams said he could not say whether that officer made 
clear to cisneros that there was a dissident faction among the 
panamanian officers who wanted to turn noriega over 
the pentagon spokesman said it isnt entirely clear to what 
extent the people claiming to hold noriega really had him under 
their control 
you have someone who was one of the coup plotters saying 
well we ought to turn noriega over to the united states he 
doesnt prevail and he leaves and he communicates to the united 
states that the people holding general noriega still have no 
intention of turning him over to the united states williams said 
there was never a request for us to come and get him they 
never offered him to us he said

a moose that apparently lost a mating 
rights battle in canada is wandering south through iowa sending 
residents scrambling for their cameras and hopping into airplanes 
for a better look 
moose arent supposed to be in iowa but several have popped up 
in the last dozen years usually heading south for a mysterious 
reason a state wildlife specialist said tuesday 
the wandering bulls natural range is 400 miles north of iowa 
the animal has traveled 120 miles in the state since it was spotted 
sept 22 
word spread quickly when the moose was sighted monday in 
woodbine about 100 miles west of des moines 
residents grabbed their cameras and postmaster dencil hammack 
rushed to the airport and rented a plane by the time he got up 
the moose had moved to a field of unpicked corn 
he was kind of tired out and resting hammack said we 
came in low and got a good look at him 
the cornfields owner farmer myron barry went along with 
hammack for the ride 
he said i dont suppose the federal crop people would honor 
a claim for damages by a moose hammack said 
lee gladfelder a state wildlife specialist said he expects the 
moose to continue south though he doesnt know why 
i only know of one case where a moose did turn back and that 
was back in the 70s the others have either gone on south or stayed 
the winter he said 
gladfelder said the best theory on the beasts trek is that it 
lost a contest for mating rights and was rejected by the herd 
the animal already has crossed two rivers to keep on the 
southerly course state conservation officer richard johnson said 
the moose was not bothered by gawkers and airplanes 
some got to within 30 40 feet from him to get their pictures 
and videos he said

the nations paleontologists who know a 
dinosaur when they see one are upset over the us postal 
services latest block of dinosaur stamps 
one of the stamps uses an outofdate name and another actually 
shows a flying reptile complain the scientists who study ancient 
forms of life 
in its own defense the postal service produced a letter from a 
maryland sevenyearold to whom the identity of the animals was 
perfectly clear 
and as for calling the set dinosaur stamps officials say 
that term is simply the easiest for people to understand 
the stamps were selected in an effort to join in the current 
interest in dinosaurs among young people and they are being 
featured as part of the postal services annual stamp collecting 
month promotion 
the four 25cent stamps include a tyrannosaurus a large fierce 
reptile and a stegosaurus or plated lizard with a row of large 
plates on its back neither of those raised any complaints from the 
paleontologists 
but the other two show a brontosaurus a largebodied lizard 
with long neck and tiny head and a pteranodon a flying reptile 
that means that one of the stamps the pteranodon doesnt 
picture a dinosaur at all complained the paleontologists 
and the brontosaurus actually is an apatosaurus they said 
while promoting the dinosaur stamps in their advertising postal 
officials admit that the pteranodon isnt technically a dinosaur 
the postal services book introduction to stamp collecting 
which is being used in the stamp promotion refers to the stamps as 
the prehistoric animals series and notes that the group of 
stamps portrays three dinosaurs and a pteranodon a winged 
creature that ruled the skies while dinosaurs ruled the land 
the paleontological society is more upset about the brontosaurus 
stamp however having gone so far as to issue a statement 
detailing the correct name for the animal 
the brontosaurus never existed having actually been the result 
of a 19th century researcher mixing up the skull of one prehistoric 
animal with the body bones of another the paleontologists say the 
body skeleton had already been named apatosaurus the scientists 
noted 
in the past 15 years or so museums have corrected the problem 
joined the correct skulls with the skeletons of the animals and 
changed the designation to apatosaurus 
by scientific convention the paleontologists state when more 
than one name is given to a species only the oldest name is 
scientifically valid as a consequence use of the name 
brontosaurus must be discontinued 
in its defense the postal service noted that its booklet on 
stamps uses both names and the agency produced a letter from 
7yearold brandon dennis of laurel md who had read about the 
controversy in a washington newspaper 
i like the name brontosaurus because it means thunder lizard 
not deceptive lizard like apatosaurus wrote brandon 
after citing a several books using the term brontosaurus he 
concluded that its all right to use brontosaurus because most 
kids including my sister know that brontosaurus and apatosaurus 
are the same creature

it was a knight that kerry oconnell 
wont soon forget 
when the 29yearold woman opened the door to her home at about 
1 pm monday she found her boyfriend dressed in armor and 
kneeling on her stoop 
kerry anne oconnell i would like to be your knight 
forever said rui lopes the 27yearold coowner of a bridgeport 
nightclub will you marry me 
oconnell her face flushed and trembling replied yes i 
will she then kissed lopes and a crowd that had gathered 
clapped approval 
lopes said donning the armor suit made of gray fiberglass and 
riding a horse up to his girlfriends front door was the 
fulfillment of a dream 
as a boy i was always into knights and castles and kings 
he said i cant really explain it but i decided when i was 14 or 
15 years old that i should propose in armor and on a horse i guess 
this is extravagant enough to prove to her that im not kidding 
around that its the real thing 
the couple have known each other for three years and plan to

persecution judi jankowski of the minnesota chapter of world 
relief an arm of the national association of evangelicals said 
tuesday 
the fbi has entered the case agent terry wyllie said tuesday 
theres a strong possibility that a civil rights violation has 
occurred he said refusing further comment 
the harassment that vladimir and ekaterina doroshkevich and 
their children have suffered since saturday is the first aimed at 
any of the more than 10000 soviet christians who have immigrated

they suffered greatly under the communist system now theyre 
suffering here jankowski said monday

homeland in the ukraine before arriving in minnesota with his 
family aug 18 said through an interpreter monday that he wasnt 
too concerned about the incidents and resolved to stay in this 
welltodo minneapolisst paul suburb 
where i come from im used to this kind of persecution he 
said but this is nothing compared with the love weve received 
here 
the ukraine is one of several soviet republics chafing under 
russian rule from moscow 
the harassment began with a telephone call late saturday from an 
adult male to the home of the rev michael smith pastor of the 
calvary assembly of god church which sponsored the familys 
resettlement

vulgar references to russians smith said no threats were made in 
that call

and this time threatened the smiths the doroshkeviches and the 
church smith said 
smith called police who told him that they were responding to a 
crossburning at the same time on the front lawn of the 
doroshkevich home near the church officers put out the fire but 
no suspects were spotted smith said 
later sunday morning graffiti was found at the church some of 
it painted inside the lobby smith said the vandals may have 
gotten in through an unlocked side door he said 
smith said the slogans painted in red included cccp not 
welcome referring to ussr in the cyrilic alphabet used in 
russia and america is for americans only our boys died over 
there so these people could live here no way

beatings and interrogations in his homeland because of his 
pentecostal faith which is not among the soviet unions authorized 
religions

have responded with support for the family by calling police with 
leads moeller said 
the communitys reaction has been very favorable very 
supportive of this family after this has happened he said

a threeeyed alien with a robot sidekick landed by 
ufo and made a boy vanish by zapping him with a pistol a soviet 
newspaper reported tuesday in a second day of strange tales in the 
staterun media 
but as the bizarre saga of the space invasion of the city of 
voronezh unfolded for a second day a scientist whose words were 
used to buttress the first published report voiced doubts and said 
he was in part misquoted 
dont believe all you hear from tass genrikh silanov head 
of the voronezh geophysical laboratory cautioned in a telephone 
interview with the associated press from voronezh we never gave 
them part of what they published 
on monday the usually staid official soviet news agency told 
the world that scientists had confirmed an alien spaceship carrying 
giant people with tiny heads had touched down in voronezh a city 
of more than 800000 people about 300 miles southeast of moscow 
as many as three aliens 13 feet tall left the spacecraft 
described as a large shining ball and walked in the park with a 
small robot tass reported a tass duty officer stood by the story 
it is not april fools today he said 
the purported close encounter in voronezh was only the latest 
weird tale to appear in the soviet media which under the policy of 
glasnost or openness have recently told of other sightings of 
ufos and the yeti or abominable snowman 
mondays report spawned rumors in moscow including one that the 
aliens told voronezh residents the earth would be destroyed by the 
year 2000 if people didnt stop polluting it 
nonetheless a communist party paper whose avowed mission is to 
write about culture was the only major national daily to print 
anything tuesday about the ufo indicating more authoritative 
newspapers like pravda thought the topic too hot to handle 
sovietskaya kultura said its coverage was motivated by the 
golden rule of journalism the reader must know everything 
of course its hard to believe in what happened in the 
town it reported from voronezh its even more difficult to 
explain 
the daily quoted witnesses as saying the ufo flew into voronezh 
on sept 27 at 630 pm it said boys playing soccer saw a pink 
glow in the sky then saw a deep red ball about 10 yards in 
diameter the ball circled vanished then reappeared minutes later 
and hovered it said 
a crowd rushed to the site sovietskaya kultura said and 
through an open hatch saw a threeeyed alien about 10 feet 
tall clad in silvery overalls and bronzecolored boots and 
wearing a disk on his chest 
the newspaper quoting witnesses gave this account 
the ufo landed two creatures one apparently a robot exited a 
boy screamed with fear but when the alien gazed at him with eyes 
shining he fell silent unable to move onlookers screamed and 
the ufo and the creatures disappeared 
about five minutes later they reappeared the alien had a 
pistol a tube about 20 inches long which it pointed at an 
unidentified 16yearold boy making him disappear the alien went 
inside the sphere which took off at the same time the boy 
reappeared 
children and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been 
questioned by police workers and journalists wrote sovietskaya 
kulturas voronezh correspondent e efremov there are no 
discrepencies in the description of the sphere itself or the 
actions of the aliens moreover all the children who became 
witnesses to this event are still afraid even now 
it gave the names of only three witnesses all youngsters 
scientists from a nationwide group that investigates abnormal 
phenomena were looking into the landing the newspaper said 
silanov who said he belongs to the group cast doubt on the 
tass report that quoted him as saying the aliens left behind two 
rocks resembling sandstone of a deep red color that cannot be found 
anywhere 
the rock they described as extraterrestrial is in fact a piece 
of iron oxide which could easily have originated on earth 
according to silanov 50 
he said there indeed was a landing site or something 
resembling one in voronezh but he acknowledged that could happen 
as well if there were an underground pipe or cable or an 
underground reservoir 
silanov also said the testimony of children between the ages of 
11 and 14 who claimed they witnessed the landing did not always 
correspond on how the aliens looked and that they certainly 
didnt mention the tremendous height cited by tass 
the phone connection was abruptly cut off before silanov could 
answer more questions 
meanwhile a tass editor said two moscowbased reporters had 
been dispatched to voronezh to check on the report on the ufo filed 
by local tass correspondent vladimir lebedev a man he termed a 
very serious journalist 
the editor who spoke on condition of anonymity said tass 
through bitter experience has learned to be wary of hoaxes in 
january the news agency reported six people had been rescued after 
spending 35 days buried alive in rubble following the armenian 
earthquake it later retracted the story

president bush joined the celebration tuesday 
for the trumbull conn little league baseball team that brought 
the world championship back to the united states 
bush a former little league coach used the rose garden 
ceremony to urge the 12yearolds to emulate the example of 
baseball great lou gehrig 
the us postal service recently issued a stamp commemorating 
the 50th anniversary of gehrigs final season and bush presented 
the original painting of gehrig to an official of the baseball hall 
of fame in cooperstown ny 
bush said the trumbull team which defeated a favored taiwan 
team at the little league world series in williamsport pa in 
august displayed a spirit which says that nothing is impossible 
in little league or in the bigger fields of life 
trumbull became the first us squad to capture the title in six 
years 
bush said the youngsters had learned the lessons of little 
league lessons like friendship and generosity like dountoothers 
and doing your best lessons which go beyond balls and strikes and 
which have made little league a global institution 
little league baseball which marked its 50th anniversary this 
year is played by 2 million youths in 33 nations bush said 
bush called gehrig a hall of fame first baseman for the new 
york yankees in the 1920s and 1930s a hero of mine 
gehrig set a consecutive games record that still stands the 
streak ended when gehrig was struck by the paralyzing disease that 
bears his name 
even in the face of that fatal ailment gehrig told a crowd at 
his retirement in yankee stadium on july 4 1939 i consider 
myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth 
that story has become an american parable what an example for 
these kids said bush adding that gehrig spent much of the last 
two years of his life counseling youngsters as parole commissioner 
for the city of new york 
he showed like little league that what matters is how we 
conduct ourselves off as well as on the field bush said 
bush shook hands with coach tom galla and his entire squad 
you truly are no 1 the president said 
the trumbull team has been invited to appear in uniform sunday 
at the second game of the world series between san francisco and 
oakland if parents can afford the trip 
bush who had hoped to see the series himself apparently has 
decided the west coast is too far to go to throw out a ball 
im afraid i might not get to go now he told reporters as 
he left the rose garden

blast in two days tuesday and telephoned bomb threats have been 
received by at least four other high schools in central indiana

no injuries classes were canceled 
police have no suspects but at least one lead looked promising

police chief ron rheam said police would step up security at the 
school wednesday he declined to reveal details 
i do not fear for any teacher or student coming to the school 
tomorrow rheam said tuesday the safety of students and 
teachers is our first priority 
a small pipe bomb exploded about 735 am tuesday in a hall 
outside the school auditorium said charles petersen special agent 
in charge of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms in 
indianapolis 
atf agents were on their way to anderson to investigate mondays 
explosion when the second bomb went off rheam said 
it sounded like a loud firecracker i was scared a little 
bit said james porter a senior who said he was about 40 yards 
from the explosion 
the areas that the bombs were placed are areas where there is 
not heavy traffic flow so that the person thats placing the bombs 
has some feeling that he does not want anyone hurt rheam said 
a telephone threat preceded tuesdays blast by about 10 minutes 
a few students and teachers were in the building at the time but no 
one was injured 
mondays explosion at the school was followed by two telephone 
bomb threats said fire chief dan edwards highland and madison

a bomb threat said stan warner assistant principal 
no bomb was found warner said students returned to classes 
about noon but some were sent home at their parents request 
once you have a bomb threat you have a certain amount of 
hysteria and uncertainty and it makes it very difficult to get the 
school back to a normal day warner said 
noblesville high school about 15 miles west of anderson also 
was evacuated tuesday after officials there received a bomb threat 
no bomb was found 
noblesville fire chief jeff reveal suspected it was a copycat 
incident following publicity surrounding the anderson bombs i

each other or to the threats petersen said

a rocket hit a crowded bus station in 
the besieged afghan capital tuesday killing 23 people and injuring 
an undetermined number radio kabul reported 
the official radio monitored in islamabad described a grisly 
scene of blood fragmented bodies and people crying 
it said five surfacetosurface rockets hit kabul on tuesday 
the eve of the afghan celebration of the birth of the moslem 
prophet mohammed 1409 years ago 
people including children women and old men were returning 
home from work or shopping when the rocket exploded the radio 
said 
it said the rocket was fired most probably by puritan wahabi 
sect mercenaries helping usbacked moslem guerrillas fighting to 
topple kabuls sovietbacked government 
the celebration of mohammeds birth depends each year on the 
sighting of the moon afghans will celebrate the event wednesday 
but other moslem countries may celebrate later this week 
afghan guerrillas who are struggling to oust the communists and 
establish an islamic government also are aided in part by private 
moslem mercenaries from some gulf states 
official kabul media often report that these mercenaries in 
addition to pakistanis and sometimes even americans are fighting 
against them on afghan soil 
washington has flatly denied that us military personnel ever 
have fought in the 11yearold afghan civil war 
also on tuesday western diplomatic sources in islamabad said an 
estimated 2 million people in kabul face a winter of scarce food 
and fuel unless the communist government changes its priority of 
supplies 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the bulk 
of a massive soviet airlift to the city consists of weapons instead 
of foodstuff 
western diplomats reported a similar situation in autumn 1988 
when early and persistent snows fell in the winter disrupting 
overland transport kabul faced a severe food shortage 
soviet combat troops ended nine years of involvement in the 
afghan civil war in february and kabul government forces still 
hold the major cities 
but the guerrillas fighting to oust the communists in favor of 
an islamic system of goverment control most of the rugged 
countryside including key roads 
several of afghanistans communistcontrolled cities only 
receive supplies by air which sharply limits the volume of cargo

a meat trade official said in a report tuesday 
that the current situation points to good times for the industry as 
the 1990s approach 
c manly molpus president of the american meat institute said 
the overall decline in red meat consumption appears to have 
stabilized over the last year or so further he said there are 
solid indications that demand for pork is increasing 
retail beef prices have responded to supply shortfalls with 
more vigor than might have been expected after the flattodown 
trend that characterized most of the decade of the 1980s 
molpus said and the export value of meat and meat products 
surpassed the value of imports for the first time ever last year 
molpus comments were in the associations meat facts yearbook 
for 1989 the 19th annual issue 
cattle numbers are at or near their cyclical low and beef 
supplies will remain tight for the next several years as producers 
hold back cattle to expand herd sizes he said 
on the pork side poor producer returns have likely slowed 
herd expansion with the result that pork supplies could be 
slightly smaller next year

the state electric industry owed more 
than 39 million is telling governmentowned enterprises to pay up 
or it will pull the plug 
the power monopoly also warns of a potential shortage of 
electrical energy due to lack of capacity as the winter heating 
season approaches the state pap news agency reported 
amid polands crumbling economy there have been reports of 
stateowned companies failing to pay other stateowned enterprises 
this results in enterprises lacking cash to operate further 
aggravating shortages and reducing funds available to pay debts to 
other suppliers 
among the debtors with overdue electric bills in warsaw are the 
pharmaceutical enterprise the car factory and the works that make 
construction and photographic supplies and transportation optical 
telecommunications equipment according to pap 
the polfa pharmaceutical enterprise alone owes nearly 139000 
the largest debtor the huta warszawa steel mill recently paid 
up pap said although no figure was provided for its bill 
regional power distribution stations already have cut off 
electricity to many smaller enterprises with high bills the news 
agency said 
the power supplier warned that even companies that pay their 
bills may suffer power shortages due to a demand for electricity 
that has increased by 1000 megawatts 
this is precisely the amount lacking at present said pap 
almost all the capacity of the polish power industry has been put 
ot use 
last month a severe shortage of coal was reported estimates 
are that coal extraction this year will be off 7 million tons from 
the approximately 185 million tons mined last year

in a state that has no limits on political 
contributions douglas wilders campaign for governor of virginia 
is happy to have the support of john w kluge named by forbes 
magazine as the richest man in america 
its great bj northington a wilder campaign aide said 
tuesday hes given us what 200000 indeed he has in two 
checks so far this year of 100000 each kluge raised an 
additional 500000 for wilder at a 5000acouple get together at 
his charlottesville estate 
but northington was quick to say that wilders republican 
opponent j marshall coleman has received more than 900000 in 
campaign contributions from mclean va developer dwight schar and 
his family 
big money is a hallmark of the campaign to succeed virginias 
democratic gov gerald baliles who cannot run for reelection 
coleman has raised more than 8 million and wilder bidding to 
become the first black elected governor of any state has taken in 
close to 5 million the election is nov 7 
money can be easy to raise in virginia too easy according to 
larry sabato a political scientist at the university of virginia 
we have no limitations in virginia he said people can 
give millions if they want 
sabato defends political action committees as a preferred 
alternative to individual contributions in the range of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars 
theyre making an investment he said of such contributors 
ive yet to find a person who believes the line theyre doing it 
for good government 
alson smith a member of the virginia house of delegates who is 
one of the states premier political fundraisers said he 
supported efforts to limit individual contributions to 1000 
we couldnt get that to fly he said adding that attempts 
to set the limit at 5000 and 10000 were no more successful 
smith described kluge as a good friend of mine and said 
ive never asked him for a dime for anybody 
he said he thought kluge was basically a republican 
the 75yearold kluge is described as a selfmade man who 
parlayed a maryland radio station into the metromedia radio and 
television empire 
forbes estimated his fortune at 52 billion and said his 
holdings rose about 2 billion from the previous year thanks to a 
tripling in the value of his investment in cellular telephones 
he took the role of richest man in america from sam walton head 
of the walmart stores discount chain who dropped down on the 
individual list because he divided his 9 billion fortune among 
himself and his four children 
smith said kluge and wilder met when the billionaire had a 
little mixer on his yacht 
he started off without a dime smith said of kluge he 
felt doug wilder had brought himself up by his bootstraps 
that prompted the first 100000 check from kluge to the wilder 
campaign the story of the second check was told by patricia kluge 
at the fundraising reception at their estate 
according to mrs kluge coleman called her husband and said he 
was aware of his support for wilder but im going to win and i 
think we should get to know each other 
mrs kluge said that after that conversation her husband wrote 
another 100000 check to the wilder campaign 
what would kluges money buy if wilder is elected governor 
there has been widespread speculation that the billionaires 
wife yearns to sit on the university of virginia board of visitors 
smith brushed off such suggestions saying that given kluges 
wealth theres nothing doug wilder can do for john kluge what 
can anybody do for john kluge

a group of roman catholic nuns won a reprieve 
tuesday for their flock of egglaying chickens which had been 
marked for slaughter by health inspectors 
lawyers for 14 nuns at our lady of passion monastery in the 
central england town of daventry appealed to the high court for a 
review of a ministry of agriculture order permitting inspectors to 
destroy the nuns 5000 chickens 
judge sir konrad schiemann said he would review the slaughter 
order at a hearing friday 
the nuns accused minister of agriculture john gummer of 
failing to comply with the rules of natural justice 
the chickens were targeted for slaughter after a salmonella 
victim in nearby bedworth blamed their eggs for her food poisoning 
mother catherine head of the autonomous order said the 
monasterys eggs had never been tested 
mother catherine said the strain of salmonella typhimurium 
has been in the convents chickens since 1913 and did not pose a 
serious health risk she said the bedworth outbreak had been caused 
by another strain enteriditus 
the nuns last week blocked roads leading to the convent and 
barricaded themselves in the henhouse to keep out health inspectors 
and ministry officials they said the convent might have to close 
if the income from selling eggs was lost 
the government authorized its veterinarians to close 
eggproducing plants and slaughter chickens after a food poisoning 
scare earlier this year involving salmonella in eggs 
the british egg producers association said they were delighted 
the judicial review had been granted and said it would be a test 
case which could force the government to rethink its approach to 
tackling salmonella contamination

president carlos andres perez asked 
latin american nations on tuesday to take strong collective 
action against gen manuel antonio noriega who survived another 
coup attempt last week in panama 
in panama there is no longer a constitutional regime but a 
simple military dictatorship engaging in dramatic excesses 
perez told a news conference 
noriega commands panamas defense forces and so controls the 
government there 
perez accused that government of executing rebel officers 
imprisoned after the coup failed 
the government denied news accounts of some coup leaders being 
executed after surendering but perez said he had reports that 
with a great deal of precision officers of the panamanian 
defense forces have been executed while in prison 
he gave no details nor did he spell out what action latin 
america should take 
at the funeral in panama city on tuesday of a defense forces 
captain involved in the coup his widow said her husband was killed 
in prison and did not commit suicide as rumors had it 
capt nicasio lorenzo was reported to have committed suicide in 
prison by hanging himself the official coroners report said he 
died of asphyxiation 
but his widow luz elaine said lorenzo was a very catholic 
man who would never have killed himself and vowed at her 
husbands coffin i will shout it to the world until justice is 
done and the truth is known 
panamanian military officials have said eight officers and two 
sergeants were killed in the rebellion oct 3 including its 
leader maj moises giroldi several us reports have said an 
enraged noriega personally shot giroldi to death minutes after the 
coup failed 
in washington the bush administration said tuesday the united 
states had flown some coup leaders to miami along with members of 
their families 
the united states has tried to get noriega out for nearly two 
years it applied economic sanctions against panama after federal 
grand juries in florida indicted him in february 1988 on charges of 
drug trafficking and money laundering 
noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a us plot 
to retain control of the panama canal after 1999 when it is to be 
turned over under treaties signed in 1977 
panama led the agenda for talks between perez and president 
francois mitterrand of france who arrived monday for a 48hour 
official visit 
on monday night at a banquet for mitterrand perez said the 
noriega regime was sowing terror by executing panamanian 
officers 
at the news conference tuesday he ruled out military 
intervention saying it would be a tragedy for the whole 
continent he added that latin american action undertaken in 
solidarity with the panamanian people would spare the region 
worse evils 
the president declared that latin america was allowing a 
military dictatorship in panama despite its repudiation of attempts 
to overthrow civilian governments in argentina ecuador and peru by 
force 
that he said could be a dangerous sign of regression for 
latin americas democratic process it compels us to see a 
dictorship in panama as a threat for the entire continent 
observers said the call for joint action could lead to formal 
expulsion of panama from the latin american group of eight whose 
other members are argentina uruguay brazil peru colombia 
mexico and venezuela 
panama was suspended early in 1988 after noriega arranged the

the judge in the case of a jogger who was raped 
and nearly beaten to death in central park issued a gag order 
tuesday at a hearing on whether the teenage defendants statements 
may be used as trial evidence 
six young men are charged with the april 19 rape and attempted 
murder of a 28yearold investment banker who was taking her 
nightly jog in the park she suffered severe brain damage and still 
has partial amnesia but is undergoing rehabilitation and has 
offered to testify 
at the request of the prosecution state supreme justice thomas 
galligan ordered lawyers in the case not to divulge any material 
brought out at the hearing that prosecutors intend to use as 
evidence 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer complaining about 
leaks to the news media told galligan the material contained the 
names of juveniles and other witnesses she plans to call as well 
as other information which could compromise the investigation if 
revealed 
a seventh teen is charged with attacking two male joggers and 
robbing them he is not charged with rape 
an eighth youth jermaine robinson 15 has pleaded guilty to 
robbery in connection with attacks on the male runners and is 
expected to testify against the others in exchange for a oneyear 
sentence and youthful offender status 
the pretrial hearing is on whether to suppress written and 
videotaped statements to police in which most of the youths 
implicate their codefendants 
the defense lawyers say the statements were taken illegally from 
children under duress and should be thrown out peter rivera 
lawyer for defendant raymond santana said his client was 
browbeaten for 10 hours before he was allowed to see his parents 
then he was told he would be allowed to go if he confessed the 
lawyer said 
colin moore lawyer for kharey wise 17 said police kept his 
client away from parents counsel and food for hours before 
extracting a statement 
outside the courtroom rivera said that if galligan bars the 
youths statements to police his client will go free 
the videotaped statements are the whole case rivera said 
without them they have no case i feel pretty confident that if 
the law is followed the statements will not be admitted 
if galligan admits the statements as evidence some of the 
youths may have to get separate trials partly because their 
interests are antagonistic

candidates for new schoolbased councils that 
will give parents unprecedented power to shape public education 
rang doorbells and passed out leaflets tuesday in a lastminute 
effort to get voters to the polls 
elections on wednesday at the citys 469 elementary schools and 
thursday at the 71 public high schools will determine council 
members whose sweeping authority will include hiring and firing 
principals developing schoolimprovement plans and spending money 
each council will include six parents two teachers and two 
community residents without schoolchildren school staffs will 
elect teacher members the 11th member of each council will be the 
principal of the school or schools the council oversees 
community activists and others who spent weeks trying to 
mobilize residents to participate in the 590 councils persuaded 
17256 candidates to run for nearly 5000 unpaid council spots 
the activists predicted a 50 percent turnout for the elections 
among parents with children in the schools urging voters without 
children to participate as well in one of the most radical reforms 
in bigcity education this century 
the basic message is that the city cant survive with the 
quality of schools that we have said donald moore executive 
director of designs for change an education research and advisory 
group that helped shape an education reform package 
the local councils are a key element of the reform plan 
approved by the illinois legislature last year 
the reform effort is aimed at lowering the citys estimated 40 
percent dropout rate improving dismal test scores weeding out 
unmotivated educators and eliminating other problems that have 
given chicago public schools a reputation as the nations worst 
the bad education system is really crippling the city whether 
you have kids in school or not its important to vote moore 
said tuesday 
any city resident older than 18 is eligible to vote in the 
elections 
i know that the system will work if we have parent 
participation said reaver barlowebell a parent candidate at 
her 15yearold daughters high school and a community candidate at 
an elementary school 
mary guytonsmith is seeking a spot as a community 
representative on the council at her alma mater farragut high 
school 
i graduated from there in 1965 and they were educating the 
children then id like to see it go back to what it once was 
she said 
each council is to hold its first meeting within seven days of 
the election said volunteer dalila wong at the council hotline 
telephone number the councils are required to meet at least once a 
month

the punch lines were missing when the nations top 
cartoonists gathered tuesday but the message was clear people 
who dont know how to read dont get the point 
the cartoonists left the captions off a series of special 
drawings to show how a person who cant read sees the comics said 
mort walker author of beetle bailey and an organizer of 
cartoonists for literacy 
comics have always helped people to read a lot of people 
learned to read by reading the comics walker said and its 
our livelihood after all if people dont know how to read 
theyre not reading our comics 
walker said he got the artists together because he thought their 
work could lead more people to read and encourage others to help 
them learn thirtythree artists attended tuesdays demonstration 
and others contributed drawings 
on display at the j erik jonsson central library the citys 
main library were drawings of peanuts garfield hi and 
lois curtis and hagar the horrible 
the groups presentation in dallas represents the first 
organized effort by cartoonists to battle illiteracy cartoonists 
have previously collectively dealt with such issues as hunger and 
homelessness 
some of the cartoonists tuesday turned out special drawings 
during a program at the library about 100 people watched as the 
cartoonists took turns drawing their characters without captions 
illustrating how words make the comics funny 
the cartoons promoting literacy will be distributed to 
newspapers through syndicates 
hopefully itll dramatize the impact of the absence of the 
punch line said bob browne creator of hi and lois most 
of us who know how to read and write cant identify that readily 
with what it must be like to not have that ability 
brownes brother chris who draws hagar the horrible said 
the brutish but lovable viking is well suited as a spokesman for 
the effort 
he cant read so its a natural for this sort of thing 
chris browne said its a point of not so much humor but pathos 
in our script 
i think that for a long time now cartoonists have felt that 
its time for us since were communicators to do something he 
said it takes very little effort in life you do whatever you 
can its like baseball you bat from wherever youre standing 
and this is where we stand 
bill hinds creator of tank mcnamara sometimes pokes fun at 
illiterate or uneducated athletes in his popular strip 
the comics im sure are widely read by a lot of people who 
dont read anything else in the newspaper hinds said the 
funny pictures attract people who dont normally read and i trust 
there are a lot of sports people out there who dont do a lot of 
reading

the house approved legislation tuesday that 
would expand the power of a white house environmental agency that 
critics said was allowed to atrophy under the reagan administration 
the bill which now goes to the senate would give the council 
on environmental quality power to require federal agencies to take 
into account the effects of their actions on the world environment 
such issues as acid rain ocean pollution the ozone layer and 
global climactic change would come under the councils purview 
the voice vote in the house signaled renewed confidence 
particularly among democrats in an agency that under reagan was 
seen as having little power said rep gerry studds dmass who 
sponsored the legislation 
the council is minuscule in terms of its budget studds 
said but he said it really is the spokesman on the environment 
for the president and it sets the tone for the administration 
separate legislation which is now in a housesenate conference 
committee could potentially double the councils budget to 15 
million 
the current chairman of the council is michael deland who 
formerly headed the federal environmental protection agencys 
boston office and gained attention for his efforts to clean up 
boston harbor 
deland said of the white house council tuesday it did not 
have a high visibility for the last eight years to put it mildly 
he said the bill approved by the house could serve a valuable 
secondary purpose by sending a message to brazil that the united 
states is serious about protecting the global environment 
brazilian officials have criticized the united states for calling 
for preservation of the amazon rain forest while at the same time 
tolerating pollution within its own borders 
before we can put on our preachers garb and go to brazil or 
anywhere else in the world we need to cleanse our own hands to get 
our own house in order deland said there are a number of 
steps that could be taken here in the us to set an example to try 
and help others 
under the house bill federal agencies would have to consider 
alternatives to any action that would have a harmful effect on the 
environment of another nation or of areas such as antarctica that 
are outside the jurisdiction of any nation

a nail accidentally fired from a nail gun 
penetrated about 1 inches into a carpenters brain and nailed his 
cap to his head but the doctor who removed the nail said he 
shouldnt suffer any serious effects 
ive had worse headaches said carpenter lance grangruth 
who said the headache was the only complication he suffered 
i didnt actually feel it go in he said i heard the gun 
go off 
i tried to take my hat off and it wouldnt come off then i 
knew it had gone in 
dr william himango said he used pliers monday to remove the 
2inch nail from the frontal lobe of grangruths brain at st 
lukes hospital grangruth of barnum was kept in intensive care 
for observation 
if he were to pick a place to put a nail in he picked exactly 
the right place to put it in himango said 
the same injury to other parts of the brain could have caused 
functional damage or death himango said 
grangruth was working on a garage monday in hermantown when a 
coworker perched on a ladder lowered his arm while holding the 
guns trigger said police officer dan perich the coworker didnt 
realize grangruth was standing below 
although the coworker was holding the regular trigger a nail 
gun wont fire until a safety trigger at the muzzle also is 
depressed by pushing it against the work surface where the nail is 
wanted 
when the gun touched grangruths head it went off with 120 
pounds of air pressure driving an 8penny galvanized nail about 
an eighthinch thick through his baseball cap and into his 
forehead 
grangruth and his coworker went to a nearby house to call an 
ambulance 
perich found grangruth alert and a little pale but not bleeding 
he was sitting on the couch talking perich said he 
walked around with the nail in his head

hundreds of supporters saluted defiant peace 
activist abie nathan with balloons and a trumpet flourish tuesday 
as he became the first israeli to go to jail for meeting with plo 
chief yasser arafat 
there is no replacement for dialogue no guns or stones will 
solve the problem nathan said before stepping through an iron 
gate into eyal prison 15 miles northeast of tel aviv 
he also called on prime minister yitzhak shamir to follow his 
example and meet palestinian leaders to continue the search for 
peace 
nearby a protester hoisted a huge redandwhite balloon that 
said dialogue not bloodshed a trumpet blared and young 
supporters sang give peace a chance 
the sixmonth sentence of the 63yearold nathan comes at a time 
when israels coalition government is deeply split over whether to 
meet with a plosanctioned delegation in cairo to discuss proposals 
for bringing peace to the israelioccupied territories 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc on friday jettisoned a proposal 
for such talks by its coalition partner the labor party it said 
the plan could lead israel to indirect talks with the plo which it 
considers a terrorist group and refuses to meet 
secretary of state james a baker iii has proposed a meeting 
with the egyptian and israeli foreign ministers within two weeks to 
try to revive stalled peace efforts israeli and us officials 
said tuesday 
israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
baker had proposed the threeway meeting be held in washington to 
work on terms of palestinianisraeli talks in cairo 
meanwhile leftwing israeli legislators said they would try to 
change the 1986 antiterror amendment under which nathan was 
convicted for a september 1988 meeting with arafat in tunis 
tunisia 
the law provides for a maximum threeyear sentence for 
unauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist organization 
several israeli activists have previously been sentenced to six 
months for meeting with plo leaders in bucharest romania in 
november 1986 but they remain free awaiting rulings on appeals 
nathan sentenced on oct 3 after pleading guilty to the 
charges did not file an appeal 
before entering the minimumsecurity lockup tuesday nathan 
vowed to continue his peace efforts in an emotional speech to 700 
supporters 
they clipped my wings only for a little while but they know i 
will be back on the air said nathan 
nathan is owner of the voice of peace an unauthorized radio 
station that broadcasts to israel and neighboring arab states from 
a ship in the mediterranean sea 
the indianborn nathan became known as a crusader in 1964 when 
he made a dramatic flight to cairo to appeal for peace 
in the west bank on tuesday an arab assailant who allegedly 
collaborated with israeli authorities fatally shot a 16yearold 
palestinian in the chest in the refugee camp fawwar claiming the 
youth stoned his car arab reports said the army confirmed the 
fatality but gave no details 
elsewhere in the occupied territories soldiers shot and wounded 
11 palestinians during clashes with stonethrowing demonstrators 
the reports said 
during the 22monthold uprising against israeli occupation 587 
palestinians and 40 israelis have been killed palestinians have 
killed more than 120 suspected collaborators with the israelis 
also tuesday israel radio quoted defense minister yitzhak rabin 
as saying 40000 palestinians have been detained during the 
uprising and more than 15000 wounded

researchers seeking access to reagan 
administration computer tapes tuesday accused the white house of 
wholesale violations of federal recordkeeping laws 
lawyers for the private national security archive and 
organizations of librarians and historians made the accusation in a 
procedural motion submitted to us district judge charles richey 
richey ruled on sept 15 that private citizens have the right to 
challenge white house decisions to erase the computer tapes which 
are of the kind discovered by investigators in the irancontra 
affair 
the lawsuit was filed on the day before president reagan left 
office and sought to prevent scheduled destruction of 12 days worth 
of secret electronic memos in a system used in the executive office 
of the president 
us district judge barrington parker issued a temporary 
restraining order in january barring the destruction of the tapes 
before the case went to richey the tapes known as profs tapes 
after the initials of the computer system have since been 
preserved under court order 
in the profs system the tapes automatically record all 
communications for use in restoring the system if the computer 
crashes in the irancontra affair memoranda that had been 
erased in computer terminals of the participants were discovered by 
investigators on the backup tapes 
no one knows what is on the tapes at issue in the case before 
richey 
richeys sept 15 ruling opened the way for further proceedings 
in the case including the pretrial discovery process in which 
plaintiffs and defendants exchange information about their cases 
the plaintiffs hope to obtain more information in discovery about 
what is on the tapes 
the justice department on sept 27 asked to have the case 
transferred to the us circuit court of appeals for the district 
of columbia arguing that prolonged lower court proceedings would 
interfere with president bushs performance of his constitutional 
duties 
in their response to the justice department lawyers for the 
challengers said tuesday it is obvious that the defendants want 
to avoid responding to plaintiffs discovery which will show 
without question that there have been wholesale violations of the 
presidential records act and the other federal records laws through 
the routine destruction of information generated over the profs 
system 
this court should put an end to defendants wasteful and 
obstructionist tactics said attorneys katherine a meyer of 
public citizen litigation group and kate martin of the american 
civil liberties union 
in addition to the national security archive a washington 
nonprofit group that researches national security issues the 
plaintiffs include the american library association the american 
historical association and the center for national security studies 
of the aclu 
the justice department argued in september that the case 
presents a threat to the presidents authority 
the plaintiffs replied that the department had not spelled out 
what authority it referred to but presumably it meant the 
authority to make unilateral and unreviewable decisions to 
destroy the profs information regardless of whether it falls 
within the definition of presidential records that congress has 
mandated must be preserved for the benefit of future generations

nearly onethird of the nations homeless 
people are impaired by alcohol or drug dependency and about one in 
five suffer severe mental illness according to a survey of both 
public and private relief agencies 
the survey which estimated the overall homeless population at 
up to 2 million an 18 percent increase since 1987 also 
indicated that from 28000 to 32000 homeless people have aids or 
diseases such as aids related complex moreover the aids group is 
likely to increase by 87 percent in just the next year it said 
the report was issued late tuesday by the partnership for the 
homeless inc of new york city the nations largest private 
service organization for the homeless and was based on 
questionnaires circulated to more than 500 public and private 
agencies in 46 citie and localities 
the survey was released three days after upwards of 100000 
people demonstrated in washington in behalf of the homeless as well 
as all americans yearning for more affordable housing the 
partnership proposed a national agenda for dealing with the 
issue including these steps 
an increase in the minimum wage now 335 per hour to 485 
over the next three years 
modest increases graduated for family size in the earned 
income tax credit for the working poor 
uniform minimum amounts for welfare benefits which now vary 
greatly from state to state beginning at onehalf the poverty 
level in 1990 and rising to at least the poverty level four years 
later 
coupled with other steps including a 680 million increase in 
direct housing assistance the partnership said the plan would 
necessitate a 28 billion boost in 1990 over current government 
spending 
this is a watershed opportunity to begin a new decade with a 
comprehensive attack on all the root causes of homelessness said 
partnership president peter p smith the american people have 
made it clear that they want some swift and effective action taken 
to address a problem that has become a national disgrace 
the new york city group which has conducted similar surveys 
since homelessness began to surge early in the decade said the 
latest results found little or no increase in the number of 
homeless families reversing a fouryear trend the family portion 
of the homeless population has steadied at 31 percent the survey 
said 
the survey found shortages of emergency shelter for the homeless 
in all 46 localities and virtually all reported turned homeless 
people away from shelters and other relief services overall it 
said the emergency needs of 37 percent of the homeless go unmet 
the report said 21 percent of the homeless are impaired by 
mental illness which afflicts mostly single men 25 percent and 
single women 28 percent about 11 percent of homeless youth are 
mentally impaired it said 
drug and alcohol dependency afflicts 31 percent of the homeless 
including 17 percent of those in the family group it said 
the report said less than 6 percent are homeless by choice down 
from 73 percent in the 1987 survey 
the survey reported the biggest increases in the numbers of 
homeless in everett wash 70 percent salt lake city 67 percent 
newark nj 60 percent and wichita kan 50 percent no city 
reported a decrease and only in corpus christi texas seattle and 
wilmington del were no increases reported 
it said also there were increases in the hidden homeless 
families doubled or tripled up with other families in substandard 
housing in all but one city st paul minn

former communist party leader luis 
corvalan on tuesday returned from 13 years of exile in the soviet 
union and immediately declared support for the oppositions 
presidential candidate 
the endorsement however could prove an embarrassment for the 
candidate patricio aylwin his main opponent has been accused 
aylwin of forging an alliance with the extreme left 
upon arrival at santiagos international airport corvalan 73 
said he would participate actively in the campaign for december 
elections 
more than 200 communist activists waved party banners cheered 
and tossed red carnations at corvalan 
he told reporters i come prepared to participate in all the 
upcoming battles the first and the principal one being the 
election 
i will do what i can for the victory of the sole opposition 
candidate patricio aylwin he said 
however corvalans return was seen a potential setback for 
aylwin a centrist christian democrat backed by 17 parties 
his leading opponent hernan buchi a former finance minister 
for the military government has repeatedly accused aylwin of ties 
to the extreme left 
aylwin was nominated by a coalition with parties ranging from 
the centerright to socialists that defeated president augusto 
pinochet in an october 1988 referendum at that time voters 
rejected a proposal that pinochet remain the countrys leader until 
1997 forcing him to call the national elections scheduled for dec 
14 
the promoscow communist party was excluded from the opposition 
coalition largely because of its ties with urban guerrilla 
organizations it nonetheless has called on its ranks to support 
aylwin 
right now there has to be just one united front to give a 
decisive blow to the dictatorship and move forward with the full 
democratization of the country corvalan declared at the airport 
a former senator corvalan was the communist partys 
secretarygeneral for more than 30 years until early this year 
when a party congress decided to replace him with volodia 
teitelboim 
he was a close ally of former president salvador allende a 
marxist whose elected government fell when pinochet seized power in 
a 1973 coup corvalan was immediately arrested and imprisoned with 
many other leftists 
in 1976 he was freed and expelled to moscow in exchange for the 
release of soviet dissident vladimir bukovsky 
corvalan was officially exiled until sept 1 1988 when the 
government lifted bans on the return of political enemies

arab mediators urged members of 
lebanons parliament tuesday to speed up talks aimed at ending 
their nations 14yearold civil war but a conference source said 
talks just ran in vicious circles 
he quoted a member of the threeman arab league mediating 
committee as telling the 63 deputies 
you have often said you would solve your countrys problems in 
10 hours if left alone with no external forces meddling but we see 
you have spent 10 days here without achieving results 
the source spoke on condition of anonymity and would not say 
which mediator made the comment the three are foreign ministers 
prince saud alfaisal of saudi arabia ahmed ghozali of algeria and 
abdullatif alfilali of morocco 
mediators held separate meetings with groups of legislators 
trying to gain agreement on a proposed reconciliation charter 
talks began after a ceasefire took hold in beirut on sept 22 
that ended six months of artillery duels between gen michel aouns 
christian forces and an alliance of syria and moslems militias the 
shelling killed more than 900 people 
in beirut on tuesday snipers exchanged gunfire along the 
lebanese capitals dividing green line and the first battle 
fatality was reported since the truce took effect first lt 
abdulrahman aslan a shiite moslem was killed and three soldiers 
were wounded in a clash between moslem troops and christian army 
units 
an 18member task force in taif is formulating a draft for 
political reforms 
deputies were reported to be moving slowly toward a peace plan 
after hardline christians conceded that immediate syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon would allow militias to take control of 
moslem regions 
the presence of syrias 40000 troops in lebanon is the main 
issue that has threatened to undermine the talks 
the arab committee proposes a phased syrian withdrawal from the 
beirut area to be completed in two years a total pullout would 
depend on israels ending its occupation of a security zone in 
south lebanon and conclusion of a syrianlebanese security pact 
the moslems and their syrian backers have said damascus should 
withdraw its troops only after a political settlement of the civil 
war has been achieved 
before the christians agree to political reforms they want 
guarantees of a syrian pullout within six months 
acknowledgement by christian legislators that a quick syrian 
withdrawal could spur more turmoil raised speculation that a 
compromise was in the works later however sharp differences on 
the syrian role were renewed and it was as if the deputies were 
back at the starting point one source said 
another said they keep moving in vicious circles going back 
on what they had indicated they will approve 
syrian troops have been in lebanon since 1976 under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate aoun says syria violated its mandate 
by backing the moslems in the civil war 
moslems say they now make up 55 percent of lebanons population 
and want more political power than was accorded them in the 
unwritten national covenant going back to independence from france 
in 1943 when christians were in the majority 
in nicosia cyprus state prosecutor rallis gavrielides said in 
court tuesday that six lebanese men being tried for illegal arms 
possession there all confessed they went to cyprus from lebanon 
last may to assassinate aoun 
under cyprus law arms possession carries a maximum sentence of 
life imprisonment plotting to kill the charge that was dropped 
is punishable by a lesser maximum of 14 years imprisonment 
gavrielides said the accused confessed they intended to shoot 
down aouns helicopter aoun was to pass through cyprus en route to 
morocco to attend an arab summit meeting on lebanon but canceled 
the trip

defense secretary dick cheney complained 
tuesday that interference by members of congress undermined the 
ability of the bush administration to handle last weeks panamanian 
crisis 
its really not their bailiwick cheney said in an interview 
with the associated press 
he contended the lawmakers cannot contribute anything in a 
positive nature while the crisis is still being managed 
we had situations here where members of congress were 
literally calling executive branch agencies downtown or even 
people in panama as these events unfolded demanding information 
that creates all kinds of problems cheney said 
cheney who served more than 10 years in the house before 
becoming defense secretary this year declined to name any names 
the secretarys remarks came in the wake of a barrage of 
criticism from capitol hill about the way bush administration 
officials dealt with last weeks abortive coup against the 
panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
cheney argued that administration and military officials were 
forced to answer the congressional queries even though they were 
trying to do their jobs in a crisis environment 
the defense secretary said a second problem was created when 
lawmakers got information under these circumstances it usually 
tends to be just a small piece of the total picture and public 
statements based on that information sometimes were found later to 
be inaccurate 
not only will lawmakers make potentially embarrassing 
mistakes cheney contended they certainly complicate our lives 
when they run out and make public pronoucements in front of the 
press knowing only half of what there is to know 
cheney cited as a case in point the assertion that noriega was 
offered to us officials 
sen jesse helms rnc repeatedly has contended that was the 
case although cheney and other administration officials say 
theyve found no evidence that such an offer was ever made 
the president is the commanderinchief hes the one who has 
to manage a crisis you cannot have every member of congress 
involved cheney said 
the secretary said that while members of congress have 
legitimate oversight roles they ought to refrain from trying to 
intrude in the process while it is still unfolding 
on budget issues cheney said he would recommend to president 
bush a veto of the defense authorization bill if funds for 
strategic programs such as the b2 stealth bomber and the strategic 
defense initiative are inadequate and congress has added too much 
money for weapons he has proposed for cancellation 
in response to calls from republican lawmakers that the 
administration take a stand on final budget total for sdi cheney 
said the pentagon was seeking the 45 billion approved in the 
senate version of the defense authorization bill but acknowledging 
the realities of current senate egotiations with the house which 
approved 31 billion he said its not a matter of our 
dictating a particular number and saying this is absolutely got to 
be it 
questioned about congressional warnings that a fleet of 132 b2 
bombers at an eventual cost of 70 billion is impossible in the 
current fiscal climate cheney retorted that if congress accepted 
his budget there would be no problem in finding the money 
we showed them how to do it he said referring to the 
budget he proposed in may that included cancellation of the marine 
corps v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft and the navys f14d tomcat 
jetfighter weapons that congress wants to keep alive

leaders of a political movement in the southern 
republic of azerbaijan suspended on tuesday a rail strike that 
choked off supplies of fuel food and housing supplies to 
neighboring armenia a member said 
we decided in a directive to open the railroad to armenia as 
of 2200 10 pm said ingilap aslanov a member of the 
grassroots peoples front and of the groups strike committee in 
a telephone interview from the azerbaijani capital baku 
he said the strike was suspended until oct 23 to give soviet 
legislators in moscow a chance to respond to azerbaijans demands 
to remove special kremlin administration of the nagornokarabakh 
area the source of a bloody ethnic dispute between azerbaijanis 
and armenians 
soviet troops moved into the caucasus republics last week to 
break the blockade that has been strangling armenia and the 
disputed territory of nagornokarabakh about 400 trains with 
60000 cars were reported idled 
official news media said tuesday that in the previous 24 hours 
authorities managed to push 1748 carloads of supplies through to 
armenia 
but deputy premier lev voronin told the supreme soviet 
legislature that did not include oil products a fuel shortage has 
stranded ambulances and halted harvesting in armenias fields 
reports said freight arriving in armenia under military guard 
was damaged 
aslanov said the azerbaijan peoples front wanted the issue of 
nagornokarabakh taken up by the presidium of the supreme soviet 
the countrys highestranking executive body but settled for 
demanding that the supreme soviet legislature review the question 
if it does not do so by oct 23 the peoples front will call a 
general strike that once again will include the railroads he said 
the peoples front leadership made the decision after thousands 
of people gathered sunday on the main square of baku he said 
the peoples front says the rail strike started sept 4 but 
armenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through azerbaijan 
dried up almost three months ago 
president mikhail s gorbachev opening the fall session of the 
supreme soviet on sept 25 called for firm steps to break the 
transportation deadlock 
after hearing tuesday from voronin the supreme soviet once 
again called on armenia and azerbaijan to end their dispute 
voronin said blownup bridges and continuing strafing of 
trains still makes transport difficult in armenia and azerbaijan 
armenians and azerbaijanis have engaged in ethnic violence for 
19 months largely over nagornokarabakh armenians want control of 
the area a section of azerbaijan where most inhabitants are 
armenian azerbaijan wants to retain control and seeks an end to 
the special administration from moscow that was imposed in january 
in an effort to calm the situation 
the communist party newspaper pravda said tuesday that 
factorybuilt temporary houses for victims of last decembers 
armenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal broken glass 
and crushed window frames during transit 
prefurnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction project 
arrived with ovens sinks pipes and beds ruined the newspaper 
said 
they simply cannot be restored pravda said 
tass said it is proving particularly hard to restore transport 
of supplies in nagornokarabakh the regions of martuninski and 
gadrutski have been cut off since a bridge was blown up saturday

secretary of state james a baker iii has 
proposed a meeting with the egyptian and israeli foreign ministers 
in the next two weeks to try to revive stalled peace efforts 
israeli and us officials said tuesday 
the israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
baker had proposed a fivepoint plan they said that according to 
the plan the threeway meeting would be held in washington and the 
participants would try to work out the terms of palestinianisraeli 
talks in cairo 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
confirmed that baker in recent telephone discussions with the 
israeli and egyptian foreign ministers outlined the framework 
for getting to a dialogue and suggested a meeting in washington 
she said the two governments had not yet responded to the idea 
of a meeting 
the secretary is working with the government of israel and the 
government of egypt trying to produce a framework that would meet 
israels and egypts basic concerns about beginning a dialogue 
between israelis and palestinians ms tutwiler said 
the israeli officials said bakers proposal focuses on working 
out an agenda for the talks in cairo and reaching agreement on the 
difficult issue of who will represent the palestinians 
the us initiative came after prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc voted down a proposal in the inner cabinet on 
friday to accept an egyptian call for talks with palestinians in 
cairo 
palestinians have criticized the decision saying israel is 
blocking the peace process 
baker first outlined his ideas to foreign minister moshe arens 
and egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid in telephone calls 
beginning friday after which they were presented in writing by 
us ambassador william brown the israeli officials said 
as part of the consultations on the baker proposal israels 
ambassador in cairo shimon shamir met with abdelmeguid tuesday 
and then flew to israel to consult with arens 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu speaking on israel 
television said shamir and arens were taking this proposal 
seriously but would not automatically accept bakers ideas or 
even his invitation for talks in washington 
we dont have to agree to everything just for the sake of 
agreement he said 
dan naveh an adviser to foreign minister moshe arens told the 
associated press there could be an opening for holding such 
talks in washington but said no formal invitation had been offered 
or decision made 
another government official said israel accepted the idea of 
talks with palestinians but wanted the right to veto proposed 
palestinian negotiators he said the problem with egypts proposal 
had been its indirect effort to involve the palestine liberation 
organization 
we cant sit for dialogue with a delegation that gets its 
authority from the plo or is part of the plo said the official 
israel officially views the plo as a terrorist organization and 
refuses to deal with it 
the government official also said israel would not agree to an 
openended agenda which was demanded by the palestinians he said 
talks should be limited to implementing israels plan set forth in 
may to hold elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in cairo a foreign ministry source said egypt is studying 
bakers proposal he spoke on condition of anonymity and did not 
elaborate 
earlier tuesday 30 rightwing members of the 120seat knesset 
israels parliament warned shamir they opposed talks with 
palestinians in cairo and would oppose him in parliament if he went 
forward with that plan 
they expressed fears that the baker proposal like the egyptian 
plan before it would drag israel into indirect talks with the plo 
michael eytan a likud member described the baker proposal on 
israel radio as a new initiative to bring the plo into the game 
energy minister moshe shahal of the leftleaning labor party 
said his party would accept the us proposal and warned that the 
ruling coalition could dissolve if the idea was rejected 
if bakers proposal is rejected by likud i think the basis 
for this government will not exist he said without it there 
is no justification to go on with a deadlocked government

the presidents of peru colombia and bolivia 
where the illegal cocaine trade has its roots invited president 
bush on tuesday to attend a drug summit within 90 days he accepted 
immediately 
in a brief communique at the end of a fivehour meeting on a 
common antidrug strategy the leaders said european leaders also 
should take part in the summit to be held in latin america they 
pledged to continue allout war on drug trafficking 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
president will go he said 90 days was within the time frame we 
have been considering its reasonable 
in their communique presidents alan garcia of peru virgilio 
barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of bolivia said both the 
production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed 
the statement appeared to reflect latin american concern over 
bushs emphasis on police and military actions against the trade 
garcia barco and paz suggested details of the summit be worked 
out at a meeting nov 20 in santa cruz bolivia of lowerlevel 
officials 
fitzwater said the united states had no objection to 
participation by europeans and security concerns would not stand in 
the way of a summit of a planning meeting nov 20 he said im 
sure thats fine with us 
garcia has been promoting inclusion of european nations as 
active participants in a war against the cocaine traffic if the 
united states is successful in slowing the flow of cocaine over its 
borders he says smugglers will shift their focus to europe 
the peruvian president read the communique to hundreds of 
reporters gathered in ica for the closeddoor summit but did not 
answer questions 
a battalion of 300 soldiers guarded the las dunas hotel site of 
the meeting and 3000 plainclothes policemen circulated in this 
desert city of 350000 people 185 miles southeast of lima 
heavy security was ordered in case of attacks by the shining 
path a maoist guerrilla group that has fought peruvian governments 
since 1980 and works with traffickers in perus upper huallaga 
valley source of more than 60 percent of the worlds coca leaf 
the raw material for cocaine 
a bomb exploded before dawn tuesday in trujillo a northern city 
where five latin american foreign ministers were meeting to prepare 
the agenda for a summit of the group of eight countries that begins 
wednesday in ica 
it went off at the offices of a public housing agency damaging 
the building but causing no injuries police said no group claimed 
responsibility 
ica suffered two brief blackouts tuesday morning but officials 
said technical problems caused them not sabotage 
peru colombia and bolivia have said militarystyle repression 
of the drug trade should be accompanied by more us economic aid 
to provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds 
of thousands of peasants who grow coca 
barco began a crackdown on colombian cocaine barons aug 19 and 
has received 65 million worth of us military aid to help in the 
effort 
garcia has been especially vocal on what he considers the 
limitations of the bush plan which includes 261 million for the 
three countries mainly in the form of weapons 
if perus huallaga valley produces 60 percent of the coca 
leaf how is it possible the peruvian government is assigned 60 
million when 8 billion is to be spent on the fight within the 
united states he asked foreign reporters last week this 
doesnt seem serious to me 
peru and bolivia produce more than 90 percent of the worlds 
coca colombian drug cartels turn semirefined coca paste from the 
two countries into pure cocaine and smuggle it to the united states 
and europe 
hundreds of thousands of peasants in peru and bolivia live by 
growing coca officials of both countries say there is little hope 
of eradicating the crop unless the growers have another way of 
making a living 
colombia says it needs stable world prices for coffee its main 
legal export otherwise the colombians say the cocainedependent 
economy could collapse if the war against drug trafficking was 
successful 
its not a problem of donating some helicopters sometimes 
very old helicopters or donating rifles or bullets garcia said 
it would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed market 
for the products that could substitute for coca 
peru has an added worry because of support the shining path has 
among the peasants who grow coca the rebels protect the peasants 
against a usfinanced coca eradication program in return 
collecting a tax of 10 to 15 percent of their earnings 
peruvian officials fear shining path ranks will expand swiftly 
if the government succeeds in reducing the cocaine trade without 
providing alternate sources of income to peasants 
we have a double problem in the huallaga valley coca 
cultivation and subversion garcia said unless coca 
substitution is gradual all we will acheive is to make poor 
peasants even poorer and push them into the arms of the subversive 
movement

some of the military forces involved in the 
failed coup attempt in panama have been flown by the united states 
to miami and invited to seek political asylum the bush 
administration said tuesday 
the state department said 42 panamanians had been admitted on 
humanitarian grounds white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the group included coup members and their families 
the panamanians had reason to believe the noriega regime would 
seek them out for persecution either because of alleged 
involvement in the oct 3 coup attempt or because of their family 
relationship with the alleged coup plotters the state department 
said 
the group is believed to include adela bonilla giroldi widow of 
the coup leader maj moises giroldi she was accompanied by 
members of her family 
capt javier licona believed to be the highestranking coup 
participant to escape capture also was reported in the united 
states 
fitzwater refused to identify any of the refugees saying the 
publishing of their pictures might result in their deaths 
the immigration and naturalization service will interview the 
panamanians on friday said ins spokesman verne jervis i assume 
some will ask for asylum while others may cite some other legal 
basis for remaining in this country he said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
panamanians are being received by the us catholic conference 
which provides assistance to refugees and people given asylum us 
officials in miami are debriefing them 
mark franken of the us catholic conference said from new york 
that his group assured the panamanians that their whereabouts would 
not be divulged 
those that have relatives somewhere in the united states we 
will try to reunite them he said those that dont we will 
try to find resettlement sites around the country these people 
came in virtually with what they have on their backs 
meanwhile the pentagon said there had been dissension and 
confusion among the coup leaders and an argument about what to do 
with panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said it was clear that giroldi 
had no intention ever of turning noriega over to the united 
states 
however williams said an unnamed officer taking part in the 
coup insisted that noriega be given to the united states and argued 
with giroldi 
williams said the officer eventually gave up the dispute and 
left the military headquarters because he feared that noriega had 
or would become aware of his opinions 
williams said the officer was among those who met later with 
us maj gen marc cisneros second in command of us forces in 
the area 
later the pentagon issued a statement saying that there was no 
mention to gen cisneros that there had been any internal debate 
among the coup plotters 
the spokesman said it isnt clear to what extent those claiming 
to have held noriega for several hours really had him under their 
control 
you have someone who was one of the coup plotters saying 
well we ought to turn noriega over to the united states he 
doesnt prevail and he leaves and he communicates to the united 
states that the people holding gen noriega still have no 
intention of turning him over to the united states williams said 
there was never a request for us to come and get him they 
never offered him to us 
fitzwater acknowledged that he had erred last week by saying 
us troops were deployed in panama at two key points merely to 
safeguard americans and to protect the panama canal 
in fact the united states had been asked by the rebels to 
station the forces to block reinforcements for noriega 
fitzwater said he had not been aware of the facts when he made 
his original statement fitzwater also had said the united states 
had only thirdparty contact with the rebels before the coup when 
in fact us officials were in touch directly with giroldi 
fitzwater said he didnt know if president bush had been aware 
of the direct discussion with giroldi 
nevertheless fitzwater defended the administrations handling 
of the matter and the decision not to provide us military force 
to the rebels 
amid charges that the administration was operating in a void 
fitzwater said bush had plenty of information he made the 
decision that he thought was best and the decision we still think 
is right we dont have any questioning about the correctness of 
that decision 
fitzwater seemed to back away from administration complaints 
about congressional interference in foreign affairs particularly 
in panama 
we dont have any specific complaints he said 
fitzwater also said the united states had no plan for additional 
economic sanctions against panama 
meanwhile it was announced in panama that john bushnell a 
30year foreign service veteran would replace john maisto as 
charge daffaires the acting head of the us embassy 
bushnell has served in argentina colombia switzerland and in 
the dominican republic during the dispatch of us troops there in 
1965 
ambassador arthur davis was ordered home in may

some opposition politicians on tuesday 
predicted political instability as a result of compromises made at 
a historic communist congress that dissolved the old party and 
formed a new socialist group 
the fourday congress that ended monday overwhelmingly approved 
a new party line calling for a constitutional state based on a 
multiparty system where the source of the power is the will of the 
people expressed in free elections 
it adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a 
break with the leninist mold but still unclear is whether the new 
party will divest itself of all remnants of communist rule and how 
fast 
the congress elected rezsoe nyers formerly communist party 
chairman as president of the new party it named a 25member 
presidium where reformers are in the majority 
imre pozsgay a key reformer on the presidium had complaints 
about the new party hungarian radio said tuesday it quoted him as 
saying in an interview with a finnish newspaper that too many 
differences among the reformers exist 
the opposition initially reacted to the new party with 
skepticism and some people privately said they were not impressed 
by the change because economic problems persist 
speaking at a rally of about 600 people tuesday nyers 
acknowledged that the new party had image problems some still 
feel that the communists are incapable of democratization he 
conceded 
he told reporters later that major changes are required for 
the party to win the peoples trust 
in his speech nyers said three issues divided the party party 
chapters at the workplace the workers militia and the assets of 
the disbanded party 
radical reformers demand ending party representation at the 
workplace and abolishing the workers militia an armed unit of the 
old party now likely to come under army control 
nyers said some delegates to the congress felt the new party 
should not accept the assets of the old but he said that would 
have made the new party poorer than the hungarian democratic 
forum the largest independent opposition party 
zoltan biro of the democratic forum expressed skepticism about 
the political changes 
i do not consider fortunate the agreement between the various 
forces although i am glad that the left wing of the party which 
does not wish to accept democracy cannot feel at home in this 
successor party biro told the mai nap newspaper 
he was apparently referring to the congress decision to reject 
radical reformers demands that diehard marxists be shut out of the 
party 
the best solution would have been a clear split with the left 
wing of the party going off on its own biro was quoted as 
saying judging by the composition of the presidium such a split 
should not be ruled out 
we suspect that no essential change occurred at the party 
congress said tibor vidos of the opposition free democrats 
despite the role of the platforms the real decisions were 
made in camera by the platform leaders we fear that this party 
will remain a source of instability in the country 
zoltan rockenbauer a leader of the league of young democrats 
said he believed unity was achieved at the congress through 
compromise on the part of radical reformers and could lead to the 
new partys loss of credibility in the public view 
a budapest taxi driver said they can talk till they drop all 
i know is that i work 14 hours a day to feed my two kids 
political observers here agree effective dismantling of 
communist control is a longterm task 
to achieve credibility before elections to be held by next june 
the new party will have to relinquish its hold on the media 
dissolve the workers militia surrender its privileges and 
dissolve its chapters at the workplace 
it will have to open its books turn its assets over to the 
government and have them shared at least in part by the new 
political parties 
the ferenc muennich society a hardline communist group said 
it will discuss its future wednesday 
on monday the marxist unity platform another conservative 
group said the old communist party remained functional and urged 
true communists not to join the new one

zulu chief mangosuthu buthelezi a 
leading south african moderate told members of the governing 
conservative party on tuesday he backs britains stand against 
tough economic sanctions to end apartheid 
leaders of the roman catholic and anglican churches in liverpool 
called for stronger economic pressure on south africa however at 
a separate meeting with delegates to the partys annual fourday 
conference in this seaside resort 200 miles northwest of london 
buthelezi praised prime minister margaret thatchers position on 
south africa which supports mild sanctions he said tough 
sanctions would not help end apartheid the government policy of 
racial separation 
political propaganda has attempted to establish the myth that 
black south africans are prosanctions and support the politics of 
violent confrontation inside the country he said nothing 
could be further from the truth 
buthelezi said money from the european economic community was 
being used to support those who favor of violence in south africa 
he told britain to stand firm against such support of 
revolutionary violence 
catholic archbishop derek worlock and anglican bishop david 
sheppard who recently returned from south africa said at the 
separate meeting that britain is seen as south africas closest 
ally and should step up pressure on its government 
the churchmen spoke for the southern africa coalition made up 
of 80 groups campaigning for fundamental change in britains policy 
toward south africa 
the bishops said in a joint statement this is clearly not the 
moment to consider any easing of existing pressures 
instead we are persuaded that further selective effective 
and targeted measures chosen in the diplomatic political and 
economic fields should be applied progressively we desire most 
urgently to see an end to the evils of apartheid

soviet space officials said tuesday that the delay 
in the launch of a module for the space station mir was prompted by 
worries about its guidance and docking system 
the official news agency tass quoted chief cosmonaut vladimir 
solovev as saying the module which had been scheduled for launch 
in midseptember will instead blast off nov 28 
two modules are to be flown to mir and tass did not say which 
one was affected by the delay 
one module was to carry quail eggs to be hatched in an 
experiment on weightlessness as well as a space motorcycle to 
be used in short trips between objects in space 
the second module includes a telescopic camera for studying the 
stars and equipment to grow vegetables and crystals for electronics 
solovev told tass that some elements of the modules guidance 
and docking system have proved unreliable in ground tests he said 
scientists decided to delay the launch even though the system has 
worked in the past 
the mir station was unmanned for more than four months earlier 
this year to cut down on costs and give scientists a chance to 
prepare the modules cosmonauts alexander s viktorenko and 
alexander a serebrov blasted off sept 5 for a sixmonth mission 
aboard mir 
in the past year the soviet space program has also struggled 
with other problems including the loss of two expensive 
international mars probes

jan timman of the netherlands on tuesday agreed to 
a draw with jon speelman of england after 53 moves in the sixth 
round of their world chess championship candidates semifinal and 
retained a onepoint lead 
with two games remaining timman leads 3525 a win scores 1 
point and a draw 5 
for speelman time is beginning to run out said leontxo 
garcia a spanish chess commentator 
following a blunder on the 17th move speelman playing white 
struggled a pawn down in an endgame for the rest of the game 
in the other semifinal former world champion anatoly karpov 
took a surprise timeout against fellow soviet artur yusupov to 
postpone their fifth game until thursday 
karpov is leading 2515 after four games but he has been off 
form throughout the contest his only victory came in the third 
game when the heavily outranked yusupov blundered horribly in a 
favorable position 
following yusupovs timeout on sunday the two soviets will have 
had a fourday break before resuming the second half of their duel 
the winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world champion 
garri kasparov for his title in a 24game match beginning in 
october 1990 the winning semifinalists will face off in the 
candidates final next march 
the most dramatic moment tuesday came when speelman pondered 
over his 17th move after 21 minutes speelmans move let the 
dutchman win a pawn with a simple trick 
jon sees 12move tactics in positions like this whats he 
doing falling for a twomover said jon tisdall an international 
master who acts as speelmans chief second 
he wouldnt fall for this trick in a blitz game he said 
following a series of exchanges timman emerged a pawn ahead in 
an ending with rooks and pawns but he was unable to create any 
serious winning prospects 
the seventh game is scheduled for thursday with timman playing 
white 
neither player has so far used his one allocated timeout 
if either contest ends in a 44 tie two further games will be 
played followed if necessary by suddendeath tiebreakers at 
increasingly high speeds

a federal appeals court tuesday upheld the 
right of the agency for international development to deny financial 
aid to private groups supporting abortions in foreign countries 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia ruled against constitutional challenges filed 
by three family planning organizations two foreign and one based 
in the united states that had sued aid in 1985 challenging the 
policy 
the reagan administration decided in 1984 that it would no 
longer contribute to nongovernment organizations which perform or 
promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations 
in 1988 us district court judge june green ruled that the 
policy violated the constitutional right of the usbased group 
dkt memorial fund ltd to associate with the foreign organizations 
the foreign groups refused to comply with aids abortionrelated 
restrictions they are the parivar seva sanstha based in new delhi 
india and population services family planning programmes ltd of 
london 
the appeals panel reversed green in a 21 decision while 
upholding other portions of her decision favorable to aid 
aid essentially says dkt is just as free to associate with 
the foreign groups as they ever were they just cant do it on 
our money said the appeals court opinion by judge david sentelle 
the only thing that presently prevents dkt and the foreign 
groups from associating is the unwillingness or inability of 
dkt and its prospective partners to fund the project said the 
opinion 
sentelle said that if dkt and the foreign groups are willing to 
finance the project with their own money or from a source other 
than us foreign aid funds then they can undertake the project 
immediately 
the appeals court returned the case to green with instructions 
that it be dismissed 
in a dissent judge ruth ginsburg said aid has 
unconstitutionally deployed its puissant purse to restrain the 
privately funded speech and association of domestic 
nongovernmental organizations engaged in family planning work 
overseas 
aid has continued its policy while appealing greens decision

the supreme court turned away freespeech 
arguments tuesday and allowed the use of a federal racketeering law 
against 26 antiabortion protesters in philadelphia 
the court let stand a successful lawsuit against the protesters 
by the operators of an abortion clinic in that city 
similar lawsuits each invoking the racketeering influenced and 
corrupt organizations act rico have been filed against 
prolife activists in cities such as pittsburgh chicago and 
brookline mass 
using the federal law lets those who win suits collect three 
times whatever financial damages they prove a feature not 
available in many suits filed under state law in the philadelphia 
case the clinic operators were awarded about 2600 in tripled 
rico damages 
in a series of past rulings the supreme court has permitted 
broad use of the law allowing lawsuits by anyone whose property 
or business is harmed by a pattern of illegal activities 
the litigation strategy has proved troubling to some abortion 
rights advocates who fear that political protesters will be 
labeled racketeers and held financially liable for nothing more 
than expressing their views 
for example american civil liberties union lawyer antonio 
califa recently wrote the aclu believes that civil ricos 
potential for chilling first amendment rights of expression is 
enormous 
but in upholding a 108000 award against the 26 philadelphia 
protesters last march the 3rd us circuit court of appeals said 
their actions went beyond constitutional rights of speech and 
protest 
the tripled damages under rico formed only a small part of the 
total damages of the 108000 65000 went to attorneys fees and 
more than 40000 went to the clinic as nonrico damages 
the protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfully 
entered the northeast womens center in philadelphia according to 
trial testimony protesters threw medical supplies on the floor 
damaged equipment assaulted the clinics employees and harassed 
patients 
tuesdays action does not preclude the nations highest court 
from granting review in some future case in which more peaceable 
antiabortion demonstrators are sued under the racketeering law 
this is one battle in a long war said michael mcmonagle 
one of the 26 philadelphia protesters and executive director of the 
prolife coalition of southeast pennsylvania 
we intend to continue our efforts to nonviolently save 
children and mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities this 
case will not deter that one bit mcmonagle said 
edmond a tiryak the abortion clinics lawyer said the supreme 
court action shows that our society will not tolerate the use of 
fear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will on 
women seeking abortion services 
in their appeal the 26 protesters decried an unprecedented 
and dangerous expansion of the federal law primarily aimed at 
fighting organized crime they said the law was being used to 
stifle political expression 
under the 3rd circuits interpretations of rico martin 
luther king was a racketeer when he trespassed on private property 
and conspired with others in an attempt to change the business 
policies of owners of segregated lunch counters the appeal 
contended 
so too is anyone participating in a sitin against apartheid 
with the goal of changing the investment policies of a 
university the appeal said arguing that no rico violation 
should be found if no economic profit motive exists 
only justice byron r white who cited a split among federal 
appeals courts over the forprofit requirement in rico cases voted 
to study the philadelphia protesters appeal the votes of four 
justices are needed to grant such review 
in other action the court 
agreed to use a missouri case to clarify when sentencing judges 
may hand down extra prison time for habitual criminals 
said it will decide in a texas case what retroactive effect to 
give its ruling last june that allowed states to execute mentally 
retarded killers if jurors are allowed to take into account the 
defendants mental state 
agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of nine 
puerto rico men accused of robbing 72 million from a wells fargo 
depot in connecticut six years ago

a harvard university expert on 
vietnamese history said shes been offered tenure nearly two 
decades since the school made its last such appointment within the 
history department 
its a milestone and i hope its also a precedent 
associate professor huetam ho tai said in an interview friday i 
hope it will be the first of many more such promotions 
tai said she had been offered a lifetime post but the school 
administration had not completed contract negotiations with her 
harvard officials said a tenure appointment would not be announced 
until it becomes official 
the last junior professors tenured in the history department 
received their promotions in 1970 
in recent years critics have insisted the tenure system favors 
established scholars over young professors from inside harvard the 
history department in particular was at the center of controversy 
three years ago when a pair of popular american history professors 
were denied tenure 
last year the department formed a committee to improve the 
status of junior professors the committee recommended such 
measures as more internal promotions to make junior faculty feel 
more like valued members of the department 
tai 40 received her doctorate from harvard in 1977 and 
published a book in 1983 on peasant politics in vietnam a second 
book on radical politics in vietnam is scheduled for release soon 
she said 
the history department voted to tenure tai in 1987 but an 
advisory committee expressed reservations because she had not 
finished her second book 
rather than being forced to leave harvard tai said she received 
an extended contract so she could finish the manuscript 
if tai accepts the universitys offer she will be the third 
tenured woman in the history department 
tai said harvards vigorous tenure system is particularly hard 
on women since female scholars often have young children and 
family responsibilities 
women comprise about 8 percent of the tenured professors in the 
faculty of arts and sciences and 277 percent of the junior 
faculty

a federal judge tuesday night rejected a 
request to block the launch of the space shuttle atlantis and its 
nuclearpowered cargo saying this court will not substitute its 
own judgment for that of space experts 
three environmental groups had asked that the liftoff be 
scrubbed on the grounds the nuclear generators used on 22 previous 
missions posed unacceptable risks 
countdown has already begun and the government states that 
the mission is ready for launch said us district judge oliver 
gasch the court concludes that nasa has complied with 
requirements of the national environmental protection act 
after the judge ruled though the mission was postponed 
perhaps until monday because of a faulty engine control system it 
had been scheduled for launch on thursday 
the florida coalition for peace and justice and two other 
environmental groups had sought to stop the launch on grounds that 
deadly plutonium238 would spread across the skies of central 
florida in case of an accident 
it is not the function of this court to decide whether the 
governments decision to go forward with the galileo mission is a 
good one he said in a written opinion instead he said he only 
needed to rule whether the environmental impact statement filed by 
the natiional aeronautics and space administration has enough 
information to allow the agency to take a hard look at the issues 
and make a reasoned decision 
never before had a court been asked to stop a manned launch 
gasch said that granting a temporary restraining order requested 
by the three citizens groups would have a costly adverse effect on 
the public interest 164 million just to maintain the galileo 
program until the next launch opportunity in 18 months 
long delays have already raised the cost of the galileo mission 
to 15 billion 
the three groups contended nasa failed to follow environmental 
rules and should be stopped from launching atlantis because there 
is a very high probability of an accident that could spread 
deadly plutonium over central florida 
to gain momentum for its sixyear trip to jupiter the galileo 
probe will be sent looping around venus and twice around earth the 
citizens groups contend the greatest danger will be when the probe 
comes within 600 miles of earth in december 1990 and within 200 
miles two years later but nasa says the chances of an accident 
then are 5 in 10 million 
the probe will carry two electrical generators each carryign 
247 pounds of plutonium238 these generators produce electricity 
from the heat generated by the radioactivedecay of the plutonium 
an accidental plutonium release at various stages of the 
mission might cause an increase in cancer rates although it is 
disputed whether increase would be significant gasch said in his 
17page opinion nasa concludes that the residual risks 
associated with the galileo mission are two to three times less 
than many of the risks associated with everyday life 
one of the plaintiff lawyers edward lee rogers said after the 
judges ruling we thought we had a very strong case in terms of 
the violations of the national environmental policy act 
rogers attorney for the florida coalition for peace and 
justice had had argued earlier that the socalled estimates of 
risk are very tenuous themselves because they nasa dont have 
good historical data 
columbus didnt have much experience either said gasch at 
the hearing the day after the federal holiday honoring the 
discoverer of america 
he wasnt going to contaminate the world rogers countered 
the coalition which has threatened to disrupt the launch 
physically if it doesnt succeed in court claims irreparable 
harm can result if the shuttle should have a launch explosion 
similar to the one that destroyed challenger and killed its crew of 
seven in 1986 
there is great disagreement as to the likelihood of a 
plutonium release said rogers 
but steven frank a department of justice lawyer arguing the 
nasa case accused the citizens groups of waiting until the 11th 
hour before bringing their suit and sitting out the environmental 
hearings in the past few years 
some of the scientific missions planned for galileo would have 
to be scrapped with a delay of even a few days he told judge 
gasch nasa hopes to get a closeup view for the first time of two 
asteroids gaspra and ida but has said the launch must be by 
midoctober to make the rendezvous 
nasa has sent 38 of rtgs for radioisotopic thermoelectric 
generators into space on 22 missions some like galileo had 
more than one rtg 
three of the rtgs were involved in accidents but only one 
resulted in a release of plutonium by design nasa says since 
then the agency contends the rtgs have undergone a design change 
and the most comprehensive analysis ever performed shows it 
would prevent plutonium release even in an accident like that of 
challenger 
rogers argued that nasa failed to consider other times and 
launch vehicles for galileo the opportunity for a launch to 
jupiter comes again in 1991 and in 1993 nasa said it cannot get a 
singleuse titan 4 rocket from the air force for such a launch 
until 1995 and that the plaintiffs had not shown anything would be 
gained by a delay 
the citizens groups argued that two major environmental studies 
disagree on the risk involved in the galileo launch but government 
attorney frank said both reports using different approaches 
calculate very low risks 
the other two groups involved are the christic institute and the 
foundation on economic trends

nasa on tuesday night postponed the 
launch of space shuttle atlantis for several days because of a 
faulty master control system in one of the spaceships three main 
engines 
the flight had been scheduled for thursday officials said the 
launch could be rescheduled for as early as monday but they would 
not have a definite date for a day or two 
the delay was announced shortly after a federal judge in 
washington rejected a request by three antinuclear groups that the 
launch be scrubbed because atlantis will carry a plutoniumpowered 
planetary spacecraft bound for jupiter robert richie a spokesman 
for the christic institute one of the groups said the decision 
would be appealed 
launch director bob sieck said the decision to delay the launch 
came after engineers had tested the suspect master controller for 
several hours and could not learn why it had given a false signal 
during a check monday night 
sieck said the controller was being replaced and that work was 
starting immediately 
earlier officials had said that a changeout would mean a delay 
of about a week but officials said the task might be accomplished 
sooner and sieck said we expect to have a new launch date in the 
next couple of days 
the countdown which began monday was halted 
us district judge oliver gasch in washington heard 2 hours of 
arguments before issuing his ruling 
the antinuclear groups had asked that the liftoff be scrubbed 
on grounds that radioactive plutonium 238 particles would spread 
over eastcentral florida if atlantis exploded the plutonium is in 
two nuclearpowered generators that provide electricity for the 
galileo spacecraft bound for jupiter 
the court concludes that nasa has complied with requirements 
of the national environmental protection act gasch said 
never before had a court been asked to stop a space launch 
justice department attorneys representing nasa had replied that 
the 15 billion sixyear galileo mission to jupiter carried 
very low risks and that the two nuclear generators aboard the 
probe were well shielded and similar to 38 that have flown on 22 
previous space missions 
nasa test director mike leinbach reported earlier tuesday that 
during overnight testing there was an erroneous reading in a 
computeroperated controller in one of atlantis three main 
engines the device the size of a 17inch portable television 
controls all engine functions during liftoff 
subsequent tests did not reproduce the bad reading but because 
it was not thoroughly understood officials said they might have to 
replace the unit 
we have to ascertain that we completely understand the problem 
and that there is no chance it will reoccur in flight and put us 
in jeopardy said bob crippen director of the mission management 
team which gives final clearance for launch 
the controller has two main channels and it is in the backup 
channel that the problem occurred the backup b channel would not 
be used unless there was a failure in the a channel 
the worst condition is that we would shut down an engine and 
have to abort the flight and we want to make sure there is no 
probability of that crippen said 
the five astronauts who are to fly atlantis on the fiveday 
mission received briefings monday on the flight plan and status of 
the countdown 
the antinuclear groups said earlier that if they lost in court 
they would attempt other means to stop the liftoff 
were going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the 
court doesnt prevent the launch bruce gagnon coordinator of 
the florida coalition for peace and justice one of the three 
groups that filed suit said 
after hearing the judges ruling he said on our side were 
sad because the court didnt rule in our favor but on the other 
side we feel that weve succeeded in bringing the issue to the 
public that they are planning to put nuclear power in space 
were going to go with our plan to put people on the launch pad 
reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough 
we have patrols out in the area near the pad said gary 
wistrand deputy director of the space centers security office 
weve installed various types of of tactical intrusion devices 
hopefully if they try this tactic well be able to detect and 
apprehend them before they are successful in getting to the pad 
he also noted there are alligators and rattlesnakes in the 
swamps near the launch pad that could deter intruders

a panamanian newspaper executive said 
tuesday that gen manuel antonio noriega has stamped out freedom of 
the press and put panama through the darkest moment in its 
history 
liberty of expression does not exist roberto eisenmann

assembly of the inter american press association free journalism 
is incompatible with the regime of noriega the only hope of 
restoration is with the fall of noreiga

meeting in monterrey for the groups 45th general assembly the 
organizations main objective is to protect freedom of the press

estimated 25 million in damage caused by the bombing by drug 
traffickers last month 
the newspaper needs financing within the next 60 days he said

message to the colombian government asking that journalists receive 
more protection

attackers colombian traffickers have been warring with the 
government for nearly two months over a crackdown on drug lords

any plan however 
noriega began his press crackdown in february 1988 when federal 
grand juries in florida indicted him on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges he denies the charges

state lawmakers tuesday convened a 
special session on abortion that drew thousands of chanting 
demonstrators and national attention although the legislatures 
democratic leaders predicted no new restrictions 
republican gov bob martinez called the 3day session soon 
after the us supreme court in july upheld a missouri law giving 
the state more authority to regulate abortions 
martinezs proposals include banning public financing and use of 
public resources for abortions expanding regulations for abortion 
clinics requiring viability tests on the fetuses of women who are 
at least 20 weeks pregnant and requiring physicians to tell women 
seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses 
both the house and senate met for about a halfhour tuesday and 
referred numerous bills many of them abortionrelated to 
committees which began work 
in the first vote of the session the senate health and 
rehabilitative services committee rejected by a 93 vote a 
sevenday waiting period so a woman could undergo preabortion 
counseling the panel also rejected by the same margin a ban on use 
of public funds employees or facilities for abortions 
the senate health and rehabilitative services committee defeated 
the first four bills tuesday proposals which would have pushed 
viability requirements from 24 to 20 weeks ban public resources 
for abortion create a state center to promote adoption as an 
alternative to abortion and force women to wait a week and undergo 
counseling before having an abortion 
the head of the senate health care committee sen jeanne 
malchon predicted late tuesday that four other bills her panel was 
scheduled to debate wednesday will also be defeated 
the house hrs committee meanwhile heard testimony but planned 
no action until later in the week 
despite widespread criticism by democrats that the session will 
accomplish nothing and may result in unconstitutional law martinez 
repeated his view that the entire package should be considered 
having a hearing on each of these bills is important to the 
people of florida martinez said all of these i think 
deserve a good debate 
as uniformed police closely guarded the doors to the senate and 
house chambers prochoice and antiabortion demonstrators marched 
around the capitol and chanted putting forth their messages on 
their chests in their songs and in the air 
the prochoice side sang america the beautiful and had a 
bannertrailing airplane saying keep abortion legal 
antiabortion protesters wore a tshirt saying spoken as a 
former fetus im glad im here 
tallahassee police spokesman phil kiracofe said two arrests were 
made tuesday 
a 14yearold boy was charged with a misdemeanor because of a 
derogatory message on his jacket that referred to the governor and 
49yearold carl carlander a prochoice supporter was jailed on a 
charge of aggravated battery after he allegedly struck a man in the 
face with a video camera 
police raised their estimate of people who attended the 
demonstration from 8000 people to between 10000 and 11000 
people there was plenty of jeering on both sides but no other 
reports of violence 
inside senate president bob crawford and house speaker tom 
gustafson both democrats promised that both houses would give 
martinezs proposals due consideration 
there had been talk of ending the session a few minutes after it 
begins but crawford said that wouldnt happen 
i think theyll all be considered he said of the abortion 
proposals we will abide by the rules of the senate and i will 
enforce those rules fairly 
both democrats predicted no new restrictions on access to 
abortions especially since the state supreme court ruled last week 
that the states privacy law protects a womans right to an 
abortion the court knocked down as unconstitutional a 1988 
parentalconsent law for florida minors seeking abortions and 
protected womens abortion rights in the first trimester 
if the effort is simply to restrict the ability to choose an 
abortion that is not a generally wellreceived idea gustafson 
said the issue is can you really do anything in this area 
without violating privacy over and over and over again 
since his initial more sweeping proposals martinez has focused 
on enacting tougher health regulations on abortion clinics three 
south florida clinics have been closed in the last two weeks by the 
state department of health and rehabilitative services after 
inspectors found unhealthy conditions 
martinez repeated tuesday that he was not backing off but 
suggested that negotiations with legislators were focusing on the 
new clinic rules 
right now there is a lot of conversation about everything 
the governor said our staff is leading discussions weve got a 
full package out there were pushing all pieces of legislation 
gustafson and crawford said they were not convinced tougher 
abortion clinic regulations were necessary particularly since the 
state successfully closed the three clinics 
crawford said the session could wind up as soon as wednesday 
night depending on what bills emerge from comittees he said most 
legislators find the session difficult politically and morally and 
would like to finish as soon as possible 
gustafson agreed saying the sense i get from my members is 
that the sooner we can resolve the issues in front of us the 
better theyd like it

hometown support for rep barney frank has 
dwindled markedly since he admitted employing a male prostitute 
hed previously hired for sex according to a survey published 
tuesday 
of 300 registered voters polled 74 percent said they would have 
voted for frank before the disclosure of his relationship with 
stephen l gobie but 56 percent of them said they now would vote 
to return him to congress 
if congressional elections were held last week over onehalf 
of newtons voters would choose to reelect frank but his 
hometown support has slipped significantly the tab weekly 
newspaper study concluded 
franks district includes the boston suburb of newton his 
hometown 
sixteen percent of those polled oct 2 said they would not have 
voted for frank before the relationship was disclosed in august 
that number grew to 23 percent following the disclosures the 
survey said 
frank spokesman douglas cahn declined to comment tuesday on the 
survey 
of the poll participants 47 percent said they would not vote 
for frank because of his admitted poor judgment in his relationship 
with gobie 19 percent cited franks admission he hired a 
prostitute and 7 percent noted his sexual preference 
but 37 percent of those questioned said the above factors would 
not sway their votes according to the poll conducted by first

the senate democratic leader accused the white 
house tuesday of trying to scuttle congressional talks aimed at 
ending the partisan stalemate over a republicanbacked plan to cut 
the capital gains tax 
house and senate leaders of both parties met for nearly two 
hours but reached no agreement in their dispute which has delayed 
senate work on a deficitreduction bill 
unless the budgetcutting measure is passed by monday spending 
cuts in many defense and domestic programs will be automatically 
triggered by the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the bargaining which began last week resumed as congressional 
experts estimated the size of the spending cuts that would occur 
monday their nonbinding estimate 413 billion out of a 12 
trillion budget 
the sticking point in the deficitreduction talks has been gop 
efforts to have the senate vote on a plan to reduce the capital 
gains tax rate which president bush promised to fight for during 
his election campaign 
leaders of both parties have been maneuvering for parliamentary 
advantages in how that vote will occur they have been exploring 
ways to keep the capital gains cut along with other controversial 
provisions from being attached to the senates 14 billion 
deficitreduction bill which is considered mustpass legislation 
asked tuesday if the administration would accept a strippeddown 
deficitcutting measure in exchange for a separate senate vote on 
capital gains later white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we believe the capital gains provision should be a part of the 
bill 
after tuesdays meeting of congressional leaders senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said fitzwaters comments 
had complicated the talks 
it appears that the white house is intent on torpedoing this 
discussion he said 
he added the administration doesnt really care about the 
deficit 
the house last week approved its own 11 billion 
deficitreduction bill that contained a twoyear capital gains tax 
cut an extension of childcare programs a rollback of medicare 
benefits for elderly people with serious longterm diseases and 
other controversial provisions 
the house provision would make the maximum capital gains tax 
rate 196 percent for two years instead of the current maximum of 
28 percent 33 percent for some taxpayers 
democrats and republicans agree that slimming down that bill 
and figuring out a way to deal with the numerous initiatives in 
contains is such a difficult task that avoiding the grammrudman 
cuts is all but impossible 
youre not going to avoid the automatic cuts said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas i think were all pretty 
much in agreement on that 
the grammrudman cuts will be triggered monday if the projected 
deficit for the fiscal year that began oct 1 is not below 110 
billion 
the congressional budget office projected tuesday that the 
shortfall will be 1413 billion necessitating cuts of 413 
billion divided evenly between defense and domestic programs the 
office said many domestic programs would take a 107 percent cut 
and many defense programs would take a 156 percent cut some 
programs in both areas are exempt from spending reductions under 
grammrudman 
the cbo projections are merely advisory the white houses 
office of management and budget issues its binding projections 
monday they are expected to require about 16 billion in cuts 
divided equally between defense and domestic programs

mgmua communications co broke off 
its 15 billion merger agreement with qintex group on tuesday and 
said it will sue the australian media conglomerate for breach of 
contract and fraud 
mgmuas board of directors voted to cancel the buyout because 
qintex australia limited failed to deliver a 50 million letter of 
credit as required last month mgmua chairman jeffrey barbakow 
said in a telephone interview 
we have done everything we possibly could barbakow said 
we really wanted this deal and we did everything we possibly 
could to hold it together and come up with an approach that they 
could perform under and they couldnt work it out 
obviously we are looking at all our alternatives which could 
include a sale to another party barbakow said 
the film and television studio subject to an intense bidding 
war that spanned almost two years said it would bring a 50 
million lawsuit against qintex in federal court alleging breach of 
contract fraud and other damages 
qintex was to have delivered the irrevocable letter of credit 
for 50 million by sept 22 one week after qintex outbid media 
mogul rupert murdoch for mgmua by 100 million 
almost every day qintex assured us that the letter of credit 
would be immediately forthcoming we believe it is now clear that 
qintex repeatedly misled us regarding its ability to furnish the 
letter of credit barbakow said 
qintex chairman christopher c skase disputed barbakows 
allegations saying in a letter to the brisbane stock exchange 
dated oct 11 that mgmua had unlawfully terminated the agreement 
skase said in his letter that qintex had met the terms for the 
letter of credit but mgmua asked for additional letters of 
credit and substantial liquidated damages 
dan saks a spokesman retained by qintex said that skase would 
not elaborate on the remarks made in the letter qintex is an 
operator of resorts and an australian commercial tv network 
mgmuas assets include a film production and marketing company 
a domestic film distribution unit a onethird interest in a 
worldwide film distribution company an international tv 
distribution concern and mgmua home video 
the deal was valued at 15 billion including the mgmua 
junkbond debt that qintex would have assumed the total deal would 
have cost qintex 19 billion

prime minister margaret thatcher on 
tuesday welcomed the release of eight topsecurity political 
prisoners in south africa as a major step in the right 
direction 
mrs thatcher attending the first day of the annual conference 
of her governing conservative party said naturally we all hope 
that it will lead on to the release of nelson mandela and open the 
way for negotiations on a new constitution for south africa 
the announcement of the release on south africas state 
television said discussions had been held with mandela and he had 
confirmed again his own release is not now on the agenda among 
those freed was his close friend walter sisulu 77 
secretarygeneral of the anc from 194954 
it is a major step in the right direction mrs thatcher 
said 
south african president fw de klerk telephoned the prime 
minister in blackpool before the official announcment was made 
aides said 
british government sources quoted by the domestic news agency 
press association said the announcment justified mrs thatchers 
opposition to tough economic sanctions against south africa she 
has favored maintaining contact with pretoria as a means of pushing 
for negotiated reforms in south africa 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock also welcomed de 
klerks announcement if it is true this is great news and many 
will want to give tribute to walter sisulu for his strength and 
courage in all these years in prison 
surely now the unconditional release of nelson mandela and all 
other political prisoners in south africa cannot be delayed

an investigation is under way into the 
cause of a fire in an electrical transformer and generator at the 
shearon harris nuclear plant officials said tuesday 
the fire was in a structure separate from the plants reactor 
it did not involve any of the nuclear portions of the plant 
said ken clark a spokesman for the federal nuclear regulatory 
commissions regional office in atlanta 
he said a fire prevention specialist and an electrical engineer 
would work with the carolina power amp light co to try to determine 
the cause 
company officials said the fire monday night did not pose a 
threat to the public no one was injured 
since the fire was located on the steam side of the plant in 
the turbine deck and at the transformer it remained external to 
the concrete buildings which house the nuclear systems of the 
plant said rb richey nuclear project manager at no time 
was there any danger to the public 
the turbine deck is about 300 feet from the reactor building 
cpampl spokeswoman elizabeth bean said hydrogen gas leaked when 
the fire spread through lines running from one of three 
transformers to a generator she said there was a hydrogen gas 
fire but there was no explosion 
ms bean said officials dont know whether the fire started in 
the generator which uses hydrogen gas as a cooling agent or in 
the transformer 
the fire was reported about 1120 pm the fire was completely 
out and the hydrogen leak was contained by 243 am today cpampl 
officials said 
the fuquay and holly springs fire departments were called to the 
scene at the plant which is located 15 miles southwest of the 
raleigh city limits 
because of damage to equipment the plant was closed for a 
refueling outage scheduled to begin next week the company said 
refueling inspection and maintenance are expected to keep the 
plant down for eight to 10 weeks

ohio university announced tuesday it expects 
to receive a patent this week for a genetic engineering process 
that has revolutionized medical and agricultrual research 
the dna microinjection process was developed by thomas e 
wagner a molecular geneticist at the university and peter c 
hoppe a researcher at jackson laboratories at bar harbor maine 
microinjection is a microsurgical technique in which genetic 
material with a new desirable trait is injected into an embryo 
shortly after fertilizaion 
it is being used to develop genetically modified animals that 
could boost agricultural production and improve medical and 
pharmaceutical research and manufacturing 
in microinjection the developing embryo incorporates the new 
gene into its genetic makeup passing on the improved trait to 
future generations of socalled transgenic animals 
transgenic animals are emerging as a fundamental tool in 
medical and pharmaceutical research and product development 
chemical safety testing and in the improvement of the health and 
value of livestock animals said paul schmitt president of 
princeton njbased dnx inc the only business licensed by the 
univeristy to use the process 
since the patent covers a fundamental and widely used 
technology we expect to establish a broad commercial licensing 
program he said 
wagner and hoppe assigned the patent to ou and wagners 
royalties will go to the ou foundation which supports research by 
the edison animal biotechnology center in athens wagner is 
director of the center 
in 1981 wagner led a team first that used the technique to 
transfer a gene for rabbit hemoglobin the material in red blood 
cells that carries oxygen thoughout the body into a mouse embryo 
passing rabbit blood traits to the mouse 
pigs rats mice goats and other animals have since been 
altered using the technique 
wagner was first interested in the concept for boosting 
agricultural production such as by producing cows that give more 
milk or animals that are diseaseresistant 
he said there is even more potential in medical research 
including development of mice and other research animals that can 
develop human diseases such as diabetes hepatitis or acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and can be used to test medications 
sheep have been bioengineered to produce milk carrying a vital 
human blood clotting factor that hemophiliacs need wagner said 
mice have been altered to produce milk containing tpa a protein 
prescribed for heart attack victims 
the process works because it is natural for chromosomes the 
cells long strands of genes to be damaged while the cell repairs 
itself the foreign genetic material is incorporated into 
chromosomes the altered egg is then implanted into a surrogate 
mother 
ohio university said dna microinjection was the technique 
employed by harvard researcher phil leder to develop the first 
patented transgenic animal the harvard mouse 
microinjection also is used in the development of improved 
livestock much of which is done by dnx 
dnx was formed in 1984 as the edison centers privatesector 
partner to develop commercial applications of prototype organisms 
produced by ou scientists

walter sisulu and other 
african national congress leaders jailed 25 years ago with nelson 
mandela will be freed unconditionally soon but mandela will remain 
in prison president fw de klerk said tuesday 
they are among eight aging longtime prisoners de klerk said 
would be released to contribute to the spirit of reconciliation 
which is presently evident in our country 
he said mandela regarded by many black south africans as their 
leader was told of the proposed releases in advance 
murphy morobe spokesman for the banned united democratic front 
antiapartheid alliance was with mandela at his home on the victor 
verster prison farm north of cape town when the releases were 
announced on state television 
mr mandela said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonight 
after all his efforts to secure their release morobe said and 
quoted mandela as saying to south africans the people are going 
to be greatly endowed by the leadership who are coming out of 
jail 
morobe and a few other black antiapartheid leaders were at the 
mandela house including albertina sisulu wife of mandelas close 
friend and anc colleague the 77yearold sisulu a leading 
political strategist of the banned anc 
cassim saloojee a member of the group read a statement from 
mandela 71 saying my release is not an issue at this stage 
saloojee added his deepest concern is that all the other 
comrades be released 
in blackpool england prime minister margaret thatcher welcomed 
the announcement of the releases calling it a major step in the 
right direction 
the releases had been expected as ammunition for mrs thatcher 
to use at the forthcoming commonwealth summit against imposing 
further economic sanctions on south africa the summit in 
malaysia begins oct 18 
de klerk acknowledged the decision was taken against the 
background of requests and representations from various sources 
over a long period he said the views of moderate blacks 
including leaders of tribal homelands whom the african national 
congress rejects had carried special weight 
on wednesday de klerk is to meet in pretoria with three of the 
most prominent black south african clergymen anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu the rev allan boesak president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches and the rev frank chikane general 
secretary of the south african council of churches 
they have said they want to establish before the commonwealth 
conference whether de klerk is serious about dismantling 
apartheid and entering negotiations to bring about a truly 
democratic south africa 
after the release announcement was broadcast chikane said 
this was one item the greater part of the agenda has to do with 
creating a climate conducive to negotiation 
if we do not get a clear indication of what mr de klerk is 
going to do and his aim is just to release leaders to come and 
live in an apartheid society then we will continue calling for 
sanctions in this country 
chikane said he understood mandelas position that his release 
is not the critical thing his release without a package to end the 
apartheid system would be meaningless i understand him to be 
saying his release cannot be a substitute for the freedom of the 
people 
de klerk said the men would be freed as soon as the necessary 
formalities can be dealt with which can take some time a prison 
official said privately the process can take from an hour to two 
weeks 
according to the president all relevant factors were brought 
into consideration including the fact that most of these prisoners 
had already served many many years of their sentences and are 
already advanced in years a favorable climate currently exists 
in which the release can take place 
the most prominent prisoner on the list is sisulu who ran 
daytoday operations of the anc as its secretarygeneral in 
194954 when the government ordered him to resign 
he was sentenced to life in june 1964 along with mandela and 
other leaders of the ancs internal military wing for sabotage and 
plotting the overthrow of the white goverment mandela already had 
spent two years in prison 
mandelas other codefendants to be freed are ahmed kathrada 
60 andrew mlangeni 63 elias motsoaledi 65 and raymond mhlaba 
69 
wilton mkwayi 66 who briefly took command of the anc military 
wing spear of the nation after mandelas codefendants were 
arrested in july 1963 is to be released from a life term he 
received after a separate trial in 1964 
de klerks announcement also named oscar mpetha an 80yearold 
partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of his 
fiveyear prison term in the hospital and was due for release next 
year 
mpetha the countrys oldest political prisoner was the anc 
leader in cape province and during the appeal of his terrorism 
sentence in 1983 was elected a copresident of the united 
democratic front 
the judge said he did not want to send mpetha to prison but that 
the terrorism act since repealed required it 
no information was immediately available on the eighth man 
jafta masemula 
two other codefendants of mandela dennis goldberg and govan 
mbeki were freed previously 
goldberg the only white convicted in the trial was deported in 
1985 
mbeki was released two years ago in what the government said was 
a test case for the possible release of mandela he was banned from 
speaking in public talking to the press or leaving his hometown 
even though the government said his release was unconditional

nato must improve the effectiveness of its 
conventional weapons to counter the vastly superior number of 
warsaw pact troops and advances in soviet technology according to 
a janes reference book published wednesday 
editors ted hooton and ken munson of janes battlefield 
surveillance systems said the superpower agreement to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear forces in europe is a major step toward 
greater reductions in nuclear weapons by the united states and 
soviet union 
but they warned that as important as it is to the continuing 
peace process the inf carries with it some serious concerns for 
both the united states and its nato allies 
warsaw pact forces are already vastly superior numerically to 
those of nato and this advantage in numbers is further enhanced by 
the recent rapid growth in soviet technology 
the editors said in the preface that despite the new soviet 
policies of openness and economic reform the postinf climate 
must not allow complacency to override vigilance 
on the contrary the current imbalance of conventional forces 
demands nothing less of the atlantic alliance than a major 
improvement in the battle management effectiveness of its 
conventional weapons and the key to this is constant 
roundtheclock surveillance 
hooton and munson said the dangers of inefficient or inadequate 
battlefield surveillance were demonstrated all too clearly in july 
when a pilotless soviet mig fighter plane flew halfway across 
europe before crashing in belgium 
the soviets said their radar operators were distracted by a 
military flight exercise and failed to notice the plane that flew 
across poland east germany west germany the netherlands and 
belgium after the pilot ejected into the baltic sea 
not until the runaway was literally eyeballed by a 
dutchbased pair of usaf f15 pilots after a 21minute air search 
did a nato ground station become fully aware of the true 
situation the editors said 
this time the overflight was accidental but what if next 
time it is not 
they said surveillance equipment to detect thermal heat from 
soldiers and equipment even when concealed by darkness mist and 
battlefield smoke is being developed however nato has been 
unable to decide which of three such systems being developed by its 
member countries it should use they said 
the new generation of airborne battlefield surveillance radars 
will reduce the likelihood of a surprise attack on the north 
atlantic treaty organization but will not prevent it the editors 
added

environmentalists and prominent state 
democrats on tuesday proposed a sweeping environmental protection 
initiative for the 1990 state ballot 
the key goals are a phaseout of cancercausing pesticides 
reducing gases and chemicals that cause the global warming and 
protecting the coast with tough water standards and oilspill 
prevention and cleanup measures 
this is a moment in history when we are waking up to the 
reality that we are killing ourselves attorney general john van 
de kamp told a news conference to unveil the environmental 
protection initiative of 1990 
the drafting committee included members of the california league 
of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the 
sierra club the national toxics campaign and the citizens for a 
better environment 
the committee also included van de kamp who is running for 
governor assemblyman tom hayden and a representative of lt gov 
leo mccarthys office 
the point of the initiative is to end what we consider to be a 
decade of environmental neglect and begin a decade of environmental 
action through programs for preserving a clean ocean clean food 
clean atmosphere and a clean government hayden said 
the group plans to begin collecting signatures next month to get 
the issue on the ballot 
the initiative would create an elected statewide office of 
environmental advocate to make certain californias environmental 
laws are observed 
among other aspects it would create a 300 million bond program 
for acquiring ancient redwood forests and to fund reforestation 
efforts 
the initiatives advocates say it would protect the states food 
supply by phasing out cancercausing pesticides by 1996 and by 
making regulatory agencies require improved chemicals by 1997 
the initiative would protect the coastline with tough 
healthbased standards for discharge of toxic pollutants into state 
waters it would also require public sewage treatment plants to 
meet federal clean water act standards by 2000 
a 500 million fund for prevention and clean up of oil spills 
would be established and on that same front the initiative would 
create a spill prevention policy allowing drilling leases within 
the threemile state limit only in the event of a national energy 
emergency

communist officials met opposition leaders in 
dresden and talks were expected soon in leipzig in the first sign 
of a shift in the east german governments hardline stance news 
reports said tuesday 
prominent lutheran official hans otto furian meanwhile said in 
east berlin that the communist party must give up its grip on 
total power 
also in east berlin prodemocracy activists said at least 500 
protesters arrested in dresden were freed the past two days the 
activists who spoke on condition of anonymity said those freed 
were among about 1000 people arrested in dresden during 
demonstrations last week and over the weekend 
the activists did not say if any of the demonstrators faced 
charges officials in dresden have said all demonstrators not 
involved in violence will be released 
some communist party officials showed increasing signs of 
willingness tuesday to talk with prodemocracy activists but east 
german leader erich honecker reiterated his hardline position 
secretary of state james a baker iii seemed to hold out a 
carrot of us economic aid tuesday if east germany follows the 
reform path of its neighbors 
in an interview on cbs evening news baker said its time 
for perestroika reforms to come to east germany 
were prepared to assist economically improve our relations 
with those countries that do move forward toward political 
pluralism and to more of an open society from an economic 
standpoint 
we simply hope that countries like east germany will opt for 
that approach rather than moving backwards to the approach thats 
failed communist regimes in the past the approach of repression by 
force 
conflicting reports emerged as to whether the lutheran church 
had taken up a dialogue with the central government or whether the 
contacts remained on the local level 
west germanys zdf television network quoting highlevel church 
sources said talks about the unrest had begun with central 
offices in the east german government it did not elaborate 
zdf said talks between local communist leaders in leipzig and 
prodemocracy activists also are set to begin it gave no timetable 
talks between communist officials and opposition activists 
already have been held in dresden 
communist officials in dresden first met with opposition leaders 
on monday mayor wolfgang berghofer said another meeting was 
scheduled for next week 
the 77yearold honecker has given no indication he is about to 
change his hardline ways 
in a meeting monday with chinese vice prime minister yao yilin 
honecker repeated allegations that western imperialists are 
poised to threaten his country 
honecker and yao recalled the events of june in beijing when 
troops crushed a prodemocracy movement 
in this respect there is a fundamental lesson to be learned 
from the counterrevolutionary revolt in beijing and the present 
defamation campaign against the gdr east germany and other 
socialist states the east german news agency adn said 
honeckers statement appeared to signal a willingness to crush 
dissent if necessary 
manfred stolpe deputy director of the lutheran church 
federation earlier tuesday denied a west german radio report that 
said highlevel talks had been held between church leaders and 
government officials in east berlin 
but he said working groups did exist on several levels to 
discuss the current situation he did not elaborate 
christof ziemer superintendent of dresdens lutheran church 
said topics discussed were election reforms travel restrictions 
and release of those arrested during demonstrations 
the events in leipzig and dresden were the first significant 
sign of any breakthrough in the countrys hardline stance 
although east germanys state media ran lengthy commentaries 
tuesday denouncing the unrest and accusing many of the 
demonstrators of having lengthy criminal backgrounds 
hansjuergen sievers a lutheran pastor in leipzig said in a 
west german radio interview he believed the decision by leipzig 
officials to work for dialogue was certainly not made alone 
without discussions with others 
but he said it was too soon to tell whether that might signal a 
change in east berlins course 
several of leipzigs most influential party leaders signed a 
declaration monday saying they would work for a dialogue between 
the government and opposition groups 
among the signatories was roland woetzel leipzigs communist 
party chief and his top ideologue jochen pommert 
no violence was reported monday night in leipzig when 70000 
demonstrators paraded in the countrys largest single prodemocracy 
protest since a 1953 uprising was put down by soviet troops 
east germanys ruling politburo also met tuesday for the first 
time since the demonstrations 
it was the first politburo meeting since soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev urged honecker to undertake reforms during a 
lengthy meeting in east berlin on saturday 
at least 50000 east germans have fled west in recent months

because lawyers george and walter stenhach hid 
a broken rifle butt in a 1982 murder case lawyers in pennsylvania 
today have clearer guidelines for handling evidence that could hurt 
their clients 
for their trouble the stenhach brothers have tarnished 
reputations and a wounded law practice to rehabilitate but at 
least they dont have criminal records or jail sentences 
hopefully this is the end of it and we can get on with our 
lives george stenhach said 
the men from coudersport spoke at a news conference monday 
after the deadline had passed for the state supreme court to try to 
have them disbarred 
the stenhachs were defending john l buchanan against a 
firstdegree murder charge in 1982 when buchanan told them where to 
find the butt of the murder weapon 
if we turned it over to prosecutors we would be accused of 
ineffective counsel said george stenhach 38 if we did not 
it would be withholding evidence 
the brothers decided that turning over the evidence would 
violate their clients rights they kept the butt in their office 
the judge in buchanans trial learned about the rifle butt and 
ordered the stenhachs to surrender it which they did it was never 
entered as evidence buchanan was convicted of thirddegree murder 
the stenhachs were arrested 10 months later on charges of 
conspiracy tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution they 
were convicted and each was sentenced to a year of probation and 
fined 750 
pennsylvania superior court overturned the conviction in 1986 
saying the laws were too vague the court ruled however that 
defense attorneys must turn over physical evidence although 
prosecutors may not tell the jury where the evidence came from 
the state supreme court let the superior court ruling stand in 
1987 but in april 1987 the courts office of disciplinary counsel 
charged the men with seven violations of the professional code 
the disciplinary board dismissed the charges saying the 
stenhachs have suffered greatly yet with humble dignity we 
believe that they have acted in a manner entirely consistent with 
the highest standards of this profession 
throughout the whole thing my brother and i always had a gut 
feeling a good feeling we would be exonerated and that kind of 
helped us through said walter stenhach 33 
the dilemma the stenhachs faced is one lawyers think about a 
lot during law school and hope they never confront during 
practice said john dingess one of 10 lawyers from kirkpatrick amp 
lockhart in pittsburgh who donated their time to help the stenhachs 
the pennsylvania trial lawyers association the national 
association of criminal defense and the public defenders 
association of pennsylvania also supported the brothers

consumers may soon be paying higher prices for 
prescription drugs as more generic products are pulled from the 
market and costconscious buyers are left with fewer lowpriced 
options some industry observers say 
dozens of drugs have been recalled in the wake of allegations 
and admissions of cheating on safety tests required for food and 
drug administration approval 
the scandal is likely to produce a shakeout in the industry and 
result in more rigorous safety testing required for approval some 
generic drug makers and industry observers say this will force 
prices up but others say the industry will remain competitive 
enough to withstand the financial pressures without price increases 
a more immediate concern for consumers however is the possible 
effect of the recalls

its said that those who forget history are 
doomed to watch it on cable 
that isnt all bad and if youre up for a firstrate new 
history series tune in tonight to the debut of the road to war 
airing on the a amp e network this eightpart series a 
coproduction of a amp e and the bbc studies the origins of world 
war ii in the two decades that preceded hitlers invasion of poland 
in september 50 years ago 
what makes this road different from previous series about 
the war such as the excellent the world at war is that it 
examines the social and political events leading to world war ii in 
each major nation involved 
each nation gets a separate onehour look in order of 
appearance they are germany great britain japan the united 
states france italy and the soviet union with the final chapter 
entitled global war a summingup of sorts 
another plus as tonights opening germany shows the bbc 
team has gone to extraordinary lengths not only to unearth rarely 
seen newsreel and nazi propaganda footage but also appears to have 
struck new crisplooking prints of them and restored as much as 
possible their sound tracks 
all that gives a strange sense of immediacy when woven in with 
interviews of nowelderly germans military men diplomats 
civilians even a benignlooking former nazi storm trooper 
they witnessed hitlers rise to power many met him and in the 
case of one socialist member of the reichstag in 193233 went to a 
concentration camp because of him 
older viewers will find familiar the documentarys retelling of 
how germanys sufferings after its defeat in world war i led to the 
political triumphs of hitler and the nazi party then his 
persecution and murder of jews his lust for domination and war 
but regardless of the age of the viewer this chapter is still a 
valuable history lesson one made striking with nazi newsreel 
footage that includes 
shots of storm troopers at night burning what a nazi narrator 
calls ungerman and immoral books 
pictures of fleeing refugees identified as as ethnic 
germans being driven out of poland the scenes staged to 
incite german support of hitlers propaganda his claim that he had 
cause to invade poland 
theres brilliant editing too in germany particularly 
thenandnow scenes of vienna the contrasts are made as one hears 
old recordings of hitlers frenzied speeches after his 
unification of austria and germany in 1938 
its also very very eerie and unsettling to hear a 
welldressed obviously educated now60ish witness of those times 
in vienna explain in her soft matteroffact way why she and 
others there supported hitler 
one reason she says without apparent shame or regret was all 
about the jews it gets worse as she continues saying 
first of all it was their behavior and their appearance

harry hopkins had something in common with 
samuel pierce both were in charge of programs to help the poor 
both got a lot of criticism for the way they ran them 
in the case of pierce former president reagans housing 
secretary critics have said the poor people werent getting the 
help 
in the case of hopkins the trouble was that they were getting 
the help and critics of franklin d roosevelts new deal didnt 
like it 
pierces troubles have been in the news recently as 
congressional investigators probe his administration of the 
department of housing and urban developments housing subsidy 
programs 
the story of hopkins the social worker who headed the works 
progress administration and later became roosevelts most trusted 
wartime aide is told tonight in a 90minute pbs documentary airing 
at 9 pm edt 
hopkins kept the wpa free of scandal and became one of the 
most vilified public servants in modern times narrator walter 
cronkite says 
businessmen said the new deal agency undermined the morals of 
workers and created boondoggles for the lazy hopkins said if he 
deserved any criticism it was that i didnt do enough when i had 
the chance to help the down and out 
arthur schlesinger jr pulitzer prizewinning historian of the 
new deal who appears on the program said in an interview there 
is a difference between having idealists in government and having 
people who are there either to promote their own careers or to make 
contacts so they can make more money after their government 
service idealists have many faults but they rarely steal 
among others who reminisce about hopkins on the documentary is 
the late rep claude pepper dfla a young senator in new deal 
days who talked to the filmmakers in one of his last interviews 
you never heard of harry hopkins trying to make any money 
getting roosevelt to approve some project over there getting some 
fellow a contract he wouldnt any more have asked for that than he 
would have asked for the lord to come down in person says pepper 
pamela harriman who met hopkins when she was winston 
churchills daughterinlaw and hopkins came on a wartime mission 
to britain is interviewed on the program for which two harriman 
family foundations provided part of the funding 
she said the foundations took no part in planning for the 
documentary but were called on for help when the producers needed 
to send three staff members to moscow to obtain soviet newsreel 
footage 
hopkins had a brusque manner and a talent for getting at the 
heart of things which prompted churchill to tell him jocularly 
that the british crown was going to name him lord root of the 
matter 
the producers originally chose this for the title but dropped 
it in favor of the more downtoearth harry hopkins at fdrs 
side 
you know people today the young dont know who harry 
hopkins is mrs harriman said and he really was a giant that 
tiny little man and he did a yeomans job

at a time when many corporations have loaded up 
on highcost debt in the form of junk bonds eight large concerns 
stand out from the field over the past decade they have had 
almost no longterm debt 
all are successful companies too and their success is 
recognized in the stock market by relatively high priceearnings 
ratios that is investors are willing to pay a premium for shares 
of these debtfree companies 
the significance of low corporate debt rises whenever the 
economy is thought to be facing a period of falling corporate 
profits because lowdebt companies generally are in a better 
position to survive 
in contrast highdebt companies especially those loaded with 
costly junk bonds face greater dangers during a time of lower 
corporate profits because it takes cash to paythose highinterest 
charges 
the eight companies crown cork amp seal dun amp bradstreet 
international flavors amp fragrances longs drug stores tambrands 
tootsie roll industries weis markets and william wrigley jr are 
the stars of a larger grouping 
these eight emerged from a study by mathematician gerald 
perritt who screened new york stock exchange listings on one 
variable companies whose longterm debt over the past 10 years 
averaged less than 5 percent of capital 
he found only 34 
perritt is head of investment information services a 
chicagobased company he founded after leaving college teaching it 
publishes an array of investment information including blue chip 
values a 17issuesayear newsletter 
it was for that publication obviously conservative that he 
sought the lowestdebt companies perritt is hardly a purist he 
recognizes that in expanding economies a company leveraged with 
debt might do very well but among other things he also wanted to 
show that companies can succeed with low debt 
the 34 companies have done very well and investors know it the 
proof of which is their willingness to pay a premium the average 
priceearnings ratio of the group is 17 times the previous years 
earnings well above the norm 
not only is that multiple higher than most big board stocks it 
also applies to companies that must pay very low dividends about 
2 percent on average late this year simply because they finance 
growth from within 
to his surprise perritt found five of the 34 the gap longs 
h amp r block melville weis are retailers a category that 
usually borrows heavily to finance real estate investments or 
longterm leases 
while perritt demonstrates that growth can be obtained without 
large debt there is little mystery to the popularity of junk 
bonds temporary though that popularity might be 
corporate borrowers like the quick capital that junk bonds 
raise buyers like the high returns and judging from the tax 
code uncle sam likes to lend his support to the idea 
the latters involvement in junk bonds is seldom noted but it 
is there allowing issuers to lower their costs through tax 
deductions for a company paying 40 percent combined statefederal 
tax a 13 percent cost becomes 78 percent 
that latter rate observes analyst john p dessauer of orleans 
mass is low enough to make debt bearable for the corporation and 
from the investor viewpoint the 13 percent rate is higher than the 
longterm return on stocks 
but still as perritt points out debt isnt a necessity for 
corporate performance or for investor performance either

lane smith almost didnt play richard m 
nixon in the abc movie the final days because through a 
misunderstanding he was asked to read for another role 
smith portrays the former president during the watergate crisis 
that led to his resignation on aug 9 1974 the threehour movie 
based on the book by bob woodward and carl bernstein will be 
telecast sunday oct 29 
executive producer stu samuels had him in mind for the lead 
role but the casting people mistakenly had him read for the role 
of j fred buzhardt special white house counsel for watergate 
they had looked at everybody for nixon said smith they 
looked at albert finney in london everybody then susie glicksman 
a casting director who was not involved sent my picture to stu and 
said heres your richard nixon but they had me read for the 
buzhardt role which richard kiley got 
it got down to the wire and they still hadnt found nixon 
then stu learned id read for buzhardt they called me on a friday 
to read on a monday i looked all over town for video tapes on 
nixon and finally found one i knew they didnt want an imitation 
of nixon but i knew i had to have the physical aspects 
smith stood up he pulled his pants up above his waist i 
noticed that he wore his pants high he said his jacket was 
always buttoned and he often had his hand on his hip 
he demonstrated and suddenly he was transformed into nixon 
once i had that i was able to get on to the emotions he said 
i saw him as a man who had suffered a great loss i wasnt 
concerned about the politics what concerned me was how did he get 
through this dilemma i tried to make him a human being 
two clues gave smith the key to the man he said 
i looked at his resignation speech and thought it was a little 
bizarre woodward gave me the clue hed talked to people who had 
been there richard nixon had finally taken off his mask and showed 
himself as vulnerable and suffering and when he got down on his 
knees with henry kissinger i think that process restored him to 
his roots so having those clues i was able to portray him 
nixon has protested the portrayals in the final days which 
tells of his last days in the white house in a letter to sponsor 
atampt his spokesman john h taylor said the company should change 
its slogan to reach out and smear someone 
besides challenging the accuracy of the final days nixon 
objects strongly to being depicted by an actor without his 
consent said his lawyer william e griffin in a letter to 
capital citiesabc inc 
abc said it was satisified with the fairness and accuracy of the 
program 
in addition to smith and kiley it stars david ogden stiers as 
gen alexander haig ed flanders as nixon aide leonard garment 
theodore bikel as henry kissinger graham beckel as press secretary 
ron ziegler james b sikking as elliot richardson diana bellamy 
as nixon secretary rose mary woods and susan brown as first lady 
pat nixon hugh whitemore wrote the screenplay and richard pearce 
directed 
smith has just completed a role in abcs challenger a movie 
about the explosion of the space shuttle on jan 28 1986 he plays 
larry malloy chief engineer at the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala 
his latest feature film night games starring roy scheider 
opened recently american built a movie about motorcycle 
racing filmed in france will be released soon 
at the time the final days is telecast smith will be in 
thailand for air america a movie about the airline operated in 
southeast asia during the vietnam war by the central intelligence 
agency it stars mel gibson 
i play a us senator whos sort of an innocent abroad he 
said hes heard a rumor that a vietnamese general is involved in 
the drug trade but the american government is ignoring it to keep 
his army in the field hes also heard that a few americans are 
lining their pockets 
smith a native of memphis tenn studied at carnegie tech and 
the actors studio in new york on the stage he played mcmurphy in 
one flew over the cuckoos nest and won the drama desk award 
for his role in glengarry glen ross 
hes been in such movies as weeds places in the heart 
frances prince of the city honeysuckle rose and 
red dawn and such tv movies and miniseries as gideons 
trumpet something about amelia chiefs if tomorrow 
comes and dress gray 
his only series was cbs kay obrien in 1986 in which he 
played a surgeon

one day on the set of on golden pond jane 
fonda was standing in front of a mirror combing her hair when she 
felt costar katharine hepburn reach over and tug at her cheek 
how do you feel about this hepburn asked peering from 
behind this is your box that carries your persona what do you 
want this to be 
image is what hepburn meant what kind of a person does a face 
suggest 
fonda didnt have a ready answer even though neutrality is 
impossible for this selfstyled crusader 
at age 51 shes still in training memoirs dont interest her 
a house in montana will have to wait theres too much to do her 
outlook remains shaped by possibility and by now her public knows 
that its never too late for a new jane fonda 
it literally doesnt occur to people maybe even women more 
than men because women dont have as many options for change that 
you can become very very different and its never too late and it 
can be very profound she said in a recent interview 
you just have to stay open to life and not allow yourself to 
settle in anything can happen i feel fortunate that i have this 
characteristic of openness 
people say have you fulfilled your dreams i never had any 
dreams my projections of the future were maybe id od at 25 and 
end up lonely and selfdestructive i never had dreams i never 
expected anything so everything was a surprise to me 
relaxed jane 
she sat on a sofa at the regency hotel in jeans and blue flannel 
shirt occasionally resting her black booted feet on a coffee table 
and nibbling chocolates 
she talked about open participation and activism somethings 
wrong well lets form a committee organize protest do 
something get involved it starts with each of us we can change 
the world 
no wonder a special screening in new york of her new film old 
gringo was a benefit for the robert f kennedy memorial 
foundation fonda and costar gregory peck were there so were the 
kennedys ethel caroline john jr kathleen robert jr 
wealth glamour power and idealism fonda and the kennedys 
feasts for the tabloids 
the latest the drug bust of vanessa vadim the daughter fonda 
had with her first husband french filmmaker roger vadim the 
21yearold brown university student was arrested oct 6 with a 
friend thomas feegal outside a reputed drug den in lower 
manhattan at her arraignment she pleaded innocent to obstructing 
governmental administration loitering for the purpose of 
purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct 
patrician jane 
she was born in new york in 1937 the daughter of a highly 
respected film actor henry and his wife frances seymour brokaw 
fonda a descendant of lady jane seymour a wife of king henry 
viii she committed suicide in 1953 although her children were told 
it was a heart attack jane learned the truth a year later from a 
gossip magazine 
her brother peter also went into movies leaving a testament 
to the 1960s with the haunting easy rider 
fonda went to private schools on both coasts and wound up 
partying at vassar college unsure of a career in acting her 
confidence grew in the late 50s under the guidance of method 
acting guru lee strasberg 
thespian jane 
there was broadway and hollywood in the early 60s she had 
great reviews in bad shows but her career was going nowhere she 
escaped to france and made vadims la ronde in 1964 a 
vulgarization of the 1950 classic about love and sex starring 
simone signoret she and vadim married a year later 
sex kitten jane 
she was dubbed la bb americaine by the french press a 
reference to brigitte bardot who was once married to vadim among 
fondas roles over the next three years a woman who seduces her 
stepson la curee a business executives mistress any 
wednesday and an erotic space maiden who takes on a sex robot 
and wins barbarella 
hanoi jane 
in 1968 around the time of barbarella students in paris 
nearly toppled the government and opposition at home to the 
vietnam war overflowed at first she defended the united states 
involvement but soon changed her mind completely 
ive taken many paths ive broken all the rules fonda 
said i left hollywood and went to europe at the time when i 
shouldnt have i came back not as an actress but as an 
activist 
nearly 20 years later her celebrated visit to north vietnam 
when she appeared on radio hanoi and begged american soldiers to 
stop the bombings still isnt completely forgotten 
last year a waterbury conn vet tried to circulate bumper 
stickers that read im not fonda hanoi jane while the 
actress was there filming stanley and iris with robert de niro 
fonda apologized last year on national television to veterans 
who may have been hurt by her actions but her effort at 
reconciliation was rejected by both the american legion and the 
veterans of foreign wars 
and her name is still invoked by conservatives in political 
campaigns do you want jane fonda running this country 
im a good scapegoat she said i can be painted in to an 
image which causes a lot of hostility i may not be that person but 
thats irrelevant 
tom and jane 
she divorced vadim in 1970 and met activist tom hayden a 
founding member of the radical students for a democratic society 
she married him three years later and they had a son troy now 
16 they separated earlier this year 
dick and jane 
fun with dick and jane was a 1976 satire with george segal 
but in real life dick and jane meant president nixon and the 
enemies list a collection of actors authors and activists 
deemed subversive by the administration 
fonda was in the elite wiretapping harassment of friends a 
failed drug bust and agents reporting on vanessas kindergarten 
class 
sometimes i literally feel like somebody who walks through a 
field of gunfire and doesnt get hit fonda said i dont shy 
away from ambushes and i dont particularly have any armor i just 
go through it and the shots miss me its not like im protecting 
myself i just live my life and i dont think about it

forbes magazine says its estimates of the net 
worth of what it considers the 400 wealthiest americans are 
deliberately conservative 
the magazine said its basic principle in compiling the estimates 
was to think in terms of how much a prudent buyer might be 
willing to pay for a persons net assets 
among the factors used in compiling the estimates which forbes 
released monday 
blocks of publicly traded stock were priced at the market close 
sept 8 
privately held companies were valued according to estimated 
revenues and earnings and to prevailing priceearnings ratios for 
publicly traded companies in similar businesses 
if earnings and cash flow werent known the magazine said it 
adopted valuations typically used in particular industries 
for trusts and other interfamily arrangements forbes said it 
worked on a casebycase basis applying common sense 
the fortunes of the very rich are of course very difficult 
to calculate forbes said often it isnt even clear exactly 
who owns a great fortune

americans paid an unusual amount of 
attention to alaska in the past year tuning in to news ranging 
from the rescue of stranded whales to the cleanup of the nations 
largest oil spill 
heidi kuhn wants to hold their attention 
the newswomanentrepreneur owns alaskan newslink a juneaubased 
television news service that has provided reports from alaska to 
stations across the country since last spring 
kuhn came up with the idea almost by accident 
last april she met a california news producer and reporter in 
juneau they noted how much interest there was in alaska news how 
expensive it was to send a tv crew here and how there was no 
inexpensive alternative 
you hear of businesses getting started on cocktail napkins 
thats what happened she said 
just days before kuhn had been on vacation out of state when 
the exxon oil spill occurred she recalled how a television news 
report made it sound as if alaskas entire coastline was threatened 
by oil 
i dont think they had any perception of how large the state 
of alaska was she said i realized there was a need in the 
market for immediate news access to alaska from the perspective of 
an alaskan reporter 
her first national story had nothing to do with oil it was a 
feature on juneaus fourth of july celebration 
what makes fireworks in juneau so special in july it doesnt 
get dark enough to have a good fireworks show until about midnight 
so the city holds its annual display in the early morning of july 4 
i picked up the phone and called good morning america she 
recalled i told them i can offer you video of the first town in 
the country where fireworks have occurred 
they bought it and abc viewers across the country had fireworks 
with their breakfast later that day juneaus fireworks were shown 
on the cbs evening news the alaskan newslink had hit the big 
time 
last month when exxon completed its summer oilspill cleanup 
kuhn was one of a small army of stringers as freelance 
reporters and photographers are known covering the story in 
valdez she found a freelance tv cameraman and did reports for 
several bigcity stations including ones in new york and san 
francisco paying a local public tv station to use their satellite 
uplink equipment 
i produced wrote and edited my own piece i did my own 
reporting and a personalized standup she said i also got in 
the truck and drove up to the top of the hill and satellited it all 
off 
in two days she earned about 2000 profit 
not bad for a 31yearold mother of three whose previous news 
experience was a stint as a weather reporter at juneaus kjudtv 
her extensive business and marketing experience has helped she 
formerly was west coast sales manager for american express co 
and she said shes learned a lot about news by seeking advice from 
professionals 
one of those professionals is in her own family her uncle john 
b sias is president of the abc television network group part of 
capital citiesabc inc 
in addition to selling her own reports kuhn has a contract with 
gov steve cowpers office to notify news directors in the lower 48 
when the states news reports are available via satellite cowpers 
office has been providing free video reports on spillrelated 
topics and part of kuhns job is to report how theyve been used 
kuhn said she worked especially hard to make her spill reports 
balanced because of her business relationship with the state 
news directors are very smart she said the first time 
you put together a public relations type of video your business is 
over 
rick little managing editor of kpixtv in san francisco said 
kuhn has become a great resource to his station for video that 
otherwise would be unavailable 
shes found a real need and shes filled it he said

jaguar plc said it is in talks with general motors 
corp about a possible cooperative operating agreement setting the 
stage for a tugofwar between gm and ford motor co over the 
british automaker 
jaguar said monday that gm was considering buying a minority 
stake in jaguar as part of such an arrangement 
ford announced three weeks ago that it wanted to buy up to 15 
percent of jaguar and left open the option of making a full bid 
for the british company 
ford said the approach was friendly but jaguar called fords 
interest unwelcome the moneylosing luxury car company maintained 
that it wanted to remain independent but it also said it might be 
interested in building ties with a major auto company it was 
widely believed to be holding talks with general motors 
jaguars brief statement said jaguar and general motors corp 
are in discussions concerning the possibility of the two companies 
entering into certain manufacturing marketing and other commercial 
joint venture arrangements as part of these arrangements general 
motors is considering taking a minority interest in jaguar 
jaguar declined to elaborate 
gm spokesman john pekarek in detroit confirmed his company has 
had discussions with jaguar for several months regarding possible 
joint manufacturing marketing and other ventures 
in this connection gm is discussing the possibility of 
acquiring a minority interest in jaguar to assist jaguar in 
remaining an independent british owned manufacturer pekarek 
said refusing to elaborate 
from dearborn mich ford said the announcement by jaguar and 
gm does not affect our view in any way about the advantages in 
a fordjaguar association 
we believe ford is uniquely qualified to assist jaguar because 
of our long commitment to he uk our british research research and 
development capability our sourcing to uk suppliers and our 
continuing investment in our uk manufacturing facilities the 
ford statement said 
the announcement came after londons stock exchange closed 
jaguar finished at 685 pence or 1082 a share down 46 pence or 
73 cents on active trading of 10 million shares 
dealers said the price fell on speculation that an alliance with 
gm could discourage a hostile bid by ford or any other auto maker 
for jaguar 
trading has been very heavy since friday when ford which 
previously owned 1 percent of jaguar received us regulatory 
clearance to buy up to 15 percent ford received early clearance 
from the federal trade commission which must approve major share 
acquisitions under the hartscottrodino act 
jaguars rules of association prohibit any shareholder from 
taking more than a 15 percent stake before the end of 1990 and give 
the british government a golden share with which it may block 
any bid for the formerly stateowned company these conditions were 
imposed when the british government privatized jaguar in 1984 
analysts have said jaguar needs to link up with a major car 
company to provide the economies of scale necessary to remain 
competitive

after eight months of a bitter walkout by 
eastern airlines pilots a nationwide vote of pilots to be counted 
today could be the proverbial last straw for the striking eastern 
fliers 
the air line pilots association ballot on continuing strike 
payments to the eastern pilots if negative would withdraw 
financial support from the beleaguered strikers and force them to 
pull down their picket lines after numerous setbacks in their fight 
against eastern boss frank lorenzo 
at the same time an upcoming senate vote on eastern could turn 
into a disappointment for the striking pilots machinists and 
flight attendants if their request for a blueribbon investigative 
commission is defeated 
the 40000 or so alpa members were balloted last month on 
whether they wished to keep paying about 3 percent of their wages 
to their colleagues at miamibased eastern which is trying to 
emerge from bankruptcy protection as a smaller carrier 
pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits to 
eastern pilots averaging about 2400 a month per flier since the 
walkout began march 4 but the number of pilots paying those 
special assessments has decreased as the strike has worn on some 
have unilaterally decided to stop paying according to alpa which 
represents pilots at nearly all the nations major carriers 
if the alpa vote is negative it would be in everyones best 
interest to go about their business and relocate to other 
airlines said louis a marckesano an airline analyst at the 
philadelphia brokerage janney montgomery scott inc 
i think the strike basically is over he said monday 
neither side has won theyve just sort of mortally wounded each 
other 
the mailin ballots which had to be postmarked by midnight 
sept 25 are expected to be counted today and the results 
announced wednesday 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the airline would have 
no comment on the matter until after the vote had been announced 
and alpa spokesman john mazor in washington was unavailable monday 
because of the columbus day holiday 
the striking eastern pilots whose ranks have dwindled to around 
2400 from 3600 when the walkout began remained defiant 
i feel confident said skip copeland head of the eastern 
pilots union asked what might occur if the majority of alpa 
members vote to stop the payments he replied it cant happen i 
cant even give that any consideration if lorenzo were able 
to beat us theres no telling whos next 
copeland said the vote likely wont be 100 percent in favor of 
sustaining the benefits but he insisted that the majority will opt 
to do so if the pilots abandoned their eastern colleagues alpas 
bargaining position with all the carriers would be weakened he 
warned 
the pilot leader cited strong support especially from 
counterparts at megacarriers united airlines and northwest 
airlines 
also this week the senate could vote on a bill supported by 
the pilots to set up a commission that would investigate the 
eastern dispute in a cloture vote last week the senate decided to 
cut off debate on the bill 
but the white house and the transportation department have 
lobbied heavily against the bill and president bush is likely to 
veto it in that case if congress couldnt muster the votes to 
override his veto the pilots could suffer another crushing blow to 
morale 
it would be terrible copeland said were looking to the 
congress for a fair shake 
in the latest setback for the pilots eastern received 
permission last week from a federal bankruptcy judge to dip into 
75 million held in escrow and to sell a 30 million note that it 
owns 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland also postponed until 
dec 15 a hearing on the unions request for a special trustee to 
be appointed to run eastern in place of current management which 
is controlled by parent texas air corp consideration of the 
eastern unions request has been put off several times by the judge

now that central bank intervention appears to have tapered off 
except for the bank of england which is trying to shore up the 
sagging pound 
theres no intervention going on at the moment and it doesnt 
look like theres anything else on the horizon that could bring the 
dollar down said jensuwe fischer senior trader at

the sixth day of the boeing machinists strike 
brought good news for pickets with some 25 other unions pledging 
support for the walkout against the aerospace giant 
the union had asked for help in case the strike proves to be a 
long one said tom baker president of the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers local 751 
the unions that voted support represent 125000 workers in 
washington state 
no contract talks were scheduled as of monday there have been 
no talks since 57800 machinists walked out oct 4 after rejecting 
a threeyear boeing co contract offer 
the strike affects boeing plants in the seattle area at 
wichita kan portland ore and several other sites 
this was a real upbeat meeting baker said after mondays 
onehour session with other labor leaders people are willing to 
do whatever they can do monetarily theyre going to form a 
hardship fund that type of thing 
other unions expressed solid support said larry kenney 
president of the washington state labor council 
boeing officials meanwhile said they didnt know how to 
interpret the meeting and union support 
i still dont think anybody at this point knows how long a 
strike it will be said paul binder boeing spokesman 
another boeing official harold carr said the company was 
waiting for more specific demands from the union before resuming 
negotiations 
baker angrily dismissed carrs statement 
the boeing people who were involved in the negotiations 
know what our position is theyre just playing games he said 
federal mediator doug hammond left a recording on his answering 
machine saying no talks were scheduled 
in an everett hotel north of here recruiters from intertec 
aviation co of phoenix ariz said they were deluged by hundreds 
of people answering their newspaper ad for aircraft maintenance 
workers the visit was planned before the strike 
when i got to town sunday night there were already 15 people 
waiting at the hotel recruiter jack tubert said monday we 
hired 10 of the 15 people 
tubert said many boeing machinists were among those interested 
he said some of the people intermec has hired on this trip were 
strikers but he did not have exact figures 
the twoyearold company is looking for licensed supervisors and 
mechanics and must hire 100 people before jan 1 he said 
in wichita where boeing military airplanes is headquartered 
hundreds of strikers rallied early monday before joining pickets 
for a peaceful show of force at plant gates there was a similar 
rally in everett where the 747s and 767s are built 
boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began a 747 to 
malaysia airlines and a 757 to ansett worldwide an australian 
leasing company which will pass the plane on to air belgium 
before the strike boeing committed to delivering 57 jetliners 
before the end of the year five consecutive years of record orders 
have given the company a backlog that stretches into the late 1990s 
that backlog and the steady stream of overtime that workers have 
been asked to work were behind machinists demand for better wages 
and less overtime 
boeings offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 
3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 annual bonuses of 8 percent 
of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990 
mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours per 
quarter to 160 hours and the costofliving formula improved to 
account for virtually all inflation 
boeing said a machinist in a middle skill grade such as an 
engine mechanic could see pay go from 34389 this year to 43138 
in 1992 counting seniority and costofliving increases but 
excluding 13000 in bonuses and any overtime 
workers who have seen bonuses but no increases in their base 
wage for six years say thats not enough 
boeing earned 356 million on sales of 907 billion for the 
first half of 1989 and had profits of 614 million on sales of 
1696 billion in 1988 
the strike is the machinists first against boeing since 1977 
when there was a 45day walkout 
industry analysts say what happens at boeing will affect labor 
talks at other aerospace plants talks have been extended in a 
machinists contract that expired sunday with lockheed corp in 
marietta ga 
the unions contract with mcdonnell douglas boeings only us 
competitor for jetliners expires oct 22

only a few airlines serving kansas city 
international airport have stepped in to provide service lost when 
braniff inc cut its routes drastically almost two weeks ago 
america west has added flights to las vegas nev and omaha 
neb while usair has added two flights to indianapolis 
all three cities were eliminated from braniffs schedule when 
the bankrupt carrier decided to operate with 20 departures out of 
the kansas city airport braniff had 93 flights in and out of 
kansas city international daily before filing for bankruptcy 
protection 
but airlines have not responded by adding flights to boston 
philadelphia and at least 15 other cities where braniff had direct 
service 
braniff filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy laws in orlando fla less than two weeks 
ago about 2800 of the companys 4800 workers were laid off as 
part of braniffs attempt to reorganize as a small carrier 
additional cities that braniff dropped as destinations from 
kansas city include albuquerque nm atlanta cleveland denver 
detroit houston miami milwaukee minneapolisst paul oklahoma 
city san antonio texas st louis seattle tampa fla tucson 
ariz tulsa okla and wichita kan 
many of those cities have direct flights from kansas city by 
other airlines but some of the other cities can only be reached by 
changing planes 
for example there now is no direct flight out of kansas city to 
boston said kathy sudeikis executive vice president of overland 
park kan travel agency brennco travel inc 
people get used to having those direct flights she said 
it just gets to be a pain when theyre not available any more 
given that most airlines have a limited number of aircraft 
already used in other routes it appears unlikely that the other 
cities dropped by braniff will be picked up soon by another 
carrier ms sudeikis said 
william hill president of transmark travel said carriers that 
had direct flights to some of the cities eliminated by braniff had 
not experienced shortages 
the other airlines have easily absorbed the demand hill 
said noting that this is an offseason for air travel 
hill added that braniffs cutbacks had not had an impact on air 
fares either 
its probably too early for that he said 
cities to which braniff retained its service but that have been 
the targets of expansion by other carriers are los angeles and san 
francisco both usair and united airlines have added flights to 
both of those destinations since braniffs bankruptcy

british aerospace plc and thomsoncsf sa a major 
french defense equipment manufacturer said tuesday they might make 
a joint takeover bid for ferranti international signal plc a 
troubled british defense electronics concern 
in a brief announcement british aerospace and thomsoncsf 
confirmed they were talking with ferranti about a possible bid or 
other areas of cooperation 
british aerospace and thomsoncsf didnt indicate what they 
might be willing to pay for ferranti 
analysts noted that a bid wasnt likely to be made at much more 
than 70 pence or 110 a share owing to the companys difficulties 
ferranti shares were down 15 pence at 58 pence in early 
afternoon trading on londons stock exchange at that price 
ferrantis 748 million shares outstanding are worth a total of 434 
million pounds or 681 million 
ferranti has sought links with a major defense contractor 
following the discovery last month of contract fraud involving its 
us subsidiary international signal and control ltd of 
lancaster pa ferranti said the fraud would require it to write 
off 185 million pounds reducing its net asset value by almost half 
british aerospace and thomsoncsf had been rumored to be 
interested in assisting ferranti although previously both 
companies had refused comment 
ferranti chairman derek alunjones has said talks were being 
held with a number of major defense companies about a partial or 
full takeover of ferranti but he has cautioned that a decision on 
a rescue plan for ferranti was still weeks away 
british aerospace and thomsoncsf have requested that ferranti 
allow them access to information about the company 
british aerospace and thomsoncsf would be equal partners in a 
bid for ferranti though management control would lie with british 
aerospace the companies said

company has signed a letter of intent to buy the dornier deutsche 
aerospace 328 airplanes for 244 million she said the airline 
holds an option on an additional 40 planes which seat 30 people 
each 
midway started a decade ago as a discount carrier serving the 
midwest since then the airline the nations 16th largest has 
grown from three destination cities to 51 
analysts say the rapid growth of the company makes it an 
attractive takeover target 
ampcopittsburgh corp announced in august it might seek control 
of the airline the pittsburghbased engineering company has since 
increased its stake in midway to 96 percent of the carriers 
outstanding stock 
but midway officials say they see no cause for alarm 
we consider it a normal business investment and treat it 
accordingly ms allen said she said midway has not held talks 
with ampco officials 
ms allen said the airline will begin receiving the new aircraft 
in april 1993 
the planes will replace the dornier 228 a 19seat airplane 
midway now uses on its feeder routes into midway airport the 
airlines base of operations on chicagos southwest side 
during the transition to the new aircraft midway will lease 12 
embraer 120 aircraft from dornier ms allen said 
the airline recently introduced firstclass service and earlier 
this year ordered 74 new jets from mcdonnelldouglas corp a deal 
worth about 2 billion 
midway also recently acquired eastern airlines gates and routes

slick magazine ads will get more of 
the money chrysler corp spends to market its luxury chryslerbrand 
cars in 1990 than will television spots 
the strategy differs from previous years when 60 percent of the 
advertising budget went to broadcast and 40 percent to print media 
this years split will favor print media 70 percent to 30 percent 
for broadcast 
we think luxury car prospects dont view as much 
generalinterest television as the population at large jim 
jamdasek national advertising manager for chrysler brand said 
monday 
chrysler officials like those of other automakers refuse to 
divulge specific amounts in advertising spending 
jamdasek said chrysler will continue advertising its luxury 
models on television notably around professional football 
basketball and golf events and on cbstvs 60 minutes 
magazines that will carry advertising for chrysler cars include 
black enterprise fortune golf digest and real estate today 
plymouth advertising which is geared to a younger less

the supreme court today rejected by a 63 
vote a bush administration appeal aimed primarily at limiting tax 
deductions for some real estate investors 
the court let stand a ruling that favored investors in the 
purchase of a new jersey apartment complex 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun and anthony m 
kennedy voted to hear arguments in the case but they fell one vote 
short of the four needed to grant such review 
the case stems from the purchase in 1978 of the summit house 
garden apartment complex in west orange nj by pleasant amp summit 
associates 
george and sharon prussin were among the partners in pleasant amp 
summit who bought the complex for 776 million all or almost all 
of money came from loans to the prussins 
the couple claimed losses on the property in depreciation and 
other deductions of more than 762000 for 1978 and 1979 
the internal revenue service in 1985 disallowed the losses and 
said the prussins owed the government about 400000 
the irs said the fair market value of the apartment complex was 
42 million at the time of the purchase not the 776 million 
claimed by the investors irs officials said the transaction was 
intended to be a tax shelter creating big deductions by inflating 
the purchase price 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in at least a partial 
victory for the prussins ruled last november 1988 the claimed 
deductions should not be disallowed completely 
the prussins should be allowed to claim a deduction based on the 
fair market value of the apartments the appeals court said it 
ordered a trial judge to determine the 1978 fair market value 
the government appeal said the 3rd circuit court ruling will 
produce grave inequities in tax administration and cause a 
substantial disruption in the efforts of the internal revenue 
service to achieve a prompt and fair disposition of a large number 
of tax shelter cases especially cases involving real estate 
shelters 
the appeal said that at least 630 million could be at stake in 
tax deficiency payments the irs is seeking 
the case is commissioner of internal revenue vs prussin

here are excerpts from an april 10 1987 memo written by 
william black a savings and loan regulator in san francisco to 
edwin gray then chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
black and other regulators met privately in washington with five 
us senators who questioned the handling of lincoln savings its 
parent company american continental corp and its chairman 
charles keating who was a large contributor to the senators 
the federal home loan bank of san francisco responsible for 
overseeing savings banks in california nevada and arizona wanted 
to seize lincoln in 1987 after keatings complaints supervision

sen dennis deconcini dariz we wanted to meet with you 
because we have determined that potential actions of yours could 
injure a constituent they lincoln have two major 
disagreements with you first with regard to direct investment 
where the sampl becomes a partner in a real estate venture second 
on your reappraisal theyre suing against your direct investment 
regulation we suggest that the lawsuit be accelerated and that 
you grant them forbearance while the suit is pending i know 
something about the appraisal values of the federal home loan bank 
board they appear to be grossly unfair lincoln is prepared to 
reach a compromise value with you 
sen alan cranston dcalif arriving im sorry i cant join 
you but i have to be on the floor to deal with the bill i just 
want to say that i share the concerns of the other senators on this 
subject cranston leaves 
sen john mccain rariz one of our jobs as elected officials 
is to help constituents in a proper fashion acc is a big employer 
and important to the local economy i wouldnt want any special 
favors for them i dont want any part of our conversation to 
be improper id like to mention the appraisal issue it seems 
to me theres a problem arizona is the second fastest growing 
state land values are skyrocketing that has to be taken account 
of in appraisals 
sen john glenn dohio even the accounting firm says 
youve taken an unusually adversary view toward lincoln to be 
blunt you should charge them or get off their backs if things are 
bad there get to them 
james cirona president of the federal home loan bank of san 
francisco this meeting is very unusual to discuss a particular 
company 
deconcini its very unusual for us to have a company that could 
be put out of business by its regulators 
richard sanchez supervisory agent lincoln had underwriting 
problems with all of their investments the examiners looked at 
52 real estate loans that lincoln had made since the 1984 exam 
there were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan 
files 
cirona these underwriting practices violate our regulatory 
guidelines 
black they are also an unsafe and unsound practice 
sen donald riegle dmich wheres the smoking gun where are 
the losses 
deconcini whats wrong with this if theyre willing to clean up 
their act 
cirona this is a ticking time bomb 
riegle these people saved a failing thrift acc is reputed to 
be highly competent 
black lincoln was not a failing thrift before acc acquired it 
it met its net worth requirement it had returned to profitability 
before it was acquired 
michael patriarca director of agency functions im relatively 
new to the savings and loan industry but ive never seen any bank 
or sampl thats anything like this this isnt even close you can 
ask any banker you know about these practices they violate the law 
and regulations and common sense 
glenn what violates the law 
patriarca their direct investments violate the regulation then 
theres the file stuffing they took undated documents purporting 
to show underwriting efforts and put them into the files sometimes 
more than a year after 
glenn have you done anything about these violations of law 
patriarca were sending a criminal referral to the department 
of justice not maybe were sending one this is an 
extraordinarily serious matter 
deconcini the criminality surprises me were not interested in 
discussing those issues our premise was that we had a viable 
institution concerned that it was being overregulated

while skepticism remains over donald trumps 7 
billion bid for american airlines one of the companys largest 
stockholders said today it has sold all its holdings in parent amr 
corp to cash in on the higher stock prices generated by the 
billionaires offering 
windsor fund manager john b neff said his mutual fund sold the 
last of its 425000 shares monday getting 104 per share or 442 
million the sale cleared out windsors holding in amr which at 
its height was 4 million shares during the quarter ended july 31 
1988 
overall amr was the second most actively traded stock on the 
new york stock exchange monday inching up 87 cents in composite 
trading to close at 10462 as 12 million shares changed hands 
by late morning today amr had fallen 187 to 10287 per share 
neff said he had begun selling last thursday getting 107 a 
share hours after trumps 120 offer was made public the stocks 
highest price before slipping back 
trumps cash offer for the airlines 589 million shares has 
been met with suspicion by many in the financial community who see 
it as a ploy to drive up the price and enhance trumps own holdings 
american the nations largest and most profitable airline has 
had little to say about the offer beyond its initial response that 
the bid would be considered in due course although the company 
said it preferred to remain independent 
trump said he would put up 1 billion of equity in the deal and 
believes financing is readily available for the remainder 
however neff who has managed the conservative windsor fund for 
25 years said i have a hard time taking mr trump seriously 
120s a very full price and i dont know where the financing is 
going to come from 
this isnt loose change he said 
he also questioned trumps 1 billion equity commitment the 
developers wealth is estimated in the latest issue of forbes 
magazine at 17 billion and neff said i kind of wonder if hes 
really going to bet everything on amr one its cyclical two its 
well run to start with three the pilots and other prima donnas are 
very important on this and what if they dont go along and finally 
is congress going to sit on its hands and see the third biggy 
disappear 
the parent companies of northwest airlines recently was taken 
private in a 365 billion buyout and the parent of united airlines 
is in the midst of a 675 billion employeemanagement takeover 
the deals have led to increased congressional scrutiny and 
legislation is pending that would require the federal 
transportation secretary to approve airline takeovers 
the windsor fund based in valley forge pa is an 88 
billionasset mutual fund that has consistently ranked among the 
top performers of funds investing in stocks for the past 10 years 
the fund has averaged a 2057 return on its investments

general electric cos aerospace 
operations in syracuse began shipping products to the navy and air 
force today after defense department officials determined the 
company had corrected serious procedural and quality control 
problems 
defense contract administration services personnel returned to 
inspecting equipment ready for delivery lifting the government 
sanctions that held up more than 16 million in partial payments to 
ge said michael r flannery dcas administrative contracting 
officer in syracuse 
the us department of defense had allowed only essential 
products to leave ge since february when the company was caught 
violating a number of defense department regulations the syracuse 
operation was allowed to continue limited manufacture of products 
the company received the severe and rare sanctions because it 
was found to be mixing production on contracts for both the us 
military and foreign governments whose specifications were less 
stringent on the same production line 
flannery said the company had corrected the problem of 
comingling by making the specifications and procedures required by 
us contracts the standard for all its production lines 
the company also has guaranteed it will repair or replace any 
product in the field that is shown to be deficient 
ge spokeswoman connie grasso said the company will now attempt 
to increase production to recoup time lost during the sanction 
period 
in an effort to improve the syracuse operation ge announced a 
restructuring in september creating separate divisions for its 
radar and sonar operatons 
now ges radar division is based in moorestown nj while its 
sonar and related underseas systems are built in syracuse

chevron usa and 17 other oil 
companies filed suit to overturn a california coastal commission 
decision and allow oil shipments from offshore fields through the 
santa barbara channel 
the suit filed last friday in santa barbara county superior 
court seeks to overturn an august ruling by the commission that 
blocked the shipments from the point arguello oil fields the 
commissions ruling blocked a temporary county permit allowing 
tankers to operate between the point arguello projects marine 
terminal near gaviota and chevrons refinery in el segundo 
we believe the coastal commission ignored numerous prior 
findings made by itself and the county in previous permit 
proceedings and approvals concerning our project said richard t 
hughes offshore district land supervisor for chevron which is 
leading the legal fight 
commission officials could not be reached for comment on the 
suit tuesday a person at the commissions main office in san 
francisco said no one with information on the action was 
immediately available to discuss it 
the head of get oil out a local citizens group opposed to 
offshore oil development criticized the move however 
i think its a bad move on their part and wont get them 
anywhere said goo president henry feniger 
the consortium has invested about 2 billion in the project oil 
officials believe the field contains about 300 million barrels of 
crude 
permission to ship the crude is one of the last remaining 
obstacles facing the project which has yet to produce any oil 
the league of women voters of santa barbara county and goo 
appealed the granting of the county permit to the commission 
arguing chevron did not demonstrate that it could adequately handle 
a massive oil spill like the 10 milliongallon exxon valdez spill 
in alaskas prince william sound last march 
the opposition groups also complained that a proposed pipeline 
project would not be in place before the tankers were to begin 
shipments and that the company had not explored other options for 
transporting the oil 
chevron had once agreed to build a pipeline but the proposal was 
scrubbed when elected officials and communities along the route 
filed legal challenges said chevron spokesman g michael marcy 
the county board of supervisors said it approved a permit for 
the tankers last may because supervisors believed chevrons marine 
emergency management plan adequately addressed the possibility of a 
disastrous spill 
point arguello is about 40 miles northwest of downtown santa 
barbara which is about 100 miles northwest of los angeles 
the santa barbara channel is the sea passage between the 
mainland and a string of pristine islands that provide homes to 
various wildlife

the president of wang laboratories inc 
says the company posted another loss in the first quarter of its 
fiscal year but he says the company will become profitable after 
some jobs and assets are cut 
we have built up some layers of bureaucracy and processes that 
probably are not essential to the ongoing conduct of our basic 
business company president richard miller said 
the computer manufacturer posted a loss of 3747 million for 
the final quarter of the last fiscal year leading to the 
resignation of frederick wang son of company founder an wang as 
president miller became president aug 23 
for the first quarter that ended sept 30 wang should show an 
operating loss in the range of 30 million to 70 million miller 
told the boston globe on monday 
miller said however he expected the company to begin showing a 
profit by june 30 the end of its fiscal year 
i would expect that we would have the operating earnings into 
the black he said 
but miller said the profits would not be enough to offset 
earlier losses making it necessary for wang to cut more of its 
workforce 
the company has reduced the number of employees by 20 percent to 
25000 since jan 1 miller declined to say how many more may lose 
their jobs 
he said the company plans to sell about 800 million in assets 
not considered vital to its future including real estate credit 
subsidiaries and telephone switchboard units 
he said he hopes to sell 400 million to 500 million of the 
assets within the next six months the money will be used to reduce 
debt and interest payments 
miller said revenues for the first quarter of this fiscal year 
were about 13 percent lower than the 684 million for the first 
quarter of last year the company had a restated profit of 131 
million that quarter

fannie mae said tuesday its earnings soared 60 
percent in the third quarter as yields increased on its mortgage 
portfolio and fee income rose 
fannie mae formally known as the federal national mortgage 
association is a congressionally chartered shareholderowned 
company that provides money for home buyers by purchasing mortgages 
from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to 
investors 
for the third quarter earnings were 2119 million or 80 cents 
a share on total interest income of 281 billion compared with 
1324 million or 55 cents a share on interest income of 261 
billion in the same period of 1988 
for the first nine months of the year net income totaled 5701 
million or 217 per share an increase of 61 percent over 354 
million or 148 per share in the first three quarters of last

fanie mae president roger birk listed three reasons for 
increased third quarter earnings 
an improvement in the margin on mortgages and other investments 
in its portfolio to 79 basis points from 53 basis points a year ago 
an increase in the size of the companys investment portfolio 
to an average balance of 1159 billion from 1089 billion a year 
ago 
growth in guaranty fees earned when the company buys mortgages 
and packages them into securities to 1036 billion from 844

the london international financial futures 
exchange said tuesday it will introduce an electronic trading 
system next month to extend its trading hours in hopes of 
attracting more international business 
with a nov 30 launch date the liffe will beat the much larger 
chicago futures exchanges to the punch with an automated trading 
system 
but the liffe system at least initially will extend the london 
exchanges trading day to just 11 hours compared with the 24hour 
capability of systems being developed by the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange 
officials of the chicago exchanges said they would have to study 
the liffes system to weigh its potential impact on their own 
businesses 
but at first blush the liffes system looks like competition 
for the board of trades proposed trading network dubbed aurora 
said bot spokesman michael oconnell 
competition isnt the worst thing its often good for the 
overall market oconnell said the board of trade looks at 
this as something good for the industry 
michael jenkins liffes chief executive announced the 
exchanges plans at a futures and options trade show in chicago 
as planned the system would operate from 430 pm to 6 pm 
london time for trading of euromark and west german government bond 
futures an early trading session from 7 am to 8 am london 
time would be added in the first half of 1990 as would all the 
exchanges other futures and options contracts 
some of those contracts such as us treasury bond futures and 
international currency futures compete with products offered by 
the chicago exchanges 
futures exchanges around the world are trying to extend their 
trading hours to capture more foreign business 
the liffe system resembles the board of trades proposed aurora 
system allowing traders sitting at computers to identify and trade 
with each other the board of trade announced plans for aurora in 
march but has not set a launch date 
the board of trade the worlds largest futures market is also 
working with the chicago mercantile exchange on a possible joint 
venture in electronic trading 
the merc is working separately on globex a blind tradematching 
system slated for a launch early next year the new york mercantile 
exchange the sydney futures exchange and the french futures 
exchange matif have agreed to offer some of their products for 
trading on globex

many market strategists have expected the dow average to show

although volume picked up sharply from mondays sluggish pace the 
market remained featureless they said 
dull dull dull said mitchell meisler an executive vice 
president of equity trading at shearson lehman hutton inc 
theres no overriding theme right now

the dollar ended sharply higher tuesday after 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan hinted that us 
interest rates would remain firm in the near term regardless of the 
currencys movements 
gold prices slipped here and abroad 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery closed at 361 a troy ounce down 210 from monday 
republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid for gold also 
at 361 an ounce off 150 
currency dealers attributed the dollars rally mainly to remarks 
from greenspan in moscow on tuesday 
greenspan said attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates 
may lead to destabilizing international capital flows and 
ultimately have to be abandoned he said paying inordinate 
attention to intermediate targets in setting monetary policy may 
not promote the attainment of longterm goals 
the fed has been under pressure from the bush administration to 
take action to bring the dollar down from its steep rise against 
foreign currencies this year it has also been urged by some 
officials to ease its grip on credit to steer the economy clear of 
recession 
earl i johnson a trader at harris trust amp co in chicago said 
many dealers interpreted greenspans remarks to mean that the fed 
probably wouldnt push down interest rates any time soon thereby 
keeping the dollar from declining 
the market was poised to move up and that was a nice 
catalyst said johnson 
the british pound meanwhile continued its sharp drop tuesday 
despite last weeks hike in britains interest rates one dealer 
said there is a lack of confidence in sterling 
in london it cost 15580 to buy one pound cheaper than 
15775 late monday sterling fetched 15520 in new york down 
from 15775 monday 
tokyo markets were closed tuesday for a national holiday but in 
london the dollar was quoted at 14325 yen down 102 yen from 
monday the dollar stood at 14450 yen in new york up from 14285

production at ford motor cos wayne assembly 
plant will stop for about three months to retool the factory for 
the next generation of escort subcompact cars the company said 
tuesday 
the united auto workers union said it anticipates fewer than 100 
layoffs because of the changeover 
the wayne assembly plant west of detroit fords principal 
source for the escort will stop production nov 22 and resume in 
late february or early march ford spokesman joel pitcoff said 
during that time the plant will undergo an extensive retooling 
for the new escort which will be introduced to the public next 
spring as a 1991 model 
the retooling is part of a 15 billion project ford is 
undertaking for the new generation of escort and mercury tracer 
cars 
along with the wayne plant escorts and all tracers will be made 
at fords hermosillo mexico plant which stopped production in 
late august pitcoff said the plant would not build 1990 tracers 
since it had no facilities to install passive restraint systems 
required by the us government for 1990 model year cars 
there are about 3300 hourly workers at the wayne plant dale 
smith financial secretary of united auto workers union local 900 
said during the down time workers will be retrained on the new 
production processes 
ford currently makes escorts at its edison nj plant in 
addition to the wayne factory pitcoff said he didnt know when 
escort production would stop at the edison plant to make way for 
changing the plant to producing ranger small pickup trucks 
ford needed the new source for rangers after deciding to build 
the explorer sportutility vehicle at its louisville assembly plant 
in the 1989 model year 366354 escorts were sold making it the 
bestselling car in the united states for the fourthstraight model 
year 
this changeover at wayne jeopardizes our string of 
continuous model and calendar year sales titles for escort 
pitcoff said escort was the bestselling car during the 1987 and 
1988 calendar years 
the honda accord was the secondbest selling car in the country 
during the last model year with 362437 being driven off dealer 
lots the ford taurus was third at 360237 sales

a major institutional investor in amr corp said 
tuesday it has sold all its shares to take advantage of inflated 
stock prices in the wake of donald trumps 7 billion buyout 
proposal for the company that owns american airlines 
since last thursday when trumps 120 per share offer was made 
public windsor fund has sold its 425000 shares said john b 
neff who has managed the fund for 25 years were out as of 
yesterday neff said tuesday 
meanwhile little additional information emerged on trumps bid 
revealed last thursday in a letter to the company 
trump told the associated press in new york he was serious about 
acquiring the airline although he would not reveal any details of 
his financing trump also said he would leave the airlines 
headquarters in fort worth 
amrs stock fell in trading in the new york stock exchange 
closing down 325 a share at 10150 reflecting speculation that 
trumps offer is a ploy to increase the value of his amr stock and 
not a serious offer for the airline 
i have a hard time taking mr trump seriously 120s a very 
full price and i dont know where the financing is going to come 
from neff said this isnt loose change 
at one time the windsor fund held 4 million shares of amr 
stock and airline said in its annual report institutional 
investors hold about 80 percent of its 589 million outstanding 
shares 
the wall street journal reported earlier this week that some 
institutional investors were considering backing trump despite amr 
chairman robert l crandalls reputation as one of the industrys 
top executives 
trump had pitched his bid somewhat in the institutions 
direction promising to give them an immediate payoff in a company 
that has never paid a dividend since the holding company was 
created in 1982 
this is the whole essence of the strategy said analyst 
kevin burke at first union corp a bank holding company in 
charlotte nc 
he said trump is saying he wants to pay you off right now 
while crandall has essentially said he would deliver more profits 
down the road than if i paid out 4 percent in a dividend 
most observers are awaiting some response from amr which has 
said nothing beyond its initial promise to review the offer in 
due course while adding it preferred to remain independent 
the mostoften mentioned alternatives include finding a friendly 
buyer putting together a managementlabor buyout deal selling a 
large chunk of stock to employees or establishing a special 
dividend through a restructuring 
neff in a telephone interview from his valley forge pa 
office said he had raised the issue of the dividend with crandall 
many times 
its been a sticky issue he said 
amr officials refused to discuss the policy referring questions 
to the companys 1988 annual report which includes almost a full 
page in defense of the nodividend policy 
the airline business is very capital intensive and the funds 
that would be required for payment of a dividend are being used 
instead for capital expenditures the report says 
noting that the company has averaged 103 billion in capital 
expenditures annually since 1983 and anticipates to spend 19 
billion a year for the next five years the report says to pay a 
dividend in the midst of this capital spending seems 
counterproductive every dollar paid out as a dividend is one more 
dollar that would have to be financed assuming a constant cash 
position 
amr denies the policy short changes stockholders saying 
reinvestment of earnings with resultant share appreciation is 
more beneficial to shareholders than receipt of dividends 
especially on an after tax basis 
other profitable airlines however do pay dividends for 
example delta airlines paid 120 last year and has paid a 
dividend during the last 40 fiscal years while growing to become 
the nations third largest carrier behind american and united air 
lines 
we believe that its part of our responsibility to 
stockholders to maximize their stake in the company delta 
spokesman jim lundy said its best for us to return a portion 
of profits through dividends 
nwa inc parent of northwest airlines paid dividends each 
quarter going private recently in a 365 billion buyout usair 
group inc also has paid dividends

saatchi the worlds largest ad holding company 
that increased southeasterns holdings to 53 million american

usx corps board of directors adopted a 
shareholder rights takeover defense on tuesday saying it wanted to 
deter coercive takeover tactics 
adoption of the plan which was effective tuesday came less 
than a week after takeover strategist carl icahn disclosed that he 
was studying the feasibility of making a bid for the 
pittsburghbased steel and oil giant 
icahn controls 1306 percent of usxs stock including an 
additional 425 million shares acquired last week 
usx fell 50 cents to 3812 a share tuesday on the new york 
stock exchange 
shareholder rights plans commonly known as a poison pill 
generally are aimed at thwarting hostile takeovers by making them 
prohibitively expensive 
the usx plan would take effect once a person or group acquired 
at least 15 percent of the companys common stock 
under the plan shareholders would be issued one stock right for 
each common share they already hold the usx board could give 
shareholders the option of exchanging the rights for common stock 
at the ratio of one share of common stock for each right thus 
increasing the number of shares a raider would have to acquire 
usx said the plan was designed to prevent someone from gaining 
control of the company without offering a fair price to all 
stockholders 
icahn who owns trans world airlines inc said his group was 
considering making proposals for business combinations with 
usx he made the comment in a filing with the securities and 
exchange commission last thursday

makes the case the second largest insidertrading case behind the 
ivan boesky scandal in 1986 boesky the nowjailed stock 
speculator agreed to return 50 million in alleged illicit profits 
and pay 50 million in penalties to the government

said he added that the united states does not have an extradition 
treaty with taiwan covering the offenses in the indictment 
lee faces up to five years in prison on each of the 493 criminal 
charges and tens of millions of dollars in fines romano said

headlines in which lee earned more than 165 million 
lee allegedly carried out the illegal transactions by trading in 
more than 40 accounts at eight foreign and domestic brokers the 
indictment said some accounts were in lees name but most were 
listed in the names of relatives and other third parties 
wang entered into a cooperation agreement with prosecutors in 
september 1988 and pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in 
connection with his scheme with lee 
wang 25 who no longer works for morgan stanley originally was 
sentenced to three years in prison but his term was reduced to

digital equipment corp suffering from a sales 
slump unveiled a system of office software tuesday designed to 
allow computers made by different companies to share information 
and work together 
the action marks the latest move toward equipment that is 
compatible across the computer industry easing some of the 
confusion for customers who have had to struggle with diverse 
systems analysts say 
with any large company the most important and hardest 
business problem is that they have all these different types of 
desktop computers and they want all these people to work 
together said henry ancona digitals vice president for 
business and office information systems 
the new system will be compatible not only with digitals vax 
computers but with popular systems from international business 
machines corp and apple computer inc as well as software from 
microsoft corp the company said 
workers using this system can share computing software and 
transmit data documents and pictures kenneth olsen president 
of the maynardbased company said in a statement its just 
common sense 
the software which was presented tuesday at an office computer 
convention in new york will be available next year 
digital the worlds secondlargest computer company behind ibm 
was long known for the compatibility within its vax system digital 
promoted this with the slogan digital has it now a jab at its 
giant rival whose systems until this year lacked that capability 
ibm now has software that can run across the full range of its 
machines 
but company officials and analysts said digitals move takes 
compatibility further by linking computers from different companies 
we believe that reflects the reality of the market ancona 
said it would be arrogant to tell a customer that if you buy our 
computer you have to throw out everything else youve invested 
in 
i think decs made a very significant step forward said 
terry shannon an analyst with international data corp a computer 
research firm based in framingham 
digital is saying if you dont have a digital pc personal 
computer its fine shannon said their concern is the 
underlying system 
computer software which runs the machines is becoming a more 
lucrative market than the computers themselves which are becoming 
less expensive shannon said 
also digital can employ the integrated system to introduce its 
products to customers using other brands of computers and possibly 
persuade them to use more digital equipment said sonny monosson 
publisher of the monosson report in boston which monitors 
activities at digital 
the introduction of the new system comes as the company tries to 
reverse a sales slump 
digitals earnings slid 22 percent for the year that ended july 
1 and the company has frozen salaries and transferred hundreds of 
employees from manufacturing to sales jobs 
last week john j shields who was in charge of sales and was 
long regarded as the no 2 man at digital resigned analysts noted 
that he had fallen out of favor amid the companys slowdown 
part of the companys slump could be blamed on digitals rapid 
introduction of new products which confused sales people and 
customers analysts said 
but that will not be the case with the new system ancona said 
since the programs will build on the vax system not depart from it 
there has been confusion it would be complicated about 
what they had and didnt have said walter ulrich an analyst 
with arthur d little inc a cambridgebased management and 
technology consulting firm 
but now theyre able to give a more simple message about what 
theyre doing he said

levi strauss amp co one of eight advertisers who 
bought commercial time during last springs test of the channel one 
news show for teens in the classroom has decided against being a 
sponsor when the service goes national in the spring 
the san franciscobased apparel maker said tuesday it felt that 
sticking with media vehicles like network and cable television 
would offer a more efficient and less expensive way to reach the 
audience of young men aged 14 to 24 that it targets with ads for 
its levis 501 jeans 
dan chew marketing manager for levi strauss said the 
controversy that channel one stirred among some national education 
groups and others about permitting paid pitches in the classroom 
played no role in levis decision 
we never reached the point internally where we discussed the 
issue of inschool advertising he said im not sure how that 
would have come out 
chew declined to say how much levi strauss was being asked to 
pay for commercial time on channel one but said the company felt 
it could reach a wider audience at less cost by sticking with 
traditional media 
whittle communications the producer of channel one is 
currently lining up advertising support and signing up schools for 
its daily 12minute news shows that will include two minutes of 
paid advertising 
it hopes to make channel one available in 8000 schools reaching 
6 million teens by the end of 1990 
whittle spokesman tom ingram said the knoxville tennbased 
media company wont discuss in advance which advertisers have 
signed up for the national rollout of the service scheduled for 
march 1990 
whittle chairman christopher whittle announced last month that 
after 90 days of advertiser recruitment channel one was already 
more than halfway toward its goal of selling 90 million in 
commercial time the first year he said some of the companies who 
were in the test program in six schools last spring would be 
included in next springs rollout while others would not 
among other advertised products in last springs test were candy 
from mampmmars co chewing gum from wm wrigley jr co shampoo 
deodorant acne medication and potato chips from procter amp gamble 
co and mints and cough tablets from warnerlambert co

fourth quarter could boost the end of a lackluster year at the 
nations secondlargest retailer chairman joseph antonini said 
tuesday 
antonini also said at a news conference that he will make some 
personal appearances in television ads in an effort to lure 
customers i can go on tv in front of the american public and 
tell them what we are doing he said 
in addition antonini outlined a 13 billion expansion plan 
that would increase the number of k marts to 2500 by 1995 from the 
current 2283 
lowerthanexpected inflation and interest rates and 
betterthanexpected employment raise the possibility of the kind 
of strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year 
antonini said 
because the economy seems to be holding up he said were 
more optimistic than we were four months ago 
k mart will open 43 new stores this fall and complete expansions 
of 63 others by the end of october antonini said 
he said he already made television commercials being tested in 
the pueblo and colorado springs areas of colorado and will appear 
in national television ads during two christmas specials k mart is 
producing 
one is christmas in america a movie that will star kenny 
rogers the other a special on christmas entertaining with author 
martha stewart who also lends her name to a line of k mart 
household products 
k mart bought national television advertising during about 24 
weeks this year and will increase that to about 30 weeks next year 
keying some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars 
antonini said 
he said last week that cutting prices to gain customers has 
reduced profit margins and is expected to lower thirdquarter 
earnings below last years 
the company reported earnings of 145 million in its second 
fiscal quarter which ended july 26 that was down 109 percent 
from a year earlier though secondquarter sales of 7 billion were 
up 48 percent 
september sales of 26 billion were up 61 percent from 
september 1988 but up only 3 percent when comparing stores open 
for the full year 
from the start of the fiscal year feb 1 through sept 27 sales 
reached 177 billion up only 47 percent overall and a sluggish 
12 percent on a comparablestore basis 
k mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of 803 million on sales of 
273 billion 
profit margins will improve as the company connects 2200 of its 
stores to a centralized inventory computer system by the end of 
next year for greater marketing precision antonini said 
we know what product sells in hoboken new jersey we know the 
price it sells for and we know how many sold on monday he said

recent commercial agreements will allow 
mexico to double steel exports to the united states and increase 
other types of nonpetroleum exports mexican commerce secretary 
jaime serra puche said tuesday 
the agreements reached during president carlos salinas de 
gortaris visit to the united states last week will help mexicos 
developing economy and further reduce its reliance on petroleum 
exports serra puche said 
the most important thing weve done is set up a program to 
promote trade rather than just resolve problems as they come up 
serra puche said 
before it was a passive agreement he said now we have an 
active agreement with dates and deadlines for considering 
improvements in trade 
he said us secretary of commerce robert mosbacher will be 
visiting mexico next month for further talks on expanding trade 
one 30month agreement more than doubled mexicos quota for 
steel exports to the united states from about 370000 tons 
annually to about 800000 tons he said the exact tonnages depend 
on the mix of steel products involved 
serra puche said the united states also agreed to consider 
lifting tariffs on 43 categories of products including data 
processing equipment beer car parts plastics glass and crystal 
products toilet paper and other paper products jalapeno chilis 
and alphabet blocks for children 
he said mexico felt it deserved concessions because it had gone 
so far to free its own market of government control and 
protectionist rules 
right now we have one of the most open economies in the world 
that allows us to ask for reciprocity serra puche said 
intellectual property rights remain a sticking point us 
industry has long complained that mexicans steal patented ideas 
especially in the pharmaceutical field and some firms refuse to 
invest in mexico for fear their patents will not be respected 
serra puche said mexico wants to resolve the problem in order to 
modernize its industry but that nothing would be done to put the 
mexican pharmaceutical industry out of business overnight 
he said forthcoming negotiations will lead to a higher textile 
quota for mexico adding that the mexican textile industrys main 
problem in the past had not been quotas but competitiveness 
he said that with the opening of mexicos economy to foreign 
competion since mexico joined the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade mexican industry has become much more competitive in both 
quality and price 
under previous protectionist policies that virtually prevented 
imports of everything from chocolate bars to refrigerators mexican 
manufacturers got away with making shoddy goods at high prices for 
the domestic market 
with regard to steel serra puche noted that mexico exported 
286 million worth to the united states in the first nine months of 
1989 up from 232 million in 1988 steel is mexicos 
eighthlargest export he said 
also reached said serra puche was an agreement to push closer 
commercial relations along the usmexico border including 
examination of new customs protocols and agreements to allow trucks 
to circulate freely on both sides of the border 
serra puche said mexicos overall nonpetroleum exports have 
risen from 4 billion in 1983 to 15 billion in 1988 with a 
further 10 percent increase expected this year petroleum has 
dropped from 90 percent of mexicos export trade to 30 percent 
although that is also partly due to the drop in world oil prices 
since 1982 
he said efforts were being made to push exports to europe and 
the far east but the united states remains the worlds largest 
consumer market and mexicos closeness to that market is an 
advantage
