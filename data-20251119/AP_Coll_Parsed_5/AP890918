a judge monday ordered the state to provide 
756 million to finance services for mentally retarded 
philadelphians living at home saying state law requires adequate 
services for all persons who need them 
commonwealth court president judge james crumlish jr also 
ordered the city to immediately restore the program which a budget 
cutback forced officials to gut july 1 
crumlish noted that failure to provide the services would risk 
institutionalization for the 7750 retarded people enrolled before 
the budget cutback 
crumlish ordered the state public welfare department to ask the 
legislature for the funds within 10 days and also to reimburse the 
city for monies expended to reinstate and operate these programs 
the crying needs of and imminent harm to the individuals at 
issue here unable to speak themselves cannot be ignored while the 
intricacies of the general assembly budgetary process unfold the 
judge said 
by ordering the state to seek additional funds from the 
legislature the judge pointed out the department will be able to 
retain services in other counties 
the lawsuit was the second the state has lost over the 
philadelphia program during the last fiscal year unhappy with 
deficits in the program the legislature tried to withhold the 
appropriation acquiescing only under court order 
weve won on the law said attorney david ferleger who 
represents retarded people waiting for services the judge said 
everybody who is entitled to services should get them it is a great 
victory not only in pennsylvania but for retarded persons 
everywhere in this country 
vicki smink spokeswoman for the welfare department said no 
decision on an appeal has been made 
the program involves teaching and training the retarded in basic 
life and social skills such as feeding and dressing themselves and 
learning a simple job 
the current injunction sought by the city and joined by the 
philadelphia police and fire association for handicapped children 
affects only the mentally retarded receiving services before the new 
fiscal year started july 1 
the judge noted that the state mental health and mental 
retardation act of 1966 provides that the commonwealth pay 90 
percent and each county the remaining 10 percent of the costs 
philadelphias programs have operated at a deficit since 
1982 crumlish said in the ninepage opinion granting the 
preliminary injunction in each year the city has found a way to 
avoid service cuts

the united states intends to give hungary 
permanent mostfavored nation trade status president bush said 
monday 
in budapest commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the united 
states was negoatiating toward a comprehensive pact to support 
hungarys efforts to develop a freer political system and to create 
and expand private enterprise said mosbacher who is in budapest 
for talks with hungarian officials 
the presidents decision was annouced as hungarys new parliament 
speaker matyas szuros told the washington post he sees the 
possibility that his nation could withdraw from the warsaw pact and 
become neutral by the end of the century 
szuros whose comments were published in the posts tuesday 
editions said the shift to neutrality could take place within a 
climate of trust between hungary and the soviet union 
the financial package announced monday includes improved tariff 
treatment of hungarian products new development programs and 
creation of a 25 million fund to help create private business there 
this step is an important part of implementing president bushs 
goal of building an american partnership with hungary mosbacher 
said in a statement after a meeting with hungarian trade minister 
tamas beck a copy of the statement was made available in washington 
such an agreement is fundamental for private sector business 
because it would contain investment protection guarantees which 
boost confidence and open the way to subtantially increased us 
private investment in hungary 
in helena mont president bush told a news conference hungary 
has taken major steps toward economic and political reform and 
during our recent visit we witnessed significant changes toward 
freedom in that country our commitment to helping the reform 
movement in eastern europe is strong our step today underscores our 
willingness to help these countries 
the white house released bushs letter to congress in which he 
said it is my intent to add hungary to the list of countries 
that qualify for mostfavored nation status which would guarantee 
hungary the lowest tariffs for its products that any competing 
country gets 
mosbacher led the highlevel mission to hungary to explore new 
trade and investment opportunities the mission will prepare 
recommendations on private sector expansion of us trade 
the commerce secretary said hungary would be granted permanent 
most favored trade status in october if its parliament as expected 
enacts legislation on freedom of emigration by the end of september 
hungary would become the first eastern bloc country to receive 
most favored status under the jacksonvanik amendment of 1974 which 
tied such benefits to a countrys emigration policies yugoslavia 
and poland have continuous most favored nation status but both 
preceeded 1974 
the status assures that exports to the united states wont face 
discriminatory tariffs hungary receives such benefits only on a 
yeartoyear basis 
mosbacher also said bush is notifying congress of his intention 
to designate hungary eligible for generalized system of preferences 
treatment which would offer hungarian exporters dutyfree tariff 
treatment for a broad range of exports to the united states worth 
more than 110 million 
to help hungary take full advantage of this program we will be 
sending a team of washingtonbased gsp experts to hungary to conduct 
seminars and provide indepth technical assistance mosbacher said 
he also said an agreement had been reached granting hungary a 30 
percent increase in steel exports to the united states 
bush has submitted legislation to extend overseas private 
investment corp programs to hungary and create a 25 million fund 
to help establish private business there 
those programs would provide investment guarantees to us 
companies investing in hungary

the only way to stop poachers from 
killing elephants for their tusks is to take the fashion statement 
out of ivory kenyas leading wildlife official said 
a piece of paper which says you shall not trade in elephant 
ivory is about worth the paper its written on richard leakey 
said sunday at a benefit for friends of conservation 
the way to stop the trade in elephants is to make the people of 
the world disgusted and revolted by the wearing of animal parts 
particularly elephants 
leakey who became director of wildlife conservation in kenya in 
the spring has boosted the east african countrys efforts to save 
its elephant population 
earlier this year kenya was losing an average of 2 elephants 
every day from its national parks and reserves leakey said the 
countrys elephant population has dwindled during the last decade 
from 65000 to 17000 
leakey said that during the past four months poaching has 
virtually stopped because of a crackdown on poaching 
four people have been killed since july in attacks that leakey 
blamed on poachers who were frustrated by the drive he said 
friends of conservation was originally founded as friends of the 
masai mara in 1982 to preserve the wildlife and endangered habitat 
of the masai mara game reserve in kenya 
by 1987 the original project was expanded to help other regions 
in africa and the name was changed to friends of conservation the 
group has offices in oak brook ill london and nairobi

lonesome dove the cbs miniseries that starred robert duvall 
and tommy lee jones scored the highest number of emmy nominations in 
nontechnical categories 18 followed by nbcs frequent winner 
la law with 17 and abcs miniseries war and remembrance 
with 15 
abcs the wonder years had 14 nominations abcs 
thirtysomething hd 13 and nbcs the golden girls and foxs 
the tracey ullman show had 10 nominations each 
lonesome dove was a big winner before sunday nights event 
taking six emmys in technical categories in nontelevised ceremonies 
saturday night the miniseries won prizes for costume design 
makeup music composition sound editing sound mixing and casting 
before the success of lonesome dove the western had been 
largely moribund for well over a decade on both the big and small 
screen this fall will mark the first time in 15 years that two 
westerns have been on the network schedule cbs paradise in 
its second year and the new show the young riders on abc in 
195859 by contrast the top four shows were all westerns 
gunsmoke wagon train have gun will travel and the 
rifleman 
thirteen other shows including thirtysomething and the 
tracey ullman show won two technical emmys each 
sunday nights spectacle marked the end of a threeyear contract 
between the television academy and newcomer fox the 1987 show was a 
ratings disaster last years nielsens showed improvement but still 
embarrassed academy officials 
this year should be much better predicted john moffit 
coexecutive producer of the emmycast fox has been very strong on 
sunday night last weeks ratings showed foxs married with 
children in the 17th position and totally hidden video in 33rd 
fox the academy and the producers also sent letters to and 
called the nominees to try to prevent a repeat of 1988s parade of 
noshows designated accepter tony danza came to the stage so many 
times he finally exclaimed whats the matter with you people 
where are you 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
production designers moffit and pat tourk lee strove for a new 
look and a tighter show at the 41st annual emmys gone were the 
meaningless production numbers and the endless number of nominee 
clips but moffit admitted that certain elements cannot be 
regulated particularly the acceptance speeches 
we urged the nominees to be scintillating and succinct in their 
acceptances said the veteran producerdirector you always hope 
for that spontaneous reaction like when alan alda won a writing 
award and did a cartwheel on his way to the stage 
there was hope among academy executives that the emmycast would 
return to one of the three major networks for a ratings rejuvenation 
next year when bidding reopens however fox has the right of first 
refusal before abc cbs nbc and others can enter the bidding 
process 
one reason emmy ratings plummeted while on fox was that the young 
networks coverage of the country is far less than that of the big 
three networks many tv academy officials think their annual emmy 
show deserves broader exposure 
strong counterprogramming was the rule of thumb sunday night on 
the three major networks abc scheduled the jack nicholsonkathleen 
turner hit movie prizzis honor cbs scheduled a preview of its 
new fall shows and the steve martindaryl hannah film comedy 
roxanne nbc struck back with reruns of the family ties 
finale and bionic showdown

leslie s victor adorned his office wall with a 
portrait of himself as a monarch complete with a crown and royal 
finery 
but to authorities unraveling a corporate bankruptcy case he is 
nothing but the king of con a man who may have embezzled 50 
million or more from investors banks and companies he controlled 
after following a paper trail through us bankruptcy court 
investigators say they are dealing with an avid gambler and 
extravagant spender a deceiver who practiced law without a license 
and falsely represented himself as a certified public accountant 
hes a brilliant but degenerate individual said martin 
pollner the courtappointed trustee of the bankruptcy case 
he also is missing he disappeared after spending the weekend of 
july 22 gambling in atlantic city nj with 200000 embezzled 
from a connecticut bank a few days earlier pollner said 
he left behind evidence of an opulent lifestyle 
according to authorities victor spent 500000 for a party at 
manhattans pierre hotel for his 10th wedding anniversary he 
shopped for 2500 suits and 500 ties at a store where appointments 
are required in one day he spent 350000 for jewelry at cartier 
his 5000amonth apartment now sealed by court order is 
filled with japanese art and oriental rugs pollner said 
victor was the vice president and sole operating officer of the 
corporations in the bankruptcy case seven companies under the 
umbrella of maruki usa co inc and funded mainly by japanese 
investors 
the companies which went into bankruptcy proceedings last year 
owned dozens of restaurants across the united states and in england 
as well as a restaurant equipment leasing firm until his 
disappearance victor reported to pollner each day guiding the 
companies through the bankruptcy process 
pollner said the fraud by victor was uncovered as accountants and 
private investigators tried to untangle marukis finances and find 
money to pay back its many creditors 
three major schemes emerged he said in one victor persuaded 
hundreds of people to invest in nonexistent real estate 
partnerships by promising tax shelters and profitable returns the 
investors from all walks of life gave victor anywhere from 15000 
to 600000 pollner said 
pollner said victor also defrauded banks of millions of dollars 
by using phony documents to get financing for restaurant equipment 
never purchased 
victor also allegedly diverted millions from the maruki companies 
to casinos to pay his massive gambling debts 
he is tremendous in terms of convincing people of his 
credibility pollner said i think hes one of the greatest con 
men of the century 
in victors manhattan office pollner found letterhead and 
business cards falsely identifying victor as a lawyer and certified 
public accountant he said victor apparently illegally practiced 
both professions 
little information was available about victors background except 
that he was born in brooklyn his personal papers list two different 
dates of birth one in 1939 and one in 1943 his wife cheryl was 
in italy at the time of victors disappearance according to the new 
york times 
john drucker victors lawyer said he could not comment on 
pollners allegations 
joe valiquette an fbi spokesman declined to discuss details of 
victors life the bureau was called into the case after victors 
flight a worldwide alert was issued for victors arrest on 
bankruptcy fraud charges on july 26 
he certainly has the means to travel anywhere in the world

a judge who is about to swap the bench for the 
bright lights of television news says there is not much difference 
between the two careers 
a judge works to get the facts concerning a situation and puts 
them together in the form of a verdict and delivers it to an 
audience the jury said dallas district judge catherine crier 
who will turn in her gavel next month to become a cable news network 
anchor 
i would say the parallels are considerable 
the 34yearold judge the youngest woman ever elected to the 
texas bench is known in courthouse circles for her nononsense 
demeanor 
ms crier who has handled a range of felony cases leaves the 
courthouse sept 30 and cnn officials said she could be on the air 
the middle next month 
she has no news experience but learned to like the public 
spotlight while giving speeches in the legal community 
i have been doing quite a bit of public speaking since my 
precampaign days ms crier said in an interview last week i 
started to think of a way i might be able to combine my careers 
she hired jack hubbard a former talent scout with cbs as her 
agent hubbard helped make a videotape of her delivering the news 
and took it to atlantabased cnn 
considering the number of tapes we receive when i open the box 
i expect to see someone i dont want to hire said paul amos cnn 
executive vice president of programming and the fact that she 
didnt have any news experience didnt help but when i saw the tape 
i realized judge crier had real potential 
amos said ms criers legal background and public speaking work 
has left her better prepared than most new anchors 
in college actor ryan oneal proclaimed ms crier one of the 
university of texas 10 most beautiful women she graduated from 
southern methodist university law school then became a prosecutor 
she has been on the bench since 1984 when she defeated incumbent 
judge dee brown walker 
some district court colleagues support her career change 
i was totally unprepared to hear that she was entering a career 
in electronic journalism said judge harold entz but i think 
her career opportunity is very exciting and i look forward to 
following her career with cnn she will be a great journalist 
because she is a strong ethical advocate 
judge ron chapman said its kind of ironic she will probably 
be making three times what she makes as a judge 
as a judge ms crier is paid 87250 a year she and cnn 
declined to say what shell make there 
she earned a b average in the annual report card poll by the 
dallas bar association eighty percent of 725 attorneys surveyed 
gave ms crier good marks for impartiality hard work and correctly 
applying the law about 20 percent did not approve of her overall 
performance 
amos said cnn is confident shell be wellreceived he isnt

i could hire an anchor with 10 years of experience in the top 
five markets in the country and it would be a risk because you never 
know who will make it he said but the people who reap the 
greatest rewards are those who take risks

holly hunter winner of an emmy as best 
actress in a drama special for rowe vs wade spoke out 
backstage for abortion rights but the movies writer called it a 
story that takes no sides 
i think this is an award for the drama not the politics 
said alison cross coproducer and writer roe vs wade which 
shared the emmy for outstanding drama special 
i dont think the academy gave us this award as a prochoice 
statement she said 
cross forced by nbc to rewrite the script 20 times ostensibly 
to remove any editorial viewpoint said we tried very hard to 
make this as good a show as possible and not make compromises 
necessary for television 
the show told the story of norma mccorvey the real life jane 
roe whose us supreme court case established a womans legal 
right to abortion 
in her acceptance speech hunter who portrayed the mccorvey 
character thanked her for continuing to fight and keep women from 
being secondclass citizens and for refusing to give up her right 
for reproductive choice 
backstage she reiterated her views and said in an answer to a 
question that roe vs wade did not take a middleoftheroad 
stance 
it couldnt be right down the middle she said the story 
was following a woman fighting for a prochoice right 
roe vs wade was not the only winner inspired by news 
headlines 
writer abby mann who won for his murderers among us the 
simon wiesenthal story criticized the tv industry for not 
addressing serious subjects more frequently 
the industry as a whole is terribly cowardly and ignorant 
toward those subjects he said and im ashamed of it 
he said his next project is a book on the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial which he hopes will become a movie 
actor larry drake who won for his role of a mentally retarded 
man on la law said his award meant more because his character 
is well received by the mentally retarded community 
producer and writer david rintels whose day one the story 
of the making of the first us atomic bomb tied with roe vs 
wade for outstanding drama special said it was a hard fight 
getting the show on the air 
it took 4 half years he said it took some courageous 
support from the network cbs it was thrilling that we had the 
resources and support to do it the way we wanted 
even the comedy winners seemed in a serious mood this year they 
spoke of their surprise at winning and how worthy their opponents 
were 
rhea perlman who won as best supporting actress for the fourth 
time for her role in cheers wasnt cheering i dont think 
anybody deserves it this many times she said 
diane english who won for writing murphy brown wondered 
aloud about how her emmy would boost the shows sale price in the 
television syndication market 
and richard mulligan who won for his lead role in empty 
nest wasnt in a joking mood either i dont know that im a 
funny person he said billy crystal is funny robin williams is 
funny im just an actor who can get it on

there should be an emmy for sundays primetime 
emmy awards show it was workmanlike had some funny bits some 
surprises and moved along smartly for the most part it also 
included a miracle 
it ended five minutes early 
never ever have i seen this happen with an awards show 
particularly the emmy awards show it tends to be televisions 
equivalent of the long march not so sundays 41st annual exercise 
in tube tribute 
broadcast by fox broadcasting the twohour 55minute emmyganza 
conducted on a set full of stylized blue and mauve mockups of old 
tv sets was a model of painless awarding 
produced by john c moffitt and pat tourk lee and crisply 
directed by walter miller sundays show could have been a nightmare 
in nostalgia having warned beforehand that it would have a 
50thanniversaryoftv theme 
but the clips of tvs past and present were wellchosen they 
were run in various welledited categories such as tv wives where 
one could marvel at the contrast between yesteryears very proper 
the donna reed show with todays rowdy marriedwith 
children 
the acceptance speeches by and large were over with quickly 
and only one acting winner dana delany of abcs china beach 
was heard to say i would first like to thank my agent 
and while lonesome dove star robert duvall an emmy 
presenter predictably joked about poking along there was an 
amazing development as the night wore on it had been thought that 
cbs highrated old west miniseries would get the major emmys it 
didnt save for bestdirection honors 
early on the emmy show took sly digs at such things as the bits 
of simulation and story dramatization that this year have 
slipped into some network news programs 
example robert altman wasnt on hand for his emmy for directing 
tanner 88 however duvall told viewers abc has been kind 
enough to furnish us with an exclusive acceptance simulation 
there ensued a blackandwhite videotaped scene of street corner 
late at night there a lady in a trench coat furtively slipped the 
emmy to a man in a trench coat there was no time code running on 
the videotape so im inclined to think it was from abcs 
enterainment division or something 
not all the joshing of awol awardees worked though one for 
absent winner carroll oconnor had an actor mumbling from within 
his knights suit of armor that made no sense not even for tv 
but on balance emmy night was a pretty good night as these 
things go with milton berle closing it by reminding those who 
didnt win to just remember theres always radio 
fox which filched emmy night from the cbs nbc and abc networks 
and now has broadcast it three consecutive years must decide 
whether to reup for a fourth year or yield this festival of statues 
back to the big three 
no matter what happens remember one thing on sunday night 
emmys awards in separate categories even went to the grammy and tony 
award shows of last season 
if they can give awards to other award shows maybe next year 
they can give an emmy for sundays show that might sound strange 
an awards show awarding itself for achievement 
but that is the magic of television

virginia lt gov l douglas wilder trying to 
become the nations first black elected governor says his bid for 
office should be viewed as an arithmetic progression rather than 
a referendum on his race 
sitting in his campaign headquarters in suburban mclean va 
wilder insisted that his election would send a message more 
important than trumpeting the success of a black man from 
richmond capital of the old confederacy 
at the same time it was clear during a recent interview that 
wilder is aware of the historical significance of his spot at the 
head of the democratic ticket in a state capital where blacks were 
for so long barred from the political and social corridors of power 
he talked of how a close friend state sen madison marye a 
white man with a rich southern drawl quipped that my grandfather 
was a confederate army captain and your granddaddy was a slave 
still he shies away from emphasizing race 
the important thing is that it sends a message that says you 
dont have to be connected politically you dont have to be born to 
money wilder said 
and that he said is a worthwhile message for young people of 
all races 
you see a lot of times unfortunately everyone believes the 
other guys got it made im the only one that has a hard time 
because im black but every white person in the world has got it 
made he said and you know i dont have to tell you its 
silly 
determined to stake out his own identity one not marked by race 
wilder said he does not want jesse jackson to campaign for him as 
he seeks to move from no 2 to no 1 in virginia 
its not a rejection of jackson he said i think jesse is 
an activist i have been involved with compromises getting 
half the loaf when you couldnt get the whole loaf i dont want to 
walk away emptyhanded 
wilder said his style of political accommodation with adversaries 
forces you to a broader constituency and that while serving as 
the only black in the virginia senate he came under pressure 
because people thought i was representing black virginia 
but times have changed in the state he said so that what you 
have now is what i call a new mainstream and im a part of it 
most people that i come in contact with are interested in where 
we go from here he said they dont give a rip about the 
past its rather poetic and ironic 
he does plan to have comedian bill cosby appear at a fundraising 
event because hes an entertainer but is not having any 
political figures from outside 
wilder said that attempts by republican opponent j marshall 
coleman to depict him as a michael dukakistype liberal wont work 
im not a mike dukakis he said i have a record and a 
proven record the american people really never knew dukakis and 
this has nothing to do with disparaging michael dukakis 
wilder supported dukakis for president last november but stayed 
neutral during the primary season jackson won the virginia 
democratic presidential primary without wilders help 
as he campaigns against coleman a former attorney general with 
a youthful telegenic appearance wilder acknowledged that he is 
confronted with whispers that his efforts will be undermined by a 
labor day weekend disturbance mostly involving young blacks in 
virginia beach va 
asked whether his campaign would suffer because of the riots and 
looting wilder replied if i was an unknown quantity maybe yes 
but people know me they know that i would not tolerate that 
nonsense and they dont look at me as a black lieutenant 
governor somebody outside virginia who wouldnt know might 
think that 
except for plenty of white hair showing the passage of time 
wilder at 58 looks much the same as he did 20 years ago when first 
elected to the virginia senate 
he complained of news accounts resurfacing about a story that 
arose during his 1985 campaign for lieutenant governor accounts of 
his ownership of an allegedly dilapidated building in richmond 
wilder denied anew that the building was a slum said no one had 
been living there that he had it repaired and transferred the 
mortgage to a trust with himself as the beneficiary to put the 
issue behind him 
he said the building never was cited as a public nuisance 
despite a grand jury investigation and insisted he had gone 
undergone intense press scrutiny on the matter

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
exaggerating his political problems warning of economic trouble 
and a possible coup against himself in a bid to consolidate his 
power some us analysts say 
there has been a deliberate creating of a sense of crisis so 
that he can undercut the conservatives said jerry hough a 
scholar of soviet affairs at duke university 
us government analysts divide into two main camps on 
gorbachevs troubles which stem from severe shortages of consumer 
and other goods and nationalist movements that have gained steam 
with the relaxation of political controls 
conservatives at the pentagon the central intelligence agency 
and some universities are warning the bush administration that 
gorbachev could fall victim to a conservative reaction jeopardizing 
proposed agreements on arms control and human rights 
those agreements will come under discussion on thursday and 
friday at a meeting in wyoming between secretary of state james a 
baker iii and his soviet counterpart eduard a shevardnadze 
the conservative viewpoint has found an outlet in the speeches of 
defense secretary richard cheney and public writings of peter 
reddaway a political scientist at george washington university in 
washington 
the soviet union is drifting toward a state of anarchy in which 
it is going to be difficult to assert political control said 
reddaway 
however the state department and some analysts at cia take a 
more moderate view placing little credence in warnings of a 
conservative coup or predictions of a popular uprising against 
gorbachev such as that forecast by soviet political maverick boris 
n yeltsin in new york and baltimore last week 
we tend to think that there has been a lot of hysteria that 
gorbachev is in a stronger position than the pessimists have been 
saying said one government official espousing the moderate view 
and speaking on condition of anonymity 
the administration so far guided by the moderate view of soviet 
politics is moving to lock in some soviet positions that we have 
not seen before in arms control and human rights said one state 
department source 
but the skeptics have the ear of president bush persuading him 
last week to avoid an oval office meeting with yeltsin who has 
emerged as gorbachevs most prominent critic 
yeltsin met instead with white house national security adviser 
brent scowcroft bush and vice president dan quayle stopped in for a 
15minute chat with yeltsin but the white house did not release its 
customary photograph of the event 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater explained that the 
administration did not want to provide yeltsin a platform for 
dissidence 
for the united states reddaway said in a recent interview the 
best policy is one of keeping very quiet 
what is going to happen is rather unpredictable and the united 
states does not want to get branded with responsibility in any way 
for what is going on reddaway said 
recent talk of a coup was kindled by andrei d sakharov the 
nobel peace laureate and member of parliament who warned in an 
article published july 30 in the weekly ogonyok that any tragic 
thing is possible 
i think that a rightwing coup is possible a military coup 
is also possible in such a situation sakharov wrote 
sakharovs remarks came on the heels of a communist party central 
committee meeting at which party stalwarts whose authority has been 
undercut by gorbachev expressed fears that the situation was 
spinning out of control 
gorbachev further fanned the fires in a speech sept 9 saying he 
faced threats from both sides 
it is a fact that some people would like to create in this 
society an atmosphere of alarm a feeling that there is no way out 
a feeling of uncertainty he said 
in this multivoice choir we can hear threats of approaching 
chaos and talk of a threatened coup and even of civil war 
gorbachev said

six months after taking command of the energy 
department and vowing to steer its nuclear weapons program out of 
troubled seas retired adm james d watkins is spending as much 
time bailing water as setting the new course 
the latest crisis was a threat last week that the rocky flats 
weapons plant near denver would be shut down because of acknowledged 
illegal storage of waste from plutonium processing the plant is a 
critical link in the nuclear arms production chain 
rockwell international corp which operates the plant under a 
government contract decided over the weekend to delay a decision on 
closing the plant so officials can work on a plan to bring the 
plants waste storage into compliance 
also last week watkins faced a court order eventually 
withdrawn to appear before a federal judge in ohio to help resolve 
a dispute over a 78 million settlement of a lawsuit by neighbors of 
a weapons plant near cincinnati that watkins acknowledges is 
violating environmental regulations 
us district judge s arthur spiegel backed down after watkins 
refused to testify but the judge said he saw confusion and 
indecision at the highest level of the department 
before that it was idaho gov cecil andrus closing his states 
borders to shipments of radioactive waste from rocky flats a move 
that could force watkins to halt production at the colorado plant as 
early as next march andrus acted after the department failed to 
open a waste repository in new mexico as scheduled 
one day before that a federal judge in washington stopped 
watkins from awarding a 10 billion contract to bechtel national 
inc to manage a proposed highlevel nuclear waste dump in nevada 
at the same time watkins was negotiating with westinghouse 
electric corp over a timetable for completing repairs to the idled 
savannah river nuclear reactors in south carolina that are the 
nations only source of tritium gas used in nuclear warheads 
all this happened in the space of two weeks bursts of political 
fallout from years of government neglect of a bombproducing system 
that congressional auditors recently called one of the most 
dangerous industrial complexes in the world 
watkins has spent much of his first halfyear as energy secretary 
managing crises in virtually every part of the nuclear weapons 
program reactor breakdowns lawsuits by citizens and states 
setbacks in waste storage lapses in security at topsecret weapons 
labs plant raids by the fbi and money fights with congress 
a strapping articulate man who usually projects a strong sense 
of selfconfidence watkins last week sounded frustrated and 
unsettled by his inability so far to accomplish the turnaround he 
promised when he took the job in march 
i have been overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of the 
problems in the weapons program watkins told an advisory group 
adding that no one in the bush administration including the 
president realized how long it would take to fix it 
i dont think either of us had a feel for the complexity of 
the problems he said nor the significance of a department morale 
problem that watkins attributed to the reagan administrations 
attempts to abolish the department 
what we have is eight years of a department sitting there 
waiting to be canceled for lack of interest so theres a lack of 
zeal among the workers he said 
watkins declined requests for an interview but aides are quick 
to defend his record 
were beginning to see signs of change said henson moore 
the deputy secretary we havent changed the attitudes overnight 
and we knew they wouldnt be 
recent disclosures of waste management problems at many weapons 
plants including alleged illegal burning of hazardous wastes at 
rocky flats also are causing turmoil among the private companies 
that run the plants under government contracts 
watkins said some of these contractors are having second thoughts 
about renewing their contracts 
there is a period of confusion with our contractors who dont 
know whether or not theyre going to go to jail for the alleged 
environmental violations he said 
watkins isnt giving up the ship in a memorandum to all 
department employees sept 5 he outlined a new course that he 
said must be established for the department as quickly as 
possible among the items he singled out for special corrective 
action was the system for reporting accidents and other events 
affecting the environment health safety or security 
crisis management after the fact has become the norm too 
often watkins wrote

house minority leader robert michel is cleaning 
out his desk and filing cabinets but that doesnt mean hes giving 
up leadership of the apparently perpetual republican minority 
to the contrary i hope to be creating even more documents 
michel said as he announced earlier this month he is turning over 
three decades worth of political papers documents pictures and 
memorabilia to the everett mckinley dirksen congressional research 
center at pekin ill 
michel used the occasion to talk about leadership in the house 
about the congressional leaders he has known and about the woes and 
challenges of leading the gop minority as he has since 1980 
republicans last held a house majority in 1954 two years before 
michel first was elected to congress from illinois 
the minority leader opened with dirksen the illinois republican 
who served as senate minority leader during the 1960s 
there are those who say he wanted to be on the stage michel 
noted i think he was a better actor than the late sir laurence 
olivier ev had flair he had a sense of the dramatic a feel for 
the shifting mood of an audience an uncanny sense of timing 
he had a carefully constructed political image before the word 
image became popular in politics his hai said to be combed each 
morning with an egg beater was his trademark 
he loved to put words together in a bill and votes together on 
the floor 
completing that thumbnail sketch michel turned to others 
house speaker sam rayburn of texas alone aloof 
majestical although not tall in stature he was every inch the 
speaker of the house and everybody knew it 
house minority leader joe martin rmass like rayburn he was 
a bachelor married to the house 
speaker john mccormick dmass he was always pulling from 
his coat pockets wrinkled papers and folded documents i can see him 
now waving them like a trial lawyer at his opponents in debate 
house minority leader charles halleck rill a firebrand 
aggressive redfaced mixing it up in debate on the floor 
as minority leader michel says he has come to believe that 
rivalry between republicans and democrats is not the most important 
division he has to face 
more important at times are liberalconservative differences 
regional differences differences among states factions within 
parties fights between communities over turf and of course the 
435 different personalities ambitions dreams and character flaws 
each of these groups interacts with the others in a constantly 
shifting volatile mixture of emotions and ambitions and ideals 
michel said and noted 
a personal grudge a secret ambition a hidden motive an 
unspoken agreement can all mean more on a given issue than partisan 
differences a house leader has to know these things 
but there also has to be communication in every direction an 
ability to leap into debate on a moments notice and michel says 
an ability to stop speaking stop communicating and simply listen 
michel is a political moderate as he sees it the house does not 
lend itself to the theoretical abstraction of ideologues 
ideological activists believe they know the truth and they 
dont want to negotiate or compromise or even talk about 
compromise he said but in the house the ability to strike a 
wise compromise is an essential part of leadership 
there has to be an understanding he said that there are times 
that subtle maneuvers can succeed where a frontal attack will almost 
certainly fail 
most members of the house he said dont want their leaders 
sending them into unwinnable battles 
members of the house and their leaders in particular are the 
nations most exposed national politicians closest to the people 
up for reelection every two years both ears always open to the 
sound of social and economic change michel says 
we dont have four years like a president or six years like a 
senator to hide our mistakes michel said we serve as a kind of 
distant earlywarning system for democracy we are ever aware of new 
problems 
and we are also aware of the clumsy legislative means at our 
disposal to deal with those problems he said

where the kura river broadens from its 
forested gorge into meskhetias tan fields eight soviet georgians 
wielding clubs block any ethnic turks seeking to return to their 
homeland 
policemen at a nearby checkpoint are happy for the help just in 
case the next bus is packed with meskhetian turks bent on violence 
against meskhetian georgians 
we dont know how many there will be and if theyll be armed 
or not one officer said on condition of anonymity 
three hundred years as a turkish province split meskhetia a 
region in southern georgia into georgianspeaking christians and 
turkishspeaking moslems 
then in 1944 josef stalin had the turks packed into cattle cars 
and deported to uzbekistan in central asia 
despite the officers fears it is the turks who have been hacked 
to pieces and burned alive in recent months a pogrom in uzbekistan 
in june claimed 100 lives and sent thousands fleeing 
but even after being uprooted for the second time in 45 years 
the turks are barred from returning home the georgians and 
armenians living in meskhetia are worried that an influx of turks 
might stir up centuries of moslemchristian feuding 
somehow president mikhail s gorbachev must resolve this 
deadlock and at least 40 other deeprooted ethnic conflicts 
between the more than 130 nationalities peopling the soviet union 
if he hopes to hold the country together 
on tuesday the communist partys policymaking central committee 
opens a meeting devoted to ethnic problems following months of 
strikes and ethnic unrest that for some soviets herald the breakup 
of the empire 
the disputes are territorial they involve political power or 
are matters of language independence religion culture 
gorbachev has promised a special meeting of the party leadership 
to solve the ethnic problems that have raged for more than 1 years 
since azerbaijaniarmenian rioting in february 1988 that claimed 31 
lives 
on aug 17 the party issued its proposed solution which was to 
give more power to the republics and regions long dominated by 
moscow the document also calls for legal guarantees of minority 
rights and local selfgovernment for small ethnic groups 
there was not a word about the specific complaints of the peoples 
of many regions in turmoil including meskhetia 
we personally saw nothing there for us ibragim medzhidoglu 
a turkish refugee from uzbekistan said of the document 
more power to autonomous republics would be helpful if the turks 
dominated meskhetia but the territory is closed to us he said 
in moscow 
while communist leaders cast about for compromises hundreds of 
meskhetian turks are virtually camped in the oncetidy reception 
area of the government presidium in moscow where they make daily 
appeals for aid most are among the 35000 meskhetians who fled the 
violence in uzbekistan 
the petitioners are now adrift in the soviet system with no jobs 
and no homes but with a fierce desire to return to meskhetia 
national authorities moved quickly to protect the meskhetians 
from wellorganized attackers in uzbekistan since then they have 
offered the meskhetians refugee camps in the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan or cottages in central russia and byelorussia abandoned 
by peasants moving to cities said one man on condition of anonymity 
our goal is a peaceful route to regaining our homeland he 
said 
the meskhetians have been pleading to return to georgia for 
decades signing hundreds of petitions but returning is not as 
simple as rescinding stalins order which shipped more than 150000 
meskhetian turks to central asia in november 1944 stalin allegedly 
was convinced that turkey was about to attack 
soviet residency permits are still tightly controlled and tied 
to existing jobs and scarce apartments 
the meskhetian georgians some of whom moved into the turks 
former homes definitely dont want them back they say their former 
neighbors were also old enemies in a moslemchristian conflict based 
more on rival cultures than on religion and they recall relatives 
killed and terrorized by the turks 
they killed they robbed they raped said avtandil 
diasamidze an older man in the village of vale it was impossible 
for a wife to take food to her husband working in the fields 
because the turks would attack her 
meskhetia was the cradle of georgian civilization but became a 
province of the ottoman turkish empire for 300 years until the 
russian czar took over in the early 19th century 
the landscape is a constant reminder of the conflict with its 
ruined watchtowers and mountaintops denuded of forests reportedly 
by turks trying to burn out georgian partisans hiding in the trees 
since the moslem preference for large families has multiplied the 
meskhetian turks to 360000 compared to the 200000 christian 
residents of meskhetia some turks say their majority gives them the 
right to demand the area be separated from georgia 
if we are allowed back we will ask for autonomy said sattar 
iskandarov a meskhetian studying in moscow who is taking part in 
the vigil at the presidium office 
some turkish activists have even called for deporting georgians 
so the turks can replace them said shalva shanidze communist party 
chief in akhaltsike the largest city in meskhetia 
why solve the first mistake with another he said 
a prepogrom plan to return several hundred meskhetian turkish 
families to meskhetia was scrapped after georgians heard that some 
turks planned to demand autonomy shanidze said 
friction started when the turks came and saw people had been 
living for 45 years in their houses shanidze said they came 
and said this is our home throw them out 
besides shanidze said we dont have enough land to support 
hundreds of thousands of new residents most of them farmers 
demanding at least a garden plot if not fields to lease 
with the way to their homeland blocked some meskhetian turks are 
seeking to emigrate to turkey if the soviet government will allow it 
sevki mutevellioglu first secretary of the turkish embassy in 
moscow said 5000 to 10000 meskhetians are seeking soviet exit 
visas to emigrate 
to refuse them is out of the question he said even though 
turkey is already overwhelmed by refugees as bulgaria expels tens of 
thousands of its own ethnic turks 
iskandarov who wants to go to turkey said the violence in 
uzbekistan has left him with no faith that the meskhetian turks will 
ever have a safe home among the soviet people

a private thinktank analyst says development 
of rural america has been hampered by a mistaken tendency to 
associate the wellbeing of communities with farming 
secondly says louis e swanson in resources quarterly there is 
a false assumption that with the possible exception of farmers 
rural people are doing well 
at least five factors have impaired rural policy development in 
congress and the federal bureaucracy he said these include 
an unrealistic often romantic view of a bucolic rural economy 
and society 
serious limitations to existing social and economic data on 
sparsely populated areas 
the treatment of rural america as a geographical entity 
unconnected to the larger us economy and society 
a perception that many rural areas do not have viable political 
solutions 
the absence of a unified rural constituency and the presence of 
a formidable opposition to renovated and new rural development 
programs 
a report by an agriculture department task force earlier this 
year said the rural economy has difficulty keeping pace with 
national economic growth because of the small size of communities 
isolation unskilled labor and a lack of institutional support 
the task forces recommendations which are still under review by 
usda said the department should begin by committing itself to 
rural development as a major mission and should articulate clear 
goals 
one of swansons criticisms was that usda and the network of 
landgrant universities have been relatively passive opponents 
of rural development for many years 
their opposition has taken the form of neglect he said 
they define their mission as primarily to assist commercial 
agriculture and in so doing believe they help all rural people 
swanson is an associate professor of sociology at the university 
of kentucky and was a resident fellow in the national center for 
food and agricultural policy at resources for the future a 
nonprofit independent organization that conducts research on the 
development conservation and use of natural resources and the 
environment 
in his report swanson said that rural america long ago shed its 
overwhelming dependency on farming 
for example he noted in 1984 most rural employment nationally 
was accounted for by manufacturing 40 percent services and trade 
165 percent government 13 percent farming 9 percent and 
mining about 55 percent 
moreover for the same year farm families reported that more 
than 60 percent of their net family income came from offfarm jobs 
of more than 3000 counties in the united states only 617 are 
considered agriculturally dependent he said and those account for 
less than 7 percent of the national population 
by the late 1980s then the old axiom that farm wellbeing 
and by inference farm programs determine rural wellbeing was no 
longer useful swanson said certainly some rural economies 
continue to depend on farming but this is the exception rather than 
the rule 
as to the assumption that rural people except for farmers are 
doing all right swanson said that claim has been based on reports 
of rural population growth between 1973 and 1983 rural counties 
did grow faster than urban counties and many social experts 
proclaimed a rural renaissance 
however most of the population growth was due to a combination 
of residential mobility and natural population growth he said 
the former was simply part of the postworld war ii process of 
suburbanization and not migration 
swansons and other studies are coming along just as congress is 
cranking up again for a shot at solving the problems of rural 
america legislation for hastening rural development has cleared the 
senate and the house is working on a version 
ironically he said it was the financial crunch on farmers 
during the mid1980s that spurred the renewed interest in rural 
development 
since part of the problem was the assumption that farm 
wellbeing determines rural community wellbeing the reintroduction 
of rural development in the context of a farm crisis had the effect 
of reaffirming this assumption swanson said 
the public still appears to associate farming with rural 
wellbeing and to believe that the farm programs of the past 50 
years have helped farm families he added in fact the evidence 
is that these programs have facilitated the decline in the number of 
family farms 
rural development should be seen as part of a longterm national 
strategy to upgrade our human resources while providing employment 
opportunities and basic services swanson said unfortunately 
neither congress nor the general public appears to be willing to 
make such a longterm national commitment

the whistle of steam locomotives has 
returned to the south rim and officials say it could usher in a 
cleaner era at the crowded grand canyon overlook 
the grand canyon railway was to haul its first paying passengers 
today over the 64 miles from williams to the south rim 88 years 
after the first train chugged over the sinous route leading from 
pine forests to the bloodred sandstone of the canyon 
the railway which resumed its run sunday restores service that 
was ended in 1968 since then most of the 35 million annual 
visitors to the rim have arrived by automobile 
the railroad plans weekend service until november and daily 
service next year using only steam locomotives over a route that 
the atchison topeka and santa fe railroad considered the toughest 
on its system when it was completed in 1901 
the railway plans to build a 400room hotel a 
turnofthecentury theme park and an american indian cultural 
center in williams and later build a hotel near the grand canyon 
airport at tusayan 10 miles south of the south rim 
an hourly train shuttle from the airport to the rim should reduce 
pollution said max biegert the railroads developer a recent 
northern arizona university study predicted that train ridership 
could reduce motor traffic to the rim by 40 percent 
biegert said he expects the line to carry 135000 passengers next 
year and up to 500000 annually in years to come providing jobs for 
about 800 people 
on sundays inaugural ride about 500 people including gov rose 
mofford rode aboard seven 80footlong harriman coach cars that 
recalled the glamor of turnofthecentury railroading 
mofford hailed the development as an economic boost to the 
northern arizona while eugene hughes the president of northern 
arizona university in nearby flagstaff waxed sentimental 
as a child my visions of exotic travel were always likened to 
the railroads he saidin an era of jet lag and frenetic 
freeways its nice to know that a person can slow down the pace of 
things to what they used to be 
the williams depot a tealgray onestory addition to the 
historic fray marcos hotel was bedecked with redwhiteandblue 
bunting 
people turned out in traditional old west garb the women in 
gingham dresses and men in vests neckerchiefs and canvas breeches 
called duckins the trip began in part of the nations largest 
stand of ponderosa pine moved past the cones of dormant volcanoes 
and onto the austere plains of the colorado plateau ending with a 
series of switchbacks 
at the northern terminus only 200 yards from the rim the 
passengers took part in a spikedriving ceremony and briefly viewed 
the canyon before the return trip 
planners believe the railroad an entirely private venture will 
encourage people to spend more time studying and hiking in the 
canyon rather than gazing off the rim

the house will focus this week on protecting 
the nations waters against oil spills while a house subcommittee 
considers president bushs bill to improve americas air quality 
meanwhile republicans say they may propose a new strategy to pay 
for the war on drugs senate minority leader bob dole said sunday 
the gop could make a counteroffer to the democrats proposed 22 
billion addition to president bushs overall 79 billion antidrug 
plan 
the oil spill legislation will be on the house floor thursday 
just a week after exxon finished its summer cleanup of the exxon 
valdez accident off prince william sound alaska 
the cleanup of the nations worst oil spill ended with a dispute 
over the extent of environmental recovery and the legislation to 
prevent future accidents is just as controversial 
the shape of the legislation is still under negotiation two 
competing bills would establish new shipping rules and make those 
involved in oil transportation pay cleanup costs 
but still unsettled is the most crucial issue whether the 
federal government will be allowed to preempt state laws including 
statutes in 17 states that have no limits on liability for those 
responsible for spills 
the two bills would allow preemption but environmental groups 
and the national governors association are trying to convince their 
house supporters to let tougher state laws remain in effect reps 
george miller dcalif and gerry studds dmass are preparing an 
amendment to establish minimum federal liability requirements but 
permit states to enact tougher laws 
meanwhile members of the house energy and commerce environment 
subcommittee have finished listening to each others opening 
statements and are ready to consider amendments to bushs clean air 
bill 
battles are expected over the extent of auto emission 
requirements sharing the cost of acid rain reduction and strict 
limits on utility growth after the year 2000 
with just two weeks left before a new fiscal year begins 
congress also is trying to pass a dozen money bills to keep the 
government operating but theres a major disagreement over how much 
to spend to fight illegal drugs 
dole speaking sunday on nbcs meet the press said i 
dont think we find any problem in the presidents package and 
added that other ways should be found to finance the plan than 
democrats proposed acrosstheboard budget cuts 
but senate judiciary chairman joseph biden ddel contends 
there are glaring deficiencies in bushs plan he said democrats 
will be content only if the growth in the number of cocaine addicts 
is reversed drug treatment is provided for all who want it and drug 
education is extended to nearly every school child in the country 
a spending bill before the house would provide 270 million for 
increased security and weapons detection systems at airports 
the oil spill legislation approved by the merchant marine and 
fisheries committee bill would establish a maximum 60 million 
liability for owners and operators of vessels involved in spills 
legislation approved by the committee on public works and 
transportation would establish a 150 million cleanup liability 
those figures would apply when the spill is not caused by gross 
negligence or willful misconduct if there is gross negligence or 
misconduct there would be no liability limit 
the millerstudds amendment would substantially increase the caps 
on liability allow unlimited liability for simple negligence rather 
than gross negligence and allow states to enforce their own tougher 
laws 
less controversial provisions would toughen license requirements 
for ship captains and pilots set standards for qualifications of 
crewmen on foreign tankers establish studies of tanker navigation 
safety standards expand federal authority to assume command of 
cleanups and require establishment of local contingency plans 
an oil industryfinanced fund would pay for cleanups and 
compensate those who suffered losses when claims exceeded an 
innocent spillers liability

a spokesman for major banks around the world is 
urging the world bank and the international monetary fund to get 
together to aid market forces in the soviet union and its east 
european allies 
the imf and the world bank should make a concerted effort to 
promote change said horst schulmann managing director of the 
washingtonbased institute of international finance which includes 
major banks in the united states britain and other leading 
financial countries 
the imf and world bank are owned by 151 governments with the 
united states taking a major role in both china and some east 
european governments are members but not the soviet union 
these institutions can do more particularly in advising how to 
replace administrative controls with market mechanisms and through 
the funding of structural adjustment efforts schulmann said 
the ifc international finance corp can also be helpful by 
bringing together foreign investors and local enterprises he said 
the ifc a part of the world bank that lends to private business 
rather than governments already invests in poland hungary and 
yugoslavia as well as in china it also has a growing interest in 
helping privatize industry owned by governments 
schulmanns statements were in a letter dated sept 12 to leaders 
of world bank and imf which also is headquartered in washington 
schulmann a west german was an adviser to former chancellor helmut 
schmidt 
schulmanns letter was made public today as representatives of 
leading banks and the 151 governments began gathering for annual 
meetings that will go on until the end of the month treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady will be the chief us representative 
and a speech from president bush is on the schedule 
developments in eastern europe are expected to be among the 
topics another will be international debt and bradys proposal for 
reducing its burden on debtor countries poland and yugoslavia are 
among the major problem debtors 
member countries also will try to make progress on increasing the 
funds 118 billion in assets which managing director michel 
camdessus wants to see doubled 
in recent years the funds money has been used to help debtor 
countries improve their financial positions in a speech on 
thursday camdessus spoke of prospects for change in eastern europe 
this promises to be a major transformation which if 
successful will bring large benefits but there are serious 
risks he said the challenge to these countries and to those 
who should help them are enormous what is certain is that here we 
must not fail 
helping the soviet union and its allies adapt to western ways was 
proposed last week as the task for the fund during the 1990s in a 
study by two us experts they were catherine gwin of the 
rockefeller foundation and richard e feinberg executive vice 
president of the overseas development council a private research 
group both are former state department officials 
the world banks annual report published sunday said a greater 
role for markets in eastern europe would mean a basic change of the 
economic system in many cases privatization would not be needed 
but rather competition where none existed before it added 
trade reform and an opening of the economy to foreign 
competition is often an important element in this process it 
said systemic reform in the socialist economies of the region 
perhaps offers the greatest of challenges given the major 
structural changes required within their economies

surveyors mapmakers and others who need to 
know exactly where they are might find the task more difficult now 
that budget cuts are halting the maintenance of more than 1 million 
place markers across the country 
as a result it may grow increasingly harder to set locations for 
new building projects says max ethridge head of the national 
geodetic survey 
the geodetic reference system control points showing the 
exact latitude longitude and elevation of a spot were installed 
over about a 150year period ethridge said 
but maintenance of those markers has been phased out over the 
last 18 months he said following the elimination of 10 jobs and 
the 550000 budget for the work 
as a result i know that many are being destroyed its just a 
matter of time and we will end up with fewer marks surveys will 
have to cover larger distances to find base points to work from 
ethridge explained 
loss of marker points could complicate the job of setting 
locations and elevations for new projects he explained 
the 35inch diameter brass disks are set in concrete and are 
used to determine the exact locations and directions of roads 
property lines easements and other measurements 
in addition ethridge added the elevation information provided 
by the markers is important in determining water drainage patterns 
ethridge said his agency a part of the commerce department 
continues to establish new locator marks when needed in its effort 
to determine the nations exact dimensions and locations 
but the problem arises when new roads shopping centers or other 
development occurs in a spot where a geodetic marker is already 
located 
in the past when builders came across one of the markers they 
contacted the ngs and it sent out a surveying team to relocate the 
marker that allowed the area to maintain a record of locations 
because the relationship of the old and new benchmarks was known 
the agency also rechecked the elevations and locations of markers 
and made corrections as necessary 
its that maintenance program that has fallen to the budget ax 
explained ethridge 
about half of the states have programs to relocate the markers on 
their own or at the county level he said however not all use the 
same standards as the federal agency and in the other states 
development can simply mean loss of the benchmark 
roy mullen associate chief of the national mapping division at 
the us geological survey said the end of the ngs maintenance 
program should have little effect on his agency however 
the geological surveys national mapping program is 90 percent 
complete mullen said 
the geological survey a part of the interior department has a 
system of marker points of its own but mullen said these are 
largely in areas not covered by the ngs system or where that 
systems markers were not close enough for accurate mapping the ngs 
markers are the basic national surveying system he said 
in recent years satellites have allowed scientists to make new 
studies of the location of points on earth but earthbound 
benchmarks are still needed for precise surveying officials report 
the national geodetic survey was formerly known as the coast and 
geodetic survey geodesy from which the word geodetic is derived 
is the science of measuring the size and shape of the earth 
including elevations and measurements of gravity at various 
locations

two pilots who blew the whistle on 
safety violations at the rock island arsenal say theyve been 
grounded discredited and assigned to minor jobs in reprisal 
the army credits the two civilian pilots curt mcrae 40 and 
lloyd williams 50 with providing evidence that led to improvements 
in safety but arsenal officials deny any action has been taken to 
punish the pilots 
mcraes supervisors said he was grounded because of mental 
instability a claim mcrae denies 
i spent 13 months in vietnam with the marines that was a 
cakewalk compared to what ive gone through at the arsenal mcrae 
said in a recent interview i put up with safety violations and 
broken rules and even participated myself for six years because i 
was afraid of losing my job 
the pilots jobs involved flying army brass equipment and 
dangerous chemicals and weapons across the country the violations 
they reported included failure to report minor aircraft accidents 
falsification of documents and unsafe transportation of hazardous 
cargo 
mcrae made his first report in september 1987 on violations at 
the flight detachment based at quad city airport in nearby moline 
gen marvin brailsford credited him with pointing out 
weaknesses in safety management and operations at the flight 
division 
disciplinary action was taken against supervisors the flight 
detachment was reorganized and new safety checks were added to daily 
routine said brailsford commander of the us army armament 
munitions and chemical command 
but in october 1987 mcrae was grounded this past january he 
was told he would be fired the firing has been suspended while the 
merit systems protection board investigates 
since his grounding mcrae has sorted tools in a machine shop 
while drawing his 39100 annual pilots pay 
they want to make an example out of me he said they are 
trying to destroy any chance i have for employability in the airline 
industry 
williams became involved in the case when as an aviation safety 
officer he followed up on some of mcraes allegations 
williams grounded himself in june 1988 citing the stress of 
standing up for mcrae and testifying against his supervisors at army 
inquiries 
now williams wants to fly although a flight surgeon and 
psychiatrist found him fit to do so he has not been recertified 
the only reasonable explanation for my situation is reprisal 
for whistleblowing said williams who is working as a machinery 
oiler in a lubrication division 
arsenal spokesman al schwartz said williams flight status is 
under review and there is no move to fire him 
pilots who flew with mcrae and williams had divided opinions 
about the case 
chuck hanna who recently retired from the arsenal described the 
two as a couple of fellows trying to get their boss job 
hanna said a personality conflict between mcrae and neil pobanz 
chief of the flight detachment led to problems 
pobanz would say only that he regretted the situation its not 
good for anybody on either side he said thats all i can say 
one pilot who spoke on condition of anonymity said the army 
abrogated all mcraes civil rights after he reported the 
violations attacking his character and stability 
the supervisors at the flight detachment claimed curt was 
suffering from postvietnam stress syndrome if thats true they 
should have treated him and counseled him the pilot said 
schwartz said mcrae was offered the opportunity to return to his 
job in a december 1988 meeting with brailsford and was told he would 
have to work under the supervisors whose violations he reported 
mr mcrae essentially said no according to schwartz 
id go back in an instant mcrae responded but i told the 
general i wont keep my mouth shut and i wont do wrong again

a sixterm congressman seeking to come from 
behind to prevent the governors mansion from falling into 
democratic hands has found his campaign bogged down on issues such 
as homosexual rights and abortion 
rep james courter the republican nominee for governor has been 
trying to close a 17point lead pollsters said his democratic 
opponent us rep james florio held in june 
but courters stands on volatile social issues have kept him on 
the defensive in his quest to succeed gov thomas h kean a popular 
republican who is barred by law from running for a thirdconsecutive 
term 
courter stormed away from a streetcorner news conference last 
week when reporters asked him to clarify a statement that the state 
should not hire avowed homosexuals as teachers camp counselors 
or foster parents 
at the news conference he called to discuss auto insurance 
courter said he would not change state laws to bar homosexuals and 
bristled at suggestions he was changing his mind 
like kean florio has said homosexuality should not be a 
consideration in hiring practices 
abortion has hounded courter since july when the us supreme 
court allowed states to restrict abortion rights the decision 
focused the national debate on new jersey and virginia the only 
states with governors races this year 
florio immediately took a strong stance favoring abortion rights 
courter who previously promised to sign a bill outlawing abortions 
later said he would not impose his views on new jersey his new 
stand angered both sides 
we have had problems said ken connolly courters campaign 
manager but we are going to show over the next seven weeks and 
two days that we are not demoralized and that we are not 
disorganized 
both candidates in novembers election are proven votegetters 
florio 52 an eightterm congressman lost the 1981 race for 
governor to kean by less than 1800 votes the smallest margin in 
state history florio has built his reputation on environmental 
affairs and authored the federal superfund laws to clean up toxic 
waste dumps new jersey leads the nation in the number of toxic 
dumps 
courter 48 who vanquished a large field of candidates in the 
republican primary gained recognition as a member of the 
irancontra committee and is an outspoken proponent of a strong 
national defense 
after junes primary each campaign answered charges of influence 
peddling within federal housing programs 
two top courter aides including former reagan administration 
political strategist roger ailes resigned from the campaign after 
their consulting firms became embroiled in a congressional influence 
peddling investigation of the us department of housing and urban 
development 
one of florios aides resigned after being implicated in an 
investigation of a camden county housing authority located in 
florios district 
as the candidates head into the final stage of the race analysts 
predict the campaign will turn dirty 
i think its going to be nasty said richard roper director 
of princeton universitys council on new jersey affairs and a 
consultant to florios campaign i would be surprised if a lot of 
mudslinging does not occur

the kansas republican said sen lloyd bentsens proposal to 
restore partial tax deductions on contributions to iras is a great 
idea but that the proposal would cost 12 billion or more over a 
fiveyear period and where do you find the money 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee 
defended his proposal on cbs face the nation saying both his 
plan and the capital gains tax cut would lose money for five years 
before benefits would be seen 
but he said his plan would help average folks far more people 
would be able to take advantage of it than could a capital gains 
cut 
his proposal would allow a deduction of at least 50 percent for 
all ira accounts and would allow the withdrawal of ira funds without 
penalty even prior to retirement for a down payment on the 
purchase of a first home or to finance college costs

the usually predictable emmy awards show 
was quite unpredictable this year 
the winners were picked in such a random fashion its impossible 
to know what the members of the academy of television arts amp 
sciences had in mind 
the hit cbs miniseries lonesome dove won the most awards with 
seven but the only major award went to simon wincer for directing 
abcs monumental war and remembrance was all but ignored 
then won as outstanding miniseries producerdirector dan curtis 
expressed it best calling it a major shock 
cbss rookie series murphy brown was the most honored comedy 
it won four awards sunday night including those for candice bergen 
as best lead actress colleen dewhurst as best guest actress and 
diane english for writing 
but nbcs cheers still highly popular but looking a little 
strained after eight years won for comedy series 
how about designing women or the wonder years each was 
nominated for best comedy series but none of the welldeserving 
actresses in either series has ever been nominated 
did academy members cast their votes by the ratings if that were 
the case nbcs the cosby show or abcs roseanne would won 
neither was nominated lonesome dove was the years 
highestrated miniseries but it lost to war and remembrance 
which failed to get as large an audience as anticipated 
sir john gielgud gave one of the best performances ever seen on 
television portraying the professor who strayed from his jewish 
faith before finding it again in a nazi concentration camp in war 
and remembrance he lost as best actor in a miniseries or special 
as did robert duvall for his multilayered role as an aging texas 
still determined to sow his wild oats in lonesome dove 
james woods won for a role as the man who founded alcoholics 
anonymous in abcs my name is bill w a considerably less 
complex role 
holly hunter won as best actress in a miniseries or special her 
show nbcs roe vs wade tied for outstanding drama or comedy 
special with cbs day one 
the story of the case that made abortion the law of the land was 
politically popular in hollywood but was pedestrian drama 
the big loser and the actress who should have won was jane 
seymour for her magnificent role as the american jewish woman 
trapped behind enemy lines in war and remembrance 
dana delany of abcs china beach was a good choice for best 
actress in a drama series too bad former costar chloe webb was 
overlooked for her absolutely captivating role as laurette in the 
guest actress category 
ken wahl would have been a good choice for best actor in a drama 
series for cbs much underrated wiseguy 
the funny thing about the comedy awards is the way the women from 
nbcs the golden girls keep dominating the lead actress 
category theyre great the shows great but the bittersweet 
complaints from dixie carter annie potts and jean smart of cbs 
designing women are on the money they deserve to be nominated 
and the show deserves better treatment than it has gotten from the 
academy 
rhea perlman won her fourth emmy as carla on cheers 
perlmans talent is looking good in a role that has been virtually 
milked dry 
more deserving were julia duffy of cbs newhart or faith ford 
of cbs murphy brown 
peter scolari also of newhart deserved recognition for 
giving new dimension this past season to a heretofore predictable 
character 
the arsenio hall show which is rewriting some of the roles 
of latenight programming lost out as best variety music or comedy 
program maybe they should let the young viewers vote 
among others not nominated 
kirstie alley of cheers the freshest thing on the show 
cbs newhart maybe they just make it look too easy 
foxs marriedwith children maybe they make it look too 
raunchy 
why not nbcs deliciously funny dear john which won for best 
guest actor or nbcs intriguing drama midnight caller although 
it did win in two guest acting categories

the dollar edged higher against the japanese yen 
monday while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange rose 
moderately 
the dollar ended trading at 14643 yen up 058 yen from 
thursdays 14585yen finish it opened at 14590 yen and moved 
between 14545 yen and 14645 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average added 7066 points or 021 
percent ending trading at 3447254 it gained 11494 points 
thursday 
traders attributed the dollars higher opening to its upswing on 
overseas markets triggered by betterthanexpected us trade 
figures released friday 
the us commerce department reported the nations trade deficit 
declined for the second consecutive month in july to 758 billion 
the smallest gap in nearly five years 
the dollar held its ground despite intermittent dollarselling 
operations by the bank of japan said minori takeuchi trader with 
chemical bank in tokyo 
the central bank intervened when the dollar was about to reach 
the 146yen level and again when it passed the 146yen level she 
said 
the bank of japan does not comment on its monetary actions 
securities investment and insurance companies were buying the 
dollar at its lows whereas the central bank was trying to halt the 
dollars upward movement whenever it began rising ms takeuchi 
said so the dollar wasnt moving that quickly 
but the dollar continues to be strong due to its attractiveness 
to market players following the improved trade figures ms takeuchi 
said 
meanwhile stock trading was inactive following a threeday 
weekend because of a japanese national holiday friday when stock 
foreign exchange and other financial institutions were closed said 
a dealer with new japan securities co speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
some dealers said market players were concerned about the yens 
performance against the dollar

steven stayner whose sevenyear ordeal as 
a sexually abused kidnapped child was the subject of a television 
miniseries died in a hitandrun collision near the town where he 
was abducted 17 years ago 
the california highway patrol said sunday it was searching for 
the employee of a merced tomato packing company who witnesses said 
was the driver of the car that hit stayners motorcycle saturday 
stayner 7 when he was abducted in 1972 and 14 when he escaped 
was killed as he rode his motorcycle between merced and atwater 
about 125 miles east of san francisco where he lived with his wife 
and two young children he was 24 
why him again asked sandy hawkins a close friend of the 
stayner family 
though the family declined to be interviewed hawkins quoted kay 
stayner the victims mother as saying she felt like her son had 
been loaned to us 
hawkins also quoted one of stayners sisters as saying he was 
missing for so long and then came back that if we got a telephone 
call saying it was all a mistake and he was all right it wouldnt 
be hard to believe 
in 1972 stayner was grabbed off the street while walking home 
from school in merced by convicted child molester kenneth parnell 
as the two moved around mendocino and sonoma counties north of san 
francisco stayner was known as dennis parnell 
seven years later parnell snatched another boy 5yearold timmy 
white and stayner 16 days later escaped in ukiah taking timmy with 
him 
in may stayner was the subject of a nbc miniseries i know my 
name is steven which dramatized his life as parnells purported 
son 
my hope with the movie is that some kid sees it and gets up the 
nerve to tell someone and try to come home stayner told an 
interviewer in april 
parnell was arrested in 1980 while working as a hotel clerk in 
ukiah 120 miles north of san francisco and was sentenced in 1982 
to eight years in prison on two counts of kidnapping 
parnell who had been convicted years earlier for sexually 
abusing an 8yearold boy he abducted spent five years in soledad 
prison now 57 parnell is believed living somewhere in northern 
california 
while no sex charges were filed against parnell in the stayner 
case stayner testified at the trial that he was regularly sexually 
abused during the period they lived in motels and trailer parks and 
was ordered to call parnell dad 
the driver who struck stayner ditched his car two miles from the 
scene jumped into another car and fled said highway patrol sgt 
bill balestra the driver could face felony hitandrun charges 
balestra said 
stayner who was not wearing a helmet did not have a motorcycle 
license said officer allen maxfield his drivers license had been 
suspended because of numerous traffic violations

maldivian president maumoon abdul gayoom 
has commuted the death sentences of 12 sri lankans and four 
maldivians for roles in last years abortive coup to life 
imprisonment the government said today 
the clemency came after the condemned men appealed to gayoom 
said the statement sent by telex to new delhi from the maldivian 
department of information and broadcasting 
another 56 sri lankans and three maldivians were convicted in the 
plot and sentenced to prison terms ranging from nine to 38 years by 
the high court in male the maldivians capital in august after a 
twomonth of trial 
the nov 3 coup attempt was crushed by indian paratroopers who 
landed in maldives in response to a call for help from gayoom at 
least 17 people mostly local residents were killed in the fighting 
the country had never executed people for political crimes in 
its history and that he gayoom did not want this generation to be 
the first to shed blood on our soil as punishment for political 
crime the statement said 
the last death sentence for nonpolitical crime was carried out 
in maldives in 1953 by a firing squad 
the maldivian government has said the convicted sri lankans were 
mercenaries who belong to the peoples liberation organization of 
tamil eelam one of the several guerrilla groups that has 
participated in the tamil separatist war against sri lankas 
sinhalese majority 
the failed coup was led by abdullah luthufi a sri lankanbased 
maldivian who was among those who benefitted from the clemency

a parade of glitz and glamor outside this 
years emmy extravaganza contrasted dramatically with a more serious 
backstage mood set by winning shows on nazi atrocities abortion and 
the atomic bomb 
those arriving sunday afternoon for the 41st annual presentations 
included glamorous stars of such tv hits as la law golden 
girls and murder she wrote wearing what some considered to be 
fashion reruns 
its too bad said fashion gadfly mr blackwell who shunned 
the customary tuxedo in favor of a business suit if it was 
nighttime you couldnt see the dresses as well they would look 
better 
designs included tailored suits shimmering sequins miniskirts 
and ethnic costumes 
perhaps the most unique outfit was that of costume designer paula 
glock who embellished her black minisuit with brass knives forks 
and spoons she called the getup dinner for two 
but the headturner of the arrival scene was jean kasem wife of 
casey kasem who had 25 pounds of metal draped on her 
the creation which she said was titled metal mass was 
designed by anthony ferrara it was topped with a black helmet with 
rows of beads falling below her chin 
at least jean knows what being a star is all about said 
blackwell who turned thumbs down on most of the star styles 
theres too much cheap glitz blackwell said theres 
nothing new no one can figure out what a fashion statement is this 
is probably one of the most eclectic masses of yesterday 
a noticeably slimmer susan ruttan of la law wore a tight 
brocade minidress fashioned with a net pouf around the neck asked 
who designed her dress she said i did 
it looks like it sniffed blackwell 
inside pasadena civic auditorium the emmys took a more solemn 
tone as winners grappled with questioning about the serious nature 
of their television productions 
roe vs wade the muchcriticized account of the historic 
battle for legalized abortion brought one of the nations most 
heated controversies backstage after capturing an emmy for holly 
hunter and sharing the award for top dramacomedy special 
i think this is an award for the drama not the politics 
said alison cross coproducer and writer 
cross who was forced by nbc to rewrite the script 20 times 
said we tried very hard to make this as good a show as possible 
and not make compromises necessary for television 
the show told the story of norma mccorvey the real life jane 
roe whose us supreme court case established a womans legal 
right to abortion 
in her acceptance speech miss hunter thanked ms mccorvey for 
continuing to fight and keep women from being secondclass 
citizens and for refusing to give up her right for reproductive 
choice 
roe vs wade was not the only winner that was inspired by 
news headlines 
writer abby mann who won for his murderers among us the 
simon wiesenthal story about the famous nazi hunter criticized 
the tv industry for not addressing serious subjects more frequently 
the industry as a whole is terribly cowardly and ignorant 
toward those subjects he said and im ashamed of it 
actor larry drake who won for his role of a mentally retarded 
office assistant on la law said his award meant more because 
his character is well received by the mentally retarded 
community 
producer and writer david rintels whose day one the story 
of the making of the first us atomic bomb tied with roe vs 
wade for outstanding drama special said it was a fight to get the 
show on the air 
it took 4 years he said it took some courageous support 
from the network cbs it was thrilling that we had the resources 
and support to do it the way we wanted 
even comedy winners seemed in a serious mood 
rhea perlman who won as best supporting actress for the fourth 
time for cheers said i dont think anybody deserves it this 
many times

india and sri lanka today signed an 
agreement under which indian peacekeeping troops will leave this 
violencewracked island by the end of the year and begin observing a 
unilateral ceasefire this week 
the pact ends a threemonth diplomatic deadlock that at one point 
had threatened to escalate into an armed confrontation between the 
two countries 
new delhi sent about 47000 troops to sri lanka in july 1987 to 
supervise a peace accord that offered separatist rebels from the 
ethnic tamil minority limited autonomy if they would lay down their 
weapons 
the tamils were urged to end their fight for an independent 
homeland in the north and east provinces and offered limited 
autonomy 
but the largest tamil group liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
rejected the accord and began attacking the indian troops at least 
1000 of whom have since been killed 
the presence of indian soldiers and the government peace offer to 
the tamils also triggered a bloody backlash by militants of the 
islands ethnic sinhalese majority 
they argued that sinhalesedominated government had offered too 
many concessions to the minority tamils and had compromised the 
nations sovereignty by inviting indian soldiers to sri lankan soil 
in an effort to curb ethnic violence that has claimed more than 
16000 lives in the past six years sri lankan president ranasinghe 
premadasa demanded that the indian troops leave the island by july 
29 the date was the second anniversary of the signing of the peace 
accord signed by premadasas predecessor junius r jayewardene 
but indian prime minister rajiv gandhi refused saying a hasty 
withdrawal could lead to even greater bloodshed that triggered a 
diplomatic deadlock that at one point threatened to snowball into 
war 
a military showdown however was averted when india agreed to 
make a token withdrawal on july 29 and limited pullouts 
subsequently at least 3000 troops have returned home 
the two countries worked out a timetable for the withdrawal of 
the remaining 42000 soldiers earlier this month at the meeting of 
nonaligned nations in yugoslavia 
a government communique on the agreement said india has 
assured that all effort will made made to complete by dec 31 1989 
 
it said indian soldiers will suspend military operations against 
the tamil rebels beginning at 6 am wednesday it said tamil 
rebels had earlier expressed a willingness to a cessation of 
hostilities on a reciprocal basis 
the agreement also said the sri lankan army commander and the 
commanding officer of the indian troops would monitor possible 
ceasefire violations and report them to premadasa 
meanwhile in the northeast indian soldiers were involved in a 
major searchanddestroy operation in which 40 tamil rebels were 
killed and 28 wounded according to a statement by the indian high 
commission or embassy 
at least five indian soldiers were killed and 16 wounded in the 
operation that began tuesday the statement said 
the tamil secession began in 1983 with complaints of 
discrimination in jobs and education by the sinhalesedominated 
government 
sinhalese most of whom are buddhists make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military tamils are 
predominantly buddhists 
india became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern 
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million tamils to 
the rebel cause

a horsedrawn cart draped in black 
transported the partial remains of four union soldiers to their 
final resting place in a funeral marking the battle of antietams 
127th anniversary 
about 85 men dressed in civil war uniforms gave full military 
honors sunday to the four fallen members of the irish brigade from 
new york whose bones were found in march 1988 by relic hunters in a 
field near the battleground 
reenactors normally reenact history but today we are making 
history said 38yearold collin macdonald who served as 
commander for the reburial 
he said it was the western maryland parks first civil war burial 
this century 
an estimated 450 people watched the funeral that began shortly 
before noon at the 11acre antietam national cemetery near 
sharpsburg where the remains of nearly 4700 soldiers are buried 
ive done reenactments but to see it for real just sent 
shivers up and down my spine said blake magner 39 of westmont 
nj 
more than 23000 union and confederate soldiers were killed 
wounded or missing after the battle which ended confederate gen 
robert e lees two attempts to push the war northward the battle 
is described as the single bloodiest day of the war 
the remains of the four soldiers were sealed in a canister inside 
a plain pine coffin that was lowered into the ground near the 
graves of other irish brigade soldiers 
they were with regiments that charged the confederate line sept 
17 1862 and were killed by rifle fire researchers speculated that 
the mens skulls and leg and arm bones were removed from the 
battleground in 1865 or 1866 under a federal program to reinter 
union dead at the cemetery the rest of their bodies remained 
untouched until march 1988 when they were found by a group using 
metal detectors 
we brought the remains home but it bothered us that we had 
human remains said dave bebenroth an elementary school teacher 
from strongsville ohio who was with the group that discovered the 
remains 
about a month after the discovery they decided to turn the 
remains over to the national park service which manages antietam 
national battlefield 
douglas owsley a forensic anthropologist at the smithsonian 
institutions museum of natural history determined that two of the 
soldiers were in their 20s one was in his 30s and the other was 
about 45 years old 
earlier in the day the reenactors representing the 28th 
massachusetts and the 93rd pennsylvania regiments gathered for a 
roman catholic mass at bloody lane a sunken road in the middle 
of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for nearly four 
hours that day 
after the mass the soldiers marched a mile from bloody lane to 
the cemetery where two buglers played taps the remains were 
buried with a clump of turf and a rock from ireland

particular ties to jiang gave the report to the times which said 
two other chinese familiar with the talks confirmed the remarks

on intellectuals there jiang is considered to be clearly identified 
with the policy of economic openness to the west

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
exaggerating his political problems warning of economic trouble 
and a possible coup against himself in a bid to consolidate his 
power some us analysts say 
there has been a deliberate creating of a sense of crisis so 
that he can undercut the conservatives said jerry hough a 
scholar of soviet affairs at duke university 
us government analysts divide into two main camps on 
gorbachevs troubles which stem from severe shortages of consumer 
and other goods and nationalist movements that have gained steam 
with the relaxation of political controls 
conservatives at the pentagon the central intelligence agency 
and some universities are warning the bush administration that 
gorbachev could fall victim to a conservative reaction jeopardizing 
proposed agreements on arms control and human rights 
however the state department and some analysts at cia take a 
more moderate view placing little credence in warnings of a 
conservative coup or predictions of a popular uprising against 
gorbachev such as that forecast by soviet political maverick boris 
n yeltsin in new york and baltimore last week

office should be viewed as an arithmetic progression rather than 
a referendum on his race 
sitting in his campaign headquarters in suburban mclean va 
wilder insisted that his election would send a message more 
important than trumpeting the success of a black man from 
richmond capital of the old confederacy 
at the same time it was clear during a recent interview that 
wilder is aware of the historical significance of his spot at the 
head of the democratic ticket in a state capital where blacks were 
for so long barred from the political and social corridors of power 
he talked of how a close friend state sen madison marye a 
white man with a rich southern drawl quipped that my grandfather

six months after taking command of the energy 
department and vowing to steer its nuclear weapons program out of 
troubled seas retired adm james d watkins is spending as much 
time bailing water as setting the new course 
the latest crisis was a threat last week that the rocky flats 
weapons plant near denver would be shut down because of acknowledged 
illegal storage of waste from plutonium processing the plant is a 
critical link in the nuclear arms production chain 
rockwell international corp which operates the plant under a 
government contract decided over the weekend to delay a decision on 
closing the plant so officials can work on a plan to bring the 
plants waste storage into compliance 
also last week watkins faced a court order eventually 
withdrawn to appear before a federal judge in ohio to help resolve 
a dispute over a 78 million settlement of a lawsuit by neighbors of 
a weapons plant near cincinnati that watkins acknowledges is 
violating environmental regulations

antigovernment slate spoke to 2000 exiles sunday during her first 
visit to this country since becoming a candidate

the bush administration on friday bowed to congressional pressure 
and abandoned a plan to funnel about 2 million in government funds 
to her campaign through the usfinanced national endowment for 
democracy 
but administration officials say they will encourage private and 
foreign groups to donate money to mrs chamorro 
she assailed the sandinista government for human rights 
violations and causing the countrys economic problems and appealed 
for nicaraguans abroad to consider returning to home if her party is 
successful

a small band of opponents demonstrated outside the amphitheater 
where mrs chamorro spoke detractors among the antisandinista 
forces cite her political inexperience and the brief term she served 
in the revolutionary government 
in campaign appearances mrs chamorro often evokes the name of 
her late husband who inherited control of the familyrun la prensa 
in 1948 and used the newspaper as a forum for attacks on the ruling 
somoza family 
mrs chamorro joined a fivemember junta following anastasio 
somozas downfall but resigned within a year and returned to direct 
la prensa which repeatedly has been closed by the sandinistas

some call him maximum bob but judge 
robert potter isnt always as harsh as his early handling of the ptl 
trial might indicate according to lawyers who have watched him for 
years 
potter is presiding at the federal fraud trial of ptl founder jim 
bakker who is accused of diverting more than 37 million in 
ministry money to fund his lavish lifestyle 
the trial which opened three weeks ago was to resume today 
on the trials first day potter repeatedly scolded defense 
attorney george t davis on sept 6 he ruled that bakker was 
competent to stand trial despite a panic attack in which bakker 
said he thought he was under attack by wild animals two days later 
potter sentenced former bakker aide david taggart to the harshest 
prison term allowed by law 
but lawyers who have watched potter during his eight years on the 
bench say hes not a cruel man despite the moniker that refers to 
potters sentencing practices 
he can be harsh when its called for said charlotte lawyer 
george laughrun but compassionate when its justified 
if a defendant is guilty and admits it potter is likely to weigh 
that on the defendants behalf during sentencing he said if he 
thinks a defendant is lying hes likely to weigh it against him 
before he sentenced taggart and his brother for tax evasion 
potter said he thought they lied on the witness stand he sentenced 
david taggart to 18 years and five months in prison and james 
taggart to 17 years nine months 
but potter sentenced former ptl executive richard dortch to eight 
years out of a possible 10 after dortch pleaded guilty 
apologized and agreed to testify for the government 
potters average prison sentence of 74 years in 1986 was 1 
times the national average the charlotte observer reported sunday 
he has been particularly harsh on whitecollar criminals and drug 
offenders his average drug sentence of 106 years was twice the 
national average in 1986 according to the newspaper 
theres no question he deals sternly with those crimes that he 
believes have a harder impact on the community and thats always 
been his trait said ken andresen a former federal prosecutor now 
in private practice in charlotte but across the board to call 
him maximum bob i dont agree with that in other cases he has 
dealt leniently 
in 1985 potter gave a break to a former state trooper who robbed 
a federal armored express truck of more than 250000 the man an 
alcoholic with financial troubles had no prior convictions and a 
good law enforcement record potter gave him a suspended sentence 
and a 1000 fine 
as an attorney potter worked in the 1970s and early 1980s in the 
campaigns of sen jesse helms and ronald reagan in 1981 reagan at 
helms urging appointed him to the bench 
ive appeared in front of him for civil jury trials and ive 
come away feeling that judge potter was evenhanded and fair and he 
kept the trial moving right along said civil rights attorney john 
gresham

rung up the television ladder winning a top emmy for the tracey 
ullman show at the 41st annual awards ceremony 
the program which won four awards was the first fox 
broadcasting co show to win televisions top prize 
its a beginning barry diller chairman of fox inc said 
backstage during sunday nights ceremonies the first is always 
the best 
the network which has been criticized for its raunchy situation 
comedy married with children and the tabloid news show a 
current affair has defied critics who were convinced the 
2yearold endeavor would flop 
the award tonight had a special explosion to it diller said 
i think its because everybody involved in this enterprise thinks 
of it as an adventure and it is 
there was not a single person in the entertainment business who 
thought that we were anything but a fools errand and that we would 
dismally fail 
the people who were our friends thought wed survive the 
failure and go on the people who were our enemies were juicy about 
how viciously wed fail theyre going through the process now of 
saying well i guess it didnt happen 
although the tracey ullman show is not foxs highest rated 
series it is probably its most acclaimed the variety show which 
made its debut in april 1987 is an unusual irreverent cornucopia

israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin 
associated in egyptian minds with harsh military action against arab 
protesters flew in today to discuss an egyptian proposals to end 
the palestinian uprising 
his oneday mission sent into high gear efforts by israel and 
egypt which made their own peace more than 10 years ago to arrange 
for elections in the west bank and gaza strip of palestinians who 
would talk peace with israel 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid greeted rabin at cairo 
international airport and drove with him directly to a meeting with 
president hosni mubarak 
egyptian officials said mubarak hoped to get positive answers 
from rabin to questions that the president sent to israel seeking 
clarifications and assurances on an israeli peace plan 
rabin 67 a former prime minister and wartime general sought to 
reconcile israeli and egyptian plans for holding elections in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza where about 17 million 
palestinians live 
the palestinian uprising began in the territories in december 
1987 and rabin has ordered progressively stricter measures in trying 
to suppress it 
the israeli government approved a peace initiative in may that 
calls for palestinian elections leading to negotiations between 
israel and representatives of the west bank and gaza strip on 
limited autonomy in the occupied territories 
the plo has dismissed the israeli proposal insisting that any 
balloting lead eventually to palestinian sovereignty in the 
territories which israel seized in the 1967 middle east war 
after palestinians rejected the plan mubarak offered his 
modified version basing the negotiations on the usbacked formula 
of trading land for peace 
plo officials at the organizations headquarters in tunis said 
their executive committee failed to decide on the egyptian plan in 
three days of meetings last week it sent the proposals to the plo 
central council a larger body for consideration in midoctober 
efforts were under way to persuade plo chief yasser arafat to 
accept the egyptian plan as a compromise bethlehem mayor elias 
freij returned sunday from a trip to tunis where he met with arafat 
and said the egyptian plan is under strong consideration by the 
plo 
although approved by the israeli cabinet rabins trip 
immediately triggered controversy between the two rival parties in 
government who are divided over mubaraks plan 
internal differences also surfaced within the rightwing likud 
bloc headed by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
if the labor party continues to stick to the mubarak initiative 
it will lead to a break in the government army radio quoted prime 
minister and likud leader yitzhak shamir as saying 
foreign minister moshe arens of likud on sunday welcomed 
mubaraks efforts saying on israel television we regard 
president mubaraks efforts to achieve peace in the middle east as 
positive 
likuds main objections to mubaraks plan are demands that israel 
accept the principle of trading territory for peace and agree to let 
140000 palestinians in israeliannexed east jerusalem vote when 
elections are held in the occupied territories 
leaders of the leftleaning labor party meanwhile say they 
support both principles and consider mubaraks plan to be an opener 
for peace talks 
for the first time an opportunity has arisen to obtain a 
palestinian side to negotiations labor leader and vice premier 
shimon peres said sunday on israel radio 
mubarak was also reportedly trying to compose a palestinian 
delegation acceptable to both the palestine liberation organization 
and israel would launch preliminary talks before the elections the 
egyptians have suggested the list include two palestinians recently 
deported by israel 
likud officials have argued that allowing deportees as 
negotiators would be tantamount to speaking to the plo which israel 
boycotts

waving the blueandyellow flags of their once 
independent homeland and burning thousands of candles ukrainians in 
the city of lvov marked 50 years since stalin annexed their homeland 
from poland 
tens of thousands of ukrainian catholics demanding legal status 
for their church walked three miles sunday through the citys 
medieval center to hold a mass outside st yuris cathedral 
once the seat of lvovs catholic bishop it is now the cathedral 
of the local russian orthodox prelate 
western witnesses said up to 100000 people participated 
this is a moral victory ukrainian catholic activist ivan gel 
told the worshipers in lvov which is 50 miles east of poland and 
700 miles southwest of moscow look how powerful our church is 
the time has come for freedom for our church declared gel 
head of the committee in defense of the ukrainian catholic church 
the ukrainians carried at least 300 flags of their homeland along 
with crosses images of the virgin mary and banners reading 
freedom for our church 
the outdoor service under an overcast sky was only the latest 
sign of reviving nationalist consciousness in the soviet unions 
second most populous republic where a new grassroots prodemocracy 
group called rukh held its founding congress last week 
tonight let us all turn off the electricity and put a candle in 
the window to commemorate the millions who died under stalinist 
repression said gel those candles will also symbolize the 
great hopes we have for our one our dear ukraine 
at dusk about 30000 ukrainians carrying candles ringed a 
central square at lvovs opera theater and observed a halfhour of 
silence to commemorate victims of the 1939 soviet takeover and the 
purges that followed 
candles of mourning also twinkled in some apartment windows of 
the city of 650000 people 
the action was designed to mirror aug 23 demonstrations in the 
three baltic republics in which more than 1 million estonians 
lithuanians and latvians joined hands to protest the annexation of 
their lands 
the baltics and the western ukraine both fell into the soviet 
orbit as a result of a secret pact between josef stalin and adolf 
hitler 
the ukrainian church sometimes called the uniate church has up 
to 5 million members by some western estimates and is said to be 
the largest banned religious organization in the world 
in 1946 it was accused of widespread collaboration with the 
nazis and forced to merge with the lvov synod of the russian 
orthodox church the ukrainian churchs property was confiscated and 
believers who refused to accept the reunion were brutally 
repressed or driven underground 
despite greater official tolerance of religion since president 
mikhail s gorbachev became soviet leader in march 1985 the 
ukrainian church is still officially banned the churchs status has 
been a major obstacle to improved relations between the vatican and 
the kremlin 
the ukrainians status under gorbachevs reforms is likely to be 
a central issue at talks reportedly to be held between pope john 
paul ii and the soviet leader when they meet for the first time 
during a november trip by gorbachev to italy 
soviet control of the western ukraine began sept 17 1939 
slightly more than two weeks after hitler started world war ii by 
attacking poland and less than a month after he and stalin reached a 
nonaggression agreement with a secret protocol dividing eastern 
europe into spheres of influence

two paramedics who were among the first to 
arrive after a gunman opened fire inside a printing plant were 
pinned down with four victims in a reception area while the gunman 
roamed the building 
at a news conference saturday paramedic greg torpey described 
watching helplessly as sharon needy died of massive internal 
bleeding while gunman joseph t wesbecker roamed somewhere nearby 
in the standard gravure corp building 
if we could have got her out right away and got her to a trauma 
center there is a possibility that she could be living now he 
said 
wesbecker a standard gravure employee on longterm leave because 
of mental problems went from floor to floor shooting people at the 
plant thursday leaving seven dead and 13 wounded before committing 
suicide 
torpey and connie grace who were among the first to arrive at 
the building after the shooting spree began described the harrowing 
scene along with three other emergency workers at an impromptu news 
conference at louisville emergency medical services headquarters 
torpey said that one of the wounded women he was treating had 
expressed something akin to sympathy for wesbecker when she learned 
by police radio that he had shot himself 
the victim said well god rest his soul he said which 
for me was a tremendous boost in faith that somebody could say that 
after being shot several times to still understand that this 
wasnt the action really of a criminal this was the action of a 
sick individual someone who for some reason has gone over the 
edge 
torpey and ms grace heard shots as they rode up the elevator 
after entering the building 
as soon as the elevator doors opened at the third floor they 
began attending two gravely injured women angela bowman and needy 
two other injured women lay down a nearby hallway but police 
indicated that it was too dangerous for ems personnel to go to them 
wed been there just a couple of minutes and they came back on 
the radio and said that the assailant was back on our floor 
ms grace said i was petrified 
the two waited for what seemed like an eternity for another 
ambulance crew to help them evacuate the wounded torpey said 
normally paramedics try to stabilize gunshot victims and whisk 
them away to a hospital immediately load and go said 
paramedic kenneth murray who also was involved in treating victims 
of the shooting 
murray whose voice quavered occasionally said he wanted to 
speak publicly about the experience because people should know 
what an ak47 can do 
wesbecker used the sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifle two 
semiautomatic machine pistols and other weapons during his rampage 
its tough were talking about combat medicine ems director 
richard bartlett said

experts from 15 western nations gathered in paris 
today to plan the next phase in the war against drugs a joint 
effort to combat the laundering of money from the narcotics trade 
in recent years it is hard to find an issue that has 
galvanized the worlds attention as much as the drug issue has 
said a senior us treasury department official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified its a truly global issue 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy commenting to reporters 
last week said one of the major problems facing the investigators 
is the absolute bank secrecy of some countries which makes 
following the trail of drug money extremely difficult 
the maintenance of absolute bank secrecy seems to me to be 
incompatible with the efficient fight against the laundering of drug 
money he said 
among those attending the oneday meeting were switzerland and 
luxembourg two countries whose stringent bank secrecy laws 
frequently have frustrated law officers 
the french are playing host to the meeting in the greatest 
secrecy refusing even to acknowledge where in paris it is being 
held and announcing in advance that there would be no news 
conference nor any information about it afterward 
mondays gathering was to be the first of several its primary 
goal will be to create a financial action task force to increase 
international cooperation in tracking down the profits from the 
narcotics trade 
the impetus for this latest effort at cooperation came from 
president francois mitterrand who had it included in the final 
communique of the annual summit meeting of the worlds seven richest 
democracies in paris july 1416 
this is not a study group beregovoy stressed this group 
of experts must devise and take action decisions 
surveys in the united states indicate that americans consider 
drugs and drug abuse the most important problem facing the country 
the issue is also of growing concern in western europe 
the purpose of todays meeting in the words of the treasury 
department official was to inventory and evaluate the current state 
of international efforts against money laundering to determine what 
improvements can be made in this area and to submit a report to the 
heads of state and finance ministers of the countries involved with 
the experts analysis and recommendations 
the report is due in april 
the global financial system is one of the integral parts of the 
international drug conspiracy if you like said the us 
official the recognition of the need to rein in the financial and 
economic side of the house means there needs to be a marriage of the 
traditional law enforcement on one side and the financial and 
economic on the other 
participating in the meeting are the seven nations of the annual 
economic summit the united states france west germany canada 
britain japan and italy plus australia austria belgium spain 
luxembourg the netherlands switzerland and sweden along with the 
european commission executive body of the common market

the discovery of a steer that may be a bum 
has 4h officials pondering how to reclaim their wholesome contests 
from the lure of the cash cow 
big money has been changing hands in recent years at state fairs 
around the country with major corporations sometimes participating 
in the auctions for prize animals large crowds and television crews 
spur the bidding 
and with the big money comes temptation officials say 
authorities last month impounded hank a 1245pound steer sold 
for 28000 at the ohio state fair when it was disclosed that it 
may be the same animal that won second place at a county fair in 
illinois in july under a different name 
hanks owners deny wrongdoing and in any case officials say open 
cheating may be unusual 
they are more concerned by the impact of the profit motive on 
4h which after all was intended to reach out to the head heart 
hands and health of children not their bank accounts and to 
teach the way of citizenfarmers 
increasingly youngsters purchase the animals they exhibit 
rather than raising them from birth said jack foust general 
manager of the ohio state fair 
we have always been concerned that were not doing enough to 
develop the whole boy and girl said milton boyce an 
administrator responsible for 4h at the us department of 
agriculture 
too much emphasis is put on the money and sometimes it teaches 
the kids little more than how to get their names in the paper he 
said 
the goal here is to get the thing back in focus 
the usda and 4h this year began an educational project in 12 
states to teach young people the importance of honesty the project 
began in ohio as authorities investigated the identity of hank the 
fairs grand champion anguscross steer 
hanks credentials came into question when fair officials 
received a tip from an illinois extension agent that hank might be 
carl a reserve champion at the iroquois county fair 
hanks exhibitor 17yearold susan shealy of tiro and her 
parents have denied any wrongdoing as has the family of 
12yearold jeremy simmons who exhibited carl 
simmons stepfather donald kopsell said he sold hank to the 
shealys last october and that carl was destroyed after he ate some 
tainted corn 
fair officials have said that some similarities between the two 
animals have been found both are black and both have a similar 
belly marking 
at issue is whether the ownership of the animal was 
misrepresented under rules of both fairs an exhibitor must have 
owned the animal since jan 1 of the year in which it is shown 
if hank is an impostor ms shealy could lose her 28000 prize 
and firstplace ribbon a decision by the ohio expositions 
commission which oversees the state fair could be announced as 
early as thursday 
in ohio the grand champion steer was purchased by burger king 
for a record 69500 in 1986 tyson foods paid 42000 for the grand 
champion in 1987 and great southern midway paid 38500 in 1988 
auctions for winning animals also take place in many other states 
when these animals get to bring these high prices and all the 
tv cameras are on i guess thats where human faults come in 
figuring a way to bring a high price said foust who thinks the 
earnings on the top steers should be divided among participants in 
the contests 
the other states involved in the 4h honesty program are 
michigan indiana illinois iowa kansas minnesota missouri 
wisconsin nebraska north dakota and south dakota

researchers found a mysterious lacy and 
delicate creature near some 400 million in gold on a 19th century 
shipwreck 200 miles off the south carolina coast 
charles herdendorf an oceanographer with the columbusamerica 
discovery group exploring the ship said saturday that researchers 
discovered what he believes to be two new invertebrates clinging to 
the ss central america 8000 feet below the waters surface 
a columbusamerica spokesman said both samples were retrieved 
but herdendorf on sunday said in a shiptoshore telephone 
conversation that an unmanned submersible ship was able to retrieve 
only one of the unusual finds apparently a type of animal known as 
a sponge and scientists were still trying to determine if it was 
already classified 
when the subersible operator brought it up it was beautiful 
very lacy and delicate the entire animal is supported by a very 
clear skeleton of glass spicules herdendorf said they look 
like little ice skeletons 
herdendorf is one of about 20 crew members of the arctic 
discoverer trying to reclaim as much as 400 million in gold coins 
and bars from the central america 
the central america sank during a hurricane sept 12 1857 as it 
traveled from panama to new york it was carrying a monthly shipment 
of gold from the san francisco mint to new york banks by way of the 
panamaian isthmus the wreck claimed 425 lives 153 people survived 
early estimates valued the treasure at 1 billion but 
columbusamerica director barry schatz said 400 million is more 
realistic 
the organism captured saturday originally thought to be a coral 
looked different when it was brought up from the original pictures 
from the ocean floor herdendorf said 
he expected to place it in an alcohol solution for transport to 
the shore by midweek 
the other organism which herdendorf still believes may be a 
newly discovered sponge remains out of reach of the submersible he 
said 
though saturday was devoted solely to scientific research schatz 
said in a shiptoshore conversation that the submersible nemo 
raised more gold coins sunday 
many of the coins are lying in the rolls they were originally 
shipped in he said 
in addition to the mint money schatz said the central america 
also carried shipments of coins from private companies to banks 
one of the companies was levi and company before it became levi 
and strauss schatz said so levi was making money making jeans 
and he was sending it back to new york so we are looking at some of 
his money 
while hurricane hugo lashed the eastern caribbean with winds of 
up to 140 mph sunday schatz said the storm was not yet a concern on 
board

east german refugees say czechoslovak 
and east german authorities are seizing their passports and travel 
visas to stop them from reaching hungary and emigrating to the west 
the crackdown has forced emigres into acts of desperation an 
east german man taking part in the exodus to west germany drowned 
while swimming across the danube river from czechoslovakia to 
hungary refugee workers said today 
the man was forced to swim because he had no travel documents 
they said 
a czechoslovak man today managed to cross his communist 
homelands border to west germany on a homemade motorized hang 
glider bavarian border police said 
the most direct route for east germans seeking to take advantage 
of hungarys free passage to austria is through czechoslovakia 
which is sandwiched between east germany and hungary 
wolfgang wagner head of the west german maltese aid service 
said that in some cases east german refugees have been forced off 
east german and czechoslovak trains and ordered to return home 
in west germany officials said today that nearly 750 east german 
refugees had arrived in bavaria during the night that brings to 
more than 16000 the number of refugees that have arrived since 
hungary opened its border to the west one week ago 
east german officials have said that despite the exodus they 
would not restrict travel for citizens wishing to visit hungary 
travel visas had been easy to obtain but more and more people 
are telling us that their visas are being taken from them wagner 
said sunday 
some have told me that state security had come to their 
apartments to take the visas and a growing number are forced to 
swim the danube river or find other illegal means of coming to 
hungary he said in an interview 
the 22yearold east german who drowned in the danube was the 
first casualty reported among the thousands of east germans 
traveling to hungary 
the czechoslovak man a 39yearold doctor took off from a 
village south of domazlice near the west german border and flew 
apparently unnoticed over the heavilyguarded frontier to the 
bavarian town of cham about 18 miles west police said 
border police who did not identify the escapee by name quoted 
him as saying he fled to avoid reprisals for taking part in an 
illegal demonstration in prague the czechoslovak capital last 
month 
police in hanover west germany said a 23yearold east german 
climbed over a border barrier to escape to west germanys lower 
saxony state 
police said the escapee arrived with cuts and scratches on his 
hands but was otherwise uninjured no other details were provided on 
that escape 
on sunday a 25yearold man from east berlin said he and 15 
others entered hungary on foot after crowding into three cars and 
crashing through several czechoslovak border barriers at the rajka 
crossing about 85 miles northwest of budapest 
he said police in bratislava czechoslovakia took away their 
travel documents and at one point they were held at gunpoint until 
they promised they would not head toward the hungarian border 
also today a polish newspaper quoted west german officials in 
warsaw as saying the number of east germans who have taken refuge in 
the embassy there has swelled to about 100 
about 40 more refugees seeking to emigrate to the west found 
their way to the embassy during the weekend the prosolidarity 
gazeta wyborcza said 
czechoslovakia and east germany have eschewed the political and

col rozo julio navarro chief of the national police force in 
cali told colombian radio the bomb at the shopping center killed

cali bogota and medellin have been the sites of frequent 
shootings and bombings since aug 18 when the government cracked 
down on the nations powerful drug traffickers who in turn declared 
total war against the government fortytwo people have been 
killed and 116 injured in the attacks 
the war began after the assassination of luis carlos galan a 
senator who was seeking the presidential nomination of the governing 
liberal party and had pushed for forceful action against drug 
traffickers 
under emergency measures imposed since aug 18 president 
virgilio barco has resumed extraditions to the united states of 
suspected drug traffickers

extradition proceedings are under way against two others 
as the violence continues newspapers have begun calling for the 
government to negotiate with the drug traffickers

daily el tiempo suggested saturday the government should use 
extradition as a bargaining chip in negotations and warned that the 
war could become a little vietnam 
in another bogota daily la republica columnist francisco 
morales casas wrote we should not continue with this war and 
should turn to dialogue 
perhaps the most important colombian favoring negotiation with 
the drug traffickers is juan gomez martinez mayor of medellin and 
one of the owners of medellins leading daily el colombiano he 
favors negotiations 
el espectador however has remained firmly opposed to such 
moves despite the murder of its editor guillermo cano three years 
ago 
the bogota newspaper reported sunday that its reporter in 
buenaventura guillermo gomez murillo was shot to death by three 
men who barged into his house saturday night it said there was no 
way of telling if the murder was the work of drug traffickers 
el espectadors editor was slain by drug traffickers in 1986 and 
the newspaper was heavily damaged sept 2 in a car bomb attack

southern governors grappled with the 
problem of infant mortality which is especially high in the south 
trying to find ways to teach working women better prenatal care 
low birth weight is still above the national average in almost 
every southern state and ill bet you the rate is high because 
employees dont have the education said arkansas gov bill 
clinton chairman of the southern corporate coalition to improve 
maternal and child health 
i think its because we havent reached this employee 
population like we should clinton said sunday 
the southern governors association threeday annual meeting 
began sunday with a session on infant mortality rates with clinton 
as host 
among the other topics on the agenda are a session on drugs held 
by florida gov bob martinez and maryland gov william donald 
schaefer 
sundays meeting focused on the roles businesses can play to 
reduce infant mortality and lowbirthweight babies those born 
weighing 5 pounds or less 
joe taylor plant manager for sunbeam appliance co in coushatta 
la said a mandatory inhouse prenatal education program at the 
plant has drastically reduced the rate of premature babies born to 
employees and cut the companys health care costs 
the program began in 1986 after statistics showed that in 1984 
and 1985 11 employees had premature babies that cost the company 2 
million in medical care 
in 1987 taylor said no employee had a premature babies and in 
1988 only one did 
the prenatal program costs the company about 10000 per year 
weve saved a great deal of money taylor said 
according to the southern regional project on infant mortality 
the souths infant mortality rate is 120 per 1000 live births 
compared with a national rate of 100 
the project has not compiled figures on the rate of low birth 
weight babies but officials said the souths rate is higher than 
the national average

a bomb exploded on a bus and killed five people in 
the republic of azerbaijan where rival ethnic groups have carried 
out violent protests pravda said today 
also today armenian leaders traveled to moscow to appeal to the 
kremlin for help in breaking what they say is an economic blockade 
by neighboring azerbaijan that is strangling their economy armenian 
sources said 
the communist party daily said the blast occurred near the 
central azerbaijani town of evlakh on saturday the bomb exploded 
about six hours after the bus left tbilisi the capital of the

said 
rafiyev said the casualty toll could have been much higher had 
not the driver escaped injury and prevented the bus from crashing 
into a ravine 
official reports so far have not said whether the blast is linked 
to ethnic tension in the caucasus mountain region of the soviet 
south 
azerbaijan is engaged in a bitter dispute with neighboring 
armenia for control of the nagornokarabakh region that region 
while legally part of azerbaijan is predominantly armenian the 
armenian population demands that the region be taken from azerbaijan 
and annexed to armenia 
about 100 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of 
people have fled their homes in violence that has encompassed both 
of the republics during the past 18 months moscow has imposed 
direct rule on nagornokarabakh in an effort to ease tensions 
armenian leaders say they are under virtual economic blockade 
from neighboring azerbaijan more than 80 percent of the shipments 
armenia receives from other parts of the soviet union are shipped by 
rail from azerbaijan 
rem ananikyan an editor of the official armenpress news agency 
in yerevan the armenian capital said in a telephone interview

at a standstill because there is no fuel 
the armenian supreme soviet or legislature met in an emergency 
session saturday and sunday to discuss the slowdown in supplies from 
azerbaijan 
armenian officials say builders in northern armenia who are 
reconstructing cities leveled by an earthquake last dec 7 are out 
of supplies that means many people may be without shelter as winter 
approaches they say 
azerbaijans parliament reasserted its right to rule 
nagornokarabakh on saturday calling the district an integral part 
of the republic and noting the soviet constitution classifies it as 
such

rep barney frank says stephen gobie wasnt the 
first prostitute i had used even though he believed it was wrong 
to patronize them 
in an interview with newsweek magazine the massachusetts 
democrat also denied claims that he acknowledged his homosexuality 
because he was afraid gobie would blackmail him 
he wasnt the first prostitute i had used frank said i 
just couldnt live that way anymore i was tired of looking over my 
shoulder i met herb moses franks companion about that time 
i knew it was wrong for me to be hiring prostitutes from time 
to time frank said gobie wasnt the only one i knew it was 
wrong but i couldnt sit home the interview is published in the 
sept 25 issue of newsweek which is on newsstands today 
the congressman said he never risked contracting aids i wasnt 
sexually active in the old days by the time i was sexually active 
i knew better i knew about aids and i was very careful one of the 
first men i went out with is a doctor who specializes in aids 
research 
asked if gobie could provide names of other prominent politicians 
with whom he had relations frank said i dont know if you can 
trust him and i dont know who hes going to say was in my kitchen 
im vulnerable and other people are vulnerable 
franks dealings with gobie are being investigated by the house 
ethics panel the congressman has said that after ending his sexual 
relationship with gobie he hired him in 1985 as a personal aide 
using his own money not congressional staff funds in an attempt to 
help gobie start a new life 
but he said he fired him in 1987 after he learned that gobie was 
running a prostitution ring out of franks apartment 
frank 49 revealed in june 1987 that he is a homosexual the 
following year he was reelected with 70 percent of the vote from 
his predominantly democratic southeastern massachusetts district 
but the revelation about his relationship to gobie have prompted 
some calls for his to quit including one this week from the boston 
sunday globe which said he should resign for his own good and 
for the good of his consitutents his causes and congress 
the issue of franks conduct is not homosexuality but 
prostitution which is illegal and which has always been a 
destructive element in heterosexual and homosexual life the 
newspaper said had the issue been heterosexual prostitution 
feminist groups would not have been silent so far frank has 
enjoyed more than the benefit of the doubt he has enjoyed a double 
standard 
in the newsweek interview frank said he would never resign 
because that would among other things shortcircuit the ethics 
procedure its very important to have that go forward 
he has said however that he would consider not running for 
reelection if the incident begins to seriously hurt the liberal 
causes he believes in

the widow of prime minister olof palme 
questioned directly today by the man convicted of killing her 
husband said there was no chance he was innocent 
unfortunately there is no doubt lisbeth palme said at an 
appeals hearing 
she identified christer pettersson as the only person in sight on 
the downtown street corner where palme was shot to death on the 
night of feb 28 1986 
pettersson was convicted of the killing in july and the 
appellate hearing which began sept 11 has largely been a rehash 
of testimony at the lower court trial 
after mrs palme had been questioned by defense attorneys for 
almost two hours pettersson was led into the courtroom under heavy 
guard and allowed to question her directly for the first time mrs 
palme appearing shaken closed her eyes as he was led in 
speaking loudly pettersson said if i am convicted of this i 
can count on 10 years imprisonment that is 90000 hours before i 
have my first furlough 
therefore i ask you to look judge birgitta blom in the eyes 
for 10 seconds and say that it was i that killed your husband 
pettersson said 
the svea court of appeals fell silent until blom said mrs 
palme nodded her head the policemen guarding mrs palme blocked 
her from spectators in the courtroom although she was visible to 
pettersson 
in todays session as in the original trial mrs palme said she 
could not testify to seeing a gun in petterssons hand 
i was focusing on his face she said that does not exclude 
his having a gun in his hand 
pettersson has repeatedly denied he was close to the site of the 
slaying a lower court july 27 sentenced him to life imprisonment 
largely on the basis of mrs palmes identification 
no murder weapon has been found 
why would i kill your husband the friend of the weak and 
oppressed said pettersson who contends he admired palme mrs 
palme did not answer 
the appeal was scheduled to end oct 5 if the conviction is 
reversed pettersson will be freed immediately if not petterssons 
life sentence may be commuted after 20 years a common practice in 
swedens penal system

cardinal john j oconnor says he supports jewish 
efforts to get a roman catholic convent near the auschwitz death 
camp closed but that many of his fellow catholics are prejudiced 
against jews 
the fight over the convent in poland has put fuel on the 
fire oconnor said on the wnbctvs news forum program 
broadcast sunday i think there are many catholics who are 
antisemitic 
its deep within them and this kind of thing then just throws 
up the flames and simultaneously there are jews who live in fear of 
catholic antisemitism and consequently it feeds the fear 
oconnor said he said he has received letters criticizing him for 
supporting the move of the convent 
he said he is exploring the possibility of talking to pope john 
paul ii about the dispute which arose after the church agreed to 
close the convent and then local catholic officials in poland balked 
its not a fight between jews and catholics oconnor said 
catholics and jews made an agreement the agreement hasnt been 
honored its as basic as that 
the convent just outside the auschwitz concentration camp is seen 
by many jews as an intrusion of christian symbols at a place where 
25 million jews were murdered by the nazis during world war ii 
a 1987 accord between jewish and roman catholic representatives 
stipulated the convent should be moved by feb 22 but the deadline 
passed and the convent remained the polish primate cardinal jozef 
glemp has termed the accord offensive an estimated 15 million 
christians also were killed at auschwitz 
nobel laureate elie wiesel an auschwitz survivor who appeared on 
the same program said jews are in a nowin situation in the dispute 
if the convent of carmelite nuns is allowed to remain we 
lost wiesel said but even if we win we lost 
can you imagine when the nuns will leave the convent there 
will be thousands of reporters and tv cameras and people will say 
look these poor carmelite nuns thrown out of their convent by 
jews we dont need that 
oconnor said he considered unwise the recent trip by rabbi 
avraham weiss and six other jewish demonstrators from new york to 
auschwitz where they were attacked when they tried to climb a fence 
surrounding the grounds 
the archbishop also called glemps statements after the incident 
unfortunate glemp said the jews had launched attacks on the 
convent possibly intending to kill the sisters and that jews had 
the media easily at your disposal in many countries

amtrak pleaded innocent today to charges 
stemming from its practice of flushing passengercar toilets and 
sewage holding tanks into florida waterways as trains go over 
bridges 
assistant state attorney paul meredith said the federal railroad 
agency submitted its pleas to circuit judge robert perry by 
facsimile machine 
the plea was entered after amtrak rejected a settlement offer 
from district state attorney john tanner who promised to drop three 
charges of commercial dumping if amtrak would stop all flushing 
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers 
the company said it cant do that because it would set a 
precedent federal law permits the railway to dump its sewage on its 
rightofway and this overrides state and local regulations amtrak 
contends 
amtrak has threatened to suspend service in florida if tanner 
presses his case but tanner said amtrak was bluffing 
amtrak has come under fire in several western states as well as 
florida for the sewage dumping 
but the putnam county case may be the first to go before a 
criminal judge amtrak spokesman clifford black has said the only 
other pending cases are two civil lawsuits in oregon there have 
been concerns and inquiries raised in other states he said 
they run the risk of losing passenger train service said 
black that is something the various jurisdictions must consider 
agreeing to tanners plea bargain would make amtrak a target for 
similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop dumping in any body 
of water in florida black said 
with the myriad waterways in florida it would be an impossible 
situation he said 
amtraks 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping 
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the 
contents of 30gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at 
least 35 mph 
the company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with 
new cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets black said 
it would cost 147 million to install those tanks on the current 
fleet

donald t regan who served as treasury 
secretary and white house chief of staff in the reagan 
administration proposed today that the government change the color 
or size of 50 and 100 bills to frustrate drug dealers with big 
accumulations of currency 
under regans proposal the government would announce that the 
old bills would be worthless in 10 days 
when people went to banks to exchange their bills for the new 
currency records would be made of all transactions involving more 
than 1000 forcing drug dealers to either give up vast fortunes 
or expose themselves to scrutiny by law enforcement agencies 
this would panic those with huge cash holdings regan said in 
an article written for the oped page of the new york times 
if the cash is legitimate no one should have any fear yes it 
might cause confusion for a couple of months but what honest 
citizen wouldnt be willing to put up with a little inconvenience so 
as to trap these criminals regan wrote 
this would hit the criminals where it hurts most in the 
pocketbook 
additionally regan proposed that the bush administration call 
for an agreement of all central banks in industrialized nations to 
instruct member banks not to accept deposits from known or 
suspected drug dealers and not to do business with any banks 
latin caribbean asian or wherever that accept drug money 
president bush and william bennett his drug policy coordinator 
should ask the leaders of the 200 largest banks and savings 
institutions in this country to pledge not to accept deposits from 
drug dealers whether overlords or street pushers regan also 
proposed 
the idea of changing the color of us currency to thwart drug 
dealers or others holding large hordes of illegally obtained cash 
has been offered before but resisted by the government 
in 1986 katherine ortega then the us treasurer announced 
after a study that the idea had been rejected 
subtle changes have been made in recent years in the design of 
us currency to make it more difficult to duplicate with ever more 
sophisticated photocopying machines a tiny plastic thread and 
microscopic printing were added changes that could not be 
reproduced by copying machines

a man who was relocated here after 
testifying in the killing of a new york city police officer was 
moved again and even his attorney says he doesnt know where the 
man is now 
the man a guyanese immigrant with the single name of arjune 
came to local attention when he recently claimed that he was roughed 
up by a police officer 
he passed a private lie detector test on that claim then was 
quickly relocated under the federal witness program that brought him 
to spokane originally attorney carl maxey said friday 
arjune who took the name of amos hardeen under his new identity 
was moved to spokane secretly a year ago after he became a key 
witness in the prosecution of two men accused of killing new york 
city police officer edward byrne whose death became a factor in 
last years presidential campaign when george bush said it showed 
the need for the death penalty 
all i can tell you is that hes gone said maxey even i 
dont know where they took him this time 
arjunes cover was effectively blown in his runin with local 
police 
this past week he publicly discussed his arrest on sept 1 by 
officer patricia madsen saying she called him a racial slur 
accused him of being a drug dealer and struck him in the back while 
he was arrested and taken to jail 
madsen said she stopped arjunes car for speeding and suspected 
him of being drunk when a blood test showed he had not been 
drinking he was booked on charges of speeding and failure to stop 
at a stop sign he also was accused of resisting arrest 
police chief terry mangan called arjune a liar who thinks he is 
above the law and said another polygraph examination cleared the 
arresting officer 
the new york murder case in which arjune testified gained 
national attention last year when bush was given the badge from the 
father of the slain officer 
bush last week also used the badge in a televised address to 
schoolchildren about the dangers of drugs 
arjune 47 lived in a crackravaged neighborhood in the new york 
borough of queens byrne a 22yearold rookie police officer was 
shot feb 26 1988 as he guarded arjunes house because of prior 
threats against arjune 
four men were convicted of seconddegree murder and weapons 
charges and were sentenced to 25 years to life in the killing 
arjune had led a quiet life in spokane working as a mechanic at 
a ford dealership 
armed federal agents were sent to guard arjune as a moving van 
cleared out his house in the shiloh hills area

house staff members met today with 
congressional investigators to outline an inquiry an ohio lawmaker 
is seeking into the navys report on the explosion aboard the 
battleship iowa 
rep mary rose oakar last week asked the general accounting 
office and the house armed services committee to investigate the 
thoroughness and impartiality of the navys probe 
the navy said it is standing by its investigation of the april 19 
gun turret explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship 
the study concluded that sabotage by clayton hartwig a gunners 
mate from cleveland most likely caused the blast 
aides to the house banking economic stabilization subcommittee 
which ms oakar chairs met with gao officials today to discuss 
details of her request for an investigation 
media general news service reported in a copyright story sunday 
that transcripts of interviews done by navy investigators showed the 
iowa was a floating laboratory for highexplosive experiments at the 
time of the blast 
investigators were also told improper gunpowder was being used in 
experiments when the no 2 turret exploded 
everything was very carefully considered said cmdr mark 
baker a navy spokesman at the pentagon who defended the navys 
report on the explosion 
the transcripts showed that the navy command which requested the 
experiments also performed the tests on the powder those tests led 
to the navys conclusion about the cause of the explosion 
a report the pentagon released earlier this month said 
circumstantial evidence indicated hartwig sparked the explosion on 
purpose that conclusion could not be proved however because all 
the witnesses died in the blast the report added 
gunners were firing an experimental load from the no 2 turret 
with powder not approved for the weight of the projectile the 7007 
pages of transcripts showed the tests were designed to improve the 
accuracy and range of the ships old 16inch guns 
the ships gunners were using five 110pound bags of the powder 
instead of the normal charge of six bags of powder the report said 
the powder was clearly marked that it was not to be used with the 
heavyweight projectiles being fired 
the battleships commander capt fred b moosally told 
investigators that he did not know a fivebag charge was going to be 
used 
moosally said he approved the use of a reduced charge but 
said he thought that meant six 55pound bags of powder 
investigators pursued the theory that hartwig who took over as 
gun captain on short notice perhaps was confused to see only five 
bags of powder pop out from the powder cars instead of six and that 
somehow in the confusion the powder got rammed into the barrel too 
quickly splitting a bag open and setting off the powder by friction 
with the projectile 
the friction theory was eliminated by a series of technical tests 
under the direction of the naval sea systems command at the naval 
surface warfare center at dahlgren va the same command that 
request and encouraged the tests aboard the iowa 
sens john glenn and howard metzenbaum both dohio last week 
made a formal request to the senate armed services committe for 
investigations 
the letter from glenn and metzenbaum said hartwigs reputation 
has been harmed beyond repair by the navy report

job 
is it my fault i shouldnt get the sack because men cant keep 
their minds on the job said 24yearold tanya graovac who 
brought the action at the human rights and equal opportunity 
commission 
she said it was not her fault if somebody apparently cut his 
finger her story appeared on the front page of the australian a 
national newspaper 
ms graovac who was dismissed in june told the paper she didnt 
mind wolf whistles and suggestive remarks from male workers but 
that she was not prepared to accept being fired for being too 
goodlooking 
her employer solander industries of northern queensland denied 
the charge it may seem strange but we employ a lot of women on 
our sites said construction manager andrew corrigan she was 
part of a casual cleaning gang that was laid off because there was

an american team landed monday on a deserted 
pacific island where it believes amelia earhart crashed in her 1937 
attempt to fly around the world the expedition leader said 
there was no immediate sign of any wreckage richard 
gillespie head of the international group for historic aircraft 
research told his base camp in fiji from a ship off the island of 
nikumaroro 1000 miles to the east 
gillespies wilmington delbased group will spend the next 
three weeks searching nikumaroro in the kiribati archipelago 
near the beach the vegetation is very dense and easily could 
have hidden an aircraft from aerial searches he said of attempts 
52 years ago to locate the american pilot after she crashed 
the 16 expedition members including naval historians divers 
and archaeologists left fiji a week ago aboard a converted 
japanese trawler the pacific nomad 
after spending the past two years trying to resolve a mystery 
that has confounded experts for decades they concluded that miss 
earhart must have crashed landed on nikumaroro instead of her 
intended stopover destination of howland island 500 miles to the 
north 
gillespie said that if she crashed on the island at low tide she 
would have stood a good chance of surviving for a brief time 
nikumaroro also known as gardner is uninhabited and without 
fresh water the group believes miss earhart managed to send 
distress signals for about three days before dying of thirst 
we are all very exhilarated and in awe of the beauty of the 
place he said none of us have ever seen a place so wild as 
nikumaroro 
he said the vshaped island was home to a huge amount of wildlife 
seabirds of every description circle the island and 
blacktipped sharks are in constant attendance there are fish 
turtles and dolphins in abundance 
miss earhart disappeared in 1937 after taking off from papua new 
guinea just north of australia in an attempt to make the first 
circumnavigation of the world by plane her exploits achieved 
legendary status in the united states the flyer was 6820 miles 
short of her goal when she and navigator fred noonan vanished 
the expedition to find her remains which has cost 250000 so 
far was spurred by research by two fort walton beach fla men 
tom willi a former navy pilot and tom gannon a retired air force 
navigator 
they studied aircraft navigation of the 1930s to plot a probable 
course followed by earhart their research pointed toward nikumaroro

soviet politician boris yeltsin drank heavily and 
spent wildly during his highprofile tour of the united states an 
article in the communist party daily pravda contended today 
yeltsin on sunday wound up his ninecity us tour with a visit 
on sunday to a supermarket near houston and then a trip to miami 
pravda without comment reprinted what it said was an article on 
yeltsins behavior from the italian newspaper la repubblica 
yeltsin who arrived back in moscow today denounced the article 
its a simple lie slander and revenge for the fact that 
americans received us with admiration he told the associated 
press 
in a box on the communist party dailys front page telling 
readers what to find inside pravda quoted the la repubblica article 
as saying yeltsin found the united states to be a holiday a 
stage a 5000kilometerlong bar 
soviet officials have not commented on yeltsins trip to the 
united states saying that his behavior and his comments were his 
own affair since he was on a private trip 
but official papers have reprinted several comments recorded in 
the foreign press that in the soviet union could be damaging to 
yeltsin 
yeltsin the 58yearold former communist party chief of moscow 
was stripped of that job by president mikhail s gorbachev almost 
two years ago 
he has become an antiestablishment hero to many soviets by 
attacking special privileges for party and government officials and 
urging economic and political reforms be carried out more quickly 
muscovites in march gave him 89 percent of the vote in an 
election for a citywide seat in the new congress of peoples 
deputies last month he was elected along with five other reformers 
to the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the 
soviet parliament in 70 years 
but yeltsins battle with party regulars has continued at a 
central committee meeting earlier this year some party officials 
demanded an investigation of his statements that they said ran 
counter to party policy 
yeltsin accused the moscow party apparatus of dirty tricks aimed 
at upsetting his election campaign 
in houston he said americans were industrious friendly full 
of good humor and vitality the trip had changed his old 
perception of americans as generally crude and offensive 
speaking sunday to a luncheon sponsored by the university of 
miami graduate school of business studies he praised us democracy 
and farming techniques adding of course we shouldnt forget the 
beautiful american women whom weve met 
yeltsins trip included meetings with president bush and vice 
president quayle and an unscheduled visit to former president ronald 
reagan at a minnesota clinic where reagan had undergone surgery

us government officials will meet with island 
representatives this week to begin mapping a foreign and domestic 
policy for americas farflung possessions in the pacific and 
caribbean 
the federal government has often failed to consider the 
implications effects and potential of the noncontiguous pacific 
areas congress said in 1986 when it passed legislation ordering a 
policy to be formulated 
too often the federal government fails to take into account the 
effects of its foreign and domestic policies on the unique 
circumstances and character of the pacific basin said guam 
congressional delegate ben blaz a republican 
not since the carter administration in 1980 has any us 
administration clearly defined a policy for federal agencies to deal 
with the territories 
a twoday conference starting tuesday will be an excellent 
opportunity for island leaders to lay their concerns on the table 
but more importantly to work with federal officials to find 
solutions said stella g guerra who has been assistant interior 
secretary for territorial and international affairs for two months 
federal agency representatives headed by interior secretary 
manuel lujan will confer with officials from hawaii guam the 
northern mariana islands american samoa the marshall islands the 
federated states of micronesia palau and the virgin islands 
guerra said discussions will target issues such as economic 
development the applicability of federal laws social development 
us foreign policy for the region and federal executive 
organization 
of concern to hawaii guam and the northern mariana islands are 
the potential social economic and political impact of migration of 
people from the marshalls federated states and palau to urban 
centers 
the virgin islands were included because although they are in 
the caribbean they have problems in common with the pacific 
possessions said guerra 
excluding hawaii an estimated 350000 people live on islands and 
atolls in the almost empty expanse of the pacific south of japan 
east of the philippines and north of australia 
what guerra calls the american political family has been 
changing especially as the western pacific islands move toward 
their own political identities 
in late 1986 the reagan administration began dismantling the 
unestablished trust territory of the pacific islands 
the northern mariana islands became a us commonwealth 
the marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia 
became selfgoverning and semiautonomous under compacts of free 
association the compacts will provide the two island states a 
combined 25 billion through the year 2001 the united states 
retains responsibility for their defense and mutual security 
palau the fourth trust territory entity still is a trusteeship 
with the interior department administering its affairs 
guam an unincorporated us territory since 1950 is seeking 
commonwealth status legislation is pending in the us house of 
representatives 
american samoa is in its 89th year as a us territory with no 
serious indication of a change in its status 
the virgin islands is discussing a new political arrangement 
the pacific possessions have been of military importance to the 
united states defense since all but american samoa were captured 
from japanese occupation forces in bitter fighting 45 years ago

a us marshal apparently has issued himself a 
55000 mercedesbenz seized in a drug bust for use as a company 
car a newspaper reports 
the car that has been driven to and from work by basil stu 
baker us marshal for the southern district of texas was seized 
last year from a jamaican drug dealer the houston chronicle 
reported citing unidentified sources in the marshals service 
the 1988 goldtrimmed mercedes equipped with a cellular 
telephone is owned by the federal drug enforcement administration 
and is on loan to the marshals service 
spoils of the illegal drug trade seized by authorities are not 
intended for use by administrators said jim griffith an official 
with the seized asset division of the us marshals service seized 
property usually is auctioned and the proceeds used to buy equipment 
for federal drug agents 
marion hambrick special agentincharge of the dea office in 
houston said dea policy prohibits assigning luxury cars to its 
administrators 
however hambrick said he asked that the marshals service assign 
the mercedes to an administrator in that agency to lessen the risk 
of its being damaged 
griffith said he was not aware that baker was driving such a car 
there was no immediate comment monday from baker he was out of 
his office and will not return until sept 25 a secretary said 
monday 
under federal law the drug enforcement administration and other 
federal agencies may seize cash and other property from suspected 
drug dealers if the federal officials determine the property is 
connected to the illegal drug trade it legally may be forfeited to 
the government and used by federal drug enforcement officials 
the mercedes was seized by dea agents in august 1988 from the 
houston residence of clacon james a jamaican drug dealer later 
convicted of federal drug charges in mcallen and florida 
the car had been purchased the previous month by james and his 
girlfriend for 55000 in cash said greg gladden a lawyer

the state health department spiked plans to 
use 30 seconds of donated music in an aids prevention video after a 
union said the musicians had to be paid for their work 
the squabble spoiled plans to send the video to every junior and 
senior high school in new york state for the beginning of the school 
year according to health department spokesman peter slocum 
based on our past history and experience it had never occurred 
to us that we would have run into this situation slocum said 
the department had hoped that 10second snippets of three popular 
songs would lend a more realistic view to the video the artists and 
their record companies gave the state permission to use the songs 
for free but the american federation of musicians said no 
the union said it had an obligation to make sure its members were 
paid for their work and didnt want to set a precedent the health 
department said the union had no spirit of public service 
new york state schools are required to teach children about aids 
and the video prepared by the health department was designed to be 
part of that curriculum 
titled flashback the video shows teenagers being told about 
the ways they can contract acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
usually spread through sexual contact or the sharing of needles 
one flashback shows a teenage party for background the 
video producers wanted to include brief portions of three songs 
stand by me by ben e king a shoulder to cry on by tommy 
page and oh yeah by yello 
we felt that using songs that kids would recognize and that are 
popular for the students would lend reality to the situation and 
increase the level of interest slocum said last week 
but when the department sought union permission in what it 
expected to be a formality the union unfurled its price scale the 
rates include 8023 an hour for a musician and 16046 for an 
arranger 
with 17 union musicians used in the recording of a shoulder to 
cry on the union calculated the health department owed 236117 
stand by me would cost a relatively economical 166156 
health department officials said they didnt bother to ask the 
cost of using oh yeah they just said oh no to using the 
music 
we were very surprised because our experience at the health 
department has been that weve received wonderful cooperation 
throughout the years not just in aids but in all of our public 
service announcements slocum said weve never been turned down 
before 
patrick havey assistant to the president for the american 
federation of musicians said the union cant set a precedent by 
refusing to insist on payments for work performed 
we as a union dont have a right to compromise the rights of 
musicians whose prerecorded music is used havey said we dont 
want anyone to feel that were singling out the department of 
health because were not weve taken this position consistently 
down the line 
the health department said it would use generic background 
music thats part of the public domain the schools should get their 
videos delivered by early november or two months later than planned

defense secretary dick cheney declaring the 
war on drugs a national security problem ordered pentagon chiefs 
today to plan an attack on drug flow across the nations borders 
with steppedup use of planes radar and troops 
i believe that our military forces have the capability to make 
a substantial contribution toward drug interdiction and i am asking 
them to make the necessary preparations to carry out that 
responsibility cheney said 
in a news conference called to highlight the pentagons role in 
president bushs war on drugs cheney offered no specifics on how 
much new money or personnel would be devoted to interdicting drugs 
at the borders 
he said he could not even give a ballpark cost estimate until the 
plans are drawn up 
cheney said the defense department will not be drawn into a law 
enforcement role in the antidrug battle and us forces overseas 
will not be put in combat situations 
theres a clear line out there cheney said that the 
military will not cross 
he acknowledged that using us military personnel to train other 
nations forces can put people at risk 
its a dangerous business i hope nobodys hurt in the process 
but i cant guarantee it cheney said 
cheney ordered the nations top military commanders to come up 
with plans by oct 15 to help stem the flow of drugs through the 
caribbean and across the mexican border 
cheney said he would instruct commanders to plan for 
a substantial caribbean counternarcotics task force with 
appropriate planes and ships to cut the drug flow from latin 
america 
deploying forces to support the counternarcotics work of us 
law enforcement agencies and cooperating foreign governments 
especially on the nations southern border and the border with 
mexico 
using norad north american aerospace defense command to help 
detect and counter illegal drug traffic across the borders 
plan to combat the production and trafficking of illegal drugs 
in conjunction with cooperating host countries 
congress has been pressing the pentagon to do more in the war on 
drugs while military leaders have expressed reluctance about using 
their everdwindling resources to enter a domestic war against 
civilian drugsmugglers 
but cheney has convinced some military doubters of the need for a 
new approach primarily because of the size of the crack cocaine 
epidemic and because the white house has demanded a new emphasis on 
the issue said a senior defense department official who did not 
wish to be identified 
cheney plans to attack the problem of competing interests in the 
drug war by improving ways of sharing intelligence information among 
the agencies 
one large question that remains unresolved is where the money for 
the drug battle will be found 
the official said cheneys plan will not require any more funding 
than that proposed by bush whose initial strategy has been widely 
criticized on capitol hill for not being adequately funded or going 
far enough

jiang zemin the communist party chief whose name 
has surfaced as the possible heir to senior leader deng xiaoping 
faces keen rivals and the vagaries of chinese politics in any future 
bid for greater power 
deng chinas 85yearold patriarch named the former shanghai 
mayor as his heir in informal talks with other senior officials 
in may and june the new york times said monday 
diplomats and chinese sources however say jiangs ascendancy 
will be far from automatic 
dengs statements which the times said referred to jiang as the 
core of the new generation of chinese leaders came as the 
communist party moved to purge reformist party chief zhao ziyang 
zhao accused of supporting the studentled prodemocracy 
movement crushed by the military june 34 was ousted from all his 
posts on june 24 and replaced by jiang 
jiang 62 by assuming leadership of the 47millionmember 
communist party became the post powerful political figure in china 
besides deng who retains the last word in all major decisions 
although he has resigned from all but one of his official posts 
deng is still chairman of the central military commission a 
crucial post in a nation where the military has a major say in 
politics particularly after the military suppression of student 
dissent in june 
deng widely reported to be suffering from prostate cancer would 
have approved jiang as party chief with the understanding that jiang 
would become first among equals once deng passes from the scene 
but the former engineer and minister of the electronics industry 
has had little experience in party politics and fewer ties to the 
military 
he has been in shanghai the past four years as mayor and party 
secretary and is said to lack the personal allegiances in beijing 
needed to sustain him in a serious power struggle 
jiang is certainly also aware that being dengs heir apparent is 
a highly dangerous position the last two in his place were both 
ousted from their jobs in disgrace for being too lenient toward 
student demonstrators 
the late party general secretary hu yaobang was the first to go 
in january 1986 followed by zhao in june zhao is reportedly under 
house arrest and could still face criminal charges for allegedly 
supporting what the government calls the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion of this spring 
jiang like hu and zhao has been a solid supporter of dengs 
marketoriented reforms while in shanghai jiang who speaks good 
english worked hard to attract foreign investment and modernize 
industry in chinas largest city 
unlike his two predecessors jiang has tried to solidify his 
position by coming down hard on the need for party discipline and 
loyalty to chinas socialist system 
we must sternly observe unified party discipline namely the 
individual obeys the group the minority obeys the majority the 
lower levels obey the upper levels the whole party obeys the 
center he wrote in a recently published essay we cannot allow 
the unchecked spread of individualism separatism and 
moneyworship 
if deng were to suddenly leave the scene jiang would almost 
certainly face strong competition for power from party 
conservatives led by premier li peng and president yang shangkun 
yang a robust 82 is a former general who has been general 
secretary of the central military commission for the past eight 
years he is the only viable choice at the moment to become chairman 
of the commission if deng were to depart giving him powerful 
leverage in any future political maneuverings 
yang is a comrade of dengs going back to the civil war against 
the nationalists but some observers feel deng may try to hold on to 
his commission post for a few more years to give jiang more time to 
build up his support within the party 
li 60 joined yang in declaring martial law in beijing and 
ordering the troops to attack the students and their supporters he 
is thought to be ambitious and has proved to be ruthless 
another variable is the reformists zhao and his supporters who 
have been beaten into silence at the moment but considering the 
unpredictable nature of chinese politics could stage a comeback 
if that happens jiang could turn out to be only a stopgap party 
chief who will be washed into obscurity when the political tide 
turns

the director of the national aids program 
office of the public health service said monday the government is 
getting information to fight the disease while protecting the 
privacy of its victims 
though the federal government has not enacted confidentiality 
laws aimed specifically at aids patients states have dr james 
allen told the house energy and commerce subcommittee on health and 
the environment 
state legal controls as well as the ethical traditions of the 
health professions and the management and administrative practices 
of health care institutions all protect the privacy of patients 
allen said 
he said that when information about a persons hiv status is 
disclosed it is to help treatment of the patient and protect public 
health 
allen was called before the subcommittee to summarize a report 
requested by congress and issued monday on state confidentiality 
laws regarding aids patients 
subcommittee chairman rep henry waxman dcalif said aids 
patients had to be willing to seek treatment with the assurance they 
would be protected from prosecution if they got the illness through 
an illegal act such as intravenous drug use or homosexual relations 
which in some states is illegal 
the centers for disease control concluded in 1987 that hundreds 
of thousands americans should be counseled and tested for aids but 
that fears of breaches of confidentiality pose a major barrier to 
getting these people into clinics waxman said 
allen said that besides the action taken by states to ensure 
privacy antidiscrimination legislation such as that recently 
passed by the senate would make aids victims more likely to come 
forward 
the proposed federal americans with disabilities act supported 
by president bush and awaiting action by the house would prohibit 
employers and others from discriminating against people with any one 
of a wide range of physical or mental disabilities and is considered 
the most expansive civil rights legislation since the civil rights 
act of 1964

experts from the united states and 14 other 
countries on monday began trying to coordinate their attack on a key 
aspect of the worldwide drug problem the laundering of profits 
from narcotics 
the oneday meeting the first of a series was largely 
organizational and was characterized by participating officials as 
a first exchange of views on the measures needed to fight money 
laundering 
the experts decided to organize their work around three themes 
evaluation of the money laundering phenomenon reinforcement of 
mutual judicial assistance and reinforcement of administrative 
cooperation 
the effort was mandated by the leaders of the worlds seven 
richest democracies during their summit meeting in july 
in the final communique of the summit the seven noted that the 
drug problem had reached devastating proportions and proposed an 
international task force to hit at the traffickers profits 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy estimated that between 
200 billion and 400 billion are produced by the drug traffic every 
year this illicit money finds its way back into the worlds economy 
through numerous complicated schemes involving bogus companies and 
countless bank transfers 
a senior us treasury department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said it is hard to find an issue that has 
galvanized the worlds attention as much as the drug issue has its 
a truly global issue 
this meeting represents the most prominent recognition of the 
fact that in order to get your arms around the drug problem you 
have to hit the economic and financial side of the house the us 
official said like global commerce there really is no boundary 
no waters edge 
money laundering often begins in countries with strict bank 
secrecy laws such as the dutch antilles the cayman islands 
luxembourg and switzerland investigators tracking money from drug 
sales frequently bump up against a stone wall while trying to follow 
the money trail through countries 
while not mentioning names beregovoy stressed the need to get 
around the bank secrecy of some countries in order to strike at the 
traffickers 
the maintenance of absolute bank secrecy seems to me to be 
incompatible with the efficient fight against the laundering of drug 
money the french finance minister said last week the answer he 
said was that under judicial control and with agreement between 
countries it must be made possible to restrict bank secrecy in 
order to seize money from drug trafficking 
among those attending the meeting presided over by denis 
samuellajeuness assistant secretary for international affairs at 
the french treasury were switzerland and luxembourg frequently 
cited by frustrated investigators as examples of countries whose 
bank secrecy laws impede police 
this is not a study group beregovoy said of the financial 
action task force being created at this meeting this group of 
experts must devise and make action decisions 
the final communique of the july summit said the task force is to 
analyze the problems and submit a report with recommendations in 
april 
its work will cover the entirety of the problem said 
beregovoy our knowledge of the networks of drug money laundering 
channels the places the methods amounts reinforcement of mutual 
judicial aid and the organization of administrative and financial 
operations 
other participants at the meeting included west germany canada 
britain japan italy australia austria belgium spain the 
netherlands sweden and the european commission executive body of 
the common market

the second of two rare beaked whales that 
beached themselves died early monday after a record 25 days in 
captivity officials at marine worldafrica usa said 
hundreds of volunteers had helped care for the young marine 
mammals which had never before survived in captivity 
the whale that died monday alexander was found aug 24 on ocean 
beach in san francisco with a second beaked whale that was named 
nicholas 
alexander had been suffering from pneumonia but marine world 
president mike demetrios said the exact cause of death will not be 
known for up to 10 days when final results of a necrospy and 
pathology tests are available 
he did the same thing the other did right before it died 
said demetrios he began swimming very rapidly around the pool 
nicholas died of a severe case of pneumonia sept 8 
alexander had been eating well and was given a shot of 
antibiotics sunday night and a volunteer was in the pool with the 
whale when it died he said 
marine researchers had not expected them to survive their first 
night in captivity 
we always know this can happen said demetrios the chances 
are terrible but the longer they last the more attached you 
become the more you root for them 
for the first time researchers were able to record beaked 
whales vocalizations and collect footage of them swimming 
underwater 
the shy deepdiving beaked whales are never seen within two or 
three miles of shore said demetrios 
people had sent dozens of getwell cards for the ailing pair and 
a research fund had been established in their names 
researchers have not yet been able to verify which of 18 species 
of beaked whale nicholas and alexander were

went to the predominantly white bensonhurst section of brooklyn to 
look at a used car that had been advertised for sale 
the four black youths were set upon by a mob of about 30 whites 
carrying bats golf clubs and at least one bat police said the 
whites mistakenly believed that hawkins and his companions were 
friends of a white neighborhood girl 
the case has raised racial tensions in the city and is believed 
to have been a factor in mayor edward i kochs defeat in last 
weeks democratic primary 
at mondays hearing owens refused a prosecution request to raise 
or revoke the 75000 bail for serrano and patino based on the new 
indictment owens said he may reconsider the request after reviewing 
the grand jury notes 
mondello is out on 100000 bail and raucci is out on 75000 
bail assistant district attorney paul burns said he was not legally 
able to ask for any change in their bail because the charges against 
them had not changed

revoked 
these defendants have now been indicted for the most heinous 
crimes in this society stewart said release on bail pending 
trial sends a dangerous message to other persons who are 
contemplating murdering a young person of african descent because of 
race

communist party leaders converged on moscow monday 
for a longawaited central committee meeting on ethnic problems that 
have left more than 200 people dead one republic virtually 
blockaded and mass movements calling for secession 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev first promised the special 
session which begins tuesday 18 months ago after 31 people were 
killed in armenianazerbaijani rioting in the republic of azerbaijan 
in february 1988 
since then ethnic tension in this country of more than 100 
nationalities has worsened violence has broken out in armenia 
georgia uzbekistan and kazakhstan in addition to azerbaijan the 
ethnic problems have combined with severe shortages of consumer 
goods food rationing and unsettling political changes all 
threatening gorbachevs program of perestroika or economic and 
social restructuring 
gorbachev said last week on national television that discordant 
voices are speculating openly about the possibility of a coup 
imminent chaos and even civil war 
the central committee meeting will have to deal with a range of 
problems 
they include the following 
armenians say their republic is being strangled by an economic 
blockade launched by neighboring azerbaijan which controls the key 
rail and highway access 
millions of baltic residents have signed documents favoring 
independence for estonia lithuania and latvia 
110 enterprises with mostly russian workers are on strike in 
soviet moldavia over a law making moldavian the official language of 
the republic 
the death toll of around 200 in the ethnic unrest includes 100 
killed in rioting in the fergana valley of uzbekistan in june and 
more than 100 killed in violence between armenians and azerbaijanis 
since february 
out of this unrest the communist party says it hopes to create a 
situation where all soviet citizens can feel at home in any part 
of the country 
a draft ethnic policy published for discussion last month calls 
for restructuring the soviet union as a federation of republics with 
broader autonomous powers and even suggests that the agreement that 
created the union in 1922 could be rewritten 
it blames the ethnic tension on disputes dating back centuries 
aggravated by dictator josef stalins mass reprisals and 
resettlement of whole peoples including the crimean tatars 
meskhetian turks germans koreans greeks kurds kalmyks 
karachayevs balkarians chechen and inkgush 
it offers the republics the power to question national laws 
before a strengthened high court and the right to use and distribute 
their national resources but it reserves for the national 
government the right to decide property relations at a time when 
baltic leaders want to legalize private property 
the proposed policy also calls for creation of new local councils 
for small minorities and national associations for groups with no 
territory of their own 
legally such changes would have to be approved by the new 
supreme soviet legislature but its deputies are overwhelmingly 
communist party members and the legislators are only beginning to 
stray from the party line in their debates and actions 
there is nothing in the proposal that offers specific solutions 
to disputes in the baltics the caucasus central asia or anywhere 
else 
it does suggest creating a new government body to handle such 
problems a proposal in line with gorbachevs plan to shift power 
from the party to the government 
armenian leaders plan to ask the party meeting to break an 
economic blockade imposed by azerbaijan rem ananikyan an editor of 
the official armenpress news agency in yerevan said in a telephone 
interview 
armenian party chief suren arutyunyan and azerbaijan leader 
abdulrakhman vezirov are among those who will attend the meeting 
about 80 percent of armenias shipments from other parts of the 
soviet union arrive by road and rail through azerbaijan armenians 
say they have received almost nothing through azerbaijan for nearly 
two months 
the two republics have been locked for the past 18 months in a 
bitter territorial dispute over nagornokarabakh the predominantly 
armenian population demands that the region be taken from azerbaijan 
and annexed to armenia moscow has imposed direct rule on the 
region but azerbaijans parliament saturday demanded return of its 
authority 
the official soviet press has reported that even ambulances are 
at a standstill in the armenian capital yerevan because there is 
no fuel 
theres no salt theres no sugar theres no oil ananikyan 
said when asked about supplies in yerevan stores the vegetables 
are not being harvested because theres no fuel 
armenian officials say builders in northern armenia who are 
reconstructing cities leveled the earthquake dec 7 are out of 
supplies that means many people may be without shelter as winter 
approaches they say 
supplies also have been cut off from nagornokarabakh official 
news reports said 
pravda reported monday that five people were killed when a bomb 
exploded in an intercity bus in the azerbaijani town of evlakh six 
hours after the bus left tbilisi the capital of the georgian 
republic authorities do not know if the explosion saturday was 
related to ethnic tensions between azerbaijanis and georgians

peace talks they hope could pave the way to ending their 28year war 
the delegations recessed over the weekend while former president 
jimmy carter was in nicaragua on a factfinding mission tuesday 
will be the ninth day of negotiations at the atlantabased carter 
center 
carter center officials are not sure whether the talks will end 
tuesday said center spokeswoman beth carpenter 
carter said friday that the ethiopian government and the eritrean 
peoples liberation front had agreed to hold additional talks in 
africa and had made much progress toward setting an agenda for those 
talks 
he said they agreed on items such as the official languages 
publicity recording and procedural rules for the talks which would 
be held in one or more of these nations north yemen egypt sudan 
kenya tanzania and zimbabwe 
about 1 million people have died in fighting and famine related 
to the war over the independence of eritrea a northern province in 
the horn of africa that contains ethiopias only direct access to 
the red sea 
the eritrean front in the past has demanded that the people of

substantive peace negotiations

blood tests of prison and jail inmates across the 
country show that about one in 24 is infected with the aids virus 
fewer than expected researchers said monday 
the study is the first to try to estimate the prevalence of aids 
in prisoners said its principal author dr ford brewer of the 
johns hopkins university school of hygiene and public health in 
baltimore 
the 11198 inmates in the study came from 10 prisons and jails 
they were selected to give us a pretty good overall picture 
of the extent of aids infection in inmates brewer said at a meeting 
of the american society for microbiology where he presented his 
results 
of the inmates tested 476 or 425 percent were infected with 
aids brewer reported smaller local studies by others had found 
infection rates of up to 32 percent among prisoners with the 
exception of one new york city study that found 174 percent of 
inmates were infected brewer said 
brewer found the highest rates of infection up to 8 percent in 
the midatlantic states reflecting the high prevalence of aids 
infections in that population he said as few as 27 percent of the 
inmates were infected in one jail on the west coast 
the figures at all the institutions were lower than expected 
brewer said most of these prison and jails thought it was going 
to be four or five times as high he said 
that is because other surveys have found that between 27 percent 
and 41 percent of inmates report that they are intravenous drug 
abusers and between 36 percent and 7 percent report that they have 
engaged in homosexual activity 
homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers are the groups most 
affected by aids so far 
blood for the testing was obtained from the inmates during 
routine medical screening when they entered the jails and prisons 
brewer said the blood was frozen and immediately shipped to johns 
hopkins for testing 
brewer said 3136 cases of aids had been reported among prisoners 
as of october 1988 with about 3 million adults in prisons and jails 
in the united states his estimate of the number infected with the 
aids virus suggests that the number of cases will climb as infected 
inmates become ill 
corrections officials will be required to prepare for treatment 
of these inmates he said furthermore education and monitoring of 
inmates can help slow the spread of aids brewer said 
the study was conceived in 1984 but brewer faced numerous 
obstacles in getting permission to test inmates blood for aids 
everybody was concerned that big brother was going to swoop 
down and that the testing would result in discrimination against 
the prisoners brewer said 
the study was funded by the federal centers for disease control 
in atlanta the cdc is now taking over the study and incorporating 
it into its surveys of aids infection said ida onorato of the cdc 
onorato reported in a separate study that the rate of aids 
infection among intravenous drug abusers going to drug treatment 
clinics ranged as high as 488 percent 
infection rates were highest in the east and in metropolitan 
areas as they were with the prison study she said

federal housing officials promised congress on 
monday to permanently remove influence peddling from a 
scandaltarred program and sought help in reversing a court decision 
they said could cost the agency more than past abuses 
the promise and request from top aides to housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp came at a senate banking committee 
hearing that also included testimony from a former florida housing 
official who said he despised the way some rental subsidies were 
awarded through political connections but didnt complain because it 
was the only way to get needed assistance 
and the panels chairman sen donald riegle said he planned to 
call before the committee all of the major figures mentioned in 
allegations of abuses at hud including former secretary samuel 
pierce and his top aides his decision was seen as an indication 
that the senate would expand its review of hud during the reagan 
administration to rival a house investigation of favoritism and 
abuse at the department during pierces tenure 
the hearing focused on huds section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program the subject of a scathing report earlier this year in which 
huds inspector general said that lucrative subsidies were awarded 
to former hud officials or other developers who retained prominent 
republican consultants 
much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision to 
repeal a fair share formula through which the subsidies were 
awarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need for 
the lowincome housing and the ability to administer the program 
after congress repealed the formula hud headquarters assumed 
most of the funding authority and had wide latitude in awarding 
subsidies creating a climate the inspector general said allowed 
political favoritism to flourish 
kemp however voluntarily decided to revert to using the fair 
share approach and his deputies said the department would continue 
to do so if the program is funded next year which is still in 
question 
theres no question about that james logue huds deputy 
assistant secretary for multifamily housing said when asked whether 
kemp was committed to the fairshare formula 
the inspector general also found that many modrehab projects 
were approved at excessive rents costing the government hundreds of 
millions of dollars over the 15year subsidy contracts 
logue said about 300 of the projects will be audited in the first 
quarter of the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 and that hud 
would move to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriately 
calculated 
kemp at a prior hearing agreed with a congressmans 
ballpark estimate that abuses at the agency during pierces 
tenure likely would cost taxpayers about 2 billion 
logue on monday said a recent court decision rejecting huds 
formula for granting rent increases to section 8 projects could cost 
the government as much as 25 billion over the next decade and 
asked the committee to take legislative steps to reverse the courts 
action 
in the ruling the 9th circuit court of appeals rejected huds 
use of market comparability studies to determine the annual rent 
increases granted for subsidized rental housing 
logue said the ruling would cost hud about 150 million in the 
9th circuits jurisdiction which includes nine western states and 
if applied nationwide could cost the government between 600 million 
and 1 billion in retroactive payments and up to an additional 15 
billion over the next decade 
sen bob graham dfla who presided over most of the hearing 
said the committee would consider the request 
graham and other committee members spent more than an hour 
questioning melvin j adams the former director of the housing 
department in dade county fla who said political contacts were 
the key to winning mod rehab subsidies and that dade county got more 
than its fair share of the awards 
i thought it was not right but it was benefiting people i 
wanted to provide housing for adams said had i just blown the 
whistle thats what i would have gotten nothing

america are anxious to join in the war on drugs because we are not 
exempt from the problem 
in a pitch for his proposals to toughen the clean air act and 
reduce acid rain and smog bush said its not enough to stop 
dirtying the air weve got to clean it up 
and to help do that we should remember the oldest cheapest 
and most efficient air purifier on earth trees said the 
president who was himself planting centennial trees here and in 
helena today and in spokane wash on tuesday 
last april bush planted his first centennial tree in bismarck 
nd officials in that state have pledged to plant 100 million trees 
by the year 2000 
i challenge you to come up with a pledge of your own to join 
the new greening of america by foresting south dakota with 
centennial trees the president said 
it doesnt take a federal program it doesnt take a new 
bureaucracy and it sure doesnt take some fancy new study he 
said what it takes is a shovel it is a family project you can do 
in your own homes literally in your own back yards 
bush said the federal government planted just 340000 acres of 
trees last year while private efforts families and businesses 
planted eight times that number enough to blanket an area almost 
the size of connecticut 
he said treeplanting can exemplify his theme of volunteerism in 
america the socalled thousand points of light bush evoked 
during his election campaign 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush wanted to use 
the crosscountry trip to build support for his 79 billion 
antidrug strategy which democrats in congress want to expand 
there was a small glitch with the tree bush planted in bismarck 
last april 24 a local forester discovered that the tree 
transplanted from the white house lawn was carrying several tiny 
larvae of the gypsy moth the leafeating insect that has 
devastated elms in many eastern and some western states 
the larvae were removed and the centennial tree a descendant of 
one planted by president john quincy adams was thoroughly sprayed 
with insecticide 
in sioux falls today bush quipped not every president is 
blessed with a green thumb noting that the last centennial tree 
he planted had some kind of moth disease he said so far im 
having about as much luck planting as i did fishing during his 
recent vacation in maine

a senate democratic task force to assess the 
nations housing needs and recommend reforms in the department of 
housing and urban development was named monday by majority leader 
george mitchell 
sen alan cranston of california named to head the eightmember 
task force said one of its purposes will be to prod the bush 
administration to take a position on housing for the disadvantaged 
there are still people in the administration who dont want to 
see any national housing programs cranston said 
he said the eventual aim is to forge a bipartisan approach on 
housing and produce a bill president bush will sign 
the problems of housing affordability are not going away they 
continue to build pressure on millions of americans cranston said 
in a statement 
young failies find it harder to buy their first home older 
people cant find housing that enables them to live with dignity and 
independence the supply of decent housing that lowincome people 
can afford is fast disappearing homelessness remains a shame on the 
nation 
mitchell said the task force will issue a report and make 
recommendations by the end of the year he said comprehensive 
housing legislation will be a high priority for next year 
cranston said he believes such a bill should include a sweeping 
overhaul of hud 
it should prevent any repeat of the recent scandal by ensuring 
that hud resources are used fairly to provide as much decent 
affordable housing as possible where it is most needed he said 
insider dealing ripoffs by consultants and excessive profits 
through doubledipping must be eliminated with stiff penalties 
cranston said the legislation also should modernize and rebuild 
the federal housing administration holding managers accountable for 
financing and program effectiveness and bringing up to date 
financial controls and accounting systems 
at present he said unrealistic fha mortgage regulations have 
knocked fha loans totally out of the market in many parts of the 
country 
the bill also should seek to build a national network of 
partnerships including states communities private industry 
nonprofit organizations and the federal government to provide an 
adequate supply of affordable housing cranston said 
other members of the task force are sens christopher dodd 
dconn bob graham dfla john kerry dmass barbara mikulski

george bush has finally broken with ronald 
reagan the issue trees 
where reagan saw trees as a pervasive polluter of the atmosphere 
his successor praises them as the oldest cheapest and most 
efficient air purifier on earth 
reagan said nine years ago that more atmospheric contamination 
was caused by natural processes than manmade pollution but bush 
declared monday that its tree planting time for america and for 
all of spaceship earth 
reagan contended during the 1980 presidential campaign that trees 
were responsible for 93 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the 
atmosphere environmentalists said reagan confused nitrous oxide 
which comes from decaying plant matter and isnt harmful with 
nitrogen oxide a pollutant emitted by coal plants 
the theory prompted reagan press secretary james brady who was 
in the campaign plane as it flew over a burning forest to shout in 
jest killer trees killer trees 
bush came down on the side of environmentalists in a speech in 
sioux falls sd inviting his audience to join the greening of 
america 
trees he said can reduce the heat of a summers day quiet a 
highways noise feed the hungry provide shelter from the wind and 
warmth in the winter 
every tree he said is a compact between generations 
all true says neil sampson a vice president of the american 
forestry association 
weve got a tremendous opportunity to affect the environment 
with trees and that can start for many people right around their 
house he said this is not rocket science it doesnt take new 
technology it doesnt cause us to go to heroic investments 
it isnt going to cure the whole world either but at least 
its a start of doing something positive we know how to do it 
today weve got the money to do it and we have people who know how 
to do it 
the plant a tree idea comes late 
since the first europeans set foot on americas shores about 300 
million acres of forests have disappeared to build cities and 
provide land for fields and roads 
of the 2 billion acres that make up the united states 737 
million acres are forest sampson said 
he suggested cities are the place to start planting trees 
most cities are under a heat island effect they are four 
degrees warmer than the suburbs and that seems to be rising by one 
degree per decade he said for each degree of heat we power 
consumers in washington pay an extra 10000 an hour 
in the process of growing wood trees take in carbon dioxide 
the stuff we exhale convert it into cellulose and breathe out 
oxygen they also act like huge coolers by evaporating water which 
absorbs heat as it moves from liquid to a vapor 
bush challenged south dakotans to pledge to plant 100 million 
trees by 2000 something north dakotans already have promised to do 
sampson said his group has been urging 100 million new trees too 
but around homes and businesses under a program called global 
releaf 
he said that los angeles a year before the city was to be the 
site of the 1984 olympics planted 1 million trees air pollution 
experts believe that was the single most costeffective way to 
improve air quality sampson said 
houston is aiming for 2 million trees by the turn of the century 
he said 
in his speech bush mentioned that the white house grounds have 
an elm planted by john quincy adams southern magnolias brought 
andrew jackson and oaks planted by dwight d eisenhower 
he didnt mention that for his seal adams used the latin words 
alteri seculo taken from the phrase he plants trees to 
benefit another generation

amtrak pleaded innocent monday via 
facsimile machine to charges that it illegally flushes 
passengercar toilets and sewage tanks when its trains cross florida 
waterways where fishermen have been sprayed 
the transmission of the pleas to circuit judge robert perry 
quickly ended an arraignment said assistant state attorney paul 
meredith the judge scheduled a nov 2 hearing for pretrial motions 
amtrak has threatened to halt service in florida 
the plea was entered after amtrak earlier rejected a settlement 
offer from state attorney john tanner who promised to drop three 
charges of commercial dumping if amtrak would stop all flushing 
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers in his 
judicial district 
amtrak which has been dumping along its tracks under a federal 
law dating back more than a century said it cant do that because 
it would set a precedent 
the federal law permits the railway to flush toilets along its 
rightofway and federal law overrides state and local regulations 
amtrak contends 
amtrak has also come under fire in several western states for its 
sanitary habits but amtrak spokesman clifford black said this is 
the first complaint filed in a criminal court 
amtrak had threatened to suspend service in florida if tanner 
pressed his case but tanner said amtrak was bluffing 
we hope we wont have to suspend service to florida said 
amtrak spokeswoman sue martin in washington dc but we are 
between a rock and a hard place and we certainly do not want to 
continue this public embarrassment we do not want to be accused of 
committing a felony every day 
tanner filed the misdemeanor counts after getting complaints from 
people who said they were sprayed with raw sewage while fishing 
beneath trestles in the palatka area of northeastern florida tanner 
said the charges would be dropped if amtrak agreed to stop dumping 
over rice creek a tributary of the st johns river and in the 
river itself 
black said agreeing to tanners conditions would have made amtrak 
a target for similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop 
dumping in any body of water in florida 
amtraks passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping 
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the 
contents of 30gallon holding tanks along the tracks when the trains 
are traveling at least 35 mph 
the company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with 
cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets black said it 
would cost 147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet

state and local governments must form 
partnerships with private industry if the united states is to regain 
its position as a leader in the global economy southern governors 
were told monday 
top industry representatives told the southern governors 
association that a skilled work force fair treatment by government 
regulators and a cooperative spirit between government and business 
are key to improving the united states position in the industrial 
world 
the governors must work harder to keep plants from relocating to 
other countries said edgar s woolard chairman and chief executive 
of wilmingtonbased du pont co 
the fastest economic growth over the next 10 years will be 
outside the united states woolard said adding that companies 
must locate in the spot where we can best serve customers 
the education of americas future workers also preoccupied 
members of the association which represents 17 states puerto rico 
and the us virgin islands on the first day of their threeday 
annual meeting 
from our perspective we need people with basic skills 
woolard said he said industry should cooperate with government to 
help identify skills that are expected to be in demand and help 
provide needed training programs 
ira magaziner an author and international corporate consultant 
said that in addition to improving education states should support 
research and development activities that benefit industry 
we have to take drastic steps and think very boldly about 
the future to make us competitive again magaziner said 
peter h mills chief administrative officer of sematech a 
superconductor research company in austin texas cautioned the 
governors not to court businesses indiscriminately 
you must understand the needs of the company you must 
understand the competition in a global perspective mills said 
states should not be encouraged to pursue every economic 
development advantage that comes down the street but instead 
concentrate on what the state needs and has to offer 
magaziner added that states ought to look beyond nailing down an 
initial agreement for a new business to open 
in other countries government officials continue negotiating 
with new businesses to get them to deepen what they are doing 
there european companies are used to that kind of dialogue and 
probably would be open to that 
premier david peterson of ontario canada held a breakfast 
meeting with some of the governors and told them he was initially 
opposed to the uscanadian free trade agreement signed in january 
peterson said that although he now supports it strength of the 
new settlement is untested we dont know how its going to shake 
down he said 
he said ontario did about 84 billion in trade with the great 
lakes region last year compared to 18 billion with the south 
ontario now has an office in atlanta and officials there hope to 
increase trade with the southern states

some officials said monday that indias 
decision to withdraw its troops from sri lanka could help end ethnic 
violence that has killed 16000 people but others feared it might 
result in a bloodbath 
according to an agreement signed monday in colombo india will 
withdraw its 42000 peacekeeping troops from the island by the end 
of the year breaking a threemonth diplomatic deadlock between the 
two south asian neighbors 
the troops stationed in sri lanka to enforce a 1987 peace 
accord also will begin observing a unilateral ceasefire in their 
campaign against tamil militants at 6 am wednesday the agreement 
said 
in new delhi a foreign ministry spokesman was optimistic the 
agreement would work because it accommodated each others 
interests and concerns 
a leader of the moderate sinhalese liberal party welcomed the 
agreement as a step toward ending spiraling violence it sounds 
like at last we might see an end to the violence because this is a 
starting point to get all forces into the democratic process said 
chanaka amaratunga 
the agreement also said the sri lankan army commander and the 
commanding officer of the indian troops will monitor possible 
ceasefire violations and report them to sri lankan president 
ranasinghe premadasa 
a moderate tamil leader feared the withdrawal of indian troops 
would lead to a security vacuum and cause a bloodbath 
will there be a professional police force capable of commanding 
the confidence of all people in the north and east because only 
such a force can prevent a bloodbath scenario once the indian troops 
leave said the leader who spoke on condition of anonymity 
india deployed more than 50000 troops to sri lanka in july 1987 
to supervise a peace accord that offered tamil rebels limited 
autonomy if they laid down their weapons and ended their campaign 
for an independent homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of 
the island nation 
but the largest and most militant rebel group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam rejected the accord because it did not 
fulfill their expectations and turned their guns against indian 
troops 
the presence of indian troops also caused a bloody backlash by 
sinhalese militants extremists of the sinhalese peoples liberation 
front opposed the government for signing the accord that offered too 
many concessions to the tamils they also resented the presence of 
indian troops on the island as a threat to national sovereignty 
tamils who are mostly hindu form 18 percent of the countrys 16 
million people and claim they are discriminated against in jobs and 
education by members of the sinhalese community who are mostly 
buddhist and comprise 75 percent of the population dominating the 
government and military 
at least 11000 people including 1000 indian troops have been 
killed since the tamil insurgency started in 1983 another 5000 
have died in the sinhalese backlash 
in an effort to curb ethnic violence that has ripped across the 
onceidyllic palmfringed indian ocean island premadasa demanded 
indian troops leave by july 29 the second anniversary of the 
signing of the indosri lankan peace accord but indian prime 
minister rajiv gandhi refused saying a hasty withdrawal could lead 
to greater bloodshed 
india made a token withdrawal on july 29 and then made gradual 
pullouts it finalized a schedule for withdrawal of the remaining 
troops at the meeting of nonaligned nations earlier this month in 
yugoslavia 
a peace committee consisting of members of political and ethnic 
groups in the northeastern province will be formed to settle local 
administrative issues under mondays agreement 
a security coordination group also will be set up to ensure law 
and order in the northeastern province it will include the sri 
lankan minister of state for defense the defense secretary and the 
commander of the indian peacekeeping troops

israels defense minister told president 
hosni mubarak monday that israel would accept an egyptiansponsored 
dialogue with palestinians but the two leaders disagreed on the 
composition of the arab delegation 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and mubarak aired their 
disagreement publicly after meeting in cairo for more than three 
hours 
at a news conference rabin said israel advocated negotiations 
only with palestinians from the west bank and gaza strip occupied 
by israel since 1967 at a separate news conference mubarak 
insisted that palestinians from outside the territories be included 
as well 
but both leaders voiced cautious optimism about the current 
israeliegyptian exchanges on a scenario for overall settlement of 
the palestinian problem which has kept the middle east in turmoil 
for four decades 
they said their two countries will have further highlevel talks 
rabin a senior member of israels centerleft labor party flew 
in for a sevenhour stay and was driven directly to mubaraks 
office the two met alone for 2 hours then called in aides 
both said they expected israel to present its final position next 
month on mubaraks twopronged peace proposal 
one segment of mubaraks plan calls for a preliminary 
israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo to discuss a palestinian 
election plan advanced by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
according to shamirs plan palestinians in the west bank and 
gaza would vote to choose delegates to negotiate with israel on 
interim autonomy 
mubarak also has presented a 10point memorandum which basically 
attaches conditions to shamirs plan that would make it acceptable 
to the palestinians 
points of that document include israels acceptance of the 
principle of trading land for peace and giving the vote to 
palestinians in israeliannexed east jerusalem 
those points have split israels coalition government both ideas 
are anathema to shamirs rightwing likud bloc but are accepted by 
the labor party headed by finance minister shimon peres who says 
they are a way to get the peace process moving 
israel radio quoted shamir on as saying monday that if labor 
sticks to its support of mubaraks initiative it will lead to a 
break in the government 
rabins visit was sanctioned by israels cabinet and mubarak 
emphasized he believed that rabin was acting as a representative of 
his government not merely a labor politician 
rabin said upon returning to israel however that since the 
cabinet had not formed an official response to egypts plan he 
could offer mubarak only his own understanding of the israeli 
position 
because there is no government decision i could only clarify 
to him the governments peace plan where i see accepted things 
and where we still disagree rabin told a news conference at ben 
gurion airport 
israeli newspapers quoted shamir as saying any deviation by rabin 
from the israeli peace plan would be only an expression of 
personal opinion 
one issue not mentioned by the leaders was the role of the 
palestine liberation organization the plo has rejected israels 
plan mainly because it does not refer to the formation of an 
independent palestinian state israel officially refuses to talk to 
the plo which it views as a terror group 
the plo also objects to the demand by likud that the arab 
uprising in the occupied lands which began in dec 1987 end before 
any talks begin 
summing up his talks with mubarak rabin said he told the 
president that israel 
appreciated mubaraks desire to convene a meeting between 
israelis and palestinians 
agreed that the invitations to such a meeting would be made by 
egypt 
agreed that the palestinian side to the talks would be announced 
by egypt 
but rabin spoke of certain problems that we have to discuss 
among ourselves in israel like the composition of a palestinian 
delegation 
he said twice that israel wanted palestinians from the west bank 
and gaza clearly implying it opposed palestinians from outside 
mubarak dissented 
my opinion is we should not neglect those who are outside 
the president said 
he said he planned to hold separate talks in the united states 
with peres and foreign minister moshe arens a leader in likud 
mubarak will be in the united states in late september and early 
october for talks with president bush and to address the un 
general assembly 
the president termed his talks with rabin very fruitful and 
very logical 
mubarak reiterated his longstanding refusal to meet with shamir 
until enough progress is made and something big can emerge from 
a summit such as final agreement on the israelipalestinian 
dialogue 
after the talks rabin drove to the tomb of president anwar 
sadat whose historic 1977 journey to jerusalem began the process 
that led two years later to egypts peace treaty with israel the 
only one between an arab country and the jewish state

the chairman of a house subcommittee defended 
the navys new 12 billion destroyer monday calling another 
lawmakers claims that the ship is a procurement nightmare a 
disservice to the navy and all involved 
rep charles e bennett chairman of the house armed services 
subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials said 
that onsite inspections by the panel testimony and briefings show 
that work on the ddg51 destroyer is going as well as any in 
recent history 
the design concept is sound drawings have been produced in a 
timely manner and the ship will be delivered to the navy in a 
reasonable amount of time the florida democrat said 
the ship named the arleigh burke for the world war ii naval hero 
and former chief of naval operations was launched saturday in bath 
maine 
bennetts comments about the guidedmissile destroyer came in a 
twopage letter to rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations 
dingell in a letter last week to navy secretary h lawrence 
garrett iii charged that construction of the destroyer has been 
marked by cost overruns and schedule delays he said a preliminary 
report by the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress showed that the destroyer is 18 months behind schedule and 
only 38 percent complete 
the acquisition of the ddg51 has turned into a procurement 
nightmare dingell said 
bennett in his letter told dingell that while it is a truism 
that there is always room for improvement to state that the 
construction on ddg51 is a procurement nightmare does a 
significant disservice to this committee the navy and its personnel 
and contractors 
bennett said cost overruns and change orders are common in the 
production of any new major ship and in fact shipbuilding 
contracts expect increases in cost and change orders because of the 
long construction time and uncertainties about the design

nelson mandela the african national congress 
leader could be freed within weeks a south african cabinet 
minister said in a british radio interview on monday 
but desmond tutu the anglican archbishop of cape town and a 
leading antiapartheid campaigner said it would be disastrous 
to release mandela without lifting state of emergency regulations 
that restrict black political activity in south africa 
the south african minister for constitutional development gerrit 
viljoen said the release of mandela and other people who have 
been convicted of security offenses is a matter very high on the 
agenda of the government 
asked if mandelas release could be within weeks viljoen said 
i think it could 
speculation that mandela soon will be freed grew after the 
reelection victory this month of the whitesonly national party 
under a new leader fw de klerk who has promised reforms under 
apartheid the countrys black majority does not have the vote 
mandela 71 was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 after his 
conviction of plotting sabotage 
viljoen interviewed from south africa by british broadcasting 
corps radio said of mandelas release the fewer conditions 
that are involved the better 
he did not repeat the key condition laid down by the previous 
south african president pw botha that mandela first renounce 
violence but viljoen added mr mandela has expressed himself in 
terms which clearly indicate his preference for a peacefully 
negotiated solution 
tutu also speaking in a telephone interview said de klerks 
government first would need to show good faith by lifting the state 
of emergency and legalizing banned black movements 
it is no use releasing mr mandela and other political 
prisoners into a state of emergency situation said tutu it 
would actually be quite quite disastrous 
he added that if mandela were released he would have to be 
completely free and not for example restricted to soweto the 
black township outside johannesburg 
he added that the state of emergency that includes bans on mass 
rallies has proved totally ineffective it has not done what 
the government hoped it would do which is knock the stuffing out of 
black opposition

nbc in what may not prove a surprise asserted 
monday that college students like television 
the network also said college students are undercounted in the 
nielsen ratings and would have a substantial impact in the nielsens 
were they included in national audience estimates 
nbcs conclusions were based on a telephone survey last spring of 
1014 students ages 1824 at 50 fouryear colleges and universities 
nationwide 
among other things the study found that 96 percent of the 
students it polled watch tv they watch it 18 hours a day compared 
to the national viewing average of nearly seven hours more males 
watch latenight tv than females and the opposite is true for 
daytime soap operas 
nbcs study was the latest in recent network efforts to study 
viewing audiences that traditionally havent been included in the 
national nielsen audience estimates 
the national nielsens only count viewers in homes not in college 
dorms hotel rooms and such places as sports bars 
during the november ratings sweeps period nielsen media 
research in a study commissioned by nbc abc and cables espn will 
conduct a survey of such uncounted viewers using diaries given to 
6000 people according to richard montesano an abc research vice 
president 
the studies come at a time when the networks losing audiences to 
cable videocassette recorders and independent stations are seeking 
ways to include hitherto uncounted tv viewers in national estimates 
or at least convince advertisers that these viewers should be 
considered in their television timebuying plans 
nbc whose spring survey focused only on college students 
estimated that there are about 13 million college students 85 
million in the 18to24 age range with spending power of 20 
billion annually 
the nbc study by survey design and analysis of ann arbor mich 
found that 83 percent of those it polled considered commercials a 
fair exchange for tv entertainment it also found that 60 percent of 
the males polled watch latenight tv entertainment as did 39 
percent of the women polled 
but 63 percent of the women students polled said they watched 
daytime tv compared with only 29 percent of the men 
as with the general public television was the main source of 
news for the students polled 43 percent said they got most of their 
news from television compared to 27 percent who said they got it 
from newspapers 
they tended to trust tv news more too when asked which medium 
they would believe in the case of conflicting stories about a news 
event 53 percent said television while 36 percent said newspapers 
in entertainment matters nbcs survey showed six nbc programs 
among the 10 television shows most favored by the college students 
polled with the cosby show at the top of the list and late 
night with david letterman fifth 
the letterman show was the only latenight program in the top 10 
list which also included three abc shows thirtysomething 
growing pains and wonder years cbs durable knots 
landing was at the bottom of the list

president bush urging a new greening of 
america proposed a national treeplanting campaign monday as a 
lowcost part of his national cleanair strategy 
he also said he would order special environmental training for 
peace corps representatives abroad to stop pollution before it 
starts and ensure that economic development and environmental 
stewardship go handinhand 
our peace corps volunteers are going to help spread the word in 
the developing world bush told an outdoor crowd in front of 
montanas copperdomed capitol at his second stop on a western trip 
honoring three states that are marking 100year anniversaries 
he said that beginning next year peace corps members would be 
trained by the environmental protection agency to deal with a full 
range of environmental challenges including waste disposal water 
pollution prevention pesticide management and reforestation 
earlier bush suggested at a similar ceremony in sioux falls 
sd that trees be planted alongside the nations interstate 
highway system as part of a national volunteer treeplanting program 
referring to trees as the oldest cheapest and mostefficient 
air purifier on earth bush declared we need to reforest this 
bountiful earth 
bush planted trees at ceremonies in helena and in sioux falls 
and also was to participate in a similar centennial observation in 
spokane wash on tuesday 
in a separate address to a regional conference of state 
legislators in helena bush said the nations teaching and 
learning environment also needs protection 
speaking of the twoday education summit he is convening next 
week in charlottesville va bush said the plain truth is that 
our educational system is not making the grade 
he told state lawmakers from wyoming nebraska north dakota and 
south dakota that you appropriate the money you make programs 
possible and you often are experts on education 
bush also put in a pitch for his crime and antidrug programs 
saying we need the states to toughen their laws mandatory time 
for weapons offenders no pleabargaining on guns the death penalty 
for heinous drug crimes and more police prosecutors and prisons 
earlier he told a sioux falls audience of several thousand 
gathered in the municipal arena you in south dakota know what it 
takes to plant a tree it doesnt take a federal program it doesnt 
take a new bureaucracy and it sure doesnt take some fancy new 
study what it takes is a shovel 
nature has powerful rejuvenative forces but we need to help 
them along he added 
the bush administration was expected to make reforestation a 
major element of its environmental policy matching an international 
movement to preserve the worlds rain forests 
by converting carbon dioxide to oxygen trees can help clean the 
air as well as counter the socalled greenhouse effect in which 
an overabundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere speeds global 
warming 
bush noted that his first effort at planting a tree in a 
centennial state had been jinxed an elm tree he planted in 
neighboring north dakota last april 
the elm transplanted from the white house lawn turned out to be 
infected with several tiny larvae of the gypsy moth a leafeating 
insect that has devastated elms in many eastern and some western 
states 
so far im having about as much luck planting as i did 
fishing bush quipped 
the larvae were removed from the north dakota tree a descendant 
of one planted by president john quincy adams and the tree was 
sprayed with insecticide 
in the middle of this century we built the interstate highway 
system the greatest ground transportation network since rome 
bush said now lets make these corridors beautiful quieter 
greener and cleaner 
its not enough to stop dirtying the air weve got to clean it 
up bush told his audience 
of course reforestation is only one part of our comprehensive 
and sometimes highly technical proposals to clean up americas air 
but trees possess a value no hightech solution will ever match 
 
trees can reduce the heat of a summers day quiet a highways 
noise feed the hungry provide shelter from the wind and warmth in 
the winter 
in comments that seemed to come full circle from ronald reagans 
1980 observation that trees are a major cause of air pollution bush 
told his audience every tree is a compact between generations 
reagan was roundly criticized during the 1980 presidential 
campaign when he said that most atmospheric contamination comes from 
natural rather than manmade processes and that trees are 
responsible for 93 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere 
environmentalists said reagan was confused about nitrous oxide 
which comes from decaying plant matter and is not harmful and 
nitrogen oxide which is emitted by coal plants and is a pollutant 
bush noted that the federal government had planted 340000 acres 
of new trees last year but he said this was a relatively small 
amount and the real solution is at the grassroots level

wrangling between israels coalition partners 
grew hotter monday over egypts peace plan leaders of both the 
rightwing likud bloc and leftleaning labor party said the rift 
could turn into a government crisis 
the infighting came as defense minister yitzhak rabin met in 
cairo with president hosni mubarak on the egyptian leaders call for 
israel to accept the usbacked formula of trading occupied land 
for peace 
rabins labor party has accepted mubaraks plan in principle and 
is pressing the government to agree to his offer to arrange an 
israelipalestinian meeting in cairo likud cabinet ministers have 
rejected the 10point egyptian plan 
prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of likud said on israel 
radio that in a government of the two divergent parties there is 
always the danger of strong differences of opinion which turn into a 
crisis 
i personally would like to see the coalition remain but i must 
say that unity cannot be equal to any price 
on israel television industry minister ariel sharon defended 
likuds stand of never giving up land even in exchange for peace 
the question is not always what are the jews prepared to give 
but should also be what are the arabs prepared to give in exchange 
for peace he said 
rabin noted the differences between the two sides upon return 
from cairo but said he hoped they could reach a compromise on 
mubaraks proposals 
i hope very much that the majority of the government members 
can make a decision on this and that the unity of the coalition 
government can be preserved he told reporters at bengurion 
airport 
israels own peace plan already has led to one crisis in the 
cabinet formed last december in july shamirs party sought to 
toughen the plan and labor threatened to pull out of the government 
labor withdrew its threat when shamir said he would not accept 
demands from likud hardliners to include the partys tough stand in 
the formal plan 
the government peace initiative approved in may calls for 
palestinian elections leading to negotiations between israel and 
representatives of the west bank and gaza strip on limited autonomy 
in the occupied territories 
after palestinians rejected the plan mubarak called for 
supplementing it basing the negotiations on the landforpeace 
principle and letting the 140000 arabs in israeliannexed east 
jerusalem vote in the palestinian elections 
likud ministers issued a statement sunday saying the government 
must not accept any additions or changes to the government peace 
plan 
in contrast labor leaders have said the egyptian plan could help 
bridge the gap between israelis and palestinians 
the subject is how to advance the peace process and not how to 
bring about the collapse of the government labor leader and 
finance minister shimon peres said on israel radio 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war

researchers using the first approved transfer 
of a foreign gene into humans said monday that altered 
cancerfighting cells have shrunk tumors in one patient and that 
cells from a single injection continue to work for at least 19 days 
dr steven a rosenberg a national cancer institute researcher 
said that five patients all terminally ill with a cancer called 
maglignant melanoma have been treated with genemodified cells but 
he could report on only one patient a 26yearold woman 
that patient he said suffers from melanoma that had formed 
tumors throughout her body including the lungs the skin and the 
soft palate of the mouth 
in july she received an infusion of a type of cancerfighting 
cell called genemodified tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes rosenberg 
said later tests showed that the tumor in her mouth had 
regressed or shrunk by about 90 percent 
the lymphocytes used in the study are natural cancerfighting 
cells that had been cultured from cells withdrawn from the womans 
tumors rosenberg and his colleagues have developed a technique 
wherein tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes or til cells are cultured 
in the laboratory in interleukin2 a protein that promotes 
lymphocyte growth when the cells multiply to 200 billion they are 
then reinjected into the patients blood stream as an army of cancer 
fighters 
rosenberg reported last year that this technique resulted in a 50 
percent tumor reduction in at least 60 percent of the treated 
patients 
cells used in the latest study were further manipulated so that 
the researchers could trace the movement of the til cells in the 
patients bodies to mark the tils the researchers inserted into 
the cells a neomycinresistant gene the gene manipulated through 
the use of a mouse leukemia retrovirus a virus that can move genes 
from one type of cell to another is the first foreign or 
nonhuman gene to be approved for use in patient therapy 
rosenberg said that in the female patient the researchers were 
able to recover some of the marked cells from several sites proving 
that the cancerfighting cells did migrate to the tumors he said 
the study also showed that the cells lived for at least 19 days and 
that followup studies may show that the cells live even longer 
additionally rosenberg said that there have been no side 
effects to the introduced cells in any patient 
he called the results extremely preliminary 
all five patients who have received the genemodified 
cancerfighting cells are still alive he said the therapy will be 
attempted soon on another five patients 
eventually rosenberg said the genemanipulation technique may 
be used to introduce into the cancerfighting cell a gene for 
another type of lymphocyte thus making the til cell an even 
stronger cancerfighter 
rosenberg made the comments at a news conference that followed a 
report to a meeting monday of the national cancer advisory board a 
group appointed by the president to monitor federal cancer research

the bush administration has reacted timidly to 
the rush of change in eastern europe and should shift gears and 
actively support the forces of democratic change in the communist 
empire senate majority leader george mitchell said monday 
the maine democrat called on president bush to support the entry 
of communist nations into western economic institutions once 
their internal reforms merit such participation 
the president should clearly state that he will let these 
countries into the economic game if they will play by the rules 
mitchell told the senate 
he cited reform movements under way in poland and hungary and 
said they are clear signs of the failure of communism as a viable 
economic and political ideology 
now is the time for the united states to encourage and 
capitalize upon the changes we have sought for so long mitchell 
said 
the administrations timidity in the face of these 
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying he said instead of 
encouragement and engagement the administration has adopted an 
almost passive stance 
president bush must reach beyond the status quo thinking that 
appears to dominate administration thinking mitchell said he 
must cast aside ambivalence and hesitation and timidity and adopt a 
more energetic and engaged policy toward the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
the bush administration mitchell said seems almost nostalgic 
about the cold war and the rigid superpower relationships that 
divided the world into two hostile and isolated camps for 40 years 
the possibility of our relations with the soviet union becoming 
more complex and cooperative should be welcomed not feared he 
said 
the new situation will create new hazards and uncertainties he 
said 
but there is no question in my mind that the greatest risk is 
the failure of continued progress toward democratization and a 
reversion to the cold war policies of the past 
the united states should not be afraid of its own success 
mitchell said the administration should actively try to shape the 
final outcome of the process of change we have demanded for so many 
years 
while the president has called for a policy of beyond 
containment he has failed to explain or adopt it he said 
there is a pressing need for the president to articulate his 
vision of where he hopes this transformation will lead and devise an 
american strategy to help achieve that result mitchell said

when shoppers say charge it a state 
lawmaker wants them to say i love new york at the same time 
an i love new york credit card could raise money for the 
state boost state pride and promote tourism says assemblyman robin 
schimminger who is promoting the idea 
the card would work in the same way any major credit card 
operates and would have competitive interest rates but the cards 
would be embossed with different tourist attractions said 
schimminger 
for example a card issued in niagara falls would have a picture 
of the famous cascade and a card issued in new york city would have 
the empire state building schimminger said 
this is a way to raise millions of dollars in revenue without 
hiking taxes he said monday it also helps promote community 
spirit and give consumers an opportunity to play a part in tourism 
and cultural development 
schimminger said montana is promoting such a card and expects to 
raise more than 12 million in revenues he said new york state 
could raise much more because its population is 20 times greater 
under the proposal the state department of economic development 
would establish a stateaffiliated credit card and contract with 
banks to distribute the card 
the state would get a percentage of an annual card fee and a 
small percentage of the value of goods and services charged while 
participating banks would retain a share and get the extra business 
the cards generate schimminger said

the head of the federal agency that studies the 
air and oceans said monday that climatic change is likely over the 
next century and that there are no quick or easy answers to the 
problem 
we can recycle we can conserve we can change our lifestyle 
but i believe it is unrealistic to expect that population and 
energy use can continue to grow without adding humaninduced 
climatic change to the normal variability of nature said john 
knauss head of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
knauss spoke at a conference on earth observation and global 
change held to discuss research efforts into the causes of the 
problem and to seek solutions 
do not expect easy answers and do not expect quick results i 
expect in the next hundred years and more we will go through a 
significant human induced climate change said knauss 
climatic change particularly the socalled greenhouse warming 
effect have attracted considerable attention in recent years 
many scientists believe that carbon dioxide added to the 
atmosphere by industry and other human activities could trap heat 
from the sun and induce a catastrophic global overheating in the 
next century 
carbon dioxide a colorless odorless gas has increased by 25 
percent over the last 100 years a change blamed on industrial 
processes that produce the chemical and on the destruction of 
forests which remove carbon dioxide from the air 
other scientists urge more study however wondering if increased 
cloudiness or other natural factors might prevent much of the feared 
warming 
both sides seem to agree that it is too soon to measure any 
actual greenhouseinduced warming because changes in yeartoyear 
weather normally vary so widely 
leonard fisk of the national aeronautics and space administration 
told the conference that his agency is launching a major mission 
to planet earth to help answer some of the questions about global 
change 
william f harris of the national science foundation added that 
the organization also is promoting such research and noted that the 
federal committee on earth science recently announced a coordinated 
global change research effort by a dozen federal agencies 
but knauss admonished listeners not to look for too much too fast 
he said that what concerns him even more than the threat of 
change is that many problems such as the hole in the protective 
ozone layer found over antarctica have come as surprises 
greenhouse warming was first predicted three decades ago he 
noted but scientists were surprised by the ozone hole by recent 
reports of increased methane in the air and by a rise in lowlevel 
ozone in rural areas 
my concern in this context is not so much on what their effect 
is on global change or the environment which is real but that we 
did not predict them it is not much of an exaggeration to say we 
almost stumbled over them said knauss 
i continue to ask myself what is it that were not measuring 
that we should be measuring he added

isthmus 460 miles southeast of mexico city 
francisco celemente a red cross spokesman in tehuantepec said 
by telephone that the quake was mild and apparently caused no 
problems in the area 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

most governors are not expecting a commitment 
from president bush to shell out more federal dollars for the 
nations schools two leaders of the national governors association 
said monday 
nga president terry e branstad of iowa and new mexico gov 
garrey e carruthers chairman of the education commission of the 
states said most of the 50 governors attending the education summit 
next week in charlottesville va will seek mainly to loosen the 
stranglehold of federal rules and regulations branstad and 
carruthers are republicans 
admitting that money is a sensitive issue that few can agree on 
branstad said i think there is a feeling that there is 
considerable amount of money being spent on education we want to 
spend it as wisely as possible 
we want to make sure that when the federal government does 
provide money to states and local school districts it provides 
enough flexibility to meet the needs of those local students in the 
schools he said 
branstad said bush already has indicated a willingness to do 
some more in helping atrisk kids and programs like the head start 
programs 
the main focus of this will not be on additional dollars but 
there will be discussions about it branstad said of the summit 
there are some governors who do feel strongly about it and other 
governors feel that is not a major area 
im not coming to the summit to ask the president of the united 
states for more federal dollars carruthers said i think thats 
wrong i think theres a lot of things that can be done without 
asking him for those federal dollars 
im certainly not asking the president to reduce those federal 
dollars by any means either added carruthers but there are 
things that can be done with deregulation that can free up money 
that can be more properly utilized in the states 
for example carruthers suggested that medicaid the government 
health care program for the poor become the principle 
responsibility of the federal government and education continue to 
be the principle responsibility of the state government 
according to branstad our hope is that the summit will help us 
focus attention of this nation on the critical issues of education 
and will help us draw the support of the american people for some of 
the most important and pressing challenges that we face 
the key to the future will be goals that we establish in this 
coming year he added

here is a transcript of president bushs 
monday news conference in helena mont 
president bush well i have a brief statement and then ill be 
glad to respond to some questions 
i have decided and secretary mosbacher has announced in hungary 
that hungary will be granted permanent most favored nation mfn 
status in october and will be granted the benefits of a generalized 
system of preferences 
hungarys undertaken major steps toward political and economic 
reform and during our recent visit we witnessed significant 
changes toward freedom in that country 
the dedication and diligence of the hungarian people is quickly 
transforming the economic system into a more productive and 
competitive posture 
gsp eligibility will open new doors for the hungarian economy 
encouraging greater market orientation and increasing the foreign 
exchange earnings our commitment to helping the reform movement in 
eastern europe is strong our step today underscores our willingness 
to help these countries 
obviously its up to them to make the structural adjustments 
but they should be aware that the united states is ready and willing 
to assist in this progress 
let me just say a word on economic growth at home there is an 
issue before the congress which i feel is just the kind of thing 
that will help states like montana bolster their economic 
productivity and employment a reduction in our capital gains tax 
rate is right for montana and it is good for america and i am 
pleased that there has been a bipartisan effort in the congress to 
bring this issue to the house floor im hopeful that the congress 
will continue in this bipartisan spirit 
and now ill be glad to respond to some questions 
q mr president 
president bush oh excuse me here weve got a friend even 
though were out of town 
q when you meet on thursday with mr shevardnadze of the soviet 
union theres a lot of speculation that he will bring with him a 
major new strategic arms proposal from the soviet union are 
conditions ripe now to move ahead on a strategic arms agreement or 
is there a chance that further delays may make it impossible to 
reach such an agreement in your term 
president bush i dont i would not take that pessimistic an 
assessment that further delay will make it impossible to make 
reach an agreement in the next 3 years i dont know tom what he 
is going to bring with him ive read speculation that there might 
be a new arms control proposal but i cant confirm that for you 
we do want to move forward on start as you know we came in did 
a review completed a review and we will were working inside our 
own administration to have proposals that i think will capture the 
imagination of the soviet union but i dont know what hes going to 
bring we havent had that confirmed 
q followup may i have a followup 
president bush yeah 
q mr president is it time now to talk about a summit with mr 
gorbachev 
president bush no its time to talk about a constructive 
productive meeting of the foreign ministers out in wyoming and 
well have to see what message mr shevardnadze brings with him but 
i feel under any under no rush on that subject 
i think our handling of the soviet account is pretty good i feel 
weve got experts in whom i have great confidence that are handling 
these matters the secretary of state general scowcroft bob gates 
with us here today dick cheney the chairman of the joint chiefs 
and so i think the key point is does the soviet union understand 
that we want to see their perestroika succeed and see them move 
forward with more liberties and i think they do understand that 
and so i dont think theres any chance of a disconnect there

zsa zsa gabor kept her lip buttoned 
monday regarding her trial on a charge of slapping a policeman 
taking to heart a judges warning that further comments about the 
case could land her in trouble 
im under gagging order miss gabor told reporters at beverly 
hills municipal court where her trial began its second week 
she is charged with four misdemeanor charges battery on a police 
officer disobeying an officers orders driving with an expired 
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car if 
convicted she faces a possible 18 months in jail 
last week miss gabor got in her best zingers when she arrived at 
court but monday morning she glided out of her chevrolet station 
wagon and said no comment more than seven times when questioned 
by a dozen reporters and television camera crews 
she even said no comment when asked about her ensemble white 
slacks and a navy blue blazer 
last week miss gabor said she was afraid of going to jail 
because of lesbians there she also made unflattering remarks about 
the prosecutor saying he has a napoleon complex and 
confronted a tv reporter the actress deemed a jealous bitch 
she also called the policeman she is accused of striking a liar 
when miss gabor did talk to reporters monday she limited her 
comments to small talk my mother is very upset and sister eva 
could kill me regarding the publicity accompanying the trial she 
said 
gone from the courthouse were zsa zsa lookalikes and throngs of 
sympathetic fans in their place was a man wearing a hang zsa 
zsa tshirt and a woman who gave a longwinded story to the 
actress about needing 480 to pay a speeding ticket in texas 
miss gabor gave her a 20 travelers check and the woman 
complained it wasnt enough 
motorcycle policeman paul kramer said the alleged june 14 assault 
was unprovoked miss gabor a foot shorter and 100 pounds lighter 
than kramer said she struck in self defense 
kramer pulled over miss gabors rollsroyce for having expired 
registration tags as he checked for other violations miss gabor 
allegedly drove off was stopped again and ultimately slapped 
kramers face 
kramer who conceded at one point that he wore a free zsa zsa 
tshirt at his recent 38th birthday party testified that miss gabor 
cursed spit and slapped him 
deputy district attorney elden fox called four witnesses to the 
stand during the morning monday with only one of them saying she 
actually saw the slap 
maureen cassidy said she was looking in her rearview mirror when 
she saw kramer being struck 
defense attorney william graysen informed municipal judge charles 
g rubin that miss gabors house was broken into over the weekend 
he attributed the incident to publication of her address in a 
newspaper story 
its just unfortunate it occurred the judge said saying 
there was little he could do

banks are asking the us government and others 
for more help in reducing the debt burden that led to the transfer 
last year of more than 50 billion from the third world to creditor 
countries 
if sufficient collateral is not made available large numbers 
of banks may turn away from the transaction said horst schulmann 
managing director of the institute of international finance which 
includes major international banks 
schulmann was talking about the first part of a debt reduction 
plan proposed by treasury secretary nicholas f brady that gives 
commercial banks a choice on dealing with about half of mexicos 
108 billion debt the banks may either reduce the debt reduce the 
interest payments or lend new money to pay interest at old rates 
choices by hundreds of banks have yet to be made the collateral 
that some of them want could be in the form of us government 
bonds which mexico would put up as security for loans at lower 
rates of interest than it now pays money to buy those bonds can be 
lent to debtor countries by the world bank and international 
monetary fund if the united states agrees to make them available 
schulmanns warning was in a letter he sent sept 12 to leaders 
of the twin organizations which he made public monday officials 
and bankers from the member countries are gathering for their annual 
meetings which will begin at the end of this week and end the week 
after 
third world debt and the progress of bradys plan are expected to 
be among the major topics brady will be the chief us 
representative at the meetings 
on sunday the world bank published its annual report including 
a table that showed how transfers including payments for goods 
from third world countries to creditors grew to 501 billion last 
year from 102 billion in 1984 before that the flow had been in 
the opposite direction with money going from the creditor countries 
to the third world 
j fred bergsten a former assistant secretary of the treasury 
has suggested that the outflow should be the direct target of attack 
by the worlds financial experts it is the outflow of funds from 
third world countries largely payments to banks that keeps them 
from spending more on goods from the united states and other 
countries to create jobs and raise living standards in their own 
in 1988 they paid 754 billion on their foreign debts and 67 
billion of interest the world bank reported another source of 
outflow is the billions uncounted because often illegal sent by 
their citizens for safekeeping to the united states and other 
havens one recent estimate put this flight of capital at 12 
billion a year from brazil alone 
the treasury department calculated that 39 countries could be 
eligible for debt reductions but schulmann told reporters on monday 
he did not see so many 
the list would be rather short he said

the federal communications commission on monday 
reaffirmed its 600000 fine against a california company after 
finding that the firm did nothing to prevent children from hearing 
its obscene phone messages 
the commission saying that intercambio of san jose calif had 
not provided any persuasive reason why it should not be fined 
ordered the company to pay the penalty within 30 days or face 
criminal prosecution 
the commission in reaffirming a july 6 1988 notice of apparent 
liability said intercambio had raised no new material questions of 
fact to support its contention that it had not violated fcc 
regulations and that the fine was both unjustified and 
unlawful 
the fcc said the law allows for fines of 50000 a day for each 
of 70 days violations 
the fcc on dec 7 1987 first notified intercambio that it was 
contemplating action following a complaint from a mother who said 
her 16yearold son was hearing pornographic messages from 
intercambio the woman said the boy was seeing a psychiatrist after 
placing more than 280 calls to various dialaporn providers during 
a 2month period 
intercambio told the fcc that its service was intended to be 
available only within california that it had attempted to restrict 
access to adults and that the law regarding pornographic phone 
messages and fcc rules on the subject were unconstitutional 
but the firm refused to provide any evidence to back up its 
claims said fcc commissioner patricia diaz dennis 
the commission said it had conducted a fourmonth investigation 
and found intercambio was placing no restrictions to prevent minors 
from dialing in nor did it find any restrictions in place to 
prevent interstate calls the fcc said interstate dialaporn calls 
to minors are banned under federal law 
as a result of its investigation the staff found the evidence 
conclusive that intercambios messages were obscene and that it had 
in fact operated and was continuing to operate in violation of the 
law the commission said 
there was no phone number listed for intercambio in san jose and 
attempts to locate a number for intercambios president dan 
glassoff were unsuccessful monday 
congress last year in an attempt to wipe out the dialaporn 
industry outlawed the sale of indecent phone messages but the 
supreme court in june said that only obscene material patently 
offensive sexual and without redeeming value may be banned 
congress acted because of complaints from outraged parents who 
incurred heavy phone bills from children dialing 976 numbers to 
listen to sexually oriented material 
but the supreme court said that recent technological advances 
such as call blocking by phone companies assured that children could 
be kept from reaching dialaporn services and that the government 
had no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults 
another california company that also had faced a 600000 fine 
for allegedly providing obscene phone messages agreed last november 
to stop selling sexual phone messages and paid a smaller amount to 
the government without admitting liability 
mary beth hess chief of the fccs enforcement division said 
monday that audio enterprises of mill valley calif paid the 
government 50000 and is out of the phone sex business 
a third company 2001 enterprises of reseda calif agreed to 
stop its sexually oriented message business and paid the government 
25000 hess said

a judge fined the united mine workers union 
135 million monday for illegal strike activities in its lengthy 
contract dispute with pittston coal group 
but elsewhere in russell county umw members continued to occupy 
the control room of pittstons main coal preparation plant where 
they locked themselves in with padlocks and steel cables 
union leaders said the takeover that began sunday would remain 
peaceful and promised that no damage would be done to the plant 
where coal is sorted cleaned and shipped they said the 
demonstration was designed to persuade pittston co chairman paul 
douglas to come to the bargaining table and as a statement against 
unfair labor laws 
the plant was shut down monday but pittston spokeswoman susan 
copeland said mines operated by replacement workers continued to 
operate 
pittstons 1695 umw employees from virginia west virginia and 
kentucky are involved in the strike that began april 5 but the 
strike has become a symbolic dispute for organized labor across the 
country because the workers believe pittston is attempting to break 
the union 
the pittston strike prompted wildcat walkouts by miners elsewhere 
in june and july 
in richmond union members pitched an awning on grounds of the 
state capitol and began a weeklong demonstration against what they 
called injustices in the coalfields 
the fines imposed monday by russell county circuit judge donald 
mcglothlin bring the total to roughly 22 million the fines imposed 
by state and federal judges for illegal demonstrations against 
pittston and for acts of violence against company property and 
employees 
the fines have been appealed 
an industry observer who spoke on condition he not be identified 
because he arbitrates labor disputes said monday that the umw 
strike fund can easily cover the 22 million in fines if appeals 
fail also companies often forego damages after a contract 
settlement is reached 
i wouldnt call it a drop in the bucket but i wouldnt call it 
a mortal blow either he said if allowed to stand it could 
have a crippling effect on the unions use of civil disobedience 
the charges of violence during the past two months range from 
shooting at moving coal trucks to peppering employee vehicles with 
rocks charges of nonviolent activities included sitdown 
demonstrations and rolling roadblocks designed to slow coal truck 
traffic 
umw attorneys argued last week that union leaders have 
continually preached nonviolence to members and that the union 
should not be punished for acts by individuals 
mcglothlin said testimony proved beyond a reasonable doubt that 
union leaders had encouraged the illegal activities 
one provision in mcglothlins injunction prohibits union members 
and supporters from impeding pittstons operations 
however neither the judge nor pittston took action by 
midafternoon to remove the demonstrators occupying the preparation 
plant 
state police will take no action until either the company issues 
a trespassing complaint or a judge requests enforcement of his 
injunction said spokesman charlie vaughan

q mr president 
president bush yeah norm 
q why hasnt there been more progress on start by the time that 
shevardnadze arrives on thursday youll have or be close to 
having a couple of modest agreements one on chemical arms 
inspection one on nuclear testing youre moving ahead with an 
innovative plan on conventional weapons but theres a perception 
here that the administration just has not been willing or had the 
desire to move forward as fast and with concrete action on start as 
it has elsewhere 
president bush that may that perception may have come about 
because we did put the earliest effort into conventional forces 
i happen to think that thats the place the earliest efforts 
should have gone into getting some conventional force stability 
and therefore we did move forward more quickly on that but i dont 
think its right to read into that effort incidentally a proposal 
that captured the imagination not just of the west but of many in 
the east as well to indicate from that were not interested in 
going forward on start 
or let me throw in chemical weapons you know most of you here 
have heard me speak about the importance of trying to do something 
in the chemical weapons area so the fact that weve tabled one 
imaginative and id say farreaching proposal should not mean that 
were not interested or unwilling to go forward with start 
but that may be how if there is such a perception how it came 
about 
q is it that those start issues or the last four remaining big 
issues on start are too difficult are the differences between the 
us and the soviets too deep are the problems with the current 
administration too great 
president bush i dont think any of that i mean maybe some of 
the above but not all i mean these are not easy problems 
verification issues arent easy i would simply say that i dont see 
any insurmountable stumbling blocks there though 
ellen 
q mr president closer to home in the past few months there 
have been a number of racial incidents in this country blacks 
attacking whites whites attacking blacks sir what does this say 
about the state of racial relations in our country 
president bush well it says something ugly whenever theres an 
incident of that nature i hope theres no trend toward more and 
more divisiveness along racial lines and i will do my best to speak 
out against bigotry wherever it occurs racism wherever it occurs 
in what direction it goes and against violence of any kind 
q but to the crux of the matter sir is there anything that 
either yourself or the present government or even the state 
government can do to end what seems to be a new trend in interracial 
violence 
president bush i dont want to give you this i dont want to 
say to you its a new i dont want to accept that premise i 
dont feel that theres a new trend of racial hostility but when 
these these regrettable incidents occur i think that all of us 
should unite in speaking out against them but i dont think that 
theres a federal statute that is going to take care of an incident 
of that nature 
yeah 
q mr president the colombia media are saying that the drug 
cartels are arming themselves with rapidfire weapons manufactured 
in the united states and smuggled into their country given the fact 
that were asking colombian authorities to put themselves at risk in 
order to deal with this drug problem how can you justify refusing 
to ban the sale and manufacture of those weapons in the united 
states 
president bush well i think everybody here knows my position on 
guns and banning guns i do feel one thing we can do is cut down on 
the automatic clips that are used the amount of fire coming out of 
one of those guns weve made proposals and i think we ought to get 
in get along supporting the presidents proposals in the 
anticrime package and that will send a very strong signal to 
colombia 
yeah 
q can i follow up 
president bush you want to follow his question 
no hes goes here and then youre second however chuckles 
q mr president there have been reports that the colombian drug 
lords have targeted people in the united states and maybe even 
members of your own family i was wondering if you had any message 
for any drug traffickers in colombia who might be thinking along 
those lines 
president bush i think i take a rather dim view of it but there 
look i know theres speculation on this but there is no hard 
intelligence evidence of such targeting

opposition legislator boris n yeltsin shopped and 
drank until he dropped on his tour of the united states said a 
scathing article reprinted monday in te communist party newspaper 
pravda 
the communist party maverick leaves behind him a wake of 
catastrophic prophecies insane expenses interviews and above all 
the perfume of jack daniels black label the italian newspaper la 
repubblica said in an article translated into russian and printed in 
full by pravda 
yeltsin heatedly denied the report when he returned to moscow 
late monday evening 
in washington his sponsor blamed jet lag and a hectic schedule 
not overindulgence in alcohol for whatever problems yeltsin 
encountered on his visit the sponsor said pravda had political 
motivations for what it did 
pravda did not comment on the article but it gave its readers a 
taste of the page 5 piece in a frontpage box quoting the article as 
saying yeltsin found the united states a holiday a stage a bar 
5000 kilometers long 
its garbage yeltsin told the associated press flushing 
with anger 
its a simple lie slander and revenge for the fact that 
americans received us with admiration he said before slipping 
into a black volga car to be whisked into moscow 
the article is potentially very damaging to the silverhaired 
58yearold populist who has become a hero to many soviets by 
criticizing special privileges for party and government officials 
and urging that president mikhail s gorbachev speed up his reforms 
it raises the question of the character of a leading politician 
more clearly than has been done in decades it also cast yeltsin as 
enjoying the good life just as much as the moscow officials he 
criticizes while soviets line up for sugar meat and dozens of other 
everyday items 
but previous attacks on yeltsin have been regarded by his 
supporters as an effort by powerful kremlin figures to discredit 
him and yeltsin has turned that deeprooted suspicion of central 
authority to his advantage 
yeltsin returned one day ahead of a crucial communist party 
central committee meeting on ethnic unrest central committee 
meetings also are empowered to consider personnel questions and 
yeltsin could be asked during the closed meeting to explain his 
behavior or censured 
earlier this year party officials investigated yeltsin for 
allegedly speaking out in favor of a multiparty system 
la repubblica a leftleaning rome daily with one of italys 
largest circulations ran the article by vittorio zucconi on page 4 
of its sept 14 edition 
the story said yeltsin drank a bottleandahalf of jack daniels 
whisky by himself one night in baltimore where he was a guest of 
johns hopkins university 
when a distinguished professor emeritus came to pick yeltsin up 
at 6 am for a speech he was presented with a wet and alcoholic 
kiss and an invitation to finish off the halfempty bottle the 
story said 
lets drink to freedom yeltsin said and offered the 
professor the bathroom toothbrush glass filled with bourbon it 
added 
it reported that yeltsin had too much to drink and fell asleep 
with his head on a table during one reception 
the story said yeltsin bought new clothes shoes boxes of white 
shirts two vcrs and a selection of videotapes including the three 
rambo movies star wars and et 
yeltsins speaking fees were to be donated to soviet aids 
victims but zucconi quoted accountant alfred ross as saying if 
he keeps spending at this pace by the time he leaves well have 
nothing but debts 
yeltsins american host denied in washington on monday that 
yeltsin was intoxicated in public during his us trip 
if there was any problem with yeltsin it was jet lag said 
jim garrison executive director of the esalen institute 
sovietamerican exchange program of san francisco which sponsored 
the visit 
what pravda has done is for political motivations 
most of the time he was cold sober 
he certainly did not finish off a bottle and a half of jack 
daniels the entire delegation of five soviets drank a bottle 
garrison said that by the time yeltsin spoke in baltimore tuesday 
night the same day he visited the white house he had not slept 
for three nights 
garrison said he personally canceled a scheduled tv appearance by 
yeltsin to be taped the afternoon before the baltimore speech 
because yeltsin was jetlagged he was just dropping he said 
yeltsin had no alcohol that day 
we did 11 cities in nine days said garrison adding that the 
soviet politician will accept none of the proceeds we gave 
him 100 a day as a per diem so he had 900 of personal money that 
is all he had he said yeltsin also was given a personal computer 
during his tour yeltsin said gorbachev could face a revolution 
if he cannot improve living conditions soon he met with president 
bush and vice president quayle and paid an unexpected visit to 
former president reagan who was recuperating from surgery 
soviet officials and the state press have not commented on 
yeltsins us tour soviet officials have said the trip is 
yeltsins private business 
but the press has reprinted comments made by yeltsin that were 
reported in the western media and could be damaging to him 
yeltsin the former communist party chief of moscow was stripped 
of that job almost two years ago by gorbachev who criticized him as 
politically immature and overly ambitious 
but muscovites in march gave him 89 percent of the vote in an 
election for a citywide seat in the new congress of peoples 
deputies parliament 
a month and a half ago he was elected along with nobel peace 
prize winner andrei d sakharov and a handful of other reformers to 
the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the 
soviet parliament in 70 years

so let me just lay that one out there to rest but clearly any 
such action would i think just bring down the total wrath of the 
american people and the american government 
but as i tried to make clear at one of our last press 
conferences sometimes the courageous government in south america 
has difficulty controlling its own fortunes 
and one of the reasons i have objected to some of this 
farsweeping legislation on the hill about lets cut off all south 
american countries from which these drugs come into this country 
is that that would stand up against president barco for who is 
doing his level best to confine this and to control it in colombia 
q are you afraid for the security of your family sir 
president bush no im not im not afraid i have great 
confidence in the selflessness and in the thoroughness of the 
intelligence community and of the secret service 
yeah and then ill come back john 
q you said last friday that you would not extend to domestically 
made semiautomatic weapons the ban you placed on imported weapons 
are there any restrictions at all that you would accept if congress 
approved them on those weapons 
president bush well id be glad to talk to congress about it 
but basically i think the thing to do is go forward and approach the 
problem by passing our anticrime bill 
i used the analogy the other day of the person in the tower with 
an automatic i mean a quickfiring rifle and as a view that 
its going to be very very hard to legislate against aberrational 
behavior and i have long felt that the answer is to go after the 
criminal and not the in the process do violence to the rights of 
legitimate gun owners 
john 
q we are told that yasir arafat is preparing a visa request so 
he can come to the un general assembly to speak now that the us 
has opened a dialogue with the plo would you have any objection to 
arafat coming to new york 
president bush i will consider that matter when and if it comes 
to my attention im not youve heard something i havent heard 
that he is preparing a visa request but i will look at that what 
i mean is im not going to answer your question right now because i 
dont know the final answer but we would obviously it is a 
decision that would come to me but its not that far along 
yeah 
q mr president back on capital gains the tax rate cut the 
democrats on capitol hill seem plainly determined to make it a major 
party question how do you deal with that going into the floor 
debate in the house and how does that tie in to the grand strategy 
that we keep hearing about for a major budget compromise in the next 
year 
president bush well it ties into the fact that i ran for office 
in this state and in 49 other states on a platform that included 
very clearly a capital gains differential and i happen to feel that 
it is good for more creating more jobs i think it is good for 
risktaking i think it is something that should happen 
so well fight for it on the floor and hopefully get it passed 
and then approach the followon budget considerations but this 
concept that im hearing from some who are on the other side of the 
issue well if you insist on this then we wont talk to you 
about a b or c for the future i dont think thats right and i 
dont think the american people would support that 
there was a good clear fight in that committee and at this 
juncture at least after lots of amendments my side prevailed on a 
bipartisan way a lot of democrats supporting us 
and now we go to the floor and then whatever comes out of the 
floor we have to fit in obviously to the budgetary requirements for 
next year but i dont think it is right for people who get whipped 
on an issue in a committee to then start a lot of threats about on 
the other side saying well well never deal with the president 
it doesnt work that way you know why because the american 
people have a say and they had a say last year about this question 
and theyll have a say in the future and it is not as my critics 
contend a tax thatll simply help the rich a lot of countries 
dont have any tax on capital at all 
yeah john

the communist partys central committee 
decided on monday to poll party members to see if support exists for 
increasing democracy within the party and poland 
for the first time in memory western reporters were invited to 
watch party leaders convene the central committee meeting it was 
closed to the reporters later in the day 
the meeting also was the first committee plenum since the 
solidarityled government took over a week ago 
politburo member leszek miller told reporters after the 11hour 
meeting that the plenums second half will be held sept 30 when 
results of the poll are known 
in a speech opening the meeting miller urged greater solidarity 
among party members facing the first government in the east bloc not 
led by communists he said the communists must form a front of 
the social left 
miller said the poll will ask members four questions if they 
support direct election of delegates to the planned 11th communist 
party congress if candidates for party membership should be allowed 
to vote for delegates if competing platforms to develop the party 
program will be allowed and whether deep changes in the party are 
favored 
he said options for the partys future include if it should stay 
the same become a more leftist force or form a new socialist party 
he did not elaborate 
miller said the central committee will follow the recommendations 
of the majority the powerful central committee carries on the work 
of the party between congresses and forms the policymaking 
politburo 
party first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski who invited western 
journalists to the plenum said i would not say this is the 
beginning of a new style of work but we assume that our debate 
is not secret and cannot be secret because the party is functioning 
before the eyes of the whole society 
no exact date has been set for the party congress but the 
central committee plenum is to advise the congress on the structure 
and goals of the party the party controlled the government for four 
decades until solidaritys tadeusz mazowiecki was sworn in as prime 
minister 
central committee secretary slawomir wiatr rejected a suggestion 
that the party might split into reform and hardline wings 
according to the state news agency pap 
it quoted wiatr as saying emotions are high and postulates 
clashing but there will be no break up of the party 
since the independent trade union solidarity was first legalized 
in august 1980 communist party membership has fallen from 315 
million to just below 21 million the average age of a party member 
is 46 compared with 40 in 1980 according to a party report 
published last month 
solidarity was suspended in december 1981 and later outlawed it 
was legalized again this year and scored stunning victories in 
parliamentary elections in june 
fully democratic elections are scheduled in four years and the 
communist party has vowed to be ready 
more than 20 speakers adressed the central committee plenum and 
discussed ways to strengthen the partys authority and gain broad 
social support pap said 
the agency reported committee members expressed special concern 
about mazowieckis plans to create more private business 
restructure industry and turn toward a marketoriented economy

q mr president a few minutes ago you told the state 
legislators that washington does not know best on the subject of 
education at the summit education summit next week in charlotte 
though many of the governors not all democratic are going to say 
they want more from washington how are you going to reconcile those 
differences 
president bush many want more and sometimes justifiably so but 
i cant think of a governor thats going to come to me and say 
tell us how to do it mandate it mandated benefits from 
washington weve had enough of that and i am against that and i 
will make it clear i dont care how many of them come and say that 
but i dont think any will john i dont think they want 
control of course governors are going to want additional resources 
of one kind or another and maybe we can accommodate them or maybe 
we cant but i dont think they want that control of education 
what they call mandated benefits im absolutely certain they 
dont yes 
q mr president how much did it figure in your decision on 
hungary and trade their facilitating the travel to the west of east 
germans 
president bush well to be candid with you it was in the mix 
before that rather those dramatic happenings and i think their 
overall economic performance merits it 
but clearly when a country takes a courageous decision thats 
just of additional benefit to this relationship thats growing and 
that is very very important way in the back 
q mr president the recent access of east germans to west 
germany has got a lot of people thinking about eventual 
reunification of germany whether that would be a good idea or not 
do you think a reunified germany would be a stabilizing force for 
america or a destabilizing force 
president bush well i dont i would think its a matter for 
the germans to decide but put it this way if that was worked out 
between the germanys i do not think we should view that as bad for 
western interests 
i think theres been a dramatic change in postworld war ii 
germany and so i dont fear it but i and i noticed that the 
chancellor had something to say on this the other day i might need 
help from bob but nevertheless he this is something that should 
be for them to determine but i think there is in some quarters the 
feeling well a reunified germany would be detrimental to the 
peace of europe of western europe some way and i dont accept 
that at all i simply dont 
yeah frank 
q mr president throughout your speeches today youve talked a 
great deal about the stewardship of the environment yet you havent 
mentioned the alaska oil spill and you decided not to go you 
dropped plans to go to alaska as an extension of this trip 
shouldnt an environmental president have visited the site of this 
terrible oil spill 
president bush we had an environmental vice president that went 
and gave an accurate report and an environmental head of the epa 
that went and gave a good report and an environmentally conscious 
head of the coast guard that went and i would like to have gone up 
there and maybe ill get to go 
but i dont think the fact that you dont go somewhere shows of 
this nature with this at this time shows a lack of interest at 
all and i am hopeful that the winter will be kind to the 
environmental damage there and help follow on to what man has tried 
to do 
but please dont associate my not going to alaska at a rather 
busy time with a lack of interest in prince william sound 
q if i may follow up sir are you satisfied with exxons 
efforts do you believe that they will either themselves be back in 
the spring or that youll be sending them the bill for more work to 
be done 
president bush well we have to see but they will come back 
there im convinced of that if the matter is not further along 
theres no question and i think theyve said that but we will be 
looking to them 
yeah one two three 
q mr president its been 3 months since the massacre in 
tiananmen square and american businessmen including your brother 
are now back making deals with the chinese are you willing now to 
resume normal relations with the chinese government 
president bush we no no were not we have relations ive 
tried to protect and preserve a longtime relationship that is very 
important to us to the united states its in the national 
security interest in the geopolitical interest of the united states 
to have a relationship 
but no its not time for total normalcy and i would hope that 
we would see proper signals that would indicate to me that is you 
know in the future but i dont want to hurt the people by cutting 
off commerce from the west ive said that early on right at the 
beginning and i havent changed my mind on that one but there are 
still difficulties great difficulties there 
yes saul and then chuck

q yes does your action on hungary today indicate that you might 
be moving closer toward some similar action with the soviet union 
president bush well one of the matters that will be discussed 
in the wyoming meeting will be the whole economic front and 
perhaps that but i couldnt say that in our decisionmaking 
process at the white house and the state department that its been 
moved forward knowing of this decision on hungary 
q well i wonder why not since the soviet union approved 
hungarys action visavis east germany and at the same time they 
have released so many american so many jews 
president bush soviet jews 
q that we dont know what to do with them soviet jews we 
dont 
president bush well there are encouraging signs coming out of 
the soviet union 
q i wonder 
president bush and were going to continue to look at them 
closely continue to have contacts with the soviet union across a 
wide spectrum of levels and then make our recommendations on that 
but all of this helps saul in my view all of these things help 
q at what point will you be making some decisions rather than 
simply saying were looking at these things 
president bush well we just take our time and do what i think 
is handle the overall soviet relationship in a prudent way and we 
i think we are doing that and so its just i cant put a 
timeframe on it for you but i would concur that all of these things 
help 
charles and then craig 
q mr president id like to you back maureens question as we 
understand theres been some increased security for your family 
for other officials but are you concerned that this drug war is 
now going to enter the united states that there has been an 
escalation not merely a threat but a potential danger here 
president bush i dont think there has been in the hard 
intelligence sense an increase in the threat there are people who 
are concerned theyre concerned in obviously in south florida 
theyre concerned in other parts of the country as well 
but i would cite the i would go back to when it was apparent 
that libya was exporting statesponsored terrorism perhaps more 
than theyre now doing and there was a concern then about the lives 
of americans in our country and so i cant say im totally 
unconcerned but i cant give you any hard evidence that should 
further alarm the american people in this regard did i leave out 
something 
q well i dont know did you leave out something 
president bush i cant remember i mean did you leave out 
something you werent clear on the question put it that 
q i cant i suppose the logical followon is have additional 
specific steps been taken to ensure that it wont come into this 
country 
president bush well i think were i dont know of any 
additional specific steps along the border but we have tried at 
every turn to step up our interdiction and we are doing a better 
job now i can tell you than we were a year ago in coordinating 
intelligence which would be probably the key area there but not as 
a result of the i cant think of any two or three specific things 
done at least that have come to my attention since the crackdown by 
president barco if that was the question 
yeah craig

rafael m estevezs hobby again became his 
work monday when hurricane hugo cut communications in the caribbean 
turning ham radio operators into key sources of information for the 
islands 
during such emergencies his home serves as base for a network of 
ham radio operators helping people contact relatives and relaying 
emergency information 
i like this because i can help my community my friends and 
people i dont know estevez said 
when hugo left communications dependent on estevez and other ham 
radio operators reporters descended on his home and television 
camera cables snaked through his front door and across the living 
room floor 
estevez seated at a desk topped with ham radio equipment and two 
telephones gave live broadcasts in spanish for several television 
stations on the latest damage reports from notes he had jotted on a 
pad 
in the community of arroyo on puerto ricos southeastern coast 
the mayor and several dozen other people stayed in a 
theaterturnedshelter after hugo passed because most homes were 
destroyed and power lines lying in the streets made travel 
dangerous estevez reported 
a huge wave about 30 feet high reportedly struck the villages 
beach he said 
the islands of vieques and culebra off the eastern end of puerto 
rico were severely pounded by hugo with wind reported up to 135 
mph he said 
theres a lot of roofless houses he said 
estevez is president and founder of the international society of 
radio amateurs with members in central america and south america 
plaques on his wall praise the groups work including transmitting 
information during the united states invasion of grenada 
estevez works at hialeah park race track taking bets and does 
racetrack publicity for the spanishspeaking media but said he is 
excused from work during emergencies like hugo 
a fellow ham radio operator robert pastor fielded phone calls 
while pressing estevez to eat a late lunch 
estevez 50 recalled other disasters including the 1972 
nicaraguan earthquake he said radio operators serve as a vital link 
for people trying to contact relatives in disasterstruck areas 
earthquakes you get more victims than hurricanes he said 
hurricanes you get less victims but more damage 
ham radio operator bernard bob sternberg of sunrise also 
relayed information monday he said he transmitted assistance 
requests for the eastern caribbean island of montserrat to the red 
cross in washington and talked to a st croix ham radio operator 
who described utter destruction on that island

of the storm and said he was making preparations for the full 
brunt of the hurricane

prayed for all of them

q weve been pressing the soviet union for so many years to 
allow unfettered jewish emigration do you think the united states 
in good conscience can set a limit on the number of soviet jews that 
are allowed to come here and does this and does the current 
decision to set some limits have anything to do with israels view 
that not enough soviet jews want to go there 
president bush well first israel does want as many as possible 
to go there theres no question about that but i think we can 
accommodate those that certainly that have applied 
and yes we do have to set our you know to control our overall 
immigration policy i mean we had that at the time of the boat 
people we have it in brownsville texas we have it in people 
coming from other countries from all across south america wanting 
to come here 
the british are facing this problem now in hong kong in a very 
serious way and any country must set its set certain limits it 
speaks very well i think in terms of whats happening in the 
soviet union and hopefully in the way were handling the soviet 
account that more and more people are being permitted to come here 
q but you dont feel any sort of moral imperative after the 
united states has pressed the soviet union for so long to have an 
almost open immigration policy to soviet jews 
president bush well id like to have an open immigration policy 
for vietnamese refugees for those fleeing the tyranny in nicaragua 
but we cant do that we have to have a certain control of our own 
policy 
i remember feeling this way at the time of the mariel boat lift 
and so i know where my heart is and im very proud that this moved 
up from what 3000 emigres in one year to now 50000 or 70000 
bob somewhere in that range and thats good and i want to do 
whatever we can to encourage it 
but ps we have got to have an overall immigration policy that 
keeps the control of our demagraphics in our hands 
yeah one and then two over here 
q mr president is there any progress to report on negotiations 
with congress on the drug bill and would you be willing to put more 
money into the drug war as a in a possible compromise 
president bush there may be a compromise in the senate and i 
hope there is and ive been one who is chastised for too much 
compromise from time to time but im not in a position that there 
will never be any compromise 
i am in a posture of saying weve allocated the right amount of 
resources lets get on with doing with what i have suggested and 
then if theres some glaring holes in the program fine but to jump 
out immediately and start yelling not had i gotten off that 
television set than a voice comes on from the democratic side 
talking about more money and then you hear this hue and cry about 
raising peoples taxes we dont have to do that 
weve allocated a proper amount of money and do i wish there 
were more that would be readily available and painless absolutely 
but weve now fit a program a national drug strategy put fit it 
in to what i think is a sound financial proposition 
and therefore id like to urge the congress to get on with it 
the american people want action they support strongly our national 
drug strategy i havent seen one single piece of evidence that they 
dont and so lets take a step instead of criticizing every time 
you come out with a proposal whether its on clean air or something 
else somebody wants to raise taxes and add more money to it well 
i can understand that reflex but i think we ought to try now to 
move some of these things forward in the last days of this congress 
and there are several other a crime package and some of these 
areas that i think they could move fast on im very pleased bill 
reilly telling me that the house is starting to mark up our 
environmental package thats good 
so i dont want to be hypercritical but i must say theres a 
certain frustration level when you come out with a sound program and 
two answers come out spend more and raise taxes and that i dont 
think we have to do to be sound in the environment or sound in 
education or sound in narcotics 
q followup 
president bush yeah antinarcotics followup 
q mr president today secretary of defense dick cheney said us 
troops should be used more in the drug war and that they would in 
fact be put in harms way is that what you foresee 
president bush you know what i learned long ago dont answer 
from one sentence out of something that somebody said that i havent 
seen but ive stated my position on trying to support colombia but 
i just would get in real trouble if i commented even though im 
sure you accurately reflected what he said or tried to but he 
hasnt laughter put it this way put it this way he hasnt 
discussed it with me something of this nature im sure he would

yeah 
q mr president the earlier question on the meetings with mr 
shevardnadze you answered and you couched your responses in terms of 
responding reacting to what he brings can you talk for a second 
about what you want them to react to what is your agenda what do 
you want to get out of those meetings 
president bush well weve got some of our agenda on the public 
table as you know the most pressing point the conventional 
forces that agreement that would really be a wonderful step to see 
completed fairly soon but there will be other issues that baker 
will be raising secretary baker will be raising with them a wide 
array of them 
they will be on their economy they will be on the environment 
they will be on well several others that i i touched on 
chemical i dont know exactly how far along were going to be by 
the time that meeting starts but were not going to just react to 
his proposals were going to be very interested in them and welcome 
them but we just simply cannot and will not keep reacting 
we have interests in this hemisphere where the soviets 
continuing to send or increased amounts of arms going into nicaragua 
right now over last year thats not very good and its not a very 
kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere and so were going to 
be raising other questions with them but i think it will be a 
constructive meeting and hope there will be progress 
staff you have to go sir 
president bush all right here it is 
q mr president vice president quayle has indicated in a recent 
statement that the administration may be either reevaluating or 
backing off on its commitment to sdi whats going on with sdi 
president bush were not backing off it we submitted some 
figures up there and lo and behold they were cut or trying to be 
cut and so we will stay with it 
but i think what the vice president was talking about was sdi as 
now constituted opposed to the original broad idealistic and 
wonderfully idealistic proposal of an impenetrable shield i think 
what dan quayle was doing was focusing it down more where the 
research would go more along the lines it is now and but with the 
shield proposal kind of set aside i think thats what that was all 
about all right persistence pays off not yours his laughter 
q i wonder if you could go back to the question of soviet jewish 
immigration its understandable that nations must set limits and 
control their immigration but when we thought that there was a real 
need the space was there i wonder if you feel that the need is 
diminished i wonder if you feel that there is no longer the threat 
to jews in the soviet union 
president bush id have to say i think the climate is better 
but i cant say theres no threat to employment to you know 
sometimes when you file an application to leave the soviet union 
youre automatically denied employment sometimes your apartment and 
wherever it might be 
so i think things are improving but i think as long as someone 
is held in a country against their will because they cant get out 
it is a matter of human concern it is a matter of conscience that 
was summed up in the really in the helsinki accords and so its 
its not just its not just the the jews coming out of the soviet 
union its a very important category but there are others around 
the world that are seeking refuge as well 
so it i think things are somewhat better there but i dont 
think we can say look youve totally lived up to your to your 
commitment for ingress and egress by permitting what 70000 people 
to leave i mean ive heard figures as high as half a million 
wanting to leave the soviet union so we cant relax on that but we 
do have to do it in an orderly immigration have an orderly 
immigration policy thank you all for your understanding 
we didnt get is there may i ask if theres a question from a 
montana frank you are not a montana reporter laughter please 
sir 
q you didnt mention anything about wilderness in your talk on 
environmental stewardship a big issue in montana and most of the 
other western states is whether to add additional wilderness areas 
to the national wilderness whats your position on that 
president bush my position is that we can accommodate first 
let me give you a broad answer we can accommodate sound 
environmental practice with some growth and the governor of the 
state feels that way we did talk about it in the earlier on

the death toll from a shooting rampage at 
a printing plant rose to nine monday with the death of a plant 
worker who was wounded four other victims were buried monday 
kenneth fentress of louisville died about 5 pm monday said a 
spokeswoman at humana hospital university fentress 45 suffered 
gunshot wounds to the chest and leg during last thursdays rampage 
he was one of 13 wounded when joseph t wesbecker sprayed the 
standard gravure corp printing plant with gunfire from an ak47 
rifle wesbecker who then killed himself had been on permanent 
disability leave from the plant for the past year because of mental 
illness 
meanwhile two antigun organizations hoping to mobilize a 
grassroots movement in the wake of the shootings placed ads in a 
statewide newspaper monday to enlist support to ban various weapons 
in a related development the gun shop owner in louisville who 
sold wesbecker the ak47 and a mac11 pistol said he has decided to 
quit ordering the semiautomatic weapons for customers 
the weapons are so controversial right now that we just dont 
want to fool with them any longer said jack tilford owner of 
tilfords gun sales 
president bush has banned the import of foreignmade assault 
rifles into the united states including the ak47 however 
possession of these weapons is not a federal offense nor does the 
import ban prevent them from being manufactured domestically 
a fullpage ad in the courierjournal from the louisville council 
on peacemaking and religion called for the abolition of assault 
weapons saying there is no compelling reason to possess these 
terrible instruments 
readers were asked to send the ad to us sens wendell ford 
dky and mitch mcconnell rky 
im deeply disturbed by the recent outbreaks of violence in our 
state and believe we must take action to stop such vicious 
crimes mcconnell said but he added we need to be careful 
about legislating in the middle of a crisis 
mcconnell referred to a police standoff monday in which a 
17yearold armed teenager held 11 classmates at a high school in 
mckee the boy later released the hostages and surrendered 
ford will consider the groups views when guncontrol legislation 
comes before the full senate said his spokeswoman susan elmendorf 
the handgun control inc placed an in the louisville newspaper 
featuring sarah brady wife of former presidential press secretary 
james brady who was critically injured in the attempted 
assassination of president reagan in 1981

the national aeronautics and space 
administration said monday it may roll the space shuttle atlantis 
back from its seaside launch pad at the kennedy space center in 
florida if hurricane hugo continues to pose a threat 
nasa spokeswoman sarah keegan said preparations also were being 
made to remove a satellite from an atlascentaur rocket which had 
been scheduled for launch on friday 
she said a final decision was to be made tuesday morning on both 
space vehicles after a weather briefing 
atlantis is scheduled to be launched oct 12 with the galileo 
space probe in its cargo bay the five astronauts on the flight are 
to release the probe and send it on a sixyear voyage to the planet 
jupiter 
the space probe is powered by a small nuclear generator 
we are starting preparations to pull atlantis back into the 
relative safety of its hangar in the giant vehicle assembly 
building miss keegan said we decided to take preliminary steps 
if they decide to roll back tomorrow 
a return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the 
launch but nasa has an opportunity to send the probe on its way 
until late november 
the payload on top of the atlascentaur rocket is the last of a 
series of communications satellites for the navy 
on monday the hurricane hit puerto rico with 125 mph winds as 
it moved across islands in the eastern caribbean killing 14 people 
and leaving thousands homeless

hurricane would strike the us mainland

president bush amid reports that he has 
ordered steppedup security for his family said monday he has no 
hard intelligence about threats from drug lords and any such 
attacks would provoke the entire wrath of the american people 
i cant say im totally unconcerned but i dont have any hard 
evidence that should further alarm the american people in this 
context he said at a news conference in helena mont on a 
twoday swing through the west 
i know theres speculation on this but there is no hard 
intelligence evidence of such targeting when asked if he knew of 
threats against his family clearly any such action would i think 
just bring down the entire wrath of the american people and the 
american government 
earlier bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater declined comment on 
what type of secret service protection was afforded the five grown 
bush children we dont comment on security period he said 
on friday the secret service beefed up security for dorothy bush 
leblond the presidents daughter who lives near portland maine and 
works for the portland chamber of commerce 
neither secret service spokesman robert snow nor authorities in 
portland would say specifically why the action was taken but local

neil in denver and marvin in alexandria va 
allan kramer another secret service spokesman said the 
president and his family are authorized to receive roundtheclock 
protection 
kramer would not provide any details of security for the bush 
children but a white house source who spoke on condition on 
anonymity said the children were not guarded on a regular basis in 
the past 
kramer said presidential children do not always want protection 
for instance former president reagans children were not happy 
about fulltime agents in their lives so reagan signed an ordered 
relinquishing protection for some of them

hungarys ruling communist party and 
five opposition groups signed an agreement late monday on measures 
to go before parliament aimed at achieving peaceful transition to a 
multiparty system 
according to hungarian television majority agreement was reached 
on a constitutional reform establishment of a constitutional court 
the functioning of political parties and a draft electoral law 
negotiators also agreed on a reform of the penal code and an 
amendment to the law on criminal procedure 
the items of legislation will be submitted to parliament which 
convenes on sept 26 
four opposition groups the league of free democrats the league 
of young democrats the league of independent democratic trade 
unions and the hungarian social democratic party did not sign the 
agreement but said they wont stand in the way of parliaments 
working on the bills 
the agreement specified that political bargaining would continue 
on issues not resolved 
according to the state news agency mti these include the 
technical aspects of electing the president of the republic a new 
law on information issues related to transforming the workers 
militia now a paramilitary group and ruling out violent means to 
solve political issues 
in addition to the communists and opposition groups the talks 
were attended by social organizations including the official trade 
unions 
in a major concession announced earlier the hungarian socialist 
workers party or the communist party agreed to give 36 million to 
the government by the end of the year to be used to finance 
opposition political parties 
mti said agreement was reached that the president will be chosen 
by referendum this year but should be selected by parliament once 
free elections have been held 
after the constitutional amendment is enacted the current 
presidential council will be dissolved and its duties assumed by the 
speaker of parliament until a new president is elected the 
11member council is empowered to exercise the functions of 
parliament when parliament is not in session 
a major opposition demand was disbanding the workers militia an 
organization set up in 1957 by the communist party to safeguard its 
rule 
the communists tried to defuse the issue on monday by offering to 
slash the 60000member militias strength by a third and put it 
under defense ministry supervision but this apparently was not 
enough

senate democrats and republicans searched for a 
compromise monday in their struggle over the size and shape of an 
antidrug package as president bush stood by his 79 billion 
proposal as sufficient to do the job 
lawmakers from both parties met for two hours monday evening 
without settling any of the differences between them and said they 
would resume their talks tuesday 
we on our side of the table are still waiting for our friends 
on the other side of the table to come up with what they would 
consider a counterproposal said sen robert byrd dwva after 
the meeting 
if we are talking about a specific plan on the republican side 
it is the presidents plan said the chief republican negotiator 
sen mark hartfield of oregon 
byrd backed by democratic leaders offered legislation last week 
doubling bushs proposal to increase financing for antidrug 
initiatives by 22 billion both sides believe that illegal drugs 
and the crime and violence springing from them are the top issue on 
the minds of the public 
bush is asking for 79 billion mostly for law enforcement for 
fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 byrds 101 billion package puts 
more emphasis than bush hasd on prevention and treatment efforts 
for his part the president told a news conference in helena 
mont weve allocated the right amount of money id like to 
urge the congress to get on with it the american people want 
action 
as for raising taxes to finance the war on drugs bush said we 
dont have to do that 
although defending his proposal bush indicated he was willing to 
compromise with democrats on the final shape of an antidrug program 
there may be a compromise in the senate and i hope there is 
the president said still he complained that the initial democratic 
response was spend more and raise taxes 
as written byrds proposal drew an immediate veto threat from 
white house officials who complained that it was too expensive 
they also objected to its formula for providing the extra money 
cutting most other federal programs by 0575 percent which results 
in a 18 billion slash in the militarys 300 billion budget 
the two sides have been bargaining since last week with 
republicans hoping to reduce the size of the package shift more of 
its resources to law enforcement agencies and shield the pentagon 
from cuts 
because of the standoff republicans on monday slowed the 
senates work on the remaining five annual spending bills to operate 
the government next year they fear that the chambers democratic 
majority will leave the pentagon spending bill for last leaving it 
vulnerable to cuts to finance antidrug efforts 
debate on a 672 billion measure for housing veterans and space 
programs began in the late afternoon three hours behind schedule 
but senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said he might block 
a vote on final passage 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine chided the gop 
for blocking the bills he noted that in the past thenpresident 
reagan and other republicans have lambasted congressional democrats 
for failing to approve spending legislation on time 
no useful purpose would be served by blocking the bills 
mitchell said no political purpose no substantive purpose 
congress has so far sent only one of the 13 annual appropriations 
bills for fiscal 1990 to bush for his signature

the yearlong 43rd general assembly ended 
monday a session that saw the end of the cold war declared by 
ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev said assembly president dante 
caputo 
before his presidential term ended in january reagan joined the 
soviet president in opening a new era of warmer superpower 
relations which was reflected in the speeches both men gave to the 
general assembly almost a year ago 
caputo said those declarations are the deepest and most 
eloquent reflection of profound change that has occurred 
they demonstrate i would venture to say the end of the cold 
war which hovered over our world for such a long period 
mondays brief closing session was mainly procedural unresolved 
questions such as the palestinian issue cyprus and the uneasy 
iraniraq truce were carried over to the 44th general assembly 
which opens tuesday 
the assembly took the unprecedented step of moving to geneva to 
hear yasser arafat last december after the state department refused 
to give palestine liberation organization chief an entry visa to 
address the general assembly 
at geneva arafat renounced the use of terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist eliminating the major issues that prompted 
the state department to refuse his visa request 
arafat has said he would like to address this years general 
assembly 
arab league ambassador clovis maksoud said he was confident the 
new us administration would grant a visa if one was asked but if 
not of course we would want to go back to geneva 
the undersecretarygeneral for general assembly affairs ronald 
spiers told reporters arafat should be allowed to speak if he 
wishes 
spiers is a former undersecretary at the state department and the 
top american official at the united nations 
caputo argentinas former foreign minister reviewed the closing 
assemblys major accomplishments 
he noted it set in motion namibias transition toward 
independence which may end in the sovereign nation of namibias 
becoming the 160th member of the general assembly next year 
caputo hailed the unanimous adoption of the afghanistan 
resolution that called for outside parties not to interfere in 
afghan affairs and for a government of national reconciliation 
other landmark resolutions included calls for peace settlements 
in central america western sahara and cambodia 
this more than any other time is the time of the united 
nations as the cold war yields to dialogue and detente new 
possibilities are opened for the collective security enshrined in 
our charter said caputo

beirut on monday after christian army commander michel aoun rejected 
a proposed committee to monitor a ceasefire in his 6monthold war 
against syrian troops 
police said the exchanges at times averaged 20 shells a minute 
and that at least six people were killed and 14 wounded 
that brought the toll to 921 killed and 2713 wounded since march 
8 when the confrontation began between gen aouns estimated 20000 
troops and syrias 40000 soldiers 
concentrated shelling of the shiite moslem slum of haret hreik 
demolished a sevenstory apartment building a police spokesman said 
three bodies were found in the rubble of the mokdad building seven 
people were wounded and three more were missing and feared dead 
under the debris he said the building collapsed while its 
inhabitants were waiting out the shelling in the basement 
rescue workers hanging from ropes pulled a bloodied woman from 
the basement she apparently survived 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the duels 
broke out around 1 am 90 minutes hours after aoun announced in a 
televised interview his rejection of a security committee proposed 
by arab mediators saturday he wants at least one syrian committee 
member 
i wont accept at all a lebaneselebanese committee this is 
what the syrians wanted to deceive the world and say the clashes 
have been among lebanese factions aoun said 
in damascus the syrian capital us ambassador edward djerdjian 
urged the lebanese to demonstrate flexibility 
the british foreign office expressed support for the arab 
initiative and said an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire 
throughout lebanon should be the first step 
and in an extraordinary burst of optimism the arab leagues 
ambassador to the united nations clovis maksoud said on monday 
that lebanons long nightmare is on the brink of resolution 
arab league envoy lakhdar alibrahimi of algeria the arab 
mediators choice to lead the proposed committee met with aoun for 
an hour at the generals bombravaged presidential palace in 
suburban baabda 
he said later we discussed ways of implementing the arab 
committees decisions 
why aouns gunners concentrated on haret hreik was not explained 
the densely populated slum is a stronghold of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god the syrians have no firing positions 
there 
a bulldozer sifted part of the rubble enabling rescuers with 
flashlights to climb down on ropes into the basement of the mokdad 
building 
one worker shouted a survivor a survivor rescuers rushed 
in with a stretcher and a blanket and pulled through a hole an 
unconscious woman covered with blood 
shes alive allah akbar god is great rescuers shouted as 
they put her into an ambulance 
the arab committee made up of king fahd of saudi arabia king 
hassan ii of morocco and president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
announced a peace plan saturday 
in calls for a ceasefire and a security committee and urges 
parliament to meet on sept 30 to discuss political reforms the 
moslems condition for ending the 14yearold civil war 
the syrianbacked moslems want to share power equally with the 
christians who have dominated the government legislature army and 
judiciary since independence from france in 1943 
the christians then were the majority but moslems now comprise 
55 percent of the 4 million population 
on sunday night aoun ruled out talk of political reform until 
lebanon is free of all occupations 
he was referring to syrias 40000 troops in lebanon under a 
1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate and an israeli force which 
has controlled a border strip in south lebanon since 1985 
us ambassador djerdjian told reporters in damascus 
theres no way out of the lebanese civil war except through a 
political solution and the withdrawal of all foreign forces 
including israels 
the arab league proposal is worthy of the support of the 
lebanese people he said indirectly criticizing aouns 
reservations 
aoun has accused the united states of turning a blind eye to 
syrias war against the traditionally prowestern christians 
washington withdrew its embassy staff from christian east beirut 
this month after aouns supporters besieged the compound demanding 
us support

hungary and israel restored full 
diplomatic ties monday more than 20 years after budapest severed 
them to protest israels occupation of arab lands in the 1967 middle 
east war 
hungary becomes the first east bloc nation to renew full ties 
with the jewish state romania was the only warsaw pact nation to 
maintain ties following the 1967 war 
the move underlined the budapest governments determination to 
continue its increasingly independent foreign policy and its opening 
to the west 
it also reflected a warming of relations between israel and the 
soviet union moscow led the east bloc in severing ties with israel 
in 1967 but in recent years there have been gradual steps toward 
the reestablishment of ties those steps have included cultural 
exchanges and the establishment of lowlevel diplomatic contacts 
hungarys official news agency mti announced the resumption of 
ties shortly after israeli foreign minister moshe arens arrived in 
budapest for an official visit 
the renewal of ties has historic significance because hungary 
was the site of thriving jewish communities until the holocaust in 
world war ii arens said on israel radio from budapest 
these ties will bring economic social and political benefits 
to israel and also to hungary the russianborn arens added 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir also speaking on israel 
radio termed the hungarian move a courageous and strong decision 
to be pioneers in the field he said he hoped other soviet bloc 
states would follow suit 
the soviet union and other warsaw pact allies were informed by 
hungary of the move said laszlo kovacs a state secretary in the 
foreign ministry 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we are pleased they have decided to restore formal 
diplomatic relations we hope that other members of the warsaw pact 
will follow hungarys lead 
about 80000 jews live in hungary giving it eastern europes 
second largest jewish community the soviet union is first with 25 
million before the nazi holocaust about 1 million jews lived in 
hungary 
hungary which has embraced liberal social reforms and plans 
multiparty elections next year has angered hardline warsaw pact 
allies by opening its border to austria allowing thousands of east 
germans to flee to the west 
foreign minister gyula horn told mti the resumption of ties after 
22 years marked another step in hungarys reform drive and an 
attempt to correct what he termed past mistakes 
hungary is against confrontation endorses dialogue and wants 
good relationships based on mutual advantages horn was quoted as 
saying 
this step is not aimed against anybody and will probably be 
helpful in solving the middle east conflict he added 
the protocol on the resumption of ties was signed by arens and 
horn 
in september 1987 hungary and israel agreed to establish 
interest sections in each others countries israel also has an 
interest section in poland 
under mondays agreement the head of israels interest office in 
budapest shlomo meron turns ambassador hungarys corresponding 
office in tel aviv also becomes an embassy israels foreign 
ministry said 
mti said the ties between the two countries were never totally 
cut especially because there are about 300000 israeli citizens 
whose mother tongue is hungarian but what was left of trade went 
through intermediaries 
four weeks ago the world jewish congress said hungary had begun 
allowing soviet jews to fly to israel through budapest becoming the 
second east european country to permit the transit of such 
immigrants romania has been allowing soviet jews to transit through 
bucharest for several years 
bilateral trade increased after the interest sections were opened 
in march 1988 the israeli airline el al and the hungarian carrier 
malev started flights between budapest and tel aviv in october 
in july an agreement went into force on the mutual reduction of 
customs tariffs between the two countries covering an equal number 
of 16 types of goods on both sides the reduction applies to roughly 
onethird of hungarian exports to israel 
at the end of june the israeli trade ministry lifted special 
import licensing obligations thus giving hungary the same treatment 
that countries of the european free trade association enjoy

pierce he was taken to a juvenile holding center in the clay county 
jail in nearby manchester mckee is a town of 250 people about 50 
miles southeast of lexington in the appalachian foothills 
he was unbalanced said state police detective bob stephens 
who negotiated with pierce throughout the day at the high school 
he was a confused young man he was a young man looking for 
somebody to help him 
throughout the negotiations stephens said he feared pierce would 
try to kill himself since he seemed to be carrying out the scenario 
of the stephen king thriller rage which he had been reading 
during a search of pierces room at home police found a 
paperback copy of the book in which the lead character is shot by 
police the book tells the story of a high school boy who hates his 
father and begins bringing his fathers pistol to school 
eventually the lead character in the story takes a class of 24 
students hostage and kills a teacher 
police also found papers pierce had written that made references 
to dying at 9 oclock 
at one point during the day he said itll all end at nine 
stephens said pierces sole demand throughout was to talk to his 
father stephens said 
he hasnt seen his father my understanding since hes 4 years 
old stephens said 
pierces father who was not identified was on his way to mckee 
from delray beach fla when the student released his last two 
hostages and surrendered 
he never would commit to why he wanted to talk to his father 
stephens said 
psychologists and fbi experts who assisted stephens pored over 
rage during the day and relayed its details to the negotiators 
after reading the book and pierces notes we thought suicide was 
what wed have to deal with at the end stephens said 
stephens said he pressed to end the standoff before the 9 oclock 
time mentioned in the notes he said pierce never threatened to harm 
anyone else 
pierce who released his hostages throughout the day in exchange 
for items such as food soft drinks and cigarettes said he wasnt 
going to hurt nobody according to craig eversole a classmate who 
was held but released he said he wasnt going to shoot nobody 
police trooper ed robinson said the hostagetaker was armed with 
a shotgun a 357caliber magnum revolver and some type of 
automatic pistol eversole identified the other weapons as a 
44caliber magnum and a 12gauge shotgun 
robinson also said the teenager apparently had held one hostage 
overnight the son of school principal betty bond he said the two 
boys arrived at school in the younger bonds red pickup and it 
appeared that the armed youth had been holding the principals son 
since the night before 
it was not clear why the youth took over the classroom 
authorities described him as a newcomer to the school who was living 
with his grandparents but some students said they had known him for 
years 
state police capt john lile said the boys parents are separated 
eversole a 15yearold junior said he was in the classroom when 
the armed youth came through the door 
he never said nothing eversole said he shot the ceiling 
and told the teacher to leave and let two rows of students leave 
he didnt say nothing why he was doing it or nothing 
later pierce fired another shot blowing out a classroom window 
to allow bond the original hostage to get an amfm radio and 
telephone lile said 
eversole was released at about 130 pm after soda was delivered 
to the room apparently as part of a deal with police 
earlier robinson said the boy fired one shot at a news 
helicopter from wcpotv in cincinnati shortly before 1 pm but a 
state police spokesman in frankfort later denied that shots were 
fired at the helicopter 
nearly 500 other students at the high school were evacuated after 
the incident began 
valerie hurst at the justice hurst funeral home across the 
street from the high school said students evacuated to her building 
were frightened 
we had a couple to pass out and had to call an ambulance for 
one who had a heart condition she said 
she said the boy was described by people she talked to as a good 
student

president bush defended the slow pace of 
arms negotiations with the soviet union on monday and said its 
not time for normalcy in relations with china despite a gradual 
increase in contacts since junes bloody crackdown on student 
dissent in beijing 
in a wideranging session with reporters in the ornate senate 
chamber of the montana legislature bush said reforms in hungary had 
made it possible to extend new economic privileges to the communist 
nation 
after the news conference the president flew to spokane wash 
and had dinner with house speaker thomas s foley in foleys home 
district 
the president was emphasizing environmental issues on a swing 
through south dakota montana and washington and he defended his 
decision not to travel to alaska to view the oil spill damage in 
prince william sound 
he said he was hopeful that winter will be kind in restoring 
environmental conditions in alaskan waters he said hed sent his 
environmental vice president to inspect the cleanup efforts and 
predicted that exxon would come back next spring if further 
cleanup was necessary in the wake of the oil spill from the exxon 
valdez 
the president also vowed to fight on the floor of the 
democraticcontrolled house to win passage of his plan for a cut in 
the capital gains tax and said his plan is not as my critics say 
a tax that will help the rich 
he also said any attempt by colombian drug leaders to retaliate 
on americans for the bush administrations drug program would 
bring down the wrath of the american people and the american 
government 
bush fielded several questions on the soviet union a few days 
before secretary of state james bakers scheduled meetings with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who has criticized the 
administration for not advancing any major proposal on longrange 
arms 
asked why there hadnt been more progress on a strategic arms 
agreement bush noted he had put early emphasis on conventional arms 
he acknowledged rumors that shevardnadze would bring a new arms 
proposal to the united states during meetings later this week but 
said i dont know what hes going to bring we havent had that 
confirmed 
he added i think our handling of the soviet account is pretty 
good i think the chief point is does the soviet union understand 
that we want to see their perestroika succeed and see them move 
forward with more liberties and i think they do understand that and 
so i dont think theres any chance of a disconnect there 
these are not easy problems bush said mentioning 
verification issues as among the thorniest to a socalled start pact 
limiting longrange ballistic missiles at the same time he said 
dont see any insurmountable stumbling blocks there he said he 
was in no hurry to meet personally with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
we do want to move ahead on start bush said as you know 
we came in did a review completed the review and we will be 
working inside our own administration to have the proposal that i 
think will capture the imagination of the soviet union 
among other topics that will be raised the president mentioned 
an increased flow of soviet bloc arms to nicaragua which officials 
have said is coming from cuba and said the shipments were not a 
very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere 
a reporter noted news accounts that bushs brother prescott was 
among american merchants who had resumed business contacts with the 
chinese and asked bush if it were time to resume normal relations 
bush responded no no were not ready although he said he 
hoped he would soon see proper signals from the chinese 
leadership that would lead to improved relations 
on other subjects he indicated he was willing to compromise with 
democrats in congress on the final shape of an antidrug program 
although he complained that their initial response was spend more 
and raise taxes 
asked about threats to himself or his family by south american 
drug lords bent on revenge for his own drug program the president 
said he didnt know of any hard intelligence that the danger had 
increased 
the president said hungary has undertaken major steps toward 
economic and political reform enabling the united states to grant 
permanent favorednation status to the eastern european communist 
state he said the move will open new doors for the hungarian 
economy encouraging greater market orientation and increasing the 
foreign exchange earnings 
bush said he wished the united states could accept as many 
soviet jews who wished to enter the country but added we do have 
to set our to control our overall immigration policy weve had 
that in regard to the boat people we have it in brownsville 
texas 
later when asked if he felt the persecution of soviet jews had 
abated the president said id have to say i think the climate is 
better but i cant say there is no threat i think things are 
improving but i think as long as someone is held in a country 
against their will they cant get out it is a matter of human 
concern 
bush sidestepped a question of whether he would grant yasser 
arafat the leader of the palestine liberation organization a visa 
to attend this months united nations general assembly session i 
will consider that matter when and if it comes to my attention he 
said 
bush was criticized last summer for a measured response to the 
chinese crackdown and he defended what he had done 
ive tried to protect and preserve a long term relationship 
that is very important for the united states no it is not time for 
normalcy but i dont want to hurt the chinese people by 
cutting off commerce he said 
on another foreign policy issue bush said its up to the two 
germanys to decide whether to move toward reunification i dont 
accept that such a move is a threat to peace or to western 
interests he said 
bush also stuck to his opposition to a ban on all assault rifles 
touching on a gun control issue that is politically potent in rural 
montana 
bush struck a combative tone when it came to his plan for a 
capital gains tax cut a plan that was approved in the house ways 
and means committee last week with the help of six democratic votes 
senate democratic leader george mitchell said after the vote that 
democrats would not be willing to enter into comprehensive budget 
negotiations with the administration if the capital gains tax cut 
were approved 
said bush this idea that we wont talk i dont think thats 
right and i dont think the american people would support that i 
dont think its right for people who get whipped in committee to 
then start a lot of threats on the other side 
bush in a speech just prior to his news conference urged a 
new greening of america and proposed a national treeplanting 
campaign as a lowcost part of his national cleanair strategy 
he also said he would order special environmental training for 
peace corps representatives abroad to stop pollution before it 
starts and ensure that economic development and environmental 
stewardship go handinhand

federal energy and environmental officials 
announced an agreement monday for handling wastes from the federal 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant an issue that had threatened to 
close the plant 
energy secretary james watkins said the agreement also involving 
officials from colorado shows the department of energys commitment 
to follow the nations environmental laws 
this agreement is a first in what will be a series of steps to 
refocus our priorities on environmental compliance he said in a 
statement issued in denver i believe todays action also further 
demonstrates does willingness to work toward resolution of 
compliance issues with both the environmental protection agency 
and the states 
the problem arose because of concern by officials for doe and 
rockwell international corp which runs the plant for doe about 
their personal liability for the plants failure to follow 
environmental laws by storing the mixed wastes at the plant 
officials said the concern was real because earlier this year 
several civilian employees at the armys aberdeen proving grounds in 
maryland were convicted of illegal storage treatment and disposal 
of hazardous wastes there 
longterm storage of such wastes at a production site isnt 
allowed yet there is no federally approved disposal site or 
treatment process for wastes including both hazardous materials and 
radioactive elements 
doe officials noted the problem earlier this summer and 
threatened to close the plant until some solution was reached then 
last week rockwell officials indicated the same concern and said 
shutting the plant was an option 
the plant 16 miles northwest of denver employs about 6000 people 
and is the only one in the nation that makes plutonium triggers for 
nuclear weapons 
federal officials worried the nations defense could be 
compromised with such a shutdown 
under the agreement which first came to light last week doe 
will handle the wastes in compliance with hazardous waste storage 
requirements and will minimize the generation of such wastes 
in addition doe is committing in the agreement to develop a 
national report that will include the information necessary to 
assess the situation at other doe facilities nationwise

a secret service agent convicted of using 
excessive force to arrest a man near a presidential candidates new 
york motorcade last year was sentenced monday to six months in a 
halfway house 
us district judge pierre leval imposed the sentence on kevin 
schatzle after viewing a videotape of the april 10 1988 incident 
at the time schatzle was in the security detail for sen albert 
gore then campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination 
a jury convicted schatzle 28 in june of using excessive force 
when he kicked and punched attorney christopher gorayeb 32 he had 
faced up to one year in prison 
during the trial schatzle testified that the lawyer spat at him 
but gorayeb said he was attacked when he yelled an obsenity at the 
passing motorcade because one of its cars almost hit him as he 
legally crossed the street gorayeb testified that he suffered a 
broken nose and deep bruises 
schatzle had been acquitted of a second charge of making a false 
arrest 
i think that what happened is that when gorayeb spat the agent 
simply blew his stack leval said he also imposed three years 
probation and a 2000 
while noting schatzles previous good record as a law enforcement 
officer the judge said the agent had engaged in serious 
misconduct during the incident 
his attorney maurice nadjari had urged the judge not to impose 
any prison time he said schatzle had earned the respect of his 
colleagues and superiors during five years in the new york police 
department and four years with the secret service 
leval allowed nadjari time to submit a written motion to postpone 
the sentence pending appeal schatzle remains free until the judge 
rules

the head of the federal communications 
commission suggests broadcasters adopt a voluntary code to control 
shock radio the use of sexually and racially oriented humor to 
attract audiences 
we are not simply recorders transmitters and antennas fcc 
chairman alfred sikes told a group of broadcasters attending the 
national association of broadcasters radio convention sept 15 we 
are what we broadcast 
sikes a former owner of several radio stations suggested 
reviving the nabs programming code which was dropped in the early 
1980s as the result of a federal antitrust suit against provisions 
regarding commercials 
standards should be drawn up by the industry without government 
pressure said sikes who took over the fcc chairmanship in august 
the government rightly leaves all programming decisions to 
broadcasters today he said not only is that as it should be 
but it should also be seen as an invitation to work among 
yourselves 
sikes said he was prepared to work with the industry and the us 
justice department which filed the antitrust suit to ensure that 
broadcasters have the freedom to develop sound voluntary 
programming standards 
the fcc announced on aug 24 that it was beginning enforcement 
action against three stations wlupam in chicago ksjofm in san 
jose calif and wfbqfm in indianapolis which may have 
broadcast indecent programs in violation of the law 
nab president edward fritts said the organization could not 
consider a code unless pending legislation granting the broadcast 
industry an antitrust exemption for programming content codes passes 
congress 
even if an antitrust exemption is granted a code could still 
lead to legal problems fritts said 
it doesnt preclude the nab from being sued on civil grounds 
on first amendment rights he said

commerce secretary robert mosbacher wont 
concentrate on promoting a highdefinition television industry in 
the united states after being reprimanded by the white house a 
congressional source said 
mosbacher in their eyes is a renegade promoting industial 
policy and they thought it was absolutely necessary to reprimand 
him said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
mosbacher was made to stand in front of the class and made to 
say i believe in the free market 500 times the source said 
as a result the commerce department will consider hdtv the next 
generation of television only as part of a broadbased effort to 
boost us technological competitiveness an administration source 
said sept 11 
mosbacher said that for months he was prepared to recommend that 
the bush administration loosen tax and antitrust laws to jumpstart 
private american industry efforts to compete with europe and japan 
to build hdtv which promises motionpicture clarity and compact 
discquality sound 
commerce department officials first promised congress they would 
unveil the government plans for hdtv by midsummer and later by the 
end of the year 
now the administration official said the hdtv initiative is on 
hold 
advocates of hdtv say it could revitalize a moribund us 
electronics industry and have important applications in medicine 
defense and other industries 
it is envisioned as a 20 billion industry by 2000 and would be a 
technology driver for industries such as computer chips 
the american electronics association has asked congress for more 
than a billion dollars in development money for hdtv and several 
bills are pending in congress that would provide taxpayer money to 
spur the industry 
but a congressional budget office report last month said hdtv 
claims were very optimistic and that even under the rosiest of 
scenarios hdtv sales would be small relative to other electronic 
equipment markets

iman batal now a refugee 25 miles 
from her home in beleaguered beirut clustered her whimpering 
hungry children around her beside their makeshift tent 
we only eat meat in our dreams she said 
a pot of potatoes boiled on an open fire their only food this 
day in their new life on a bank of the awali river in southern 
lebanon 
like tens of thousands of other beirutis who have fled their 
homes in six months of fierce shelling between christian and syrian 
forces mrs batal her husband ahmed and their nine children aged 
1 to 10 live handtomouth in squalid camps of ragged tents 
fashioned from blankets and plastic sheets in southern lebanon and 
the mountains northeast of the city 
the batals are sunni moslems from one side of the green line that 
divides beirut into moslem and christian sectors 
elie haddad and his family are christians from the other side of 
the line 
the haddads have been living for four months in a shelter made of 
nylon sheets cardboard and tree branches at a camp near the st 
sharbel maronite catholic church in the mountains 
haddad his wife ilham and their five children aged 4 to 11 
watched helplessly as their shelter on a rockstudded hillside 
overlooking vineyards was battered by unseasonal torrential rains 
what are we going to do when the rainy season starts mrs 
haddad lamented 
police estimate that around 135 million of beiruts 150 million 
people have abandoned their homes in the shellbattered city over 
the last few months fleeing the battles in which more than 900 
people have been killed and 2680 wounded 
many refugees have moved in with relatives and friends or rented 
apartments or anything they can find in southern northern or 
eastern lebanon rents have soared 
but an estimated 35000 people like the batals and the haddads 
are living as squatters in mosques churches schools empty 
buildings and in the fields 
the haddads fled from their home in the ashrafiyeh neighborhood 
near the green line because their apartment block had no bomb 
shelter 
now were refugees in our own country said haddad 
despite their parlous situation the haddads and other christian 
families around the church at innaya are better off than many other 
refugees the church has provided fresh water some food and outdoor 
sanitary facilities 
haddad is a police officer who works every couple of days which 
means he is paid regularly and can buy food and other essentials 
ahmed batal on the other hand is penniless he lost his job at 
a tile factory four months ago when it closed because it had lost 
electric power and so few employees were showing up anyway due to 
the shelling 
weve sold our washing machine the television set and the 
refrigerator to buy food mrs batal said weve nothing else to 
sell most of our belongings were smashed in the bombardment now 
the moneys run out 
the batals live with 1500 other beirutis on the banks of the 
awali river they fled the capital two months ago after their 
apartment in the ein mreisseh district of west beirut was hit by a 
155mmshell 
batal watches in despair as his children barefoot and wearing 
soiled tattered clothes go hungry in the miserable camp just north 
of the coastal city of sidon 
their most acute problem is the lack of potable water only one 
faucet is available for about 300 families 
there are no latrines some of the refugees use a rest room in a 
nearby gas station when the owners allow them 
the stench of garbage and other waste pervades the camp 
mrs batal said she has worn the same clothes she had on when she 
fled beirut 
i take a bath fully clothed in the river she said 
health is a problem 
the conditions in camps likes these have caused skin 
diseases said michel dufour chief of the international committee 
of the red cross team in lebanon 
he said the red cross has supplied medicines to clinics in 
southern lebanon to treat skin problems among refugees 
the red cross also has handed out food parcels blankets kitchen 
supplies and cleaning materials to supplement aid from moslem and 
christian militias the exodus from beirut has sent prices in 
regions like southern lebanon soaring a tworoom unfurnished 
apartment in sidon south of the awali which rented for the 
equivalent of 50 a month before march now costs 400 
a bundle of 12 arabic bread loaves costs 2 double what it was a 
few months ago meat and vegetable prices have also doubled 
the influx of refugees has antagonized the people of the south 
mostly shiite moslems who have to pay the same inflated prices 
the conservative southerners are also offended by the miniskirted 
beirut women on the streets of sidon and tyre 
said abdullah a sunni clergyman in the village of mazboud 
declared these visitors must respect the social traditions of 
this region women must be decently dressed in line with moslem 
custom our young men are not accustomed to the way of life in the 
big city

gen michel aoun who serves as lebanons 
president and calls himself its savior works eats and sleeps in a 
command bunker two floors under a presidential palace crumpled by 
syrian artillery fire 
from there he holds out in the war of his christian forces 
against the powerful syrians and their allies pledging to save 
lebanon or whats left of it even if it means the destruction of 
beirut 
the syrians have made life unbearable for my people and im 
going to make life equally unbearable for them in lebanon he said 
in a recent interview in the bunker 
syrian artillery has systematically reduced the twostory hilltop 
palace in the christian suburb of baabda to wreckage since fighting 
erupted march 8 into another fierce round of lebanons 14yearold 
civil war 
the 54yearold general has rarely ventured out of the spartan 
bunker since he launched his war of liberation against the 
syrians 
aides say aoun a small pudgy man always clad in fatigues lives 
on a daily diet of beans rice and potatoes occasionally a steak 
he works an 18hour day rising every morning at 6am for a 
brief period of exercises 
his wife nadia and three daughters mireille claudine and 
chantal stayed with him in the bunker in the initial weeks of the 
fighting but he has sent them to the family home in the mountains 
for safety 
the generals critics call him napolaoun hinting that his 
lopsided war against the syrians who with their allies outnumber 
his forces by at least 3 to 1 stem from delusions of grandeur 
president hafez assad of syria his plan to pacify lebanon 
thwarted by aouns campaign angrily calls the christian leader that 
mad little general 
but to most of the 1 million christians trapped for the last six 
months in their enclave north of beirut by the syrians aoun is a 
hero 
they consider him the first lebanese leader to stand up to the 
syrians 
despite savage artillery battles in which more than 900 people 
have been killed and nearly 2700 wounded many of them christian 
civilians aoun is unbending in the belief that his crusade is right 
this war needs sacrifice and patience he said no one 
wages a war and promises paradise but i believe i have the support 
of the people 
a maronite catholic aoun is the lebanese army commander 
although fewer than half the armys 42000 soldiers support him 
most of the armys moslem units have defected and set up their own 
command but stayed out of the fighting 
about 10000 soldiers have remained loyal to aoun and he is 
highly popular with them 
he bridles at being called the christians leader insisting he 
is a national lebanese leader a patriot fighting for christians and 
moslems alike 
he notes with pride that his men include some 3000 sunni moslems 
aouns campaign has made him a prime target for assassination 
six lebanese were arrested in cyprus in may on a mission to shoot 
down his helicopter with missiles when he flew to the mediterranean 
island en route to an arab summit in morocco as it turned out he 
never left beirut 
aides say that aoun sleeps with a pistol under his pillow in his 
bunker and has a deep fear of car bombs a favored method of 
assassination in lebanon 
in 1983 unidentified gunmen shot up his motorcade wounding him 
in the head and arm the following year his men discovered a car 
bomb in beirut only minutes before his motorcade was due to pass 
one western military attache called him the best officer the 
lebanese army has ever produced 
while few question his courage in lebanons long civil war they 
say hes out of his depth in the world of politics but even moslem 
officers say aouns personal integrity is beyond reproach 
they noted that when the israelis moved into west beirut in 1982 
they asked him to send troops into the palestinian refugee camps of 
sabra and chatilla 
he refused the rightwing lebanese forces the christians main 
militia went in instead and killed hundreds of palestinians 
aoun always wanted to be a soldier he entered lebanons military 
academy when he was 20 and graduated three years later as an 
artillery lieutenant 
he was named army commander in june 1984 at the age of 49 the 
youngest since lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 
aoun was wounded three times in 198384 when as a colonel he 
commanded the strategic mountaintop town of souk elgharb southeast 
of beirut against syrianbacked militia forces who had driven the 
christians out of the mountains 
his men repulsed six major assaults losing 400 dead 
aoun had hoped that when he took on the syrians this time the 
united states would support him but washington has stayed on the 
sidelines 
the united states withdrew the last of its diplomats from beirut 
on sept 6 after aoun accused the americans of betraying him

just in time to serve as an antidote to the 
wave of sentimental reminiscence arising from the 50th anniversary 
of world war ii scholar paul fussell has written an angry book with 
this startling proposition 
the whole truth about the war is still not known and never fully 
will be known because it is too horrible to tell 
for the past 50 years the allied war has been sanitized and 
romanticized almost beyond recognition by the sentimental the loony 
patriotic the ignorant and the bloodthirsty writes fussell i 
have tried to balance the scales 
the result is wartime understanding and behavior in the second 
world war an iconoclastic opinionated and bitter rebuttal of the 
heroic version thats making the newspapers these days 
his book does not address the wars morality necessity or 
inevitability 
instead his purpose is to dig out the untold fragments untold 
because they were suppressed by propagandists and censors at the 
time romanticized by the survivors or still too discomforting to 
tell that make his point 
some of fussells truths 
wars are fought by boys innocent of lifes experiences 
boys who had never shaved machinegunned other boys creeping up 
with panzerfausts in their adolescent hands is fussells 
description of what world war ii combat sometimes came down to 
among the horribly wounded the most common cry was mother 
at the start men had to be 21 to be drafted but that soon 
dropped to 18 by late 1944 these boys were facing across the 
front the hitler jugend consisted of boys age 16 or 17 sometimes 
as young as 12 
death comes not as cleanly as the mind imagines soldiers are 
just as likely to have their belly blown open as to be shot neat 
clean and noble where the movies always have soldiers shot in the 
shoulder or the chest 
you would expect frontline soldiers to be struck and hurt by 
bullets and shell fragments but such is the popular insulation from 
the facts that you would not expect them to be hurt sometimes 
killed by being struck by parts of their friends bodies violently 
detached writes fussell 
in the face of such horror the distinction between friend and 
enemy vanishes and the violent dismemberment of any human being 
becomes equally traumatic 
homefront propaganda to the contrary allied troops were not 
the best armed in the history of warfare 
they knew that their automatic rifles world war i vintage 
were slower and clumsier and they knew that the germans had a much 
better light machine gun they knew that their own tanks both 
american and british were ridiculously underarmed and 
underarmored so that they were inevitably destroyed in an open 
encounter with an equal number of german panzers and they knew 
that the greatest single weapon of the war the atomic bomb 
excluded was the german 88mm flattrajectory gun which brought 
down thousands of bombers and tens of thousands of soldiers 
far more often than is known soldiers are killed by blunders on 
their own side hushed up to preserve homefront morale 
fussell devotes a chapter to such disasters telling for 
example how nervous navy gunners shot down 23 planes carrying 
paratroopers of the 82nd airborne division during the invasion of 
sicily 
a canadian soldier tells of an american who confused him for the 
enemy at normandy and wouldnt stop firing its him or me so i 
shoot that boy even though i know hes a yank poor bugger a 
corporal from some texas outfit 
after the normandy landing the americans ordered up a round of 
bombing to soften nazi fortifications inland accidentally american 
planes dropped their bombs on american lines killing 25 the next 
day the american line was secretly pulled back to avoid a disastrous 
repeat this time the planes killed 110 gis and a general 
fussell quotes an eyewitness 
some enraged american units opened fire on their own aircraft 
a notuncommon practice among all the armies in normandy when 
suffering at the hands of their own pilots 
so much for precision bombing or its latterday equivalent in 
vietnam or libya the surgical air strike 
fussells book is going to displease some who would prefer to 
remember the courage and forget the carnage 
his own biography denies such critics ammunition the author is 
professor of english literature at the university of pennsylvania 
but more pertinently was a young army lieutenant in the 103rd 
infantry division in france in world war ii he was severely wounded 
in combat 
the war that author studs terkel calls the good war is his 
war too but his word for it is stupid 
the terrible fact he says is that military successes are 
achieved only at the cost of insensate violence and fear and agony 
with no bargains allowed

at 6 am one recent thursday soun 
sundary gentle and serene at 21 gave birth to her first child and 
held her up to a cambodia that has known only war for two decades 
i dont know about the future whether there will be peace or 
not she said as the sun shone into her hospital room after days 
of monsoon rains 
she and her husband soun rithy 25 have spent most of their 
lives with their tragic nation in turmoil and mass deaths the 
civil war of 197075 the fanatical communist khmer rouge rule of 
197578 and the fighting since vietnam invaded in late 1978 
seven members of their two families died in the murderous scourge 
of the khmer rouge who defeated a prowest government in 1975 
the couple and their daughter are likely to see more killing in 
the years ahead even though the vietnamese are pulling out 
rithy had come to phnom penh for the birth of his child but is 
returning to southern koh kong province where he has fought as a 
government soldier for seven years against the khmer rouge and other 
guerrillas 
peace talks in paris have collapsed vietnams pullout due to be 
completed sept 26 will leave the vietnameseinstalled communist 
government in phnom penh facing the guerrillas alone in what could 
be the wars most chaotic and violent phase 
we would like to have peace really vice premier kong samol 
said in an interview for almost 20 years our people have known 
more about killing and war than peace 
most feared is the possibility that vietnams pullout will allow 
the return of the khmer rouge the black pajamaclad fighters who 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and slave 
labor camps after they took over in 1975 
the government claims the army will have no problems handling the 
guerrillas 
many others do not feel as confident 
some phnom penh residents have been stocking rice in case 
supplies are cut off by escalating fighting said khieu kanharith 
editor of the governmentsponsored weekly kampuchea 
some senior government officials have told western aid workers 
they are saving money in case they have to flee 
they dont know what is going to happen after september if 
there are problems with the khmer rouge one aid worker said 
they believe if there are problems the first problems would be 
for them 
at kompong chhnang just north of phnom penh maj chhour 
chandoeun the provincial military commander said his nine 
battalions are hard pressed in their fight against the 300 khmer 
rouge guerrillas in the area 
they dont stay in one place and we dont know all their hiding 
places he said 
an aid official said the governments military draft appears to 
be widening a few months ago some parents forbade their sons to 
leave the house as overzealous recruiters yanked men off the 
streets some youths flee to the border with thailand only to be 
rounded up by the guerrillas for service 
a 10 pm5 am curfew was lifted in april but the climate of 
war still pervades this riverside capital 
in july authorities closed dance halls that had been packed 
nightly since they were permitted to open last year mayor thong 
khong blamed drunken quarrels and said only the rich could visit 
them anyway 
at that time there was increased fighting at the border and it 
was difficult to justify the sacrifice at the border and the good 
life in phnom penh one foreignaid official said 
for many years popular support for the vietnamesebacked 
government had stemmed mostly from its being the only alternative to 
the khmer rouge with vietnams pullout phnom penh extended 
economic reforms to include a freeing up of private trade in an 
effort to raise primitive living conditions 
ironically it created a new security problem by worsening 
corruption among officials and corruption was a factor that helped 
the khmer rouge topple lon nols prowest government in 1975 
the reforms reduced somewhat the gulf between the people and 
their leaders but in addition to the fear of more war remains the 
widespread fear of the authorities and the police who are 
thought to be everywhere

help wanted 
for the first time since mexico plunged into an economic crisis 
in 1982 and a little more than nine months into president carlos 
salinas de gortaris term the signs are going up outside plants and 
factories scrambling for workers 
two years ago it was hard for someone over 35 to find a job 
now were placing people as old as 50 said tomas acosta head of 
the placement service for monterreys national federation of 
independent unions 
bacilio ortiz personnel manager for a contractor building 
monterreys first subway said he had to go into the countryside to 
find workers 
were looking for people that will do hard work he said 
there are people here but they prefer to work inside where its 
air conditioned 
oh theres work said rosa maria garcia who runs a small 
meat market in a working class neighborhood but many people still 
cant make it 
she said the average consumer is still living with the economic 
crisis still buying less meat cheaper cuts or stretching it in 
stews 
the average workers buying power is still 50 percent below what 
it was in 1981 the year before the collapse and prices are going 
up despite a wage and price freeze 
nevertheless positive signs have come with figures that 
indicated mexicos gross domestic product the value of its goods 
and services was up 24 percent in the first part of 1989 over the 
same period last year and that industrial production grew 47 
percent through may 
salinas administration had cautiously predicted annual growth 
would reach about 15 percent while some independent analysts 
predicted 1 percent growth at best but now analysts are projecting 
1989 annual growth in the same range 22 percent to 24 percent 
its begun to neutralize the crisis said jorge mancilla 
director of economic studies for the nuevo leon state chamber of 
industries in monterrey which is 100 miles south of the texas 
border 
what some analysts are calling the miniboom of 1989 would 
have been viewed as sluggish by the standards of 1981 the last year 
of a boom that saw 8 percent annual growth rates fed by skyrocketing 
oil revenues 
the principal motor back then was the excess demand of the 
public sector there isnt that right now said everardo elizondo 
general director of the economic forecasting firm index 
but in a country that has lived through eight years of hardship 
a foreign debt that topped 107 billion tripledigit inflation 
shrinking economic output plummeting oil prices plummeting 
salaries plummeting consumer buying power even minimal growth is 
raising eyebrows 
nobody knows for certain why the economy grew so fast at the 
beginning of 1989 it wasnt forecast said elizondo 
acosta said he has the answer theres a feeling of confidence 
again he said it has to do with the attitude of the 
government 
salinas has stepped up economic measures initiated by his 
predecessor miguel de la madrid most notably the opening of the 
economy to imports salinas has said his greatest achievement so far 
is a renewed spirit of confidence 
driving to reach a 6 percent annual growth rate by the end of his 
term and create an economy that can provide jobs for 1 million new 
workers a year salinas has sold off inefficient stateowned 
companies taken decisive action to fight corruption and union 
featherbedding and pushed to encourage new investment by both 
mexicans and foreigners 
in nine months we have a new foreign investment law 
transporation has been deregulated the financial system has been 
deregulated the economy is being reprivatized said mancilla 
these are giant steps toward modernization 
economic indicators from the first half of 1989 demonstrate a 
tendency for sustained moderate growth he said 
exports of manufactured goods hit a record 5 billion through may 
4 times higher than in 1981 
the private sector has responded by increasing investments 
especially in machinery in order to compete with foreign imports 
and for many to enter the lucrative export market 
private investment was up 36 percent through may compared with 
the same period last year 
last year acosta received about 30 calls a month from companies 
needing workers and now he gets as many as 1500 
job applications have dropped by half he said 
it hasnt gotten to the point of 1981 but its going in that 
direction acosta said 
the demand for labor is beginning to drive the base salary up in 
many companies ortiz for example pays 10 percent above minimum 
for starting workers 
shelby theriot manager of a pipecontracting company said he 
had to offer 50 percent above the minimum to lure a primary school 
dropout from the underground economy to work as a messenger 
the underground economy now accounts for about 25 percent of 
gross domestic product up from 10 percent to 15 percent before 1982 
in many ways its more lucrative to have a stand at a flea 
market than being on salary said mancilla 
but the mini boom has not trickled down to people like 
44yearold mario figueroa who dropped out of school after the 
fourth grade 
he earns 30 percent above the minimum wage the equivalent of 
about 30 a week but with three schoolage children at home he 
said its very difficult to live 
still figueroa added that he was lucky to find a job working at 
a furniture manufacturer he had lost his old job at an 
airconditioning company when it was bought out 
in dollar terms due to the plunge in the pesos value the 
current minimum wage is less than half the 1981 wage 325 a day 
today compared to 750 at the height of the boom 
mancilla said theres no signs of a quick fix in consumer buying 
power 
the recovery in salaries could take until the next century 
he said

many hospitals are looking at new ways to care 
for acutely ill but ambulatory patients 
some have made arrangements with adjacent hotels and there is 
one out west that is considering revamping its parking lot to 
accommodate recreational vehicles where patients could live during

tom wasley is against alcohol he opened a little 
coffee shop with an innovation and found immediate success now 
it seems all his innovation has brought him is trouble 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the question before the court remains 
what is entertainment 
it is a subject discussed the livelong day in this gritty little 
town of 6700 in the pennsylvania hills especially over the plywood 
counter of dads coffee shop an unremarkable establishment in every 
respect save one at dads the waitresses who serve the coffee in 
styrofoam cups are naked from the waist up 
well not quite the law says they must wear what are called 
pasties tiny stickon things that glitter and seem to serve only to 
accentuate the obvious and dad says he insists on operating 
strictly within the law 
dad is thomas wasley jr a stout man of 46 with wirerimmed 
glasses thick black hair just going to gray and brown eyes that 
plead astonishment over the trouble that has befallen him 
wasley and his coffee shop came into prominence last may during 
a local election campaign as it happened which brought him more 
attention and customers than his small ads in the sports section 
of the scrantonian tribune ever produced 
i even got a call from a radio station in australia he was 
saying the other day over coffee i thought it was phony at 
first but it wasnt thats when i put up that map 
the map of the united states is about the only thing that 
decorates the pale walls of the coffee shop that and a bulletin 
board covered with newspaper clippings about the dispute over the 
meaning of entertainment a legend above the map asks how far did 
you come to dads pins are stuck in about a dozen states 
now business has fallen off from 500 or so customers a day to 
about 75 and the paper will no longer run dads ads 
people think im closed wasley said im struggling but 
im not closed 
not closed but subject to a fine of 500 a day since the city 
magistrate determined in a 13page decision rendered june 26 that 
dads coffee shop was providing live entertainment for which he 
needed a special permit under the zoning law 
wasley has appealed to a county court and says he will continue 
if necessary to appeal to higher courts on up the line 
the magistrate john ev pieski ruled that since the zoning 
statute did not define live entertainment he would use the 
dictionary definition the act of diverting amusing or causing 
someones time to pass agreeably 
that would apply to cheerful waitresses at dunkin donuts 
says wasley 
but argued the magistrate wasley advertised his waitresses not 
his coffee 
so do the places that advertise their waitressofthemonth 
instead of their food says wasley 
but when wasleys waitresses went from wearing swimsuits to 
baring their breasts ruled the magistrate the price of his coffee 
doubled to 2 a cup no refills a clear indication he ruled that 
wasley considered them live entertainment and waitresses only 
incidentally 
all price reflects is overhead you have to hire topless girls 
from out of town pay agency fees motel room costs that still 
doesnt mean they constitute live entertainment says wasley 
they dont sing or dance all they do is serve coffee 
the debate lingers on 
according to john maholic the borough president the dispute was 
more political than semantic if it were not an election year it 
would never have come up he argues 
the pot boiled over a few weeks before the may 16 democratic 
primary when a group of residents presented to the council a 
petition with 1100 signatures opposing dads or any other 
enterprise of obscene nature 
in a town of 6700 said maholic 1000 names is a lot of 
voters 
the resident who headed the petition drive frank siderowicz 
says there is nothing to the idea politics is involved 
it was a moral issue from the beginning he insists we 
collected those signatures outside our churches after services 
politics was never mentioned it was a coincidence that an election 
campaign was going on 
this is smalltown america a topless coffee shop doesnt fit 
dickson city is a small town all right but hardly typical of 
what the phrase usually conveys it abuts a string of similar 
communities just north of scranton suburbs really whose varying 
ethnic makeups reflect the immigrant groups who arrived here years 
ago to dig coal 
it is a town of seven churches and 15 taverns it also features a 
topless gogo joint the rose which is across the street from the 
borough hall and a porno shop on a major highway that cuts through 
town 
both of those places were objected to when they opened but for 
some legal reasons they were allowed to remain said siderowicz 
dads coffee shop was something we could do something about so we 
did

siderowicz says it was also coincidental that the committee he 
headed to collect the signatures was a group called democrats for 
good and honest government formed specifically to oust the 
incumbents and it did all three who were running including 
maholic 
i guess i wasnt the only loser wasley commented but if i 
were confronted with a petition like that outside of church with all 
those people standing around id have signed it myself 
apart from his current troubles tom wasleys career as a 
restaurateur has not always been placid 
he grew up in mayfield the next town over and in 1978 opened a 
shortorder restaurant it did well enough until two years later 
when an elderly customer mistook the gas pedal for the brake and 
drove his car through wasleys front window 
nobody was hurt but it killed my business for some reason 
people didnt want to come anymore 
so in 1985 he changed the operation he borrowed money put in a 
bar hired bands and stayed open until 2 am 
that he said was my idea of live entertainment and the 
results were terrible i had to break up three or four fights every 
night and i had 11 breakins the first year i started 1986 deep in 
debt and figured id have to shut down 
a friend of mine asked me if i ever thought of gogo girls i 
told him id never even seen one besides i couldnt see myself in 
the role im a guy with a mother who sings in the choir and says 
the rosary every night and a son in parochial school 
well i went with him to a gogo place in scranton and nothing 
i thought would happen happened it was great the girls joked the 
men behaved i went three more times after that and finally decided 
to try it 
i tore up the floor where i had had a pool table and used it to 
build a stage and hired two girls one for the afternoon and one 
for the evening no bands just records 
it was a success from the first day no fights everybody just 
having fun after two years i was finally back on my feet 
then one night i wasnt even there at the time a young guy 
had to be ejected he went out on the highway and was run over by a 
pickup truck and killed 
i swore right then i would never serve liquor again never ever 
thats when i got the idea for a coffee shop a nonalcoholic 
place where adults could stop in and chat over coffee no music no 
entertainment i opened last february and thought of it as an idea 
that might be copied all over the country 
you would miss dads if you didnt know where it was it is in a 
business complex just off main street but hidden behind a video 
store and a bank and squeezed between the wah yaon a chinese 
takeout joint and the my place pizza parlor wasley has a deal with 
the pizza parlor if one of his coffee customers wants a slice it 
comes via a passthrough cut in the dividing wall wasley jacks up 
the price a nickel and serves it 
the front windows of dads are curtained and on the front door 
also curtained is a sticker that says say no to drugs and 
alcohol a sign says must be 18 i card em says wasley 
the inside is well lit wasley did the carpentry himself a 
nondescript ushape counter surrounded by 30 nondescript 
plasticcushioned chairs the waitress one recent afternoon a 
blonde named natasha was not at all nondescript and was certainly 
diverting and seemed to enjoy chatting with the customers 
there were only four at the time all men in their 30s or 40s who 
managed not to stare one in fact was reading a newspaper natasha 
did not appear at all selfconscious the conversation was about the 
start of school natasha said she had just got her elder daughter 
enrolled in a school for kids with learning disabilities and was 
greatly relieved 
she also said with a sigh that she hoped business would pick up 
after 5 when the men got off work and were thirsty for coffee 
tips have been pretty scarce lately she said 
natasha are you entertainment 
not here she said i am at my other job i dance here all 
i do is serve coffee 
when wasley first opened dads the girls wore bathing suits a 
rumor got started probably by some of my former gogo customers 
that my waitresses were topless i decided if thats what they 
want why not 
tina wanis 20 who is wasleys fully clothed office manager 
points out there is good money in the topless business although she 
would never do it herself i just couldnt she said 
we pay our girls 10 an hour when we were going good they made 
another 50 to 60 on a sixhour shift in tips alone even for a 
slow waitress a 5 tip is not unusual 
but dads coffee shop certainly is it remains to be seen whether 
the idea will sweep the country

hes a biggerthanlife lonely man whose 
millions of dollars have allowed him an eclectic portfolio of 
amusements meet scott chinery who spent his youth building his 
body and approaches 30 with more toys than fao schwarz 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
never mind how scott chinery made his 
money consider instead that he claims the largest collection of 
precastro cuban cigars this side of havana 
he counts between 11000 to 12000 of them some 30 to 40 
different brands 
add to that about 100 guitars dozens of valuable watches 14 
expensive cars up to 3500 comic books including first editions 
of batman and superman and a batmobile and a batcycle with sidecar 
from the 1960s television series the latter two items cost him 
240000 but with batmania revived by the new movie he says hes 
been offered 2 million for the car alone he isnt selling 
in short scott chinery a multimillionaire by age 29 is larger 
than life 
in fact hes 6feet6 inches tall weighs in at 275 pounds 
shaking his hand is like grabbing hold of a small ham 
hed be smaller today but as a kid he wanted to be bigger and a 
college football coach told him steroids would do it he quickly 
added 25 more pounds of muscle to an already impressive frame 
thats how he made his money selling what he calls a safe 
alternative to steroids to others who like him want to be bigger 
than nature intended 
the batmobile investment brought him fame faster than steroids 
put muscles on a 98pound weakling 
want to go for a ride in the batmobile he offers you can 
be robin 
a visitor to his palatial garage has to step past the bentley 
convertible the rollsroyce the lamborghini countash and the 1958 
thunderbird before getting to the sleek black piece of television 
americana 
the bentley incidentally sports a 40000 sound system the 
floor strewn with compact discs including his favorites the judds 
im in love with naomi judd he confesses the rest of his cars 
a mint condition 1962 vw bug and a 1961 corvette among them are 
warehoused 
the batmobile chinerys prize possession still bears its 
gotham city license plates its sister vehicle the only other 
in existence remains impounded in australia where it was involved 
in an accident 
but at the risk of disappointing middleage bat fans the 
batmobile is a stretch thunderbird 14 inches longer laden with 
what are nothing more than bat props 
the red bat phone is just a metal facsimile held to the holder by 
a magnet the bat chute is just a red button so are the bat ram 
the bat ray the bat scanner the bat detectascope and the 
automatic tire repair 
its a virtual bat sham only the television works and its 
blackandwhite 
new york developer donald trump called one day to ask for a ride 
in the batmobile and chinery agreed to a three block spin from the 
plaza hotel to the trump tower providing trump returned the favor 
with a ride in his helicopter 
as they soared over manhattan chinery recounts he said ill 
show you what i own promptly pointing out just about everything 
in sight 
now chinery is ready to roll but the batmobile is out of gas he 
runs down the battery trying to start it 
like a kid with lots of toys but a short attention span he moves 
on to other pursuits and asks his aides to push it out of the 
garage pump some gas and give it a jumpstart from the batcycle 
a ruthless practical joker chinerys home security system has 
one camera trained on the front door to torment visitors he can 
hit a button next to his desk and spray the unsuspecting callers 
with water 
for his daughters first birthday he ordered a fullfledged 
circus for the back yard

at the end of a national television interview chinery in the 
midst of a divorce confessed that being young and rich can get 
lonely and what hed really like to collect is a kind and loving 
wife 
he received more than 24000 calls on a tollfree line callers 
were asked to send letters and pictures and 12000 did chinery 
talked to 1200 of them by phone and had dates with 34 hes dated 
three of them more than once 
his office is cluttered with the guitars one belonged to rock 
star rick derringer and another to eric clapton and he collects 
antique carnival games a wooden uncle sam invites shake with 
uncle sam only one cent he will tell you the strength of your 
grip 
but chinerys penchant for adolescent pursuits ends when he talks 
about steroids 
he said he and others he knew often took massive doses downing a 
half bottle of black market steroids at a time 
they were being misused then more than now even though theyre 
more widely used now he said 
normally easygoing he recalls bouts of roid rage an 
uncharacteristic urge to destroy that often strikes steroid users 
when a neighbor in his college dormitory refused to turn down his 
music i ripped the sheetrock down but i couldnt fit between the 
rafters i went around through the door and then i pushed him 
through the ceiling 
the steroids wreaked havoc on his body he landed in the 
hospital ended a promising football career and dropped out of 
college 
chinery came back with a vengeance after spending years 
researching safe alternatives to steroids he marketed his product 
called cybergenics and quickly built a multimilliondollar business 
he started out as a shoestring mailorder operation now he 
markets his product through 2000 retail outlets in several 
countries he sells a sophisticated blend of amino acids and a 
protein supplement along with a workout guide and video sort of a 
jane fonda of bodybuilding 
he lists a litany of nasty side effects that steroids can cause 
liver damage kidney damage hair loss enlarged breasts impotence 
high blood pressure and he campaigns actively against them 
a handful of bodybuilding authorities say chinerys product is a 
useful alternative to steroids 
dominic certo former vice president of the international 
federation of body building and a former mr north america said the 
results at gyms have been good 
i couldnt say scientifically that theyre as effective as 
steroids i could say theyre the best alternative to taking 
drugs certo said 
robert kennedy publisher of the torontobased muscle mag 
international agrees 
it doesnt work like steroids kennedy says steroids work 
like a kind of magic theyll kill you of course but the steroids 
will give you immediate size within a day or two the muscles just 
become rock hard and people get hooked on them 
chinery knows the market he is appealing to is a vulnerable one 
these people out there are so impressionable and so motivated 
motivated to the point of obsession he says 
these days chinery is flexing his financial muscles in other 
ventures 
hes taken up charitable causes working with epileptics and 
terminally ill children 
he couldnt find a decent car stereo store so he opened his own 
and installed a 40000 sound system in his bentley 
he loves a good cigar so he markets his own line 
as he pulls out of his house in the bentley some teenage girls 
are parked out front 
hi scott they say in unison 
theyre not groupies shrugs chinery ive got lots of 
groupies but unfortunately theyre all skinny guys who want to be 
big

hes an opera tenor from oklahoma who paid his 
dues in europe now at age 37 chris merritt is on the verge of 
achieving fame here in a field that has been dominated by europeans 
but it has required years of hard work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
move over placido domingo and luciano pavarotti 
the next big name among operatic tenors may be as american as chris 
merritt 
while singers like other entertainers dont like to discuss 
their income it is generally believed that the 37yearold merritt 
is paid more for an opera performance in europe than either domingo 
who is spanish or pavarotti who is italian 
critics and audiences have been enthusiastic 
the career of merritt a native of oklahoma city who can sing a 
high c and go on up to a d began blossoming in europe just as a 
revival of gioacchino rossini operas began sweeping across the 
continent 
rossini operas need merritts kind of high flexible voice a 
tenor counterpart to the coloratura soprano 
i was basically what people were looking for says merritt 
who has sung 17 roles in 14 rossini operas 
hell make his debut at the metropolitan opera a year from this 
fall in rossinis semiramide starring mezzosporano marilyn 
horne both of them are american singers who paid their dues in 
europe 
miss horne says that merritt can become famous if he wants to 
but operatic fame requires both voice and promotion 
both luciano and placido have worked very hard at being 
famous she says they also had the goods 
chris has so many offers to keep his sanity right now is the 
main thing hes singing in the bigger houses he has records coming 
out that will certainly fan the flame if he wants to become famous 
he certainly has the possibility he really is top of the line now 
merritt says fate an important ingredient in opera plots played 
an important role in getting him where he is now 
his parents whod been through the depression and who had a 
high sense of the beautiful provided violin lessons for their 
daughter and acting lessons for their older son then both needed to 
get regular jobs 
by the time chris arrived 26 and 18 years younger than his 
siblings the family was better off financially he studied piano 
art and dance and his parents could afford for him to pursue the 
arts 
he attended an oklahoma city school with one of the citys best 
choral programs in the eighth grade he applied to play piano for 
the boys chorus but the director found a girl for that job saying 
he needed boys who could read music as singers chris merritt had 
never sung he discovered he loved it 
when merritt went to oklahoma city university he says i had a 
vague idea what opera was 
a friend urged him to buy joan sutherlands art of the diva 
recording he was instantly hooked on bel canto which means 
beautiful singing and was the style composed by rossini bellini 
and donizetti in the early 19th century merritt didnt dream hed 
make his chicago lyric opera debut opposite dame joan in donizettis 
anna bolena 
he stretched his stay in college to eight years studying all the 
time with inez luncefordsilberg not a teacher who rushes into 
developing a pupils top money notes she at first let merritt 
sing in only two octaves one above and one below the middle of his 
register 
her emphasis was on trying to find the most natural and thus 
the most beautiful way of singing on producing sound that was the 
healthiest for the physical vocal instrument he says 
after a year and a half she let me do my first aria one from 
faust that had a high c id heard that the tenor high c was next 
to impossible i had a feeling of foreboding about trying it it 
came surprisingly easy for me 
merritt met a mezzosoprano joan coplan at college and they 
fell in love after breaking up at one point they were married in 
1978 the year he graduated from college they have a daughter 10 
and a son 9 
joan coplanmerritt resumed vocal lessons last year and is now 
auditioning to start her career 
merritt had sung during the summers at the santa fe operas and 
wolftraps apprentice programs where american opera company heads 
go to hear newcomers none of them approached him so he went to 
europe and auditioned for opera companies in salzburg austria and 
basel switzerland both offered contracts and he signed for three 
years in salzburg which planned rossinis the italian girl in 
algiers for opening night 
after salzburg he spent the next three years in augsburg west 
germany after that he was well enough known to join the 
international star circuit 
in 1984 the merritts moved to baltimore so their children could 
attend school there 
the 6foot2 tenor currently is dieting on orders of his doctor 
who found he had high blood pressure this summer 
my first step into the big arena of opera is how merritt 
describes his 1981 debut with the new york city opera in bellinis 
i puritani 
his wife read that beverly sills was looking for american singers 
whod had to go to europe to sing opera he wrote to her and after 
some mixups auditioned for her in munich west germany she offered 
a part in puritani 
the metropolitan opera was planning a production of puritani 
with joan sutherland and invited merritt to audition but joan 
ingpen then in charge of met casting turned him down i forgot 
about the met for a while merritt says 
in 1983 marilyn horne who played a major part in the rossini 
revival was to sing in three rossini operas in concert form at 
carnegie hall impresario mathew epstein suggested to her that she 
hear merritt 
merrit went to venice italy to sing for her and she took me 
under her wing as someone she wanted to present to the operatic 
world 
merritt made his carnegie hall debut in tancredi with miss 
horne and appeared with her in rossini operas in hamburg west 
germany londons covent garden san francisco and los angeles 
if i believe in somebody ill stick my neck out for them 
miss horne says hes an easy one to stick your neck out for

it took a lot of hustle by a group of connecticut 
parents but the national little league organization finally 
sanctioned a baseball program for handicapped youngsters similar 
leagues have now been formed in towns in texas kentucky and 
massachusetts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there were no hits no runs and no errors 
but what made a recent baseball game perfect was that there were no 
losers 
thats just the way they like it in the norwich little leagues 
special needs program which was launched last year for disabled 
youngsters between the ages of 6 and 15 
although it may not be as competitive as some of the other 
leagues that is not the issue says julie sage of norwich whose 
7yearold son plays in the league we never dreamed our kids 
would have been able to play in anything like this 
during one recent game alfred aj jonasch iii 15 who has 
downs syndrome pounded his glove and pawed the infield dirt with 
his cleats as he shouted at his teammates to get down on the 
ball 
at the plate 7yearold sam sage who has spinabifida took a 
lefthanded cut at the ball knocked it off the tee a short distance 
from the pitchers mound and then spun his wheelchair toward first 
base 
i like to bat bat bat sage said later 
the two are among the 25 boys and girls who play in the league 
every sunday morning on fields shared with the girls softball 
leagues like alfred and sam most of the players have downs 
syndrome or spinabifida a malformation of the bones in the spine 
under league rules batters hit the ball off a 3foot tee and run 
base paths that are a few feet shorter than the little league 
distance of 60 feet they also use a ball that is softer than the 
typical little league hardball 
in addition scores arent kept and outs arent recorded each 
team bats its entire lineup and then takes the field each game is 
played for about an hour with no set number of innings required 
allowing the handicapped youngsters a chance to toe the rubber 
and dig in at the plate was what norwich little league president 
james b rusiecki envisioned when he first began putting the league 
together in 1986 
they have just as much enthusiasm and heart as any of the kids 
playing ball says rusiecki a supervisor at a norwich naval 
products company why should a child have to stay home because he 
or she may not be as good as anyone else 
rusieckis proposal born from the desire of some parents to give 
their handicapped children a chance to play ball did not become a 
reality without a fight 
the board of directors of little league baseball inc the 
national organization rejected the proposal for a specialneeds 
program in february 1987 and refused to sanction it citing 
insurance problems and the possible need for professional educators 
it was only after a similar league in brockton mass threatened 
legal action that little league officials relented and granted 
norwich a charter as a pilot program in february 1988 
the national organization based in williamsport pa earlier 
this year launched a challenger division for handicapped youngsters 
between the ages of 6 and 18 the new divisions structure was based 
on the findings of a challenger division task force headed by us 
sen robert dole rkan which conducted a twoyear study 
steve d keener a spokesman for the national organization said 
leagues also are operating in bristol conn spring texas 
louisville ky and brockton mass 
we just wanted to give handicapped youngsters the same 
experience of playing little league baseball keener says 
a number of parents pushed for the creation of a league like the 
parents of other little leaguers they give up their sunday mornings 
to watch their sons and daughters play ball some serve as player 
assistants instructing youngsters on bases and in the field 
i think its a good idea for the handicapped to get an 
opportunity to play says kenneth patrick as he stood behind first 
base giving a mixture of encouragement and instruction to his 
7yearold daughter rose one of his three mentally retarded 
daughters that play in the league im all for it 
the support the league has gained both from parents and the local 
businesses that sponsor teams and donate equipment has led some 
league officials to seek expansion next year 
gary mathieu an orderly at seaside regional center in waterford 
who helped put the teams together last year said the league hopes 
to expand to four 5player teams next year and create a division 
for 16 to 18 year olds 
the goal mathieu said is to make the program more competitive 
and more in line with the traditional game of hits runs and errors 
smaller teams also allow for more individualized attention he says 
each child would have a coach and they could become more 
active he says we would like to teach the difference between a 
fair ball and a foul ball and keep scores of the games right now 
they are both winners and there are no losers 
barbara m sullivan a norwich physical therapist who helped 
start the league and serves as its technical adviser says the 
program should expand to create integrated teams those mixing 
handicapped and nonhandicapped players she tried to start an 
integrated team for 4 to 6 year olds in the norwich tball league in 
1982 but was turned down 
this is just a foot in the door says sullivan who operates 
the norwich rehabilitation center we would not like to have a 
separate league but eventually integrate some players into the 
regular team system 
but many of the youngsters are not worried about the score or 
even winning or losing they frequently exchange greetings when they 
reach base and seem just as interested in socializing during the 
onehour games as playing 
i like playing but i also like being with the kids says 
12yearold lucy waters of montville shyly pulling her red sox cap 
down over her eyes

elizabeth taylor sees no parallel between her 
own life and that of the woman she portrays in a new television 
version of the tennessee williams play sweet bird of youth 
in the movie to be shown on nbc on sunday taylor plays princess 
alexandra del lago a faded movie star seeking solace in booze 
drugs and affairs with young men 
during a rare interview at her belair home taylor is asked if 
she ever considered that she might be compared to alexandra 
that never occurred to me she says lounging on a couch in a 
purple gown with her bare feet tucked beneath her were both 
actresses she believes her career is over ive never felt that 
shes a desperate lady my desperation if ive ever had it had 
nothing to do with my career 
after a long pause she looks up from a cup of tea and adds 
other people may draw comparisons because were both actresses 
her black hair is done in a hairdo with lots of spikes her 
complexion is darker than it appears on screen and she apparently 
has gained a few pounds since her famous weight loss but her violet 
eyes are luminous probing mesmerizing 
typically she refuses to discuss her private life her many 
marriages and divorces her lifethreatening illnesses and her 
problems with drugs and alcohol 
currently unmarried taylor has been romantically linked in 
recent months to millionaire publisher malcolm forbes they have 
been frequently seen together and last month she was hostess of 
sorts at his 2 million party in morocco 
taylor says it took her 30 years to grow into the role tennessee 
williams always wanted her to play in sweet bird she was only 
27 when the playwright created alexandra 
he wanted me to do this but i wasnt right for it until now 
says taylor who has had starring roles in four williams plays 
i love doing tennessee williams she says i love his way 
with words and language the way he has characters feed off each 
other and eat off each other his dark side is dramatic and there 
is a wonderful black humor in everything he writes 
now the age is right for me everything was just right if i 
had been thinner i would have had to put on weight my acting style 
is instinctive and i try to become the person im playing 
i found this part terrifying because of her sadness and despair 
and lack of control once i got started however i found it was 
easy and no longer frightening i loved doing this character 
taylors long association with williams began in 1958 when she 
played maggie the cat in the movie version of cat on a hot tin 
roof with paul newman and burl ives she was katharine hepburns 
mad niece in suddenly last summer which also starred 
montgomery clift she and her thenhusband richard burton made 
boom in 1968 the film version of the milk train doesnt stop 
here anymore 
sweet bird of youth made its broadway debut in 1959 with 
geraldine page as alexandra page also starred in the 1962 movie 
with paul newman as chance her latest and most dangerous conquest 
ed begley won an oscar for his role as boss tom finley 
mark harmon is chance in the twohour nbc version boss finley is 
played by rip torn who was tom finley jr on the stage and in the 
movie and was married to page michael wilding taylors son has a 
small role as a producer who tries to lure alexandra back to 
hollywood 
taylor was doing boom on location in sardinia when williams 
first suggested she do the role of alexandra she decided she wasnt 
right yet but in 1981 she considered doing it on the stage 
instead she did lillian hellmans the little foxes on broadway 
sweet bird of youth was later restaged in new york and london 
taylor says she saw alexandra as a very selfish and vain creature 
her saving grace is her sense of humor which she does have 
taylor says but in her selfishness which she does pull out of at 
the end because she really does care for chance she was quite 
singleminded in the beginning she was consumed with selfpity 
she takes this young lover and doesnt know who he is at first 
then she develops a real sense of compassion for him and realizes 
the terrible danger hes in she really tries to help him but hes 
bent on his own selfdestruction 
in recent years taylor has appeared on television more than the 
movie screen she scoffs at the idea that she might do a series 
however 
its simply too much work she says thats why i like 
television movies because theyre short then theyre over with my 
preference is to do only one thing a year 
her last feature film toscanini was released in europe but 
according to some reports may never open in this country she has 
appeared regularly in tv movies as well as the miniseries north 
and south and made guest appearances on the abc series hotel 
and the abc soap opera general hospital 
taylor spends much of her time promoting her perfume elizabeth 
taylors passion she says she chose its fragrance of oriental 
floral herself with the help of a french chemist she is also 
bringing out a mans cologne with a woodsy citrusy fragrance

the story of michael bennett is the story of the 
american musical theater during the last 25 years 
as a dancer choreographer and director bennett had an impact on 
broadway that still reverberates more than two years after his death 
from aids at the age of 44 
from his first appearance on broadway in 1961 in the chorus of 
subways are for sleeping to 1986 when he withdrew as director 
from the london production of chess bennett defined what it was 
like to make musicals move 
now his career has been dissected by ken mandelbaum in a 
chorus line and the musicals of michael bennett st martins 
press a detailed and fascinating new book about the mans career 
and the musicals he appeared in and helped to create 
mandelbaum a former brooklyn high school teacher columnist for 
theater week magazine and musical theater buff extraordinaire 
looks at all of bennetts shows from the more conventional efforts 
like promises promises coco and seesaw to his work on 
two sondheim masterpieces company and follies 
but the books centerpiece is an exhaustive examination of a 
chorus line the story of dancers auditioning for the chorus of a 
broadway show the musical is currently in its 15th year at new 
yorks shubert theater and will reach performance number 6000 
before the end of the year 
i always wondered why there wasnt a book on a chorus line 
either a big coffeetable script with lots of pictures or a book 
about the making of the show because it was such a unique process 
mandelbaum was saying the other day it revolutionized the way 
musicals were made 
the show was born of highly personal and painful revelations it 
was based on some 24 hours of tape recordings made by broadway 
dancers talking about their lives loves hates successes failures 
and what it was like to dance in the chorus of a broadway show 
mandelbaum painstakingly traces the musicals evolution it began 
with those first sessions initially proposed by dancers tony 
stevens and michon peacock and then embraced by bennett it looks at 
the development of the book by nicholas dante and james kirkwood and 
the music and lyrics by marvin hamlisch and ed kleban more 
important the author shows how the musical was shaped and honed by 
bennett in a series of workshops 
bennett didnt invent the idea of workshops many plays 
particularly offbroadway had been developed by that method but 
starting with a chorus line he used it to create musicals 
mandelbaums book is deliberately nonpersonal there are 
private even touching moments in it but the focus of the book is 
the work not the man 
his life was his art mandelbaum says i wanted to do a 
study of a career 
the author began the book in september 1987 two months after 
bennetts death he did a month or two of research mostly at the 
performing arts library at lincoln center and then took five or six 
months to conduct interviews more than 70 in all with people who 
had worked with bennett 
some of them like katharine hepburn who starred in coco 
declined to be interviewed so did many original cast members of a 
chorus line 
with four or five exceptions they were the most difficult to 
get to mandelbaum says some of them never really got over a 
chorus line it put them in a position that they really werent 
accustomed to and maybe they shouldnt have been in michael made 
them look like these fascinating people after that there was 
really no followup so it was hard for them to talk about it 
and because the book used their lives to a degree from the 
tapes they feel exploited by the show even though as you know 
michael gave them all royalties more than one of them told me we 
were exploited by that show and i dont want to be exploited 
anymore 
stardom has eluded all of the original cast members of a chorus 
line although many continue to work in musical theater 
none of them has had a role that showed them off the way that 
show did mandelbaum says i think what happened to those people 
is a perfect example of how hard it is nowadays to find steady work 
on broadway 
thats one reason why chorus line is so interesting its a 
show about broadway and dancers and performers and what happened to 
them is the whole story of broadway in that period 
mandelbaum never met bennett 
i came to think that was an advantage he says now i could 
listen to what everyone was telling me about him without any ax to 
grind or personal feelings to color it so when people told me the 
way he affected them both good and bad i could just sort of take 
it in 
but by the time i was finished with the book i did feel i 
really knew him 
one of the most intriguing aspects of mandelbaums book is his 
chapter on scandal the bennett musical that mighthavebeen 
the show which had a book by television writer treva silverman and 
music and lyrics by jimmy webb tells of one womans sexual 
liberation it never got beyond several workshop productions and was 
canceled abruptly in 1985 most think because bennett learned he 
was dying of aids 
i truly believe that scandal would have been fabulous 
mandelbaum says the staging would have been so unusual it had 
long 20minute sequences a lot like lady in the dark which were 
the womans fantasies 
the book of the musical is very funny and everyone insisted 
the choreography was the greatest of michaels career unbelievably 
beautiful aestheticlooking and pure his stuff was so moral and 
pristine that it made the sex and the wild and lewd comedy in the 
show work everyone connected with it insisted that the show would 
not have offended anyone it would have made them think about right 
and wrong 
whatever the promise of scandal it was never realized and 
bennett never staged another musical 
but the saga of michael bennett is not likely to end at least 
not in print more bennett books are in the making already out is 
the untold story behind the making of a chorus line bantam 
books by denny martin flinn a dancer who appeared in a national 
tour of the musical 
kevin kelly theater critic for the boston globe has the 
michael bennett story arriving from doubleday early next year 
next march will mark the appearance of on the line by robert 
viagas william morrow subtitled the creation of a chorus 
line it will be the memoirs of 19 original cast members of the 
longrunning show

king hussein is pushing jordan toward its 
first nationwide elections in 22 years an event that could 
transform a country crucial to the middle easts balance of power 
more than 1000 candidates are testing their chances for the the 
80 parliament seats at stake nov 8 as a push toward greater 
democracy and looser government control sweeps across the kingdom 
martial law has been in place since the 1967 war with israel 
people are hungry for elections for participation after a 
long absence said taher masri who resigned as deputy prime 
minister in august in order to seek a seat from amman active 
cabinet ministers are not allowed to run 
the new parliament will replace one originally elected in april 
1967 two months before the six day war with israel and then became 
largely ineffective the body was suspended by hussein in times of 
difficulty and then lost about half its membership when the king 
renounced jordans claim to the west bank last year no west bankers 
will be allowed to run for the new parliament and candidates who do 
run cannot do so under the banners of political parties which have 
been banned since an attempted coup in 1957 
the election however accompanies a basic change in the nature 
of the jordan itself 
husseins renunciation to claims to the west bank seized by 
israel in 1967 ended jordans main rivalry with the palestine 
liberation organization and helped accelerate a thrust toward 
settlement of the 40yearold arabisraeli conflict 
husseins hashemite kingdom of about 3 million people roughly 
half of them palestinians has now turned inward in a struggle to 
reform an economy saddled with 83 billion in debts a battle 
dramatized by widespread rioting in april against economic hardship 
and government repressiveness 
this is a turning point in our life candidate masri said 
the past era is gone and gone probably forever 
liberals like masri say the elections should lay the groundwork 
for a stable constitutional monarchy with a working parliament to 
thresh out grievances 
the outgoing 60member parliament was suspended in 1974 then 
revived in 1984 with a handful of local elections to replace 
members who had died 
hussein scrapped the parliament altogether last year as part of 
his renunciation of claims to the west bank the economic riots 
prodded the government to advance the date for the elections 
most previous parliaments were little more than 
governmentdominated talking shops but masri and other officials 
resigned from powerful posts to run in the elections indicating 
their faith that the new body will have a significant role 
skeptics fear however the voting could once again unleash 
radical emotions among frustrated palestinian refugees and 
unemployed youngsters like those who threatened to rip the kingdom 
apart in the late 1950s and again in 1970 
jordans ability to cope with change is vital to any arab peace 
with israel whose longest border is with jordan many in the 
kingdom still have family and economic ties with the occupied west 
bank and with the gaza strip which was administered by egypt until 
israel seized it in the 1967 war 
jordan is also a vital buffer between four strategic countries 
israel saudi arabia syria and iraq it separates the powderkeg of 
the arabisraeli conflict from the worlds main sources of oil 
the palestinian guerrillas who tried to topple hussein in 1970 
are today more allies than rivals and are taking a handsoff 
approach to the elections 
while roughly half of jordanians are from palestinian families 
many over the past 40 years have come to identify with jordan the 
only arab country to give them passports 
the royal familys descent from islams prophet mohammed has 
always helped blunt radical islamic dissent 
hussein has patched up his frayed relations with the conservative 
moslem brotherhood the countrys largest independent political 
force 
but some officials who use a widespread intelligence and police 
network to stifle radical dissenters remain concerned about 
potential islamic extremism 
the government does not feel secure enough to lift the ban on 
political parties or martial law even government critics are wary 
of too much change too fast 
laith shubeilat an independent islamic activist who heads the 
engineers association argued that no one is ready to make a 
dramatic change the change should be slow 
jordan was remarkably stable for most of the 1980s thanks to 
prosperity fed by income sent home by 350000 jordanian workers in 
the persian gulf and grants from oilproducing arab nations there 
falling oil prices squeezed that flow of money in recent years 
and jordan borrowed to keep up spending on arms and luxury goods 
the resulting debt crashed down on the country last year prices for 
imports soared as the dinar currencys value fell local wages were 
stagnant 
anger at rising prices and perceived government arrogance boiled 
over in april when riots erupted in the south the rural heartland 
of husseins support

hussein fired prime minister zaid rifais government and promised 
democratic reforms 
he staved off economic collapse by cajoling more than 350 
million in grants from alarmed persian gulf states and his 
ministers reached a series of debtrescheduling agreements with 
international lenders 
the dinar which plunged to 1 in july from a high of about 3 
early last year moved back up to about 150 
but economists say jordan faces years of austerity and high 
unemployment 
that is a dangerous prospect for an ambitious young generation 
whose europeanstandard educational level is one of jordans 
greatest assets 
hundreds of graduates many of them jobless line up daily 
outside the us embassy to apply for visas 
in maan where the economic riots broke out people interviewed 
recently said the edge had gone off their wrath although anger at 
the police remains 
the people are satisfied now said 26yearold aqab khatib 
son of a prominent clan leader 
the criticism that stormed around prime minister rifai 
occasionally crept upward to touch hussein crown prince hassan and 
queen noor who were accused of condoning government abuses and of 
wasting money 
despite frequent medical checkups the 53yearold monarch still 
appears vigorous in early september he set a course record in an 
automobile hillclimb and is seen repeatedly on television touring 
towns and military bases 
hussein has ridden out the middle easts turbulence and escaped 
several assassination attempts in 35 years on the throne 
but his health and survival remain constant subjects of 
speculation in a country so closely identified with its ruler 
political analyst rami khoury former editor of the jordan times 
said the country is on the verge of a new stage of political 
participation no matter who reigns 
husseins oxfordeducated brother hassan heir to the throne 
lacks the kings popularity but he has championed the sort of 
openness that reformers have demanded 
the only major power base that might challenge the monarchy the 
army remains fiercely loyal by all accounts 
the king has more time to cement that loyalty following his 
renunciation of claims to the west bank and his retreat from 20 
years as a starring player in frustrated arabisraeli peace efforts 
the 21monthold antiisraeli uprising in the west bank and gaza 
strip shattered the last vestiges of loyalties to jordan among the 
950000 west bank palestinians 
hussein cast their fate to the plo prodding that organization to 
declare a state roughly encompassing the west bank and the gaza 
strip and to meet us conditions for talks ending a 13year 
boycott 
yet jordan remains crucial to any settlement and the king holds 
the power to sway events 
americans and israelis want jordan as a watchdog over the 17 
million palestinians on the west bank and in the gaza strip to help 
prevent an independent palestinian state 
the plo proposes an eventual confederation of equals between 
jordan and that state israeli hardliners led by former defense 
minister ariel sharon want to make jordan itself a palestinian 
state an idea bitterly opposed by most jordanians and palestinians 
husseins nightmare is the call by some israeli radicals to push 
west bank palestinians into his kingdom swamping it with refugees 
for a third time to threaten the hashemite throne

dead calm warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
the sea can be sinister or serene for john and rae ingram its 
both 
after the death of their only child killed in a car crash that 
almost claims the mother as well the couple take to the high seas 
in their ketch to mend their emotions and soothe their lives 
they are becalmed somewhere in the pacific the movie is an 
australian production when they suddenly spot a dinghy whose 
passenger is frantically rowing away from a listing schooner 
this is the starting point for dead calm a thriller played 
out by only three characters with the sea as its only setting such 
containment can often stifle a film making it claustrophobic and 
slow here however the closeness adds to the storys inherent 
tension 
the stranger hughie warriner billy zane tells the ingrams a 
bizarre tale his shipmates have all died from food poisoning the 
engine and radio conked out and he was left with the corpses in a 
becalmed sea hence his manic behavior and eagerness not to go back 
to the ship 
john sam neill a naval officer doesnt believe him and rows 
over to the injured ship before leaving he tells rae nicole 
kidman to take the rifle out of a locker in the cockpit and to use 
it if necessary 
as john unravels the terror that happened on the schooner rae 
begins her own nightmarish journey hughie is a psychopath who has 
killed all on board the other ship he makes rae his captive and 
sets sail leaving john presumably to die 
for anyone who sails dead calm is a scary notion but it 
suffers from a flawed script why for example is it necessary to 
set up the story with the death of their child it is soon forgotton 
and serves no purpose other than to establish a lengthy holiday for 
the parents who could have taken the trip for any reason including 
a happy one and rae who is equally as suspicious of hughie does 
not immediately take out the rifle even though she constantly eyes 
the locker 
still the excitement is there as john uses his wits body and 
experience to get the schooner under way and to manually empty the 
bilge before the boat sinks 
nicole kidman a young australian actress offers a fresh 
sensuality she is determined and keeps her wits her final solution 
to the hughie problem is a great moment on film 
based on the charles williams book by the same name dead 
calm is produced by george miller mad max the witches of 
eastwick and directed by phillip noyce theres some excellent 
photography by dean semler of the waters off the great barrier reef 
as well as good sailing footage dead calm is rated r for 
violence nudity and a brief sexual encounter

tequila sunrise warner home vide vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
the los angeles horizon never looked so good as it does in robert 
townes tequila sunrise even on the small screen its amber and 
ruby glow inspires 
and thats the good news 
the bad news is that tequila sunrise crawls along with an 
excellent cast and a plot that could make a lot more than it does of 
drug dealing a romantaic triangle and a triplecross 
mel gibson once one of the citys top drug dealers has retired 
from the business much to the chagrin of local police authorities 
who will do anything to still nail him 
but no one really wants gibson to quit not the cops not his 
old contacts not his customers 
his old high school and surfing buddy kurt russell is a 
narcotics cop and hes out to get gibson anyway he can that 
includes luring michelle pfeiffer a restaurant owner he suspects is 
involved professionally and personally with gibson into bed 
then theres raul julia the bigtime mexican drug connection who 
poses as a top government crime fighter 
gibson finds himself in two triangles one with the ruthless 
julia on one side and russell and crooked federal agents on the 
other and one with russell and pfeiffer 
its a talky movie with little action but the cinematography is 
great 
the actors do their best with muddled characterizations gibson 
is likeable and watchable but needs more flesh in his dialogue 
russell is very gq pfeiffer is a beautiful understated class act 
 
as for the title gibson drinks a tequila sunrise orange juice 
lime grenadine and tequila every now and then in the movie so 
much for bartending 101

madrigals by sigismondo dindia claudio monteverdi chiaroscuro 
and london baroque directed by nigel rogers emi 
 
italian madrigals as an art form display perhaps the most perfect 
marriage of words and music they are poems in song in which 
musical notes paint pictures of language 
how particularly infuriating then that this otherwise excellent 
recording contains only a german translation of the italian text 
what about us englishspeakers not to mention french 
yet even those monolingual among us can generally recognize words 
such as crudel amore and morte we dont even need to 
know their meaning with the dramatic vivid interpretation by 
chiaroscuro the vocal ensemble consisting of tenor and director 
nigel rogers two sopranos bass a countertenor and second tenor 
their performance strikes a nice balance between the 
overhomogenized quality of some ensembles and the overwrought 
extradramatized readings of others 
this disc shows us music by one of the bestknown italian 
madrigalists monteverdi and the obscure dindia and presents them 
in two guises on the first half we hear the more familiar 
ensemblesung madrigal the second half contains music that points 
to opera works in which singers take on roles sometimes limited 
to two or three voices 
the high point of this disc is monteverdis hor chel ciel e la 
terra a stunning setting of a petrarch sonnet in the space of 14 
lines the music moves from a slow eerie opening to a series of 
loudly declaimed words to a florid rapid section and finally to the 
long beautiful cadence on the last word lunge emotions vary 
from word to word its as if the range of a threehour opera is 
compressed into nine minutes the performance is masterful 
for those familiar with this repertoire the presence of the 
rarely heard dindia who called himself the noble palermitano 
should prove welcome his musical language is simpler and less 
ornate his lines more extended

world in motion elektra jackson browne 
 
the album opens with a funky beat and jackson browne singing 
sun going down on the usa party time right lets dance after 
all the name of the song is world in motion 
but wait now we awake with a world at stake browne sings 
so this is not goodtime music its an entreaty to bmw owners 
brownes fountain of sorrow has become a mountain of fret it 
includes the homeless hunger and hatred gangs and greed war and 
weapons 
browne obviously reads the paper but the record exposes a 
certain naivete such as when he rails against the need for nuclear 
weapons on how long on the title cut he volunteers to help the 
world realize its potential 
still heart and sincerity count for something world in 
motion has plenty of both and musically the record is terrific 
anything can happen for example is one of brownes loveliest 
melodies chasing you into the light is a catchy rocker 
the final cut lights and virtue includes a sizzling guitar 
duel between browne and kevin dukes as well as the albums most 
assured lyric heres to truths yet to be known the search for 
things of your own browne sings 
on world in motion such abstract sentiments have the truest 
ring

smirks wisecracks lazy charm bruce willis 
calls them his tools what carried him through four seasons of 
moonlighting and last years hit action film die hard 
but the 34yearold actor is tired of just playing for laughs 
now thinking about how future audiences will remember him willis 
balances his admiration for the three stooges with a desire to 
portray enduring dramatic characters 
so he welcomed the chance to start from scratch with warner 
bros in country playing the troubled vietnam war veteran 
emmett 
i was pretty scared and i didnt really know if i could do 
it willis said in a recent interview 
look if i had done 4 years of a guy who was angstridden and 
was carrying around a lot of weight i would have waltzed through 
this thing but on each step i had to make sure i was taking the 
right step 
the boyish grin and urbane looks that willis had as david addison 
in moonlighting has disappeared for in country instead 
theres a fu manchu mustache long slickedback hair and a 
dull pained expression in his eyes fans may be shocked but willis 
sees it as part of his job 
thats what actors are supposed to be doing if youre not 
taking risks you might as well work in tv tv doesnt require you 
to take any risk thats why i went after this film he said 
i had just done 4 years of playing the same guy the same 
character i wasnt taking any risk at all i wanted to do something 
i wasnt sure i could do 
television is a bad memory for willis who insists only his 
contract kept him from leaving moonlighting after the second 
season he worried that the public would know him only for one role 
that his abilities would be eaten up from the demands of producing 
new material each week 
glenn gordon caron executive producer said after the first 
year wed come to a point where theres nothing left to say he knew 
even then it was bound to happen its a very cyclical thing 
willis said 
youre just pouring yourself into this thing i was concerned i 
was going to use all my stuff on this show that we were going to 
exhaust ourselves 
emmett was like an old friend for willis who met several vietnam 
vets while bartending in his native new jersey like sam emily 
lloyd emmetts teenage niece in in country who begs her uncle 
to talk about the war willis wanted to learn what happened in 
vietnam 
ive been researching this character for a long time he 
said i have always been fascinated with the war itself the 
effect it had on american guys i know what makes most of us what we 
are but i saw there was something different that they saw 
something there that freaked them out 
i found things i had no idea i was ever going to find i found 
out things about myself things about the vietnam war thats one of 
the really unique things about acting if you make yourself work 
hard enough in this direction youre going to find things you never 
heard of 
up to now his style has been patterned on the breezy detached 
leading men of 1930s and 40s romantic comedies actors such as 
william powell clark gable and especially cary grant 
hes the king willis said his comic timing was superb 
even in films that didnt do so well like arsenic and old lace i 
could never figure how he did it 
willis admired grants resourcefulness the way he gently 
manipulated the other characters in such classics as the 
philadelphia story and the awful truth he tried to use the 
same techniques in moonlighting playing off the straightlaced 
cybill shepherd 
i always thought if you could make somebody laugh you could 
get them off balance and if you could get them off balance you 
could get what you want from them he said 
while moonlighting drew on the snappy dialogue of grants 
movies in country was based on the spare language of bobbie ann 
masons bestselling novel willis credited director norman jewison 
moonstruck in the heat of the night with finetuning his 
character 
you cant play stoicism willis said you cant play 
somebody that sits there like a mope you have to have something 
coming out so much of what my character had to communicate in this 
film was done nonverbally 
personally and professionally hell be busy for the coming year 
willis is married to actress demi moore who gave birth to daughter 
rumer glenn during the filming of in country 
a sequel to die hard is planned and his second album if 
it dont kill you it makes you stronger comes out this fall 
willis also ponders life 
i think about dying he said 
what scares me most is dying before you get anything done im 
starting out with things that have some kind of longevity that will 
hopefully be around its something that outlasts you it does give 
you a little bit of immortality

at little orchestra society concerts the 
conductor wears a costume and gives candy cane batons to members of 
the audience so they can conduct as well 
the 60member society which celebrated its 40th anniversary last 
may launched its 41st season of childrens concerts this month 
music director dino anagnost calls it music for a visual generation 
the imaginative conductor acts as kind of an uncle often 
dressing up according to the theme he has chosen for a concert 
mixing fun with musical education 
i like kids he says i think theyre open to anything im 
not trying to get them to become performers the point is to get 
them to become an audience 
happy concerts for young people aimed at 6 to 12yearolds are 
held at the 2700seat avery fisher hall on saturday afternoons 
lollipops concerts for folks 3 to 5 are held at the 300seat 
florence gould hall of the french institute on saturdays and sundays 
the lollipops probably would sell out an even larger hall but 
anagnost wants the tots to be physically close to the orchestra 
anagnost who has led the little orchestra society for 10 years 
said the programs are conceived musically and then visuals are added 
we did the new york premiere of a zoo called earth by peter 
schickele better known as pdq bach its a wonderful score that 
he wrote for the st louis zoo we used huge puppets i think they 
used real animals he said 
its a story about a space man who comes to earth every few 
thousand years the creator of the hudson vagabond puppets picked 
the piece the puppets did a wonderful job of moving to the music 
this season the opera babar the elephant which the society 
commissioned from nicholas berezowsky will be presented in april 
each concert has a theme such as families of instruments in the 
orchestra and showing how the orchestra is used in other art forms 
such as dance mime or an artist who draws to music one concert had 
big apple circus clowns cavorting to music written for the circus by 
wellknown russian composers 
retired tennis champion billie jean king was guest on a program 
about sports in which baseball terms such as base pitch and 
players were applied to part of beethovens ninth symphony then 
king and anagnost who used a tennis racket instead of a baton to 
conduct hit tennis balls back and forth during music titled 
match point 
last year the group did a program on young mozart which 
anagnost conducted 
a young mozart came out in accurate dress the conductor 
recalled he sat down on stage with manuscript paper and a big 
quill pen by the time wed finish playing a movement hed have 
another variation written 
we had the queen of the night aria people said id lose the 
kids during that a little theatricality came into my head soprano 
ramona dorsey kept making wrong entrances interrupting my speeches 
shed ask if she could sing our mozart would say no i havent 
written you yet 
when she made her entrance at the end the kids listened to 
every note she sang and screamed bravo at the end 
it was educational and entertaining he said they saw a 
10yearold mozart knew he was a little boy and wrote music they 
listened to his music from a symphony an opera an overture a 
theme and variations and heard why and how he wrote them 
the little orchestra society tries to get children who are 
accustomed to mindlessly watching television to use their ears 
thats the reason anagnost started the lollipops series four 
years ago to start teaching children at an early age to use their 
ears and to enjoy live performances 
i select the music quality musical selections he said 
we design the programs to make it educational interesting and 
entertaining and we try to involve the children as much as possible 
in an active way sometimes we give out toy trumpets and they play 
along or i give them candy cane batons and they conduct with me 
pieces of music need to be short or excerpts anagnost says 
because of the short attention spans of youngsters 
some of the audience is what anagnost calls underserved 
chidren who cant afford tickets but whose attendance at final 
dress rehearsals is underwritten by a foundation and administered by 
the junior league id like to have them see an actual 
rehearsal he said and see how we put it all together 
the little orchestra society also presents six staged 
performances of amahl and the night visitors staged by 
composer gian carlo menotti in december at alice tully hall and 
it gives christmas and easter concerts at holy trinity greek 
orthodox cathedral 
the society has a record coming out next spring on the arabesque 
label it will include peter and the wolf narrated by maurice 
sendak who will draw the albums cover art gerald mcboing 
boing and a zoo called earth narrated by anagnost

tracing the jacksons history can be as simple as 
turning on the radio theres two decades worth of music i want 
you back to dancing machine to lovely one to the new 
nothin that compares 2 u 
and dont forget a few addresses like 2300 jackson street in 
gary ind where the family grew up 253 west 125th street the 
location of new yorks apollo theater or 2648 west grand boulevard 
in detroit once the home of motown records 
five talented ambitious kids jackie tito jermaine marlon 
and michael a demanding father and the great motown label helped 
lift the family from near poverty in the steel belt to swimming 
pools and luxury homes in california 
they take nothing for granted spending months in the studio to 
perfect their records and carefully avoiding uncomfortable topics in 
interviews legal battles family squabbles sister latoyas recent 
playboy photos 
jackie tito jermaine and younger brother randy jackson the 
groups current lineup are looking back now they call 2300 
jackson street their first album since 1984s victory a 
tribute to 25 years in sho300 jackson street written by

nieces and nephews 
we were recording another song and teddy coproducer riley 
was sitting at the piano playing his favorite jackson songs tito 
said one of the songs was thats what you get for being polite 
and we just started singing behind him 2300 jackson street 
all the kids were there we had to bring balloons and cookies 
and everything theres some little bitty ones that were running all 
over the place hitting the microphones

for some writers facts can be more deceptive 
than fiction just ask john gregory dunne author of the 
bestselling novels true confessions and the red white and 
blue 
his new book harp is a nonfictional account of travels 
family history and health problems but dunne admits that some 
dramatic restructuring has been performed events rearranged for the 
sake of a writers most sacred truth a better story 
thats why dunne insists harp was never really meant to be 
written its also why he includes disclaimers throughout invoking 
an authors privilege to reinvent history 
i was going to publish a book of essays with a longish 
introduction 5000 words said dunne whose wife joan didion is 
author of play it as it lays and a book of common prayer 
last spring i began writing this introduction and i got to 
6000 words rather quickly and kept on going it got bigger and 
bigger and longer and if i had conceived of it as a book i never 
would have written it 
when i got to about 100 pages which is approximately 2025000 
words my wife said this is a book 
reluctantly he agreed and eventually put enough material into 
his computer to fill 234 pages that may seem pretty modest for 
readers but as dunne wrote at the books conclusion and repeated in 
a recent interview a writers life is his capital and 50000 words 
is a substantial expenditure 
he also noted that material can come from anywhere dunne 
introduces one chapter with an unusual personal ad that appeared in 
the los angeles times to my comrades in the resistance concerning 
cheka occupation via mexico cheka has learned of our existence 
casual readers would chuckle slightly if they could be bothered 
to look at all but items like these are buried treasure for dunne 
what does that mean who would put that in you really indulge 
in something like that he said 
dutch shea began with a piece in the new york times i got 
sent several copies from various writers who said this is your 
material joyce carol oates is an inveterate reader of the little 
tiny filler items theres a lot of material there 
opinionated confessional and investigative dunnes writing 
incorporates the three ps that he said once provided escapes 
from the irish ghetto politics priesthood and the police 
a fourth p should be kept in mind performer thats how he 
sees himself and other writers reading a work by dunne is like 
having a man approach you at the bar slam his drink on the counter 
and tell his life story 
im interested in getting the characters voice the author 
said i was having breakfast with joan one morning and i came up 
with the first line of a monologue i went upstairs and i wrote it 
before lunch 13 pages for just one monologue 
in harp he challenges readers with detailed accounts of 
prostitutes family deaths and his own recent heart troubles 
dunne 57 noted that other authors of his generation philip 
roth reynolda price had also recently written about their private 
lives and offered his own theory why 
i say we have all had lifethreatening experiences philip just 
had bypass surgery reynolds price had cancer it makes one somewhat 
meditative he said didions multiple sclerosis is in remission 
my wife insists that its a product of good times and we never 
had a war dunne said philip and i were both in the peacetime 
army and because we didnt have a war to always fall back in there 
comes a time i should write something like this 
dunne was born in hartford conn the fifth of six children 
like authors john updike and w somerset maugham he was a stutterer 
and turned to the written word as a way of mastering language 
if you feel that you cant be a lawyer or a brain surgeon i 
think you begin to think about what you can do its interesting the 
number of devices people use to get by stammering you never stammer 
if youre singing for instance 
he graduated from princeton university in 1954 and worked five 
years as a staff writer for time magazine dunne married didion in 
1964 and was overshadowed by her until the publication of true 
confessions 13 years later 
a tough bleak account of a womans brutal murder and its 
connection to two brothers a policeman and a priest true 
confessions sold more than 1 million copies and was eventually 
made into a film starring robert duvall and robert de niro with a 
screenplay by dunne and didion 
writing has now become a fulltime job dunne said even when 
reading others admiration for an authors work gives way to 
curiosity about the methods used to produce it he cited updikes 
rabbit is rich whose title character runs an auto dealership 
rabbit is rich is an astonishing book dunne said i 
wonder how he found out so much about that toyota agency it was 
sublime you very seldom get to see in american fiction how people 
work you make them a lawyer or a writer 
writers read differently than other people they read at rather 
than read theyre interested in how it got there and how certain 
effects are done

merle haggard has the 501 blues blues 
501 blues the title track of the country stars newest 
album is a catchy uptempo number written by jeff tweel and michael 
garvin haggard likes the song just fine but says he recorded it 
against his will 
tree publishing owns the rights to 501 blues cbs owns tree 
publishing haggard records for epic records cbs owns epic records 
the singer insists he was pressured to do the song that his record 
company pushed it on him to get profits from the royalties 
a and r artists representatives people are supposed to be 
the gobetween for the company and the artist haggard said in a 
recent interview now theyre pitching songs it would be wise to 
use a tree song wouldnt it that happened to me on that very 
tune i was pitched a variety of songs and told in that raised 
eyebrow manner it will be wise to have you to do this 
fighting words from the singer of okie from muskogee the 
fightin side of me and most recently the antiflag burning me 
and crippled soldiers he owes cbs one more record but haggard 
in a measured threatening tone talked of suing to get out of his 
contract 
you get to a certain level of popularity and it attracts this 
method in the business he said its kind of mean like the old 
mafia days you dont have to do this but theyll make you wish 
you had i publicly dont like it id like them to know im upset 
real upset 
roy wunsch senior vice president for cbs records in nashville 
tenn denied haggard was pressured and said he was surprised to 
hear of the singers complaints 
it certainly struck me as bizarre said wunsch our 
relationship has generally been good with the artist i was there 
several months in reading calif when merle listened to the songs 
and fell in love with two or three he certainly was never forced to 
record anything 
ive never known a superstar who isnt occasionally troubled by 
something merle has had peaks and valleys careerwise and right now 
hes doing well i wouldnt know what was behind it 
threats and all haggard likes the songs message of what to do 
when the job is over and theres no one to go home to hes also 
proud of his own a thousand lies ago an afterhours weeper 
about a relationship long gone bad 
songs are that way he said they kind of mark the period 
in ones life and ones experience you cant write about something 
if you didnt know anything about it a whole lot of life we dont 
know exists if we dont cross the bridge 
haggard whos busy touring has walked far to the other side 
prison time poverty the early death of his father and years on the 
road have all taken their toll he walks gingerly and speaks 
slowly gazing with weary eyes 
he was born in bakersfield calif during the great depression 
in a makeshift home converted out of a boxcar by 14 haggard was 
playing guitar but was also in and out of reform schools and in the 
late 1950s he was sent to san quentin for trying to burglarize a 
roadhouse 
after being paroled in 1960 haggard worked for his brother an 
electrical contractor during the week and played gigs as a sideman 
on the weekends he met up with fuzzy owens a local music 
entrepreneur who owned a small label tally records haggards 
breakthrough came in 1963 with all my friends are going to be 
strangers a top 10 country hit 
in 1966 he had his first no 1 song with swinging doors and 
three years later received 10 nominations for academy of country and 
western music awards the academy named him best male vocalist in 
1966 1969 1971 and 1972 
along with a steady repertoire of drinking songs and rebel 
anthems haggard tells of fragile lives men and women dependent on 
luck and the next paycheck if we make it through december is a

thrown up 
he saw this little threesome standing underneath the eave of a 
building it was raining and he saw an older gentleman an older 
lady and a young girl it seemed to be a family so he walked up to 
the girl and started to introduce himself and ask who they were 
he asked whats it like to be homeless in america and she 
said were not homeless we have a wonderful home we just dont 
have a house to put it in

jack and ann oconnell feel much more secure 
in their home and janice collins can afford a car while she saves 
for a home of her own because she shares the oconnells big 
comfortable house 
its not a hardship its a convenience said oconnell 77 
you can leave your cats and go on a trip and jan will take care of 
them 
besides in this neighborhood if you leave a house empty itll 
be really empty when you come back 
its an irony of modern life that people who spent decades paying 
for a house are finding its too much to handle after the kids are 
gone others spend huge chunks of their incomes for a nice place or 
pay less and live in a dump 
community groups around the country have an answer shared 
housing programs involving individuals or groups there were 50 
programs in the united states in 1981 now there are more than 400 
in 42 states according to the shared housing resource center an 
8yearold philadelphiabased umbrella organization 
its an idea whose time has gone and come back americans rented 
rooms through the beginning of this century before housing 
programs zoning laws and the postwar building boom brought a 
decline in the practice 
the first matchup program for individuals in the united 
states was project homeshare started in 1953 in hartford conn the 
oldest american group shared residence is shareahome founded in 
1969 in winter park fla 
anyone can hang a room for rent sign in the window but 
people who use a matchup program want it to screen applicants and 
keep tabs on the situation 
i would be afraid to advertise in the newspapers because i 
wouldnt know what i was getting a 74yearold widow told 
consultant carol s schreter of baltimore 
working with the public 40 years you learn to size people up 
said a 57yearold disabled homeowner but i wouldnt interview 
strangers in my home 
ms collins 40 a business student at la salle university 
priced apartments in the germantown neighborhood at 400500 a 
month before she was matched with the oconnells she pays 175 a 
month for their third floor 
i have a very tight budget but im saving for my own home i 
couldnt do that and afford my car if i had to pay that kind of 
rent 
ms collins moved in in 1986 in 1987 she did more than feed the 
cats when mrs oconnell suffered a heart attack jan drove me to 
the hospital we got there right away and it sure was better than 
waiting for an ambulance 
philadelphia match a nonprofit homesharing service screens 
tenants and landlords its not for everyone said susan levin 
director of the groups delaware valley division the agency makes 
it clear it doesnt want people who cant pay or work for their 
rent other ineligibles are those needing extensive care people who 
require supervision or medication nonrecovered alcoholics or 
substance abusers and those in need of emergency shelter 
they can make a thorough investigation on both sides and ask a 
whole lot of insulting questions because theyre not going to have 
to live with you afterward oconnell said 
renters and homeowners both pay a 5 application fee and 25 
matching fee commercial finders who locate apartments for 
people often charge much more philadelphia match recommends a 
twoweek trial before the parties negotiate and sign a lease rent 
can be cash or a combination of cash and services 
even less traditional are group households where an average of 
eight people share a home owned by a community organization 
philadelphia match opened st georges manor on april 17 the 
103yearold remodeled church rectory offers six bedrooms and a 
shared kitchen living room and bathroom space residents must be at 
least 62 years old or disabled and have an annual income under 
12800 
governmentsubsidized rent is 30 percent of each residents 
income the shared housing resource center estimates the average 
cost per unit in a group residence is 6250 a bargain compared to 
other forms of housing 
a 1984 survey found the mean age of owners was 68 and half were 
paying more than 40 percent of their incomes for housing the mean 
age of renters was 50 and many were middleclass and between jobs 
or at the end of a marriage 
for homeowners the biggest advantage was financial closely 
followed by companionship saving money was the attraction for 
twothirds of the renters 
in group households financial advantage was a relatively minor 
factor nearly twothirds said having somebody around in the 
event of an emergency of to help with chores was what they liked 
best and 20 percent saw their main advantage as safety in numbers 
among the disadvantages household management issues led the 
downside for landlords and tenants these included rules on setting 
the thermostat keeping the kitchen clean and not making noise at 
odd hours 
in group homes personality clashes were the major disadvantage 
complaints included arguments too much talking criticism etc 
loss of privacy was less of a problem in fact 45 percent reported 
no loss of privacy at all 
you can shut your door with nonrelatives said one agency 
client they dont need to know where you are going they dont 
get so involved in your affairs 
maggie kuhn founder of the grey panthers has been sharing her

an elderly couple in texas is invited to join a 
50000 social security sweepstakes 
an 81yearold retiree in new jersey receives an envelope from 
the irs asking her to donate money to a group opposing a new 
medicare law 
a california couple gets a warrant of appearance to claim a 
prize from the department of fbi 
officiallooking letters from officialsounding organizations 
that have no connection to the government are coming under 
increasing scrutiny this year from members of congress hoping to 
crack down on legal but potentially misleading mailings 
directmail schemes involving lookalike letters and 
soundalike groups range from real estate investment deals to 
sale of services that already are available for free from the 
government 
the fbi letter for example was from the fountains bureau of 
invitations and invited families to visit a california resort 
the irs designation signified only that the letter came from 
a nonprofit group with a particular internal revenue service 
classification 
many lookalike mailings fall into a gray area they confuse 
the recipient about their origin but are still legal said thomas w 
mcclure of the postal inspection service something needs to be 
done to make sure the public gets a clearer interpretation of what 
theyre receiving 
the direct marketing association a trade group tries to police 
itself and deter unethical solicitations but lookalike mailings 
have been a consistent problem over the past couple of years 
said spokeswoman lorna christie 
the house in july approved legislation that would require private 
mailings bearing officiallooking emblems titles and insignia to 
include prominent disclaimers of any government affiliation similar 
legislation is pending in the senate with committee action likely 
this fall 
the legislations supporters include the american association of 
retired persons which says lookalike mailings often target the 
elderly and prey on their concerns about the wellbeing of social 
security and medicare some come in envelopes similar to those 
containing social security checks and bear typical government 
messages like buy and hold us savings bonds 
there seems to be no end to peoples creativity in finding some 
way to make money at other peoples expense said the aarps robin 
talbert people get confused about exactly what it is theyre 
getting 
private mailings tied in to social security are on the 
increase unfortunately because its a very lucrative business 
said social security administration spokesman phil gambino 
groups charge fees ranging up to 40 to help married women change 
the name on their social security records get social security 
numbers for children or obtain personal earnings records in many 
cases recipients are unaware the services are available at no cost 
through ssa 
among the outfits that have come under criticism is the social 
security protection bureau which staged the 50000 social security 
sweepstakes it charges 7 for a membership kit that includes a 
form people can mail in to check their retirement contributions a 
form available free from ssa 
a person has a right to either do it themselves or have someone 
else obtain the information for them said michael kushnick an 
attorney for the company he defended its right to sell a service 
and said the mailings already include a disclaimer of government 
affiliation 
the new social security commissioner gwendolyn king said she is 
looking for ways to cut down on misleading mailings that invoke the 
name of her agency and plans to work with congress on the problem 
she recalled a frantic phone call years ago from her 82yearold 
grandmother who said she had gotten notice her retirement benefits 
were being cut off the letter turned out to be from a group seeking 
donations to safeguard social security 
it was almost worded just that crassly if you dont send 
something you may lose your benefits mrs king said weve got 
to figure out how we can shut these things down 
the pending legislation is designed to take a first step in that 
direction without stepping on the rights of legitimate directmail 
companies 
the house bill sponsored by rep frank mccloskey dind would 
require officiallooking mailings to state this product or 
service has not been approved or endorsed by the federal government 
and this offer is not being made by an agency of the federal 
government 
envelopes for such mailings would have to include the message 
this is not a government document 
in addition solicitations that looked like bills or statements 
of overdue payments would have to state this is a solicitation of 
donations and not a bill invoice or statement of accounts due 
you are under no obligation to make any payment in response to this 
mailing 
sen john heinz rpa the sponsor of a similar senate bill 
stressed that it would not limit what mailers can print only 
require them to distinguish themselves from the government 
if it looks like you are trying to make the mailing come from 
the united states government we want the mailer to say we are 
being deceitful but it is not your friendly us government that is 
being deceitful he said 
the house last year passed a somewhat tougher mccloskey bill that 
also would have required mailers to serve notice if they were 
selling a service that is available for free or at a lesser charge 
from the federal government that bill died in the senate and 
mccloskey agreed to drop the services provision this time to stem 
opposition 
but he cited a recent mailing from the federal benefits 
assistance corp a private group charging 18 to help people file 
for social security benefits as evidence of the need to continue 
monitoring misleading mailings and perhaps legislate further 
regulations to protect the unwary recipients

linda vahrenkamp knew her ailing father could 
no longer live alone but she lived too far away to care for him 
and just when she needed to research nursing homes her job as a 
programmer for ibm in boulder colo required her to run a major 
business meeting 
the 42yearold vahrenkamp turned to her employer within hours 
ibms elder care referral service provided the names costs and 
other information about adult care facilities near her fathers home 
in the mountains 
they did the legwork all i had to do was check these places 
out when i had time i didnt have to find them 
that ibm would offer such a service is testament to the needs of 
the baby boomers who are rising through the business ranks just as 
they are maturing as executives many find their parents are more 
needy so many of us are going through this same kind of thing 
said vahrenkamp 
other companies also are coming to the realization that they have 
a stake in their employees family problems a study by john hancock 
financial services found employees with needy parents are more 
likely to be absent from work and to suffer from jobrelated stress 
than others 
if elder care is a problem now and it is we had better find 
good humane answers soon if we dont the future will turn 
into a nightmare for millions of us said e james morton 
chairman of john hancock 
for a long time elder care was a sleeper issue tucked away 
behind child care said dr michael creedon of the national council 
on aging creedon is a pioneer in eldercare services hes 
credited with coining the term and he points to population 
statistics to underscore the need 
about 30 million people are over 65 today that number will jump 
to 50 million in the early part of the next century an estimated 
26 million are 85 or over now by the year 2000 that number will 
double studies also show that 41 percent of those responsible for 
elder care also have children to handle 
the baby boomers delayed childbearing so theres a high 
proportion of late childbearing creedon said people in their 
40s are also the most frequent group for parent care 
at ibm 30 percent of our population had some responsibility 
for an elder relative said spokesman jim smith we wanted to 
provide more flexibility in dealing with home and family 
in 1987 ibm turned to work family directions of boston work 
family directions had initially helped ibm establish a network to 
help the companys 223000 nationwide employees find child care in 
1984 
the next year work family directions formed the elder care 
consultation and referral service alan larue its director said it 
collects information through 175 communitybased agencies nationwide 
to provide to employees 
for vahrenkamp the worrying never went away but the service 
helped her arrange transportation for her father to his doctors 
talk knowledgeably about his condition and deal with medicare and 
medicaid 
there are other elder care organizations in new york city for 
example some companies work with the citys partnership for 
eldercare but work family directions is one of the largest 
besides ibm its client list includes colgatepalmolive johnson amp 
johnson and aetna life amp casualty 
for aetna elder care was an outgrowth of child care as it was 
for others but it had to be handled much more tacitly and 
quietly employees feel they shouldnt have to verbalize needs on 
this said sherry herchenroether the administrator of its family 
services program 
they deny the fact of needing elder care for emotional 
reasons when they do realize it its with a sense of urgency she 
said seminars aetna had before introducing its program were so 
popular that more had to be scheduled 
women have traditionally been caregivers both for children and 
for elderly parents who needed help today many women work 
herchenroether said and part of the problem stems from the fact 
that there isnt anybody left at home 
annie smith an aetna licensing and contracts supervisor in 
atlanta moved her fatherinlaw in with her family four months ago 
because she was unhappy with his living arrangement with another 
family member 
while her son can be company for him now she worries about what 
will happen when the boy returns to school her call to the 
companys elder care referral service has found places where he can 
go during the day 
sitting around all day sleeping and eating is not good for 
anyone she said ive got some data and i think i can get him 
into a senior citizen center for part of the day so he wont be 
alone 
herchenroether noted that for many of aetnas 44000 workers 
the employee is one place and the relative is far away making it 
difficult for the employee to find out what she needs to know 
while companies wont disclose the cost of the program both 
ibms smith and aetnas herchenroether say the issue is not money 
but attracting and keeping employees by offering services they need 
providing flexibility is very important creedon said but 
we need a lot of education you need understanding bosses and 
awareness on the level of management that this is happening

hundreds of volunteers devoted almost 28000 hours 
last year to the areas elderly people much like themselves but 
who needed help to stay out of institutions and keep mentally 
stimulated 
the program of classes peer counseling handyman help and other 
services is part of life enrichment services founded in 1977 by 
memers of the fledgling oak grove chapter of the american 
association of retired persons 
we wanted to form new friendships for people who had lost their 
social support system through retirement recalled anne eaton now 
81 and still an active volunteer at the time mrs eaton was 67 a 
nursing home volunteer and working on her masters degree in 
gerontology at georgia state university 
she attended the 1975 charter meeting of the oak grove aarp 
chapter and there she talked about elbert cole a methodist minister 
from kansas city mo and his innovative shepherds center which 
became a model for life enrichment 
with 500 in seed money from the oak grove chapter mrs eaton 
and fellow members robert dubose mack love and judson greene 
started talking to various agencies in their middle class community 
10 miles northeast of atlanta about forming a shepherds center 
program of their own 
as part of her thesis work mrs eaton studied the areas 
demographics and learned 90 percent of the 8000 elderly residents 
regularly attended about 40 churches which the organizers quickly 
recruited as affiliates she cataloged available services and 
surveyed older church members about what they needed 
life enrichment services once it started its first adventures 
in learning classes at an affiliate church in early 1977 was an 
immediate success at least partly because of such thorough research 
we knew where the people were and we brought the services to 
them she said we knew what churches they went to and what 
services they wanted 
those services include weekly classes on subjects ranging from 
investment banking to bridge photography to aerobics last year 
3000 people signed up for the four quarters of classes 
life enrichment also started one of aarps first widowed persons 
service through which widows and widowers counsel the newly 
widowed the trained peercounselors donated 7000 hours last year 
helping others survive what is often the most traumatic experience 
of their lives 
other programs involve senior citizen volunteers who deliver 
meals to elderly shutins for meals on wheels retired handymen who 
mainly help widows maintain their homes inexpensively and retired 
nurses who perform free blood pressure checks at the adventures in 
learning classes 
life enrichment also operates a telephone reassurance program to 
check on people living alone and a referral service for trained 
companion aides 
hundreds of volunteers worked 27711 hours last year to help 
provide services designed to make it possible for the elderly to 
remain in their own homes and to provide mental stimulation and 
useful activities for the elderly 
as life enrichment flourished it outgrew its donated 
headquarters space at briarlake baptist church the directors raised 
500000 to build the mack love senior center which is expected to 
be completed next winter it is named for the nowdeceased founder 
who served as the services first executive director 
mrs eaton a volunteer clerk at headquarters on mondays is the 
only founder still active in life enrichment although many of the 
original program volunteers are continuing their work 
were survivors and i think life enrichment has a part in it 
because it keeps us busy she said 
it gives you such a good feeling to belong to something so 
worthwhile

dr karl menninger worries these days that 
people are so hostile toward each other and that there is so much 
greed in the world 
pointing to a large jar of pennies on his desk the 96yearold 
psychiatrist says i keep them there to remind me of the 
unhealthiness of people grabbing onto material things in life when 
i think of people who have acquired great wealth what can they do 
with it what does it prove 
menningers interests run more toward fighting injustice 
pollution and other ills of society ive tried to make life 
easier for people you hold a coat when you can and you tie a mans 
shoe when you can 
you try to do what you can 
his focus has been a crusade to make life better for socially 
homeless children it manifests itself in the villages a program of 
residential care for children without parents that he founded the 
villages observed its 20th anniversary july 22 menningers birthday 
at 96 dr karl is only slightly less active than he was two or 
three decades ago he spends his days consulting teaching 
advocating social causes and receiving visitors to menninger the 
mental health center he founded with his father and brother in 1925 
he remains chairman of the board 
he still speaks out against societys taking revenge on 
prison inmates by mistreating them denounces capital punishment as 
unworthy of a civilized society pushes for nursing home reform and 
often lectures those who come calling because more isnt being done 
to improve the lot of mankind 
wealthdriven physicians are a special worry our medical 
profession and our society dont fit any more i shouldnt say this 
but doctors want too much money my father never made much money and 
he had a good life 
i want to see it changed back in that direction where doctors 
care more about people menninger sees a governmentmandated 
medical system evolving in the united states if the system doesnt 
change 
the advance of years sometimes makes him grumpy but when he 
talks about his infirmities his determination shows he wont go 
down without a fight 
i dont feel good and that worries me im used to feeling 
good but i dont feel 96 i feel better than that he said im 
as forgetful as hell im sometimes irritable my hearing problem 
doesnt get any better 
i feel rusty and my damn knees wont hold me up and that 
frightens me but im doing ok i guess 
hes alternatingly angry and philosophical over the advance of 
years 
ive had a good time all my life theres so much to do and 
ive found so much interesting to do and ive found a lot of 
friends to do it with 
dr karl derives pleasure from his weekly meetings with menninger 
students and friends and trips to the villages 
he helped launch the series of residential homes for children in 
topeka lawrence and several communities in indiana after a local 
judge complained that he had no place to send young people without 
families it was menninger who got 25000 in seed money from the 
fraternal order of eagles after speaking to its convention and 
started what he calls his homes for homeless kids 
our goal he said was to replace families these kids had 
lost either by death or abandonment or their parents just 
couldnt care for them a modernized orphans home is what it was 
although we never called it that 
menninger persuaded his friend philanthropist w clement stone 
of chicago to buy and donate 320 acres on the northwest edge of 
topeka the first cottage was built in what became eagle ridge 
village there now are five homes here three in lawrence eight in 
indiana and an affiliated program in michigan 
they have done a tremendous job in kansas from that 
beginning said villages director gary duncan despite bucking a 
trend promoted by the federal government to create treatment 
programs for homeless youth rather than homes 
children who come here need families they are not patients who 
need treatment duncan said when childrens homes emphasize 
treatment they deemphasize caring and caring is paramount at the 
villages 
that too is a testament to karl menninger and his personal 
creed id like to be remembered as a person who cared

the recent publicity about longterm care insurance 
policies and the stories of families devastated by the burgeoning 
costs of nursing home care bring to mind fears of becoming a burden 
to our loved ones 
this scenario never has to play if we learn more about longterm 
care itself and the resources available to cover the risks of not 
having enough information education and careful planning will 
eliminate the fears usually associated with long stays in nursing 
homes 
what is longterm care it has been described as medical 
personal or social services provided at a nursing home a custodial 
facility at home or at a community program for a year or longer a 
longterm care insurance policy is designed to cover most of the 
expenses associated with these services but that are not covered by 
medicare medicaid or medigap policies 
why is there so much publicity about longterm care there are 
three major influences at work that have focused attention on the 
issue 
the first is the growing number of americans over age 65 it is 
expected that by 2020 20 percent of our population will be 
seniors 
the second is a dramatic change in the definition of family 
two working parents fewer children per family more people without 
children more divorces more families living in geographically 
diverse locations all of this equals fewer resources available for 
extended care at home 
finally medicare accounts for less than 4 percent of extended 
care benefits under the old and new laws medicare does not pay for 
custodial nursing home care yet a recent study shows that 90 
percent of nursing home patients need only custodial care usually 
defined as care that meets personal needs such as getting out of 
bed walking eating or bathing professional skills or training 
are not required of the caregiver the other social healthcare 
program medicaid is intended only for the indigent 
so for most of us private resources must be available for both 
the patient and the patients family so neither will end up 
financially destitute 
before you research financing possible longterm care three 
steps should be taken first evaluate whether you think you will 
need longterm care in the future your familys medical history may 
give you clues did your forebears generally die young have your 
grandparents lived long healthy active lives 
next answer these questions dealing with your extended family 
are they willing to care for you at home would they refuse to let a 
family member stay in a nursing home are there resources to cover 
professional home health care is the family so displaced that there 
is no possibility of home care what kind of decisions would your 
family make about longterm care if you were incapable of making 
that choice finally consider the possibility that all your assets 
could be depleted by a stay of two years five years or longer 
the average cost of a years stay in a nursing home today is 
approximately 24000 using an inflation rate of 5 percent that 
annual cost will be almost 40000 in only 10 years knowing this 
now means that some of your assets can be invested specifically for 
such a purpose if you need it for longterm care its there if 
you dont it becomes a part of your estate 
longterm care insurance policies then are not the only answer 
but the efficiencies of a longterm care policy may prove to be the 
best course 
finding the right policy is no simple matter products are 
complicated and expensive each seems to offer the perfect solution 
the number of companies offering these types of policies is 
increasing rapidly which means competition will continue to 
increase benefits for the consumers but it also means you must 
examine the details and fine print 
the best advice now may be to wait a while if you can perhaps a 
year or two while the marketplace sorts out the best policies

my favorite summer month to visit friends is 
september in resort towns the crowds have gone but the water is 
still warm enough to swim 
its the perfect time for the unforgettable barbecue at the 
beach fish bought at dockside sweet corn in husks to share the 
grill and tomatoes to eat outofhand bought en route from a farm 
stand 
in september when i visit friends in suburban and country 
settings what i find is more and more of their garden space is 
given over to the growing of vegetables too which reach their 
zenith now magenta beets rosy turnips purple egglants red and 
green peppers yellow squash and whiteribbed collard greens are all 
flourishing 
not since the victory gardens of world war ii where i remember 
growing vegetables with schoolmates in a nearby vacant lot have we 
as a nation been so enthusiastic about growing our own weve 
learned squarefoot gardening circle gardening and 
container gardening all for the purpose of using our space 
efficiently whether in my twobytwofoot plot in a manhattan urban 
garden between two highrisers or in a great big 200foot country 
backyard 
as edible landscapes pop up all over the country and local 
farmers through the green farm project bring their vegetables and 
fruits to cities and towns libraries and bookstore shelves are 
becoming crowded with books that encourage taking creative 
responsibility for our environment and ourselves the friends i 
visit in congers ny to celebrate their annual september harvest 
feast are two of the best examples i know of treating themselves and 
their environment with the utmost of respect 
joan is a professor of nutrition at columbia teachers college 
alan who is an artist by profession is national president of earth 
day surrounding the house where they raised their family is a 
vegetable garden and small orchard that has evolved as their 
commitment has grown to the environment here they produce food that 
feeds them handsomely yearround in a totally natural cycle without 
pesticides 
the lucky guests invited on this special sunday choose the 
vegetables they want to prepare and cook for each course pole beans 
for a crips nosh to eat in the garden leaning into a hoe to turn up 
small potatoes reaching for kale that is the size of a small tree 
to make into the hearty portuguese caldo verde soup armfuls of 
eggplants peppers leeks onions tomatoes zucchini and basil to 
turn into a glorious ratatouille 
laughter and good conversation abound as we reach for pots take 
our turns at the stove serve each course at the kitchen table until 
the last delicious morsel of fruit cobbler is eaten by candlelight 
in the lengthening evening 
here are some favorites

the census bureau and the national council on 
the aging are joining forces to recruit older americans for some of 
the 480000 temporary jobs that will be created by next years 
national head count 
most of the workers will be out calling on people knocking on 
doors and finding out why they didnt return their census forms 
said census deputy director c louis kincannon others will have 
supervisory and office jobs 
most jobs will run six to eight weeks paying 5 to 8 an hour 
depending on location people with management experience will be key 
recruits for the office manager jobs which may pay more and last 
longer than doortodoor positions 
older people who are retired and have additional needs may find 
this an avenue that may give them a new sense of confidence and also 
demonstrate to a subsequent employer that theyve got it in them 
kincannon said 
older people would be ideal local censustakers because many have 
a lifetime attachment to their neighborhood which will help 
particularly in areas throught the country where youve had 
undercounts for instance in rural areas said donald l davis 
vice president of the ncoa 
most of the doortodoor jobs will be available next april and 
may while office positions could start earlier and last eight 
months to a year 
those interested should contact state employment offices or the 
nearest census bureau office recruitment for management and 
administrative jobs began this month ads and recruitment for 
outdoor jobs will start in february 
workers will have to pass a written test of basic abilities to 
work with numbers and read and follow instructions and most will 
need access to a car 
a new law lets federal postal and military retirees take 
temporary census jobs without loss of retirement pay or benefits 
the law lets federal retirees work shortterm census jobs without 
loss of benefits if total employment does not exceed six months and 
extend beyond dec 31 1990

an experimental pacemaker that 
adjusts the heart rate to meet the bodys needs has been implanted 
in four patients at jfk medical center where the first clinical 
studies of the device will be made 
the new design may make life easier for many of the 110000 
people annually who need a pacemaker to regulate their heart beats 
said dr paul winokur the thoracic surgeon who implanted the 
matchbooksized devices 
unlike conventional pacemakers set at a continuous rate the 
adaptable pacemaker monitors the nervous system to determine whether 
to speed up or slow down the heart rate 
we think its the next best thing to sliced bread winokur 
said we think its a great advance but its too early to say 
the us food and drug administration approved the metabolic 
pacemaker for clinical studies on aug 14 
winokur implanted the first one in 78yearold floyd cooper of 
lake worth three days later i feel great i really do cooper 
said 
a healthy heart reacts to the bodys need for blood by monitoring 
the nervous system the metabolic pacemaker tries to mimic a normal 
heart by using a sensor in the hearts right ventricle to report 
changing needs 
the sensor monitors respiration blood temperature and changes in 
the heartbeat to determine how much blood the body needs 
conventional pacemakers dont respond to demands from the body so 
too much activity or stress can result in weakness or fatigue 
winokur said 
clinical studies have been under way in europe for several months 
but jfk medical center is the only us hospital to use the 
pacemaker doctors said in coming months a few centers around the 
country will be selected to participate in the studies said barbara 
westrum of the st paul minnbased cardiac pacemakers inc which 
developed the pacemaker over the last 15 years 
if clinical studies show the pacemaker is effective it could be 
widely available within 18 months westrum said he estimated that 
up to 30 percent of pacemaker users will be able to use the new 
design it costs about 6000 some 500 more than conventional 
pacemakers

a broad range of nations gained in 
creditworthiness in the past year according to a survey of 
international bankers but the debt reputation of latin american and 
african nations continued to decline 
the 30 nations with improved credit reputations among the bankers 
over the past year included both industrial countries and 
oilproducing nations according to institutional investor magazine 
which conducted the survey for release today 
among the 15 biggest losers in credit reputation were six nations 
in latin america and six in africa the magazine said in a news 
release results of the survey are contained in the magazines 
september issue 
the winners included such smaller nations as barbados oman 
qatar and cyprus while the losers included china brazil and 
nigeria 
the survey results showed a growing gap between the credit 
ratings of richer and poor nations the magazine said while asian 
countries as a whole continue to move closer to becoming wealthy 
nations latin america sinks toward africas numbers and africa 
continues a slide of its own it said 
growing despondency about third world debt among the bankers 
who participate in this survey has tarnished their views of latin 
american and african countries and unleased what bankers 
inevitably call a flight to quality which translates into higher 
ratings for many industrial nations the magazine said 
the united states remained in fourth place in creditworthiness 
behind japan switzerland and west germany 
uganda nicaragua and north korea continued to languish at the 
bottom of the list ranked 110th 111th and 112th respectively 
every six months the magazine surveys 75 to 100 bankers to rate 
the creditworthiness of 112 nations on a scale of 0 to 100 
in the 10 years the magazine has conducted the survey the ratings 
of iraq argentina mexico brazil nigeria liberia and a number of 
other latin american and african nations have plunged dramatically 
among the winners over the decade the biggest improvement came 
from turkey which climbed from 89th to 44th place also showing 
significant improvement in creditworthiness over the period were 
taiwan portugal cyprus and spain

imported cars dominate both the best and the 
worst categories in the annual survey of automobile gas mileage 
released today by the environmental protection agency 
overall automakers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the 
1990 model year although the number of cars mostly expensive 
superluxury imports that trigger the federal gas guzzler tax 
dropped from 40 car types to 30 
there is no significant difference in the fuel economy of the 
top 10 1990 models compared to the top 10 1989 models likewise 
overall fleet average fuel economy of all cars and light trucks 
is projected to be about the same said the epa in a statement 
fuel economy has gained renewed attention in congress because of 
concern over autos role in causing global warming and air pollution 
automobile emissions especially carbon dioxide releases are a 
direct contributor to urban smog which has caused more than 100 
metropolitan areas to fail federal air quality standards carbon 
dioxide also is a major cause of the socalled greenhouse effect 
which scientists say is expected to cause a warming of the earth in 
coming decades 
according to the epa survey the mileage leaders were largely 
foreignmade with the japanese dominating that end of the list 
for the fifth straight year the fuelstingiest car was the 
japanesemade geo metro sold by chevrolet followed by the honda 
civic crx suzuki swift and daihatsu charade the geo metro xfi 
model had mileage of 53 mpg in the city 58 mpg on the highway and 
55 mpg overall the same as last year 
no usmade car made the top 10 list the ford escort had the 
best mileage of any domestic car with 32 mpg in the city 42 mpg on 
the highway and 36 mpg overall 
the car with the worst mileage was the lamborghini countach which 
got only 6 mpg in the city and 10 mpg on the highway rounding out 
the list of 10 cars with the worst gas mileage were four models of 
the rolls royce the ferrari testarossa bmw 750il porsche 928 s4 
audi v8 and maserati 228 
according to the epa survey all but two of the 30 car models 
subject to the gas guzzler tax are luxury imports the exception are 
two cadillac models the allante and the larger engine 350 cubic 
inches brougham which have combined city and highway mileage of 18 
and 17 mpg respectively they had the worst gas mileage of any 
domestic car 
several chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year 
escaped because of mileage improvements in 1990 models these 
included the chrysler tc by maserati and the chrysler new yorker and 
dodge dynasty successor cars to other chrysler models that fell 
under the guzzler tax in 1989 
european models that are subject to the tax come from maserati 
rollsroyce porsche ferrari lamborghini volvo audi and bmw 
the excise tax amounts to a penalty of 500 to 3850 with the 
amount increasing as gasoline mileage declines it was enacted in 
1975 to encourage people to buy more fuelefficient cars 
the mileage results are based on tests conducted by the 
manufacturer under laboratory conditions with about 30 percent of 
the tests verified by the epa according agency officials 
automakers are required to have an average fuel economy of 275 
mpg for their fleets last year officials in the reagan 
administration urged congress to eliminate the fleet requirements 
but the bush administration citing environmental concerns has 
urged automakers to continuing pursuing increases in the fleet 
averages and efforts to rescind the standards have fallen by the 
wayside 
legislation introduced in the senate would call for a 40 percent 
improvement in fleetwide fuel economy by the year 2000 such a 
requirement which has been opposed by the auto industry would 
require a fleet average of about 40 mpg by the turn of the century 
industry officials have said

first bank system is considering cutting its 
work force by 15 percent to 20 percent over the next year under a 
restructuring that could cost up to 40 million and reduce assets by 
2 billion the company announced monday 
chairman dh ankeny jr said the possible restructuring is still 
being studied by management and has not been presented to the board 
of directors 
we must seriously consider eliminating or downsizing some of 
our businesses that have risk characteristics that exceed their 
reward potential or that no longer provide the return our 
shareholders expect ankeny said 
he said the restructuring could cost 25 million to 40 million 
which could be booked as a loss in the third or fourth quarter

that gain was partially offset by a 70 million charge for an 
accounting change related to postretirement health benefits 
on an operating basis the cereal maker and owner of red lobster 
and olive garden restaurants made 1072 million after tax in the 
first quarter of fiscal 1990 compared with 905 million for the 
same period a year before sales were up 12 percent to 15 billion 
from 13 billion 
chairman bruce atwater attributed the operating gains partly to 
general mills growing market share in breakfast cereals where 
rival kellogg co of battle creek mich has long been the dominant 
force 
big g readytoeat cereals achieved a 27 percent market share 
during the first quarter up from the record 246 percent share of 
the market recorded at the end of fiscal 1989 
much of the gain reflects the growth of cheerios which has 
benefited from a health craze over oat bran and the introduction of 
two new cheerios flavors atwater said 
also in the foods division strong sales gains were achieved by 
hamburger helper bisquick and yoplait light 
restaurants which accounted for 465 million of the first 
quarter operating profit reported firstquarter gains in sales and 
operating profit of 18 percent and 21 percent respectively 
atwater said the emerging olive garden chain of italianstyle 
restaurants reported a 50 percent sales gain and even faster growth 
in earnings 
the company plans to invest 600 million to open 250 new red 
lobster and olive garden restaurants by the end of 1992 which 
atwater said will enable general mills to increase restaurant sales 
to about 26 billion a gain of 1 billion over three years 
general mills also plans to spend 100 million this year to build 
a cereal plant in covington ga as part of a 400 million 
threeyear investment program that will increase the companys 
cereal capacity by over 20 percent in the next 18 months atwater 
said

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
country rose by 15 last week to total 965 and remain above yearago 
levels for the third straight week baker hughes inc reported 
monday 
a year ago the count stood at 921 the company said 
baker hughes rig count is the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states wyoming posted the largest 
increase up six north dakota was up four new mexico gained three 
kansas and texas each was up two and colorado was up by one 
louisiana oklahoma and michigan each declined by two while ohio 
and pennsylvania were off one california was unchanged

it was a long battle and vigilance is still 
called for but the carbuying public seems to have gained a 
longterm advantage over carmakers 
it might be hard to believe especially for those people who were 
buying cars back in the 1960s when automakers dictated to buyers 
and buyers had the choice of taking it or leaving it 
then came the big push by the japanese and other foreigners 
american carbuyers finally had a choice and they exercised it but 
few ever thought they would be able to dictate to the big three 
well they have according to the delphi v analysis which 
indicates that as a result manufacturers will be forced to restrain 
prices improve quality and offer better service to customers 
the delphi v technique was developed by the rand corporation a 
think tank and implemented by the university of michigans 
transportation research institute based on confidential information 
from automotive policy makers 
it concludes that easy sales resulting from rapid industry 
growth are history competition will be stiff the market will be 
mature meaning little growth the level of quality and service 
will be even more important 
the report written by david j andrea of the research institute 
expects car prices to remain steady for the next decade the 
usproduced car that costs 14000 in 1990 may rise to 15000 in 
1995 and 15900 in 2000 in the same period a 15000 imported 
vehicle might rise to 17000 
dealerships will become increasingly important andrea says they 
will need to cultivate more professional staffs offer better 
diagnostic and repair services and more customer conveniences and 
work more closely with manufacturers 
the average total life of passengers cars is expected to climb to 
12 years by the year 2000 from 11 years in 1990 although newcar 
buyers will continue to stay with their purchases for five years 
same as in 1990 
partly because of longer life expectancy but also for 
competitive reasons manufacturers are expected to extend power 
train warranties up to 10 years and 100000 miles on some models by 
such means customer loyalty will be built 
while these developments might seem startling they represent the 
evolution of ideas begun in the 1980s and if any one thing can be 
singled out as the reason it is likely to be international 
competition 
such competition often viewed as a threat to the united states 
economy has helped the consumer enormously the evidence is 
especially true in the automotive market where quality and service 
had for a while deteriorated 
forced to improve or continue to lose market share the big three 
of ford general motors and chrysler strive to offer better 
machinery delivery and service competition demands continued 
improvement or a slow death 
that competition is likely to continue even intensify the 
delphi v forecast is for the big three to lose market share over the 
decade their share now is around 64 percent in 2000 they are 
expected to have only 61 percent 
what the survey says in effect is that if american and foreign 
carmakers want the business they will have to do even better not 
just next year and the year after but for the rest of the century 
and beyond

ferranti plc a british defense equipment and 
electronics manufacturer on monday confirmed that its us 
subsidiary may have fraudulently misreported contracts to its parent 
company 
in a letter to employees ferranti chairman sir derek alunjones 
said an investigation of contract irregularities at international 
signal amp control a lancaster pennbased defense equipment 
company so far suggested that ferranti was at least misled and 
possibly made the victim of serious fraud 
a copy of the letter was obtained by the apdow jones news 
service 
the sunday times reported that the company might have to write 
off the equivalent of 234 million or more against nonexistent 
contracts for which the company had previously believed it had been 
paid 
the newspaper also reported that international signal amp control 
was being investigated for allegedly selling arms illegally in the 
middle east and south africa ferranti officials declined to comment 
on that report 
alunjones letter said the problems under investigation affect 
only a few transactions and are in no way connected with other 
important contracts with specified customers in the middle east or 
elsewhere 
britains defense secretary tom king said monday i am very 
concerned and we hope these matters can be resolved at the earliest 
possible date because they are an important defense contractor 
ferranti executives left for the united states on friday for 
meetings a ferranti spokesman said sunday 
the company based in cheadle england announced friday it 
called in the accountants coopers amp lybrand to investigate 
irregularities in its accounts 
trading in the companys shares was suspended last week and the 
annual general meeting was postponed due to problems with the 
accounts 
the difficulties have prompted speculation that ferranti would 
become the target of a takeover 
ferranti merged with international signal amp control two years ago 
in a 647 million deal 
according to a report in the sunday times the us justice 
department has been conducting a secret twoyear investigation into 
international signal amp control over alleged illegal exports of arms 
to customers in the middle east and south africa 
ferranti was warned of the questionable arms deals shortly after 
the merger unidentified british ministry of defense sources told 
the sunday times 
among other things ferranti supplies fighterjet radar systems 
to british and foreign air forces it also is involved in the 
development of a new generation of mobile telephones

the last column indicates the type of transmission and the number 
of gears for example a4 means a fourspeed automatic and 
m5 means a fivespeed manual transmissions may carry identical 
designations yet differ in some respect not shown here 
apparently identical listings may show different or identical 
mileage ratings this occurs because of something not shown on this 
table such as different types of transmissions or other equipment 
for several years epa has reduced the results of its mileage 
tests by constant percentages in an attempt to more closely 
correspond to results achieved on the road the city mileage tests 
are discounted by 10 percent and the highway tests are discounted by 
22 percent the combined mileage shown in this table is calculated 
from the discounted city and highway ratings on the assumption that 
55 percent of the miles driven are in the city 
turbochargers are not shown unless indicated in the name of the

grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply 
monday on the chicago board of trade dragged down by harvest 
pressure and a report the soviet union will import no more grain 
this year 
we were on the defensive all day said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
mild dry weather in the midwest over the weekend gave the corn 
harvest a boost and provided ideal conditions for the maturing 
soybean crop 
forecasts call for little change in the midwestern weather for 
most of this week 
a news report out of moscow that the soviets have completed their 
grain buying for 1989 put pressure on the wheat market a similar 
report surfaced last week 
they might just be talking their position trying to force 
prices lower but some people believed them lespinasse said 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 6 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in september at 382 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with september at 234 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with september at 135 a bushel 
soybeans were 4 cents to 11 cents lower with september at 572 a

corestates financial corp and first 
pennsylvania corp agreed monday to a 730 million merger that rival 
meridian bancorp inc said was less than its own bid for first 
pennsylvania 
the taxfree 1875ashare stock deal also ended an earlier 
agreement for first pennsylvania to be acquired next spring by 
marine midland banks inc the new yorkbased unit of hongkong amp 
shanghai banking corp of hong kong 
the merger subject to shareholder and regulatory approval would 
create a philadelphiabased banking organization with nearly 23 
billion in assets and leading positions in the midatlantic region 
in consumer trust and credit card markets and in processing 
financial transactions 
the stockforstock deal includes all of first pennsylvanias 
nearly 39 million oustanding common shares and equivalents such as 
convertible stock 
first pennsylvania spokesman leslie r butler said readingbased 
meridian had offered 093 shares of its stock for each of first 
pennsylvanias outstanding shares 
based on meridians closing price friday of 22375 that would 
have amounted to about 20875 a share or about 813 million the 
actual value would have depended on the price of meridian stock when 
the deal was completed in six months butler said 
meridian spokeswoman doris piasecki would not confirm the terms 
of the failed offer 
we negotiated the transaction throughout the weekend she 
said we were confident our higher bid would be a good bid 
corestates chairman terrence a larsen said in a statement the 
merger would create an unspecified number of jobs and result in no 
layoffs the deal is targeted for completion by the end of 1990 
corestates said both dilution of pershare earnings in 1990 would 
be limited to 68 percent with a modest improvement in 1991 and a 
strong rise by 1992 
under the plan first pennsylvania bank na would become an 
operating subsidiary of corestates retaining its name as have 
corestates three existing full service banks philadelphia 
national hamilton and new jersey national 
philadelphia national and first pennsylvania banks would be 
realigned to serve specific market segments in the philadelphia 
area first pennsylvania would serve primarily the retail and 
smallbusiness market while philadelphia national would focus on 
wholesale commercial markets 
joel w silverstein an analyst with the advest group in new 
york predicted investors would view the merger favorably 
it will enhance their the banks market position in retail 
banking and middle market commercial lending he said 
trust operations of the merged companies would exceed 100 
billion in administered assets and 70 million aggregate fees per 
year ranking corestates among the top 20 in the nation larsen said 
corestates based in philadelphia since the founding of 
philadelphia national bank in 1803 had total assets of 164 
billion as of june 30 its banking subsidiaries do commercial and 
retail business through 201 domestic and foreign branches and 14 
foreign representative offices 
first pennsylvania the oldest commercial bank in the united 
states traces its roots to the national bank of north america 
founded in 1782 the holding companys total assets june 30 were 
66 billion 
if the merger is approved first pennsylvania chairman george a 
butler would become president of corestates while larsen would 
remain chairman and chief executive officer 
george butler who earlier had discussed retiring in early 1991 
agreed to postpone his retirement and remain as president until the 
end of that year 
robert b palmer vice chairman of corestates and president and 
ceo of philadelphia national bank would become president and ceo of 
first pennsylvania bank frank e reed president and chief 
operating officer of first pennsylvania corp and bank would be 
president and ceo of philadelphia national bank 
corestates projections of savings and 1990 earnings dilution 
were based on normal employee attrition rates in both companies and 
on projected nonpersonnel savings larsen said 
the projections included a very conservative estimate of 
increases in revenues but 80 percent of the dilution would be paid 
through projected savings

cocoa futures prices fell to new lifeofcontract lows monday on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange following the 
international cocoa cartels failure to salvage a derailed 
pricesupport scheme 
on other markets grain and soybean futures fell sharply 
livestock and meat futures were mixed precious metals were lower 
and energy futures were mixed 
cocoa futures settled 54 to 67 lower with the contract for 
delivery in december at 1035 per metric ton all contracts 
established new lifetime lows 
the price drop followed the conclusion saturday of a fruitless 
sixday meeting in london of the international cocoa organization 
whose approximately 40 nationmembers were seeking to resolve 
problems that have severely weakened the cartels ability to support 
cocoa prices 
the icco charged with stabilizing world cocoa prices by 
maintaining a variable buffer stock of the commodity has been 
virtually powerless since february 1988 when the stockpile reached 
its permitted 250000metricton limit 
the organization also has been weakened by the refusal of some 
the major cocoa producers to pay levies on their cocoa exports to 
finance icco operations 
the overall debt to the organization by its 12 producer members 
now stands at 120 million cocoa producers say they cannot afford 
the levies due partly to the historically low price that cocoa 
commands in a world market burdened by five straight years of 
expanding supplies 
negotiators for the producer nations appeared to nearing a 
unified position at the london meeting on friday prompting hope for 
a solution to the iccos problems and the meeting was extended 
through saturday but discord ultimately prevailed said arthur 
stevenson a cocoa market analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
some of the participants at the end didnt even bother to vote 
they just walked out he said this means the international 
cocoa organization cannot be viewed as even a psychological 
pricesupport instrument because it is just not getting support from 
its key members 
further selling was prompted by indications that a proposed sale 
of 500000 metric tons of cocoa from the ivory coast the worlds 
largest producer to the trade house philipp brothers inc had 
fallen through 
grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of 
trade due to harvest pressure and a report the soviet union will 
import no more grain in 1989 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 6 cents lower with september 
at 382 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with september 
at 234 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with 
september at 135 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 11 cents 
lower with september at 572 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange ahead of a monthly agriculture department report 
that showed 4 percent fewer cattle on feedlots as of sept 1 than on 
the same date a year ago 
the number was slightly lower than expected but the usda also 
reported lighterthanexpected marketings of cattle off of feedlots 
last month and analysts said they expected cattle prices to open 
slightly lower tuesday in reaction to that report 
live cattle futures settled 10 cent to 43 cent lower with 
october at 7202 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 
15 cent higher with september at 8352 cents a pound hogs were 02 
cent to 68 cent higher with october at 4165 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 03 cent to 20 cent lower with february at 4820 
cents a pound 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 240 to 250 
lower with october at 36280 a troy ounce silver was 2 cents to 
22 cents lower with september at 5063 a troy ounce 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude oil settled 5 cents to 8 cents lower with october at 1988 a 
barrel heating oil was 23 cent lower to 01 cent higher with 
october at 5572 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was unchanged to 
52 cent higher with october at 5813 cents a gallon

energy futures prices ended mixed monday in 
fairly quiet trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
the october contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil fell 8 cents to 1988 a barrel after 
peaking at 2007 during the session the contract had risen 24 
cents on friday 
among refined products traded on the exchange the october 
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up 052 cent to 
close at 5813 cents a gallon home heating oil for october delivery 
declined 023 cent to 5572 cents a gallon 
oil analysts said trading was featureless as participants began 
to anticipate the coming meeting of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries on saturday 
the market is being cautious said larry lawrence manager of 
options and technical analysis for elders futures inc 
opecs eightmember strategy and pricemonitoring committee is 
scheduled to meet in geneva to discuss current market conditions as 
well as future strategy 
opec officials said after the groups meeting in june that the 
september gathering might turn into a full meeting of all 13 
ministers and could result in a further increase in the cartels 
production ceiling from 195 million barrels 
but more recent speculation is that the committee will focus on 
longterm price and production strategy and wait until later in the 
year to change output levels 
oil prices have weakened since last spring as opec continues to 
exceed its output ceiling but prices have remained firmer than many 
analysts predicted due to strong demand and perceptions that opec 
was trying to rein in production 
nevertheless many analysts believe the current market is 
overbought and that prices could weaken more significantly if opec 
fails to show at this weekends meeting that it plans to act 
decisively to contain overproduction

earlier in arizona california colorado kansas and texas only 
iowa and nebraska feedlots showed increases

japanese automakers are still producing the 
most fuelefficient cars tiny compacts getting up to 55 miles per 
gallon while the list of gas guzzlers is dominated by 
expensive luxurious european models government fuel economy 
figures showed monday 
the vehicle mileage survey based on industry and government 
tests on all 1990 model cars trucks and vans showed little change 
over the previous year although the number of vehicles subject to 
the guzzler tax dropped from 40 to 32 
the tax which can add 3850 to the price of a car kicks in on 
automobiles that get overall fuel efficiency of less than 225 miles 
per gallon 
bob larson branch manager of the epa testing lab in ann arbor 
mich said that overall the nearly 1000 models tested averaged 
24 mpg gallon in combined cityhighway driving 
they ranged from the toprated geo metro xfi a small 
japanesemade car sold by general motors at a combined 55 mpg 
including 58 mpg on the highway to the twoseater lamborghini 
countach which managed only 6 mpg in city driving and 10 mpg on the 
highway 
the mileage results are based on tests conducted by the 
manufacturer under laboratory conditions with about 30 percent of 
the tests verified by the epa larson said the epa figures have been 
adjusted from original laboratory results to more closely reflect 
driving conditions the reductions were 10 percent for city driving 
and 22 percent for highway driving he said 
larson said that while the figures displayed on automobile 
window stickers are adjusted to reflect driving conditions results 
still can vary because of driving habits 
the latest statistics come amid an increased clamor in congress 
and among enivronmentalists to push automakers into hiking the fuel 
efficiency of their cars and trucks not only to save petroleum but 
also to curb the release of automobile pollutants 
in releasing the mileage figures the environmental protection 
agency said the most fuel efficient cars on the list emit about 
onethird of a pound of carbon dioxide per mile traveled while the 
worst gas guzzler releases about twice that 
carbon dioxide is a chief contributor to the socalled 
greenhouse effect which many scientists predict will lead to a 
significant warming of the earth if not checked 
each of the top 10 cars with overall mileage rating of at least 
39 mpg were made outside the united states mostly in japan the 
stingiest usmade car was the ford escort with an overall mileage 
of 38 mpg 
the top 10 cars for the best mileage were three versions of the 
geo metro two versions of the honda civic crx three versions of 
the suzuki swift the daihatsu charade and the dieselpowered 
volkswagon jetta 
the lamborghini was among six tested cars that are subject to the 
maximum 3850 excise tax for poor gas mileage the others facing 
the maximum tax are the ferrari testarossa and four rollsroyce 
models 
rounding out the 10 worst mileage cars were the bmw 750il the 
porsche 928 s4 the audi v8 and the maserati 228 
the only domestic cars subject to the gas guzzler tax were 
two cadillac models the allante and the larger engine 350 cubic 
inches brougham which have combined city and highway mileage of 18 
and 17 mpg respectively and a 500 tax surcharge 
several chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year 
escaped because of mileage improvements in 1990 models these 
included the chrysler tc by maserati and the chrysler new yorker and 
dodge dynasty successor cars to other chrysler models that fell 
under the guzzler tax in 1989 
automakers are required to have an average fuel economy of 275 
mpg for their fleets but that reflects laboratory results for cars 
actually sold and therefore is higher than the average fleet 
figures calculated by the epa for use on widow stickers

the dollar dropped again monday in the aftermath 
of the panicky decline at the end of last week hurt by traders 
fear of centralbank selling and the uncertain effect of an 
impending meeting of finance ministers 
gold prices also fell following gains overseas republic national 
bank quoted gold at 36070 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt vs 
36250 late friday 
money traders said the foreign exchange market was quieter monday 
than last friday when wild rumors and price swings jolted traders 
and wrenched down the dollars value unexpectedly 
traders said that rout convinced other dollar holders to sell 
their holdings monday or at least avoid the market until the 
currencys longterm outlook becomes clearer 
the dollar bulls are hanging on the sidelines said michael 
guarino vice president and chief dealer at the new york branch of 
algemene bank nederland nv the largest dutch bankthe dollar 
bears are taking over they have the central banks in their favor 
thats going to add fuel to the fire 
the central banks of the united states and its principal trading 
allies repeatedly have swooped into the foreign exchange markets 
recently to sell large amounts of dollars in order to keep the 
dollar from rising in value 
a more expensive dollar partly reflects confidence in the us 
economy and the relatively high interest rates offered in this 
country which attract foreign investors but as the dollars value 
rises it hurts american manufacturers by making their products more 
expensive overseas 
some traders said a meeting this weekend of finance ministers 
from the socalled group of seven nations likely would reinforce the 
groups resolve to keep the dollar at present levels or depress it 
further others said it was impossible to speculate intelligently on 
what the g7 nations might do 
at this point i dare say i wouldnt put my neck on the line my 
frame of mind is one minute to one hour said scott horwitz 
senior foreign exchange trader at the bank of bostons new york 
branch i think well see the dollar trade in a range until we get 
new direction from that meeting 
the g7 members meeting in washington include envoys from 
britain canada france japan italy the united states and west 
germany 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14643 japanese yen up 058 yen 
later in london the dollar was quoted at 14585 yen by the time 
trading concluded in new york the dollar fetched 14593 yen down 
from 14635 late friday 
in london one british pound cost 15695 late monday more 
expensive than the 15390 rate late friday later in new york the 
pound fetched 15710 more expensive than its 15660 rate late 
friday

ford motor co the leading lighttruck seller for 
three consecutive years is steering clear of comparing its models 
with the competitors trucks in its new advertising company 
officials said monday 
ford and chevrolet trucks have been battling for sales supremacy 
for years and chevrolet ran a series of ads last year comparing its 
trucks with fords in tugs of war load hauling and switching to 
fourwheeldrive in something chevrolet tagged the ditch of doom 
john vanderzee advertising manager for the ford division said 
monday the company wont trade pot shots using chevys in its 1990 
commercials 
in one ad for 1990 a heavy chain is locked to the bumper of a 
hefty ford fourwheel drive pickup the truck begins to pull and an 
announcer talks about engine size power and competition 
the truck at the other end of the chain pulling equally hard 
also is a ford rather than a competitor and the announcer voices 
the theme the toughest competition we have is ourselves 
one of the fundamental principles of advertising is when you 
are the marketing leader you never mention the competition 
vanderzee said 
ford research indicates potential buyers want facts not staged 
competitions he said 
the consumers really believe these socalled stunts are not 
what they want vanderzee said we would like to think the 
competition is going to get off their kick of taking us on 
chevrolet however is continuing its comparison ads for 1990 
chevrolet sold more than 13 million light trucks compared with 
fords total of more than 12 million in 1985 but ford has led in 
succeeding years 
in 1986 ford sold nearly 14 million trucks while chevrolet sold 
more than 12 million in 1987 ford sold more than 14 million 
versus fewer than 12 million for chevrolet and in 1988 ford sold 
more than 15 million trucks to more than 13 million for chevrolet 
according to fords figures 
although fords truck ads are keeping the gloves on the 
companys car ads arent there are pointed comparisons to features 
and prices of competitors models in television advertisements for 
escort festiva and tempo cars 
two new vehicle introductions will boost fords advertising 
budget for 1990 vanderzee said though he wouldnt give an overall 
figure or a percentage increase 
fords explorer a replacement for the bronco ii utility truck 
and a new escort model both are scheduled for spring introduction 
the new car and truck advertisements will debut oct 5 on 
television in magazines and newspapers

burroughs wellcome co on 
monday announced a 20 percent reduction in the wholesale price of 
azt the only drug approved in the united states for fighting aids 
the company said however it couldnt guarantee that the full 
savings would be passed on to consumers who have been paying 7000 
to 8000 per year for the drug 
the reduction effective immediately reduces the price to the 
wholesale distributor to 120 from 150 per capsule 
louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and human 
services said he was pleased with the companys action he said 
that the price cut combined with recent findings that lower dosages 
may be effective will reduce the cost of azt treatment 
aids activists had been pressing burroughs wellcome to cut the 
cost of azt on thursday five activists chained themselves to a 
banister at the new york stock exchange to protest the drugs cost 
three of the five who were members of the aids coalition to unleash 
power were described as having aids or aidsrelated complex 
they unfurled a banner that read sell wellcome referring to 
burroughs wellcome before they were removed by guards and turned 
over to police burroughs wellcome however is traded over the 
counter and not at the new york stock exchange 
burroughs wellcome spokesman thack brown said the decision to cut 
the price was based on test results showing that people who have hiv 
infection but no symptoms can benefit from the drug 
that means more patients will be using the drugs which 
broadens the financial risk he said at a news conference 
he insisted that protests by aids activists did not affect 
burroughs wellcomes decision 
actually i can say the protests slowed things down a little 
bit he said we had to field inquiries from the media and other 
people about what we planned to do at a time when we were still 
trying to decide what that would be he said 
in april four members of aids coalition to unleash power sealed 
themselves into an office at burroughs wellcome they were arrested 
after authorities broke down a wall charges were later dropped 
peter staley of new york one of the actup members who was 
arrested in april said the 20 percent reduction wasnt enough 
this is a step in the right direction but a very small step 
he said its not enough actup will continue to fight to make sure 
that all aids treatments are provided to all who need them free of 
charge which means we will continue to pressure burroughs wellcome 
for further price reductions 
sue dodd executive director of the arizona aids project a 
nonprofit group in phoenix agreed 
she said she was extremely pleased by the price reduction 
but the drug needs to be affordable for everyone not just the 
chosen few 
jean mcguire of the washington dcbased aids action council 
who signed a protest letter to burroughs welcome a few weeks ago 
said she thought the company was being responsive and acting in good 
faith but it remains to be seen whether its enough 
at the fivecapsulesaday regimen used in recent trials among 
asymptomatic hivinfected patients burroughs wellcomes price for 
azt called retrovir would be 6 a day or about 2200 a year 
that would represent more than a 70 percent reduction in the cost 
of therapy as a result of price decreases and reduced dosage since 
the drug was first marketed the company said 
when the new findings on the broader utility of retrovir were 
announced by the national institutes of health a month ago we 
immediately commenced an evaluation of the feasibility of lowering 
the cost of retrovir to patients said te haigler jr president 
and chief executive officer of burroughs wellcome co 
the company has carefully weighed a number of factors 
including our responsibilities to patients and shareholders the 
very real remaining uncertainties in the marketplace and the vital 
need to fund ongoing research and development programs 
only a limited number of patients met the medical criteria for 
azt use when the drug was approved in 1987 haigler said although 
the precise timing and total number of patients remain uncertain it 
now appears the number of patients on retrovir will be growing 
considerably over time 
the expected growth in patient population coupled with recent 
production economies will reduce somewhat our financial risk and 
will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug 
was first introduced 
since the reduction is in wholesale cost burroughs wellcome 
cannot say how retailers will respond brown said 
we would hope it would be passed along but we cant control 
that he said were going to get out to the wholesalers and 
suppliers tomorrow making adjustments in the prices and we hope 
the retailers will take that as a sign that were working to quickly 
get the price down 
azt was first shown to be effective against hiv infection in 
september 1986 a trial of the drug was halted because of a 
significantly lower mortality rate among patients with aids and 
advanced aidsrelated complex who had received azt during the next 
six months burroughs wellcome made azt available free of charge 
to some 5000 patients 
azt was approved by the food and drug administration in march 
1987

stanford university and the university of 
southern california are targets of a federal probe into whether 
private colleges and universities are violating antitrust laws in 
the setting of tuition and financial aid officials said monday 
the two california universities were asked in recent days to 
forward documents to the us justice department signaling that an 
inquiry that once focused on colleges in the east and midwest had 
been broadened to include california schools 
federal officials said they were looking into whether private 
colleges and universities had engaged in a form of pricefixing by 
comparing notes with other schools before setting tuition and 
determining how much financial aid a student should receive 
officials at other private colleges and universities failed to 
immediately respond to requests for comment and it was unknown 
whether other california schools were targets of the federal probe 
the probe comes as private colleges face increasing pressure to 
justify tuition increases which have far outpaced inflation among 
the highranking officials who have complained about the increases 
is white house chief of staff john sununu the father of eight 
including two in college 
the justice departments antitrust division last week sent 
stanford a civil investigative demand for documents pertaining to 
financial aid and tuition said john schwartz the universitys 
legal counsel 
university provost james rosse said in a statement monday the 
school was complying with the governments request but stanford was 
innocent of any wrongdoing 
stanford has had a policy for many years that forbids exchange 
of current tuition student aid and salary information prior to the 
decisionmaking based on that data he said we are confident 
that the investigation will show our policy to have been effective 
the government has asked stanford and other schools for written 
answers to five questions on how the schools determine tuition and 
scholarships the government also asked for information on expenses 
ranging from travel to salaries along with telephone records 
rosse said the governments request will generate considerable 
legal expense 
christian markey general counsel for usc also confirmed the 
justice department recently asked for financial aid and tuition 
documents but declined further comment 
although stanford officials denied exchanging information prior 
to making tuition decisions undergraduate tuition at stanford and 
usc for the 198990 academic year fall within only a few hundred 
dollars of each other and are similar to tuitions at other 
california colleges 
stanford this year is charging 13569 and usc is charging 
13200 this compares for example to 13150 at pepperdine 
university 13044 at occidental college and 12900 at claremont 
mckenna college 
gina talamona spokeswoman for the justice department in 
washington confirmed the departments antitrust division was 
investigating possible antitrust violations at private colleges and 
universities but she would not discuss the matter further the 
probe apparently does not include public colleges and universities 
were not going to get into specific allegations or schools 
not even geographical areas she said 
but the inquiry first disclosed by officials at elite eastern 
schools apparently is focusing on at least 30 private colleges and 
universities nationwide 
some of the schools responding to justice department requests for 
documents include princeton brown cornell wellesley the 
university of pennsylvania harvard and the university of chicago 
officials at those schools have said

us sen dennis deconcini said monday he is 
returning reelection campaign money raised by american continental 
corp founder charles h keating jr who is being sued for his role 
in failed lincoln savings and loan 
federal regulators on friday filed a 11 billion fraud and 
racketeering civil lawsuit against keating and a number of relatives 
and associates on behalf of lincoln a wholly owned subsidiary of 
american continental of phoenix 
defendants named in the suit included william j keating brother 
of charles keating jr and a director of american continental from 
february 1986 through march 1987 
william keating who is an attorney is president of the detroit 
newspaper agency and chairman of the board of directors of the 
associated press 
the civil lawsuit filed by the federal resolution trust corp 
under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act also 
alleges negligence breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract 
the lawsuit charges fraud in the takeover of lincoln and 
subsequent mismanagement that squandered the thrifts assets 
diverted enormous sums of money to the parent company and 
benefited american continental and its executives at lincolns 
expense 
deconcini an arizona democrat said he would return 48000 
raised by keating because the governments suit raises the serious 
possibility that money from lincoln savings may have been illegally 
funneled into a number of political campaigns 
two us senators from other states said monday they would not 
return contributions another us senator previously returned 
keatingrelated contributions 
deconcini had told reporters friday he would repay the money if 
the charges held up in court but deconcini spokesman bob maynes 
said monday the senator was in the process of issuing checks to 26 
individuals 
i regret that there may be any appearance of impropriety on my 
part deconcini said in all of my relations with the federal 
home loan bank board i was acting in good faith in seeking to 
protect over 1500 arizona jobs 
my actions were not in any way related to the contributions 
raised for my campaign he said 
maynes said the 1500 positions were held by american continental 
employees 
sen john mccain an arizona republican who received 112000 
from keating and associates will return contributions only if a 
court determines they were illegal spokeswoman victoria clark said 
monday 
sen alan cranston dcalif has no intention of returning 
39000 raised by keating for his 1986 campaign cranston spokesman 
murray flander said 
senate banking committee chairman donald riegle dmich also 
reported campaign contributions from executives and other employees 
of keatings company but returned the 76100 after it was 
publicized during his 1988 reelection campaign 
keating a former cincinnati lawyer and associates also gave 
200000 to a nowdefunct committee that paid for us sen john 
glenns political appearances prior to and after the ohio democrats 
unsuccessful 1984 presidential campaign 
glenn said he has no plans to return this or any other 
political contribution 
edwin gray thenchairman of the federal home loan bank board 
and other officials met in 1987 with deconcini mccain glenn and 
cranston to discuss lincoln savings then under examination by the 
federal home loan bank of san francisco 
gray maintains he was asked apparently on keatings behalf to 
revoke a thrift regulation limiting investments 
the senators have denied any wrongdoing and deconcini said 
monday he would not have participated in the meeting if the 
information that is now known about the activities of mr keating 
and american continental had been known to me

parent nwa inc and twa with deltas datas ii system are in the 
preliminary stages the airlines said plans call for the combined 
reservations system to operate as an autonomous company with 
independent management 
the announcement was no surprise to industry analysts and travel 
agents who expected delta to rebound from its failed bid to merge 
its reservations system with industryleader saber owned by 
american airlines parent amr corp plans for that merger were 
dropped after the justice department threatened to file an antitrust 
suit 
the federal agency said the joint operation would harm 
competition in the computerized sale of airline tickets 
robert decker an analyst for duff amp phelps inc in chicago said 
a merger of pars and deltas data ii would be less likely to draw 
justice department opposition because pars is much smaller than 
saber which has 41 percent of the nationwide market of the five 
systems used by airlines and travel agents 
pars is a distant fourth decker said and delta is interested in 
joining it because the data ii system is technologically inferior 
investing in a new system would be too costly he said 
delta has pretty well admitted they dont want to be a 
contender in computerized reservations decker said 
pars was started by twa and joined by northwest about three years 
ago 
dan mcelroy a partner and financial officer of travel 
professionals a travel agency in bloomington said pars is 
primarily known as a pocket player in the computerized ticketing 
industry it is strong in twa and northwest hubs and weak where the 
airlines dont have a presence he said 
deltas participation in pars could add another 2000 to 3000 
travel agencies now carrying the datas ii system mcelroy said 
ivar sigveland of travel professionals which has a pars system 
said there would be no immediate effect on consumers if the merger 
is completed but he said further consolidation in the ticketing 
industry might result in higher costs for travel agents 
you just dont know what the longterm effects are going to be 
when you lose that competition sigveland said 
reservations systems make money from fees charged to airlines 
for instance when a travel agent using a pars system books a flight 
for an american airlines customer american pays pars nearly 2 a 
flight segment decker said a onestop flight consists of two 
segments 
the computer systems the primary channel for the distribution of 
airline tickets provide uptotheminute information about 
schedules fares seat availability hotels car rentals and package 
vacations 
despite a 1986 regulation that says airlines must not favor their 
own flights in computer listings travel agents tend to be more 
loyal to the owner of the system they are using decker said

scientists at boeing co have produced a highly 
efficient solar cell that could lead to improvements in the use of 
the sun to generate electrical power on earth 
the solar cell is the most efficient ever produced according to 
government experts in other words it produces the most electricity 
for the amount of sunshine it receives of any cell 
boeings research was aimed at improving the power supply for 
spacecraft but the new cell is so efficient it may have spinoff 
benefits scientists say 
we were interested in space applications said roger 
gillette a manager in the lab where the device was devloped this 
appears to have spinoff benefits but at present we have no product 
objectives for uses on earth 
the new cell was designed in the boeing high technology centers 
materials and devices laboratory 
low efficiencies of solar power and high costs have limited its 
use mainly to space applications or remote areas on earth where 
conventional power is unavailable or is extremely expensive 
boeings solar cell which achieved an efficiency of 37 percent 
in laboratory tests converts sunshine directly into electricity 
nasa has confirmed the 37 percent efficiency said boeing spokesman 
david suffia 
the previous record was 31 percent accomplished last year at 
sandia national laboratory in albuqueruqe nm the sandia cells 
efficiency was considered phenomenal by experts in the solarenergy 
field 
efficiency is the ratio of electricity produced to the solar 
energy received on the cells surface 
the boeing work is a surprise said don schueler manager of 
solar programs at sandia our work last year was considered a real 
benchmark like the first running of the fourminute mile 
the development is a significant step forward schueler said 
we didnt expect such a big step so soon 
but schueler noted that efficiency is not the only important 
factor when considering commercial applications for solar cells 
there are many other things like cost producibility 
performance that are important with regard to commercial 
development he said 
solar energy plants are used primarily by power utilities in 
sunny parts of the country to supplement the output of coal or 
nuclear plants during peak demand they average less than 15 percent 
efficiency 
doubling that efficiency would cut in half the size of the solar 
panels required to produce the same amount of power that would also 
reduce the amount of land needed for a plant 
smaller solar panels in spacecraft would reduce both weight and 
costs 
boeing has sent some of its solar cells to sandia where they 
will be evaluated in the new mexico sunshine and to nasas lewis 
research center in cleveland where they will be flown in jets above 
much of the atmosphere for testing

soviet aerospace designers met monday with 
gulfstream aerospace corp officials to discuss a joint venture to 
develop a supersonic corporate jet that would hold 10 to 12 
passengers 
gulfstream and officials of sukhoi design bureau said they hope 
to develop a prototype of the jet within three years and begin 
commercial manufacture in five years eventually they said they 
may develop a stretch version that would seat up to 52 
passengers 
under the joint venture the soviets would pick up all costs for 
the project gulfstream a unit of chrysler corp would provide the 
technology developed in the design of its gulfstream iv business 
jet production and assembly would be completed in the soviet union 
the venture was first announced at the paris air show in june 
vm chepkin general designer for the soviet engine manufacturer 
an lulka design bureau made available slides of soviet engine 
designs that were top secret 18 months ago 
gulfstream chairman allen e paulson said part of the soviet 
interest in the 50 million project may stem from a need for foreign 
currency 
they need hard dollars desperately and dont mind spending 
rubles to get them paulson said
