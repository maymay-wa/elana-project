this media generalassociated press poll is 
based on telephone interviews may 1120 with 1143 adults in the 
continental united states phone numbers were selected randomly and 
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent 
birthday a random phenomenon 
the results were weighted to adjust for variations in the 
sample the poll has a 3point margin of error meaning that 19 of 
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if 
every adult american were asked the same questions the error 
margin is larger for subgroups 
there are other sources of potential error in polls including 
the wording and order of questions these are the questions in this 
poll because of rounding sums may not total 100 results from a 
september 1989 poll in which some of the same questions were asked

just a few days ago hungarys foreign 
minister dropped by nato for a chat with western diplomats his 
visit unthinkable a year ago barely caused a stir 
but its significance was not lost on geza jeszenszky one of 
only a handful of high officials of warsaw pact nations to visit 
the headquarters of the north atlantic treaty organization 
as a man growing up in the cold war i never imagined that 
i would step into this building he said 
the political upheavals that have rocked eastern europe have 
also shaken the alliances complex of threestory concrete 
buildings on the outskirts of brussels 
western officials are scrambling to come up with a new role for 
the alliance forged in 1949 to counter the expansionist policy of 
the soviet union it provides a military link across the atlantic 
ocean tying north america to western europe 
president bush and other leaders of the 16 nato nations will 
meet in london this week to launch formally an overhaul of the 
organization to make it appear less threatening to the soviet union 
in doing so the west hopes to win the kremlins acceptance of 
full and immediate membership for a united germany in nato west 
germany belongs to the western alliance but its eastern neighbor 
is in the warsaw pact 
not so long ago nato and the warsaw pact were sworn enemies 
each warned about the military threat posed by the other 
tanks missiles and weapons were counted and compared 
frontline troops were at full alert in case of a surprise attack 
new nuclear weapons were on the drawing board 
but in the past year or so the perception of the military 
threat posed by moscow and its oncestaunch eastbloc allies has 
withered soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has eased western 
fears with his agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his promises 
of reductions in troops and military spending 
moreover the ousting of longtime communist regimes in eastern 
europe has loosened the ties those countries had to the soviet 
union and its military structure 
with the warsaw pact in virtual collapse why bother with nato 
at all 
you dont cancel your home insurance policy just because there 
have been fewer burglaries in your street in the last 12 months 
british prime minister margaret thatcher insisted recently 
us gen john galvin natos top military commander in europe 
said the alliance was needed for at least a decade to keep an eye 
on moscow 
we are going to have to be watchful of a nation that has the 
possibility to destroy us and that is at this point very 
unpredictable he said in a telephone interview 
the allies already have begun revamping the western alliance to 
make it less military and more political although they are vague 
about what it might do differently 
the truth of the matter is no one really knows what a more 
political nato really means said col michael dewar deputy 
director of the international institute for strategic studies in 
london nato is going to be no more or less political in 
substance than it ever was 
a nato diplomat demanding anonymity said im not sure its 
going to develop political attributes it doesnt have instead 
he said the publics perception of the alliance as strictly a 
military machine needed to be changed 
another diplomat also demanding anonymity predicted nato would 
evolve into a place where people exchange ideas and try to come 
to some kind of general direction 
the new nato will be heavily involved in arms control issues and 
play a prominent role in ensuring compliance with disarmament 
accords officials said 
it also may discuss such farflung issues as the environment but 
will probably steer clear of economics issues already handled by 
the european community the 12nation trading bloc also 
headquartered in brussels 
whatever happens all are agreed there will be less emphasis on 
the military side 
there will be fewer soldiers tanks and artillery 
the united states and the soviet union already have agreed to 
pull out thousands of soldiers to get down to 195000 on each side 
in the strategic central region of europe the united states will 
maintain an additional 30000 troops in britain and southern europe 
caps will likely be placed on the stationed forces of other 
nations in the central zone the soviet union also wants limits on 
west germanys army 
the remaining nato armies will be multinational with soldiers 
drawn from different countries 
there will be fewer weapons to maintain 
nato and the warsaw pact are pushing for an arms deal this year 
to reduce sharply tanks artillery and other nonnuclear forces in 
europe 
western officials have said there is less need for battlefield 
nuclear weapons in their arsenal 
the united states has agreed to speed up a timetable with the 
soviet union for negotiating cuts in those arms it has canceled 
plans to build a more powerful lance shortrange missile and a 
modernized 155mm nucleartipped artillery shell 
military strategies will be redone 
some frontline troops as of sunday have been given twice as 
long to react to an enemy attack as they had before 
the policy of forward defense under which nato troops are 
stationed along the western borders will be revised the 
frontline the border between east and west germany will 
disappear shortly 
the wests threat of using nuclear weapons first if faced with a 
massive soviet attack will be reviewed nato officials said no 
decision has yet been made despite us reports that the policy 
will be retained

websters defines recession as a period of 
reduced economic activity federal economists however have more 
technical definitions todays weak economy may not qualify as an 
official recession but for millions of americans this year feels 
an awful lot like a recession at least of the dictionary variety 
this first of a fourpart series examines the nations unofficial 
recession 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
richard lyon and his son tried to make a living 
with a twotruck shipping company but bills outran them the 
business shut down and lyon drove straight into bankruptcy court 
dont tell him the economys not in a recession 
were just one of the statistics now lyon shrugged 
ra ballard went from building 78 homes a year here in 1986 to 
six this year the three savings and loans that financed him each 
were declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators hes 
found it difficult to borrow more money 
i have essentially closed my company down said ballard a 
director of the national association of home builders i thought 
it was only happening to me i thought it was isolated to texas 
arizona and some other problem areas but its not its happening 
everywhere 
a recession not based on officially sanctioned economic 
statistics they show the us economy continues to eke out slow 
growth prolonging the longest peacetime expansion in history 
but in some regions such as the northeast and parts of the 
sunbelt local economies have slipped dramatically in some 
industries most notably housing a recession is clearly under way 
many economists say 
for millions of americans from clerks in debtladen retail 
stores to defense industry machinists facing unemployment and 
truckers and builders like lyon and ballard the times feel like a 
recession an unofficial recession 
official proclamations aside i think for certain sectors and 
certain states it is a recession said robert brusca chief 
financial economist at nikko securities co international in new 
york 
this is not a typical business cycle recession but the 
regional problems may finally drag down the rest of the country 
said albert sindlinger a forecaster whose wallingford pa firm 
tracks household liquidity as a measure of the economys health 
sindlingers survey predicted the last two recessions when it 
found more than 50 percent of us households responded negatively 
to at least one of his key questions dealing with household income 
jobs and business conditions 
that happened again for the first time in january 
historically every time that weve had the nation with over 
50 percent of the population in recession that was the month that 
the government later issued a declaration saying that was when the 
recession started sindlinger said 
consider 
the labor department reported no job growth in the private 
sector during march april and may 
an official forecasting gauge called the index of leading 
economic indicators has remained sluggish this year the gross 
national product the broadest official measure of economic 
activity has been growing at less than a 2 percent annual rate 
since october one of the slowest periods since the 1982 recession 
new home sales have fallen for six months also to the lowest 
level since the recession year 1982 the auto industry is stalled 
and defense contractors are laying off thousands 
bankruptcies are growing they range from the huge corporate 
variety resulting from junkbond debt like that of federated 
department stores to the personal variety resulting from 
unemployment or too many bills 
the latest report on regional economies by the federal 
reserve the nations central bank said most are weak or growing 
only slowly 
still the feds periodic assessment released late last month 
found healthy economies in the northern midwest and the pacific 
coast states 
moreover economists say key ingredients are missing to lay the 
groundwork for a recession most notably the high inflation that 
causes interest rates to jump sharply and bring business to a halt 
they also say the economy today is far more diversified than in the 
past 
if the economy was still as heavily dependent on housing and 
autos as it was in the 60s and 70s then id say were in a 
recession but its not said prudentialbache securities inc 
economist edward yardeni who coined the term rolling recession 
to describe the regional downturns that have swept across the 
country in recent years 
i would still characterize it as a rolling recession 
yardeni said if you want to find recession you can find it but 
its not economywide 
the national association of business economists still predicts 
the economy will skirt a recession through 1991 economist robert 
j eggert whose sedona ariz firm compiles the blue chip 
consensus forecasting report agrees 
i feel very strongly that we will not have a recession as a 
nation this year or next said eggert on the other hand he 
said recessionlike conditions are likely to prevail in some 
industries and regions of the nation its going to seem like a 
recession to some people 
it seems that way in kevin obriens business which grew by a 
record 18 percent last year and this year is up 24 percent over 
that pace customers line up before opening and use a nightdrop 
slot long past closing the number of employees has nearly tripled 
in four years 
obriens shop isnt the hippest hightech firm or video store 
hes the clerk for the us bankruptcy court in phoenix now one of 
the busiest in the nation 
by the looks of the rows of people poring over stacks of 
bankruptcy documents you might say the local economy was in a 
recession 
but like the rest of the nation arizonas economy is growing 
sluggishly a few office buildings are still under construction in 
phoenix state unemployment is running around 53 percent about 
the national average 
it is a very soft economy here said ron simon economist 
with the arizona department of economic security within arizona 
you could say that construction and related industries are in a 
recession but overall we are still growing as a state so we are 
not in a recession as a state but its fragile

like much of the rest of the country arizona faces what some 
economists are calling a credit crunch or a shortage of loan 
money that not only has crimped housing but also other small 
businesses 
superx corp a chain of 130 drug stores in four states sought 
bankruptcy protection after government regulators who seized the 
firms main lender were unwilling to renegotiate debt 
chickenchain el pollo asado was forced to liquidate after 
regulators cut off financing 
they made a bad situation a whole lot worse said ron 
paradise former president of el pollo asado all we needed was 
another 30 days to put a reorganization plan in place 
seven of arizonas 10 sampls are controlled by the federal 
government which must sell or dispose of 15 billion worth of 
assets in the state a survey by the accounting firm kenneth 
leventhal amp co found the worst shortage of credit in arizona in 
nearly two decades 
were virtually redlined in terms of new financing said 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard now a gubernatorial candidate 
but across the country in washington talk of a credit crunch is 
dismissed by alan greenspan the federal reserve chairman and the 
most powerful banker in the country 
nonetheless greenspan acknowledged to congress last month some 
lenders have tightened their practices and this cautious stance 
in the granting of credit could cumulate to threaten the economic 
expansion 
whatever its called the declining availability of credit 
doesnt seem to have drastically affected consumer spending at 
least not yet consumers account for much of the nations economic 
activity 
findings of the university of michigans respected survey 
research center for example show many consumers remain upbeat in 
their outlook 
consumers say these are good times in contrast to the 
volatile 1970s said survey director richard curtin after the 
70s slow and steady are not viewed as negatively as what they 
might have been 
but viewed another way curtins survey barely gets 50 percent 
of consumers polled to say these are good times another prominent 
consumer survey produced by the conference board a new york 
business research group shows consumer confidence dropped 
significantly in june the first serious decline this year 
for those who like to categorize things as boom or bust this 
is difficult because its neither curtin said one of the 
reasons its not a severe bust is because we didnt go into an 
excessive boom 
confident consumers have kept up their spending ways even as 
their personal debt load has increased eggert said thats one 
reason the economy shows signs of strength 
were avoiding a recession by spending eggert said one 
of the reasons for our prosperity is that all three groups 
government consumers and business are still borrowing 
to some economists whether the economy is truly in a recession 
boils down to a question of words definitions and interpretations 
we are limping along and thats different than being 
crippled said brusca it really is a game of semantics but to 
some being in a little bit of a recession is like being a little 
bit pregnant

the official definition of a recession was established by the 
national bureau of economic research a forecasting concern in 
cambridge mass that has been associated with presidential 
advisers arthur burns and martin feldstein and other influential 
economists 
it measures recessions through the gross national product the 
total value at retail prices of all goods and services produced by 
the economy in a given time period adjusted for inflation the 
gnp compiled quarterly by the commerce department is considered 
the broadest measure of economic health 
generally speaking there must be at least two consecutive 
quarters of declines in gnp for the government to acknowledge a 
recession has occurred that hasnt happened since the 198182 
recession 
the most recent gnp figure was issued june 21 when the commerce 
department said growth in the first quarter of this year totaled 
19 percent on an annual basis compared with 11 percent in the 
final three months of 1989

the gogo days of booming economies in 
the northeastern states are gonegone the massachusetts 
miracle is a mirage as bill mallon found even some salvation 
army shelves are nearly bare 
mallon said he made 75000 a year as a selfemployed carpenter 
three years ago but by last november there was no work at all 
as a last resort in his direst moment he turned to the 
salvation army one day recently seeking canned goods to help feed 
his disabled wife and three children and money to pay his utility 
bills 
when your children say hey dad theres no food in the 
house im hungry that really tears you apart mallon said i 
just came here to see if i could get some food 
his story is an extreme but not uncommon example of how the new 
england recession now more than a year old has affected many 
working people with mortgages mouths to feed bills to pay 
economists dont forecast a rebound until next year 
the massachusetts unemployment rate exceeded the national 
average in march for the first time in 10 years new hampshire 
showed a 50 percent increase last year in both bankruptcy filings 
and welfare applications at connecticut banks the number of bad 
loans tripled last year the largest increase nationwide 
the massachusetts salvation army reported that the number of 
people seeking food and financial help had tripled at some of its 
community centers and that food pantries were low 
the slowdown began in the same industries that helped drive the 
boom through the good times computers and housing 
computer companies found their markets squeezed by competitors 
at home and abroad in the past year for example wang 
laboratories inc of lowell mass laid off 8000 employees close 
to 30 percent of its work force the company lost nearly 150 
million for the first three months of 1990 
as builders erected more housing demand dropped massachusetts 
has a fouryear supply of condos estimated between 10000 and 
12000 empty units desperate developers have slashed prices by up 
to 50 percent 
office vacancy rates for multitenant buildings average more 
than 20 percent in connecticut massachusetts new jersey new york 
and pennsylvania coldwell banker commercial real estate services 
reported 
in fairfield county conn home to several major corporate 
headquarters the vacancy rate of 289 percent during the second 
quarter was among the highest in a 55city survey coldwell banker 
said 
real estate problems in turn have helped create a banking 
crisis 
bank of new england corp lost more than 1 billion last year 
much of it in bad property loans the bank plans to eliminate more 
than 5600 jobs this year 
problem loans and repossessed real estate have nearly doubled at 
northeast banks in the past three years from 183 billion 153 
percent of total assets in 1986 to more than 36 billion or 279 
percent of total assets by the end of 1989 said veribanc inc a 
wakefield mass bank rating firm 
problems with real estate loans are dragging down banks 
said warren heller research director of veribanc new england 
hasnt reached bottom 
five banks or thrifts in the northeast have failed already this 
year two in the first eight days of june in april the 
government seized home owners savings bank in boston the largest 
savings and loan in massachusetts 
by the end of last year 32 banks in massachusetts and 
connecticut were losing money so fast they risked having their 
equity wiped out within a year veribanc said 
still analysts say the recession in new england is not as 
severe as the depression that rocked the southwest after the 
collapse of oil and savingsandloans some say this downturn may 
not even be as severe as earlier recessions in the region 
the massachusetts unemployment rate was 55 percent in june but 
thats half the 11 percent rate of the early 1970s when the state 
verged on disaster 
but bankruptcy filings and foreclosures on real estate are on 
the rise 
in massachusetts bankruptcy filings nearly doubled in the first 
four months of this year to 2474 according to banker amp tradesman 
a weekly banking and real estate trade publication 
banks have foreclosed on more than 2000 properties during the 
first four months of the year double last years pace 
in connecticut where defense contractors already have laid off 
hundreds of workers real estate developers ranked fourth in the 
nation in loan defaults 
one bright exception is maine with lower labor and energy 
costs state employment grew by 31 percent last year vs 02 
percent for the rest of the northeast many businesses are shifting 
from southern to northern new england because of cheap land and 
building costs as well as affordable housing 
beyond maine the weak economies translate into problems for 
state legislatures too sales tax and other collections have 
fallen short of projections in several states yielding large 
budget deficits tax increases and more layoffs 
new york state passed a record 18 billion in new taxes an 
increase of 64 percent over last year massachusetts residents 
face more than 1 billion in tax increases newly elected new 
jersey gov jim florio has proposed about 14 billion in new 
taxes along with 3000 layoffs in state government 
connecticuts revenues have been especially hard hit by lower 
company profits that have cut into the states corporation taxes a 
900 million increase in taxes last year made gov william a 
oneill so unpopular he was among three democratic governors in the 
northeast to decide against seeking reelection this year 
a decade ago the three governors were riding a wave of economic 
growth to political heights but now with a reversal of their 
fortunes theyve decided to bow out rather than face defeat 
gov michael s dukakis won the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination partly on the strength of the massachusetts miracle 
which began unraveling even during his white house campaign he 
announced more than a year ago that he would not seek a third 
consecutive term 
vermonts madeleine kunin announced in april she wont seek a 
fourth twoyear term the vermont legislature enacted 50 million 
in tax increases to balance a sharply cut budget 
higher taxes are of secondary concern to mallon the carpenter 
assisted by the salvation army 
in the last few weeks mallon said hes found some irregular 
work though hes had to cut his fees by half its not 
gangbusters but its something for the short range he said 
beyond that i dont know 
hes still behind in his mortgage as well as telephone gas and 
electric bills he had to drop his life insurance because other 
bills took priority 
bankers dont have much sympathy 
the banks used to let you go three four months if you got 
behind in your mortgage he said now theyre snapping them 
right up bad loans have gotten them in their own mess

its been described as the largest ongoing civil 
engineering project a multibilliondollar link that will help 
revolutionize europes economy and physically end britains 
historic isolation a dream born in napoleons day 
the chunnel between britain and france is halfdug and 
scheduled to open on time in three years but the threetunnel 
thoroughfare under the english channel is almost 60 percent over 
budget embroiled in a contractor dispute and scrambling for more 
investment money 
the project also has raised increasing hostility among many 
britons who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the 
continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals 
we will have the money to finish the project says alastair 
morton british deputy chairman of eurotunnel the privately owned 
anglofrench company overseeing the work 
the chunnels debut scheduled for june 15 1993 will come six 
months after the 12nation european community formally drops 
remaining trade barriers becoming a unified marketplace of 320 
million consumers but the projects success hinges on much more 
than just finishing it 
while the french are forging ahead with a highspeed rail link 
to their end of the tunnel for example stateowned british rail 
is dragging 
britain becomes branch line of europe a guardian newspaper 
headline declared after the government announced june 14 that it 
would not fund a highspeed link between london and the british end 
of the tunnel 
its not the first time the idea of a tunnel has confronted 
britains island identity 
the british resisted an undersea bond with the continent 
envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a french engineer named albert 
mathieu napoleon wanted to build it but britain warned him off 
tunneling actually was started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and 
1974 but they were scrapped 
the chunnel project also has been marred by eight accidental 
deaths on the site 
the british public demonstrates little enthusiasm for the 
chunnel random samplings elicit fears that it will import rabies 
terrorists invading armies 
there is an attitude in france that this is a great project in 
the national interest in this country the attitude to these 
projects tends to be the reverse morton told a recent news 
conference 
eurotunnel chairman andre benard said the company has provided 
for any foreseeable problems but stressed we always made it 
very clear that this was a risk project 
giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each 
other from folkestone england and calais france with the first 
underground meeting expected in november in the service tunnel 
between the rail tunnels 
tunneling is three months ahead of schedule on the french side 
a week behind on the british as of midjune workers had dug 532 
of the total 919 miles 
chunnel trains will carry passengers cars and freight between 
london and paris in about three hours roughly the same time as a 
flight including ground travel and at least twice as fast as a 
carferry journey 
eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent 
of britains nonoil trade will pass through the tunnel in the 
first year the civil aviation authority says the tunnel should 
divert 5 million out of 53 million air passengers annually 
this past wednesday shareholders approved a sale of an extra 
906 million worth of stock to existing shareholders who already 
have bought 17 billion worth that step could clear the way for a 
bank syndicates approval of additional credit eurotunnel has 
requested from 86 billion to 12 billion 
assuming banks approve the project would have a total of about 
146 billion in debt and equity financing the company most 
recently estimated it would cost 131 billion to complete vs 
83 billion forecast initially 
history dictates that that will not be the last figure we 
hear but the order of magnitude of increase will slow down said 
richard hannah a transport analyst with the london investment firm 
ubs phillips and drew he expected the extra financing to come 
through 
its one of these situations where the more money you put in 
the more you have to spend or else youre walking away from 
billions of pounds hannah said 
eurotunnel says it doesnt expect to profit before the end of 
the century and probably wont pay shareholders a dividend until 
1999 four years later than envisioned 
but stockholders havent fared badly the shares first traded 
in november 1987 at about 6 have traded recently at 855 the 
more urgent worries for eurotunnel have been costs creditors and 
contractor feuds 
in october concern about the rising price tag drove 
eurotunnels banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months 
until the company reached a truce with transmanche link the 
consortium of 10 british and french contractors doing the 
construction over responsibility for 17 billion in overruns 
the problems led to eurotunnels second management shakeup since 
1987 
the british governments refusal to finance a rail link has 
presented another big obstacle 
eurotunnel says it can survive without a new link but clearly 
it stands to lose business if travelers have to dawdle through the 
tangled commuter network of southern england to reach the tunnel 
the prevailing scene hardly conveys an impression of history 
being made commented the conservative daily telegraph 
jimmy knapp general secretary of the national union of 
railwaymen said the decision is an unmitigated disaster for 
british industry and for the british people as we approach the 1992 
singlemarket economy 
british rail says it will go on studying options but a new line 
is not expected this century 
british industrialists say they are worried that poor rail links 
will lose them export markets but prime minister margaret 
thatcher for whom market forces are a cornerstone of policy is 
adamant that she wont spend taxpayers money on a rail link 
the french government on the contrary is spending roughly 28 
billion building 210 miles of rail from paris to the tunnel with a 
branch to brussels where the ec is headquartered trains capable 
of traveling 190 mph will link the tunnels freight and passengers 
to another planned highspeed system 
one reason the french are enthusiastic is that the tunnel 
surfaces in one of the most depressed areas of france 
on the other hand residents of kent in englands rural and 
prosperous southeast have campaigned strenuously against having 
highspeed trains screaming through their back yards

power endorse the principle of private property and make other 
major reforms but the countrys economic problems have worsened in 
that time and he now faces charges from both traditionalminded 
communists and radical reformers that his policy is paralyzed and 
that he has lost the initiative

demoted to handling the unenviable agriculture portfolio by

ella fitzgerald fighting a cold during her jvc 
jazz festival concert this year has to be one of the worlds most 
endearing performers 
the audience in avery fisher hall friday night loved everything 
she sang and roared approval just as loudly when shed say isnt 
that a pretty song in her sweetly modest girlish speaking voice 
you have to forgive me ladies and gentlemen she said once 
my sinus is up she complained of heat though the 
airconditioning was chilling the audience she wore a gown with 
skirt swirling gracefully over pants and carried a handkerchief for 
her nose 
miss fitzgerald didnt stint her audience she sang with her 
trio pianist mike wofford bassist keter betts and drummer bobby 
durham for an hour in the first half of the program guitarist joe 
pass played four numbers to start the second half then joined miss 
fitzgerand and trio for the rest of the evening 
her best songs of the first half were the last two angel 
eyes and roy eldridges little jazz in which her scatting 
sounded free and she ended triumphantly high her previous problem 
had been hitting low notes 
pass started one number with complexity thats a key the 
singer asked adding we never know what were going to sing when 
we come out here we hope you recognize it the audience laughed 
the way one does in the livingroom of an old friend 
at another time she said this is cole porter right and 
after a pause said youre laughing at me in a tone indicating 
she was speaking to good friends 
her spark caught fire in sophisticated lady miss fitzgerald 
swung it with feeling and volume both her low and high notes 
clear the spark stayed lighted from then on through body and 
soul the man i love teach me tonight which she said 
was requested 
she sang take the a train inserting a bit of drop me off

con varnabas doesnt let his work go to 
his head but it adorns many of the bestcoiffed attorneys in the 
country 
varnabas 47 is australias last wigmaker to the bar sort of 
the equivalent of the royal dressmaker 
he works out of his oneroom tailors shop in sydney where he 
also makes other apparel for barristers its a centuriesold craft 
that he learned 31 years ago from a tailor in london 
the painstaking process requires turning long strands of 
imported horse or yak hair into the wigs that put the pomp and 
ceremony into the legal profession 
you must have the right contacts to get the hair varnabas 
said when i need some i ring my brother in london who gets 
them from the man who taught me to make wigs where he gets them 
we dont know but we think he gets the yaks hair for the judges 
wigs from switzerland 
wigs are required of members of the bar in court according to 
the theory that the law should be anonymous and that everyone from 
the youngest attorney to the mostsenior partner should look the 
same 
but of course there is some variation from one attorney to 
another some sport their wigs at a jaunty angle and an older wig 
can actually be a mark of distinction since horse hair turns 
green with age the greener the wig the more experienced the 
lawyer 
as a result most attorneys hang on to the same wig throughout 
their careers many even handing them down through the generations 
varnabas recently renovated one that was more than 100 years old 
attorney clive evatt found it impossible to carry on his 
familys wig tradition when he followed his father clive evatt 
sr to the bar 
my father got his passed down from someone else in 1924 he 
said so by the time i arrived at the bar in 1956 it was so 
battered that he was the only one who had the courage to wear it 
so i had to get a new one 
an attorneys wig starts at about 750 us for 35 hours of 
work a judges wig can cost 1420 us

ebrahim najafi went to sleep looking 
forward to his wedding the following night to a girl from the next 
street in this mountain village 
their parents were discussing the wedding plans in the next 
room and the girls aunt was staying up late to put the finishing 
touches on the bridal dress 
now the wouldbe bride is dead and najafis home is a pile of 
crumbling mud bricks and bamboo sticks clinging to a mountainside 
najafi a 24yearold war veteran doesnt know what to do after 
he finishes picking through the rubble of his home 
he was an army ambulance driver during the iraniraq war but he 
was only doing odd jobs around the village before the quake 
were not able to make a new house by ourselves said his 
father gholamhossein a retired army master sergeant with whom 
najafi lived 
the najafis have no idea if they will ever get such help the 
iranian government has promised to rebuild manjil a much larger 
town six miles away in the valley below 
more than half a million iranians have been left homeless by the 
earthquake harzevil is but one of 300 villages around manjil the 
area hardest hit 
a dutch relief worker who asked not to be identified praised the 
iranian relief effort and said many survivors he had encountered 
were surprisingly optimistic he said he didnt find the widespread 
depression he saw in soviet armenia after the 1988 earthquake there 
as in other towns and villages the iranian red crescent society 
has put up tents to house the villagers within walking distance of 
their destroyed homes 
harzevil was a quiet place of about 500 families many of them 
related 
many of the men worked in the power plant at loshan a few miles 
away some of the residents added to their income by selling the 
olives and walnuts grown on the slopes below a few were shepherds 
but the power plant is out of service and olive oil and shoe 
factories to the north other major employers in the region were 
destroyed 
gholamreza vefaii 65 appeared perplexed as he led a reporter 
and a photographer along the dark red dirt paths of the village 
which climbs steeply up the side of the mountain 
i dont know if ill ever see it rebuilt he said as he 
pointed out the rubble of what was once his tea house one of two 
such meeting places in the village 
he said there were about 2500 people in the village and that 
all but 100 were killed another man says the death toll was 1500 
the school was destroyed and the mosque built since the 1979 
revolution and the fanciest building in the village was heavily 
damaged but since the quake occurred in the middle of the night 
no one was injured in those buildings 
tahere amadi 26 expects to come back one day but she doesnt 
plan to wait here for any rebuilding she is taking her five 
children to tehran 180 miles to the southeast to stay with her 
brother while her husband and father both shepherds remain here 
to tend sheep 
ive heard the whole mountain is sliding down she said 
referring to rumors prompted by hundreds of aftershocks that have 
occurred since the quake 
ive also heard that there will be lots of disease she 
said sitting amid piles of dishes appliances and other 
possessions pulled from the rubble of her home 
she will soon be joining the procession of pickup trucks full of 
parents goods and children going to the capital 
mrs amadi feels lucky that she and her family escaped harm 
they were sleeping in one half of the house when they heard the 
other half collapse they raced outside just as their side fell in 
abbas hakimi looked dejected and exhausted but he kept trying 
to make order of what was left of his house and possessions 
hakimis parents and sister and her seven children were among 
the 19 members of his family who perished it was the sisters 
eldest daughter puneh who was to be the bride of najafi 
hakimi said he wasnt getting enough food or water he said he 
didnt know how he would earn a living now to support his wife and 
two children because his taxicab was crushed where it was parked 
next to the mosque

president daniel arap mois word has been 
political law for years in this oneparty state but it grows 
steadily more difficult for him to stem demands for political 
pluralism 
a loose alliance of churchmen lawyers and politicians ignored 
his latest order to stop campaigning for a multiparty democracy 
its leaders continued meeting with journalists and issuing press 
releases 
they have suffered telephoned threats open police surveillance 
and condemnation in parliament 
critics say the situation belies kenyas image as a stable 
democracy and describe the govermnent of moi and his kenya african 
national union party as increasingly corrupt and authoritarian 
it is a very serious situation said gibson kamau kuria a 
human rights lawyer and former political detainee the government 
is not respecting the laws of the country if the threat continues 
were witnessing the beginning of the end of a civil society as we 
know it in kenya 
kuria and 18 other lawyers signed a document calling for a legal 
opposition to keep the government on its toes and to keep it 
awake to the rights freedoms and aspirations of the people 
kenya has been at peace since independence from britain in 1963 
it often is cited as an example of stability and prosperity on a 
continent known more for guerrilla warfare military juntas and 
corrupt dictatorship 
it became a oneparty state in effect when its first president 
jomo kenyatta proscribed the only opposition party in 1969 it 
became one by law in 1982 with a constitutional amendment that 
banned opposition parties even though none existed 
demands for change began jan 1 in an address by the rev 
timothy njhoya long a critic of the government the presbyterian 
pastor urged africans to reflect on the experience of eastern 
europe and choose multiparty democracy 
in may two former cabinet ministers charles rubia and kenneth 
matiba took the message to a news conference they have been 
followed ever since by plainclothes security agents but continue 
demanding that the government allow a public meeting on the 
question 
my own view is there is overwhelming support for allowing a 
political opposition but i want to put it to the test matiba 
said in an interview moi has rejected what he terms foreign 
ideologies peddled by some unpatriotic people with borrowed 
brains and said those who tried to divide the nation would be 
hunted down like rats 
he claims the existence of about 40 tribes in kenya would invite 
tribalbased parties ethnic divisions and even tribal warfare 
critics say his rigidity signals political stagnation that could 
lead to mass unrest 
i see problems and i see trouble and my children have no 
future unless things change matiba said 
a leading cleric who spoke on condition his name be withheld 
said simply the situation is so explosive 
roman catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter read from 
pulpits throughout the country that decried corruption election 
rigging and the widening gap between rich and the poor onethird 
of the kenyas 23 million people are catholics 
they joined the lawyers in expressing concern about what they 
see as a trend toward an unfettered presidency 
constitutional amendments in the last three years have increased 
the time police may hold suspects without charge from 48 hours to 
14 days and removed security of tenure from judges and government 
auditors making them susceptible to political pressure 
they have gone toward establishing a totalitarian dictatorial 
system of government said gitobu imanyara a prominent lawyer 
and editor of the nairobi law monthly 
he characterized governments interference with news media 
efforts to cover the pluralism issue as official censorship police 
have broken up news conferences seized notebooks and film and 
detained two kenyan journalists for questioning 
nairobis police chief said later that officers had been ordered 
to monitor news conferences halt any they consider illegal and 
make arrests without warrants if necessary 
the catholic bishops said they feared widespread abuses could 
occur under the guise of state security in the week they issued 
the letter journalists were harassed repeatedly and two of 
matibas unarmed bodyguards were arrested without charge 
if left unchecked the letter said the situation could lead to 
political murders unlawful home searches arbitrary detentions 
confessions under torture and death squad actions that escape the 
control of the public forces of order

republicans are out to an early lead in 
the ohio governors race as the gop nominee tries to blame his 
democratic rival for the ills of a state government he likens to a 
dirty sock 
it stinks says george voinovich who in january ended his 
10year tenure as mayor of cleveland 
the democratic nominee state attorney general anthony j 
celebrezze jr is keeping his distance from outgoing democratic 
gov richard celeste and hoping to gain votes with his newfound 
support for legalized abortion 
with celeste having to step aside after two terms both parties 
want to control the governors mansion when legislative and 
congressional districts are redrawn next year based on the results 
of the 1990 census nationally the gop sees the ohio race as one 
of its best opportunities to pick up a state now in democratic 
hands 
ohio republicans have not won a statewide office except supreme 
court since 1978 but voinovich has history on his side no 
democrat has succeeded another democrat as governor of ohio since 
1935 
the most recent polls show voinovich with leads of 9to13 
percentage points the celebrezze campaign has stumbled through 
organizational changes and been distracted by reports of 
mismanagement within agencies controlled by the attorney general 
voinovich 53 has built his campaign around a promise to bring 
private business expertise to government he claims credit for 
rescuing cleveland from budget woes that in the late 1970s plunged 
the city into default 
celebrezze insists that cleveland rode the crest of a national 
and state economic recovery and does not owe its revival to 
voinovich 
youll find that when a number of critical decisions were 
made george voinovich wasnt even there celebrezze says 
although the bulk of voinovichs political career has been spent 
in cleveland he is well known throughout the state he served 
briefly as lieutenant governor in 1979 and was the party 
standardbearer in a futile 1988 bid to unseat democratic sen 
howard metzenbaum 
celebrezze 48 is the son of a former cleveland mayor who 
served in president kennedys cabinet he has held statewide office 
since 1979 and has been attorney general since 1983 
he earned a reputation for integrity in the attorney generals 
office and before that as secretary of state only to have it 
called into question early in the campaign 
voinovich claims celebrezze should have investigated conflict of 
interest charges that have swirled around democrats in the nearly 
eight years they have been in power in ohios capital but 
celebrezze points out that ohio law empowers him to investigate 
civil cases only 
the attorney general himself was stung by allegations of 
mismanagement within the states bureau of criminal identification 
and investigation an arm of his office he also admitted he used a 
state van to haul old cars that he worked on as a hobby 
celebrezze reimbursed the state 700 blaming the lapse in 
judgment on an idiosyncrasy that i have 
while both candidates say they want to campaign on issues they 
have shown little contrast except on the question of abortion 
celebrezze has switched his position from antiabortion to 
prochoice voinovich opposes abortion but last year altered his 
position to support abortions in cases of rape and incest or to 
save the life of the mother 
statewide polls have yet to show any consensus among ohio voters 
on the abortion question but celeste who is barred from seeking 
a third straight term says its my hunch that the no 1 issue 
that moves votes is choice 
the campaigns of both candidates are wellfinanced with each 
side expecting to spend 5 million to 10 million both reported 
having more than 22 million in midjune 
in 1988 voinovich waged a negative campaign against metzenbaum 
but his effort to depict the democrat as soft on child pornography 
backfired when metzenbaum and many of the states newspapers 
accused voinovich of a smear 
celebrezze claims voinovichs hiring of media consultant roger 
ailes shows he has another such campaign in mind celebrezze said 
ailes tries to define you before you can define yourself to 
voters i expect him to try the same thing in this campaign 
voinovich brushes aside notions of a negative campaign saying 
its all going to be positive

democrats say they see renewed signs of hope 
of winning the white house in 1992 largely because of the 
potential political travails facing the man who beat them so 
soundly in 1988 
moreover they now say the numbers of that crushing defeat are 
not really as bad as they appeared at first blush 
the party leaders wound up their weekend meeting in portland 
ore professing to be on a roll and eager to adopt a more 
aggressive stance against a republican president and party they 
maintain is being torn by festering internal strife a malady more 
often associated with democrats 
their next order of business is to select the site for their 
1992 convention party officials say it will be new york city 
barring a lastminute snag 
we have got a republican party that is unraveling being torn 
asunder democratic chairman ronald brown said in an interview 
before leaving portland they no longer have the cold war and 
taxes to run on and we as democrats are beginning to speak with one 
voice 
for all the newfound optimism there remained plenty of 
discouraging signs for democrats to hash over at their meeting of 
state party leaders bush remains at nearrecord highs in 
favorability polls voters still express more faith in republicans 
ability to manage the economy and the gop still far surpasses the 
democrats in raising money 
yet the state chairmen and national party officials see a chance 
to capitalize on presidents bush abandonment of his no new 
taxes pledge his veto of family leave legislation and his 
handling of the savings and loan crisis 
after months of moaning about bushs perceived invincibility 
democrats suddenly are talking of mounting a serious challenge in 
1992 
much of the optimism is based on growing satisfaction among the 
state leaders with brown who after 18 months on the job appears 
ready and more willing to fill a partisan void often felt within 
the party because of the cooperative style of democratic 
congressional leaders 
there is a growing sense of anger that is causing things to 
break politically said john marino the new york state 
democratic chairman the break hasnt come our way yet but its 
there and we have to step into the void with a saleable message 
the democrats took the unusual step in portland of publicly 
dissecting the disastrous 1988 campaign of party nominee michael 
dukakis to underscore the theme that victory in 1992 is not as far 
away as generally perceived 
with a series of colorful charts and maps party political 
director paul tully showed the state chairmen what he said 
initially came as a shock to him that despite winning only 10 
states dukakis got more votes in 324 of the nations 436 
congressional districts than walter mondale did in 1984 and that 
bush got fewer than ronald reagan 
brown has staked his reputation as chairman on preventing a 
repeat of 1988 when dukakis sent primary campaign aides into 
unfamiliar states to run the general election in most cases 
ignoring veteran local leaders 
were watching a drama of failed leadership in the white 
house said ohio gov richard celeste who pumped up the state 
leaders with a populist rallying cry it is our job as democrats 
to stand up and point out the differences between us and them 
although bushs reversal on taxes presents the democrats with an 
unexpected political opportunity they face risks of their own in 
the ongoing budget talks 
in exchange for his concession on taxes bush is seeking curbs 
on social security and other entitlements support of which long 
has been the breadandbutter of democratic rhetoric 
we have to be very careful here in this time of 
opportunity said ohio democratic chairman james ruvolo if the 
public perceives the rich get a better deal out of these talks than 
the middle class then we as a party will have a major problem but 
right now things are looking up for us

if you think nato has problems take a 
look at the warsaw pact 
one country east germany is about to switch to the other side 
another country hungary wants out 
about the only thing all seven member states agree on is that 
the warsaw pact did not play a very constructive role in its past 
35 years and now it must be radically changed 
the virtual collapse of the warsaw pact will concern leaders of 
the north atlantic treaty organization gathering thursday and 
friday in london to discuss the future of the western military 
alliance 
the decline of the sovietdominated military and political 
alliance calls into question the usefulness of nato which was 
created primarily as a shield against attacks by the soviet union 
and its east european satellites 
the polish government newspaper rzeczpospolita summed up the 
state of the eastern alliance earlier this month 
the warsaw pact created in 1955 undoubtedly has lost the cold 
war and now faces the prospect of total disintegration if it 
is to survive it must be seriously restructured 
the warsaw pacts highest body its political consultative 
committee met in moscow on june 7 and decided the pact would 
deemphasize its military role and concentrate on being a political 
partnership 
what that means will be considered by a commission from all 
seven countries meeting later this month in prague 
for now the pact continues to hang on 
what should be said at this point is that all of the warsaw 
treaty bodies including the military ones are functioning there 
is no doubt about it said piotr switalski a specialist on 
international organizations at the polish ministry of foreign 
affairs 
internal differences exist he said but the members have agreed 
to avoid any radical steps until the commission meeting in july and 
the final decision of the political consultative committee in the 
fall 
if the pact survives it appears five states will belong the 
soviet union poland czechoslovakia romania and bulgaria 
east germanys membership almost certainly will end when full 
german unification takes place perhaps as early as this year a 
soviet proposal that germany be simultaneously a member of both 
alliances has engendered no enthusiasm from west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and the nato allies who want the united germany fully 
engaged in nato 
also ready to bolt as soon as possible is hungary whose 
parliament voted unanimously last week for the government to begin 
negotiations on its withdrawal meanwhile hungarian troops will 
not take part in warsaw pact maneuvers and no allied maneuvers can 
be held on hungarian soil 
hungarians hold bitter memories of the 1956 soviet invasion of 
their country and do not look at the west as their enemy so now 
membership in the pact is redundant and does not meet hungarys 
needs if it ever did said new foreign minister geza 
jeszenszy 
faced with hardline criticism at home that the soviet union let 
slip its grip on eastern europe soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze has recently reiterated that the warsaw pact has 
been and will remain intact as long as it meets the real needs of 
its member states 
but he admitted that the alliance has failed to keep up with 
the times and needs to modernize and perfect its military and 
political organization 
to make the warsaw pact more palatable to its allies soviet 
defense experts are considering rotating the top military command 
post among the member countries instead of monopolizing it 
another proposal is to create an international secretariat like 
natos brussels office where permanent delegations from each 
member state could share in decisions 
despite such concessions both poland and czechoslovakia are on 
record as seeking the eventual creation of an alleuropean security 
organization that would end the continents 45year division 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel whose country was invaded 
by five of its six allies in 1968 calls for disbanding both 
nato and the warsaw treaty his government has negotiated 
withdrawal of all 73500 soviet troops on its soil by next june and 
plans dramatic cuts in the czechoslovak army 
switalski said experts are still formulating polands stance 
toward the pact poland has suffered repeated invasions from both 
russia and germany making the solidarityled government wary of 
leaving the warsaw pacts protective umbrella before a new one is 
put up 
there will be room in it for us as long as it comprises a 
large group of countries and is a true partnership deputy 
defense minister janusz onyszkiewicz said recently

mikhail s gorbachev could lose his job as head of 
the communist party this week ousted by democratic reforms that 
have allowed hardliners to tighten their grip on the party 
gorbachev had intended to use this weeks 28th congress of the 
soviet communist party to try to further democratize the party 
accelerating reforms and ridding top party bodies of opponents 
he wants delegates to change party statutes and to endorse major 
changes in the top party bodies the 12member politburo and the 
249member central committee 
for the first time in history however the party leader has 
surrendered some control over the agenda and delegate selection 
conservatives say they plan to try to force gorbachev out of his 
job as party general secretary although he would retain the newly 
expanded post of soviet president 
gorbachev has sought to shift authority from the party to the 
government but loyalty to the party remains strong in the 
military the kgb security police and government bodies 
losing control of the party would jeopardize his reforms and 
career 
if the two posts were to be separated now in order to satisfy 
some peoples slogans the country could end up with anarchy and 
confrontation he has said 
whether or not conservatives actually follow through with the 
threats to dump gorbachev such open talk is unprecedented in 72 
years of soviet history 
no one can safely guess the outcome although one top western 
diplomat ventured friday that it looks incredibly likely that 
gorbachev will be reelected party leader 
no party leader has ever been ousted by a party congress and 
the public threats by hardliners in the past two weeks underscore 
the openness that gorbachev has introduced into the party 
there have been only three other parallels in soviet history 
and they are not exact said thane gustafson a professor at 
georgetown university 
the first was the 10th party congress in 1921 when vladimir 
lenin allied himself with bureaucrats to defeat the workers 
opposition the second was the 17th party congress in 1934 when 
the heavyhanded policies of josef stalin came under fire 
prompting him to launch a murderous purge of party ranks the 
following year 
and the third was the 20th party congress in 1956 when nikita 
s khrushchev was so uncertain of the reaction that he waited until 
the last day to deliver a secret speech condemning stalin 
hardliners failed in a conspiracy to oust him in 1957 but 
succeeded in 1964 
in the past the party leader controlled the agenda and could 
block any vote that may have directly threatened his job or 
policies 
but gorbachev may lose control of the agenda in the same way 
that he lost control last month of the founding congress of the 
communist party of the russian republic which provided hardliners 
with a national tribune 
this is quite an unprecedented setting gustafson said 
the factor is the creation of the russian communist party which 
gives an organizational base to the conservative leadership 
the 2700 delegates to the russian party congress will also 
attend the national congress where they constitute a majority of 
the 4683 delegates 
at the russian congress hardliner alexander melnikov from 
western siberia called for the resignation of the entire 
leadership including gorbachev 
and the leading conservative on the politburo yegor k 
ligachev said the same person could not head the party and act as 
president 
it is impossible to run the party this guiding force without 
devoting full time to it ligachev said in a nationally televised 
speech on june 20 
responding to the criticism gorbachev acknowledged that there 
may be a new general secretary or chairman of the party elected 
at the congress 
so far no one has come forward to challenge gorbachev 
ligachev was quoted by a newspaper last week as saying he had 
absolute confidence in gorbachevs authority and that the 
congress would focus on the fate of the country and the party 
rather than on individuals 
in a central committee meeting on friday however some members 
said they would ask the congress to discuss whether one person 
could handle both jobs as president and party leader said 
alexander kapto a senior kremlin official 
the party congress is expected to last 10 days said kapto and 
gorbachevs fate might not be decided until the end 
hints of the outcome might be visible in the delegates reaction 
to the platform and rules changes that gorbachev is pushing 
the reformers want to change the title of the party leader from 
general secretary to chairman and create either one or two 
deputies to run daytoday business the formula would allow 
gorbachev to keep the top post ceding the deputies slots to a 
conservative and a reformer as a compromise

carbon monoxide leaking from an exhaust 
pipe on a hot tub furnace spread through a motel sunday sending at

60 to 90 receiving oxygen 
some of the victims were held for as long as two hours but all 
were released sunday

elliot said some of her friends were found sick in their room 
they looked terrible elliot said when i saw my friends 
i thought they were dying they thought they were both having heart 
attacks 
officials said they had tentatively identified the cause of the 
gas release as a leaky exhaust flue on a furnace that heats water 
for the buildings hot tub 
authorities arrived at the motel shortly after 8 am responding 
to a call that a woman was sick emergency technician bryan reichel 
said

blue skies blue seas white sand the beach 
is back for now at least 
the vista from the belmar boardwalk captures a perfect summers 
day but few people here can forget the summer of 1988 when the 
tide ran brown and carried sewage and syringes onto abandoned 
shores 
this year the water is clear and ocean breezes carry the scent 
of salt water and suntan lotion yet theres an undercurrent of 
uneasiness among those who care for the beach a sense that the 
days of innocence are over 
all it would take is two days of that northwest wind for that 
stuff to come washing in again says jack roberts who supervises 
about 40 lifeguards on belmar beach 
it hasnt been an entirely pristine summer here or in other 
beach towns around the country 
just as the season began an oil spill in new york harbor sent 
dribbles of tar onto beaches in new jersey and on new yorks long 
island a sewage spill closed three new york beaches last week oil 
from the tanker mega borg threatened beaches along the texas coast 
and at huntington beach in southern california heavy surf recently 
churned up buried oil from a tanker spill in february 
no pollution this year can compare with the large stretches of 
slime pushed ashore along the east coast two years ago by freakish 
winds now tourism seems to be rebounding in areas that were hurt 
it looks to me like its going to be a very good season 
said ralph savastano who owns ralphs snack shop on the belmar 
boardwalk theyve cleaned up the ocean really good 
new jersey enacted some of the most stringent standards in the 
nation for ocean water quality pollutants have not exceeded the 
standards yet this year last year pollution forced beaches to 
close 19 times in 1988 there were 68 closures 
in monmouth county which includes belmar public health 
coordinator lester jargowsky overflows with enthusiasm when he 
talks about the improvements 
positively unequivocally we have at this point the cleanest 
water you could ever jump into he said and i dont mean 
maybe 
one reason is that new jersey has stopped dumping raw sewage 
into the ocean sewage spills caused many of the problems two years 
ago also new york city has taken steps to keep its garbage from 
spilling close to shore 
the natural resources defense council warned last week that 
water quality standards nationwide vary so widely from state to 
state and town to town that water considered polluted in one place 
might be considered clean in another 
the environmental group urged the environmental protection 
agency to establish stricter national standards 
no one should have to swim in waters laced with human waste 
council scientist allen hershkowitz said 
in belmar a coastal town with a yearround population of 6200 
that swells with tourists in the summer politics has superseded 
pollution as the leading topic of conversation 
the town recalled its mayor recently in a battle over turf and 
surf maria hernandez wanted to use high fees to restrict use of 
the beach which brought her into conflict with those who make 
their living off belmars most visible asset 
now with the mayor gone and the water cleaner theres an air 
of optimism along the beach 
belmar will be the busiest place on the eastern seaboard in 
another two years said tom cox who opened a hotdog stand on the 
boardwalk last year

both liberals and conservatives can find 
decisions to cheer in the supreme courts 198990 term but there 
is little doubt the courts conservative majority is in control 
the past year has been a mixed one said steven shapiro of 
the american civil liberties union there were important 
victories most notably in the flag burning case and the two 
affirmative action decisions 
the court struck down a federal law that banned flag burning and 
upheld government policies helping blacks and other minorities 
seeking radio and television station licenses 
on the other hand shapiro said the courts decisions on 
abortion religion search and seizure have done serious damage 
to longstanding civil liberties principles 
the court made it more difficult for girls to obtain abortions 
without their parents being told let student prayer and worship 
groups to meet in public schools and allowed police to set up 
roadblocks and briefly detain all motorists in trying to catch 
drunken drivers 
john scully of the conservative washington legal foundation 
called the justcompleted term generally favorable but not as 
good as we would have liked 
scully praised the leadership of chief justice william h 
rehnquist but said its a precarious majority and 
disappointments occurred when one or another justice jumped off the 
conservative ship we definitely need the appointment of one more 
conservative justice to solidify our gains 
the aclus shapiro decried the courts willingness to defer to 
majoritarian rule when basic constitutional rights are at stake 
that attitude more than any single decision suggests that 
the cause of civil liberties will face an uphill battle with this 
court for years to come he said 
summarizing the term american university law professor herman 
schwartz said in the big cases with occasional forays off the 
reservation the conservatives still carried the day 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy both 
conservative sided with three liberal justices to overturn the law 
banning flag burning justice byron r white another conservative 
joined the courts four liberals in the affirmative action 
decisions and in gutting political patronage 
justice sandra day oconnor joins rehnquist scalia kennedy and 
white in the fivemember conservative majority 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens are the courts liberals 
blackmun in an interview in the terms waning days said the 
conservatives this year have control of the court completely and 
are making the most of it 
voting statistics for the term confirm blackmuns perception 
in the 129 signed decisions the five conservatives cast a total 
of 83 dissenting votes while the four liberals cast 168 
one decision can yield in addition to a majority opinion 
several dissenting and concurring opinions 
of the 37 decisions reached by a 54 vote the 
conservativeliberal split held in 19 
some of the 54 rulings had no ideological heat schwartz 
said and there were a few significant crossovers 
here in summary form are the major decisions of the courts 
198990 term

an agreement signed by 56 nations aimed at saving 
the earths ozone layer was heralded as a landmark in international 
relations and a historic step in protecting the global environment 
countries set aside selfinterest and reached across traditional 
divides to tackle a common threat 
they agreed to ban a range of chemicals that are depleting the 
ozone layer and set up a 240 million international fund through 
which industrialized nations can help developing countries adopt 
environmentally safer technology 
fridays agreement substantially toughened the 1987 montreal 
protocol a treaty signed by the 56 countries to protect the ozone 
layer 
but the twoweek conference attended by 100 nations also 
revealed traditional conflicts between rich and poor countries and 
environmentalists and business executives that have farreaching 
implications 
the conference was widely viewed as a prelude to talks on the 
far more complex and expensive issue of global warming 
the conference set the tone not only for how we are to go 
about a climate change convention but also how difficult it is 
going to be said dr mostafa tolba the egyptian who heads the 
un environment program 
we tried to strike a balance between what scientists say is 
going to happen if we dont save the ozone and what is politically 
and financially feasible he said 
at the conference at least a dozen countries including most of 
the european community the nordic countries australia new 
zealand and canada thought swifter action was feasible and 
necessary 
these nations advocated a ban effective in 1997 on chemicals 
called chlorofluorocarbons cfcs that erode the ozone layer which 
shields the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays 
the united states japan and the soviet union insisted on 
setting the target date for the year 2000 the united states argued 
that industry needs the additional time to test alternative 
chemicals before introducing them as replacements for 
chlorofluorocarbons 
environmentalists said the extra three years would mean 11 
billion tons of additional cfcs pumped into the stratosphere 
industry defeated science the environment and common sense 
said paul hohnen a greenpeace spokesman 
cfcs used in refrigeration insulation cleaning solvents and 
as aerosol propellents rise into the stratosphere where they break 
down in constituent chemical parts one of these chlorine 
destroys the thin shield of ozone which helps preserve the earths 
flora and protects humans from developing skin cancer 
another compromise was reached at the conference between 
developing nations and underdeveloped countries on the transfer of 
technology 
chemical company officials met with indian environment minister 
maneka gandhi and agreed to make available technologies to produce 
cfc substitutes 
gandhi speaking for developing nations had demanded assurances 
that third world countries would have access to advanced 
technologies 
very often in the third world we have come across this 
problem ms gandhi said they tell us we have no access to the 
technology only the finished product we become clients on a very 
large scale 
india and china have flourishing chlorofluorocarbon plants 
burgeoning populations and a growing demand for the chemical the 
conference thus set up an ozone fund to coax such countries into 
signing the treaty by helping them build industries that do not 
rely on ozonedepleting chemicals 
china and india will receive 40 million from the fund over the 
next three years after signing the protocol which they have said 
they will do

farmland prices may be settling down after 
more than a decade of climbing to record levels and falling even 
faster an agriculture department analyst says 
the departments economic research service announced in april 
that farmland prices rose nationally in 1989 for the third straight 
year as of jan 1 the average was 693 per acre up about 4 
percent from 667 a year earlier 
another increase of 3 percent to 4 percent is expected in 1990 
the agency forecast in june 
economist roger hexem noted that the high point for us 
farmland prices which includes buildings as well as land was 
823 per acre in 1982 that was followed by a 27 percent decline 
over the next five years to 599 per acre in 1987 
the plummet in land values was a key part of the overall farm 
recession of the mid1980s which turned out to be the worst in 50 
years 
many analysts believe farmers and investors learned a lot in the 
1980s about the land market and how it can be affected by so many 
factors not tied directly to agriculture 
but the general economic health of farming is still hugely 
important to the land market and usda estimates of annual farm 
income interest rates and credit availability are part of the 
overall investment picture 
in 1989 farmland values did not increase as much as some 
factors seem to indicate they might have hexem said in the july 
issue of farmline magazine 
the modest increase of 4 percent in a time of positive 
income and debt indicators suggests that investors may have 
anticipated the 1989 conditions in 1988 and 1987 as land prices 
began climbing again he said 
as it turned out last years net farm income was at a record 
level and farm real estate debt edged lower continuing a sixyear 
decline from its 1983 peak 
other factors that may have held farmland values down in 
1989 include uncertainties about changes in the capital gains tax 
possible changes in income and price support programs in the new 
farm bill movements in interest rates and the outcome of the 
trade liberalization negotiations hexem said 
estimates of farmland values come from an annual survey of 
farmers and ranchers by the departments national agricultural 
statistics service

cooperatives providing fuel to the nations 
farmers have reduced production of leaded gasoline but not as 
rapidly as us refineries in general according to an agriculture 
department report 
in 1988 according to the departments agricultural cooperative 
service coops produced 165 million barrels of leaded gasoline 
down 30 percent from 1982 when the previous study by the agency 
was made 
that decline was much smaller than the estimated 60 percent 
figure representing all us refiners and reflects cooperatives 
response to the continuing demand by farmer members for leaded 
gasoline to power older equipment the report said 
the use of leaded gasoline has been banned in new automobiles 
for some years as part of the nations antipollution campaign but 
farmers with older tractors say the unleaded fuel means more wear 
and tear on their machines 
overall coops provided nearly 40 percent of the gasoline

the census bureau is closing in on the last 1 
percent of american households that havent yet been tallied 
the 1990 count has reached 99 percent of all homes officials 
proclaimed sunday despite a disappointing start in april 
the doortodoor counting will continue at least through autumn 
in areas where the work is not complete officials have said 
in many regions a were you counted campaign is starting in 
an effort to reach people who have been overlooked so far 
without the willingness of hundreds of thousands of americans 
who volunteered and stuck with a tough job we would not be where 
we are now commerce secretary robert a mosbacher said in a 
statement 
with more than 100 million households across the nation the 99 
percent mark means that 1 million homes remain to be counted 
officials hope the new campaign will reach many of them through 
posters in stores and community centers newspaper advertising and 
similar efforts people will be encouraged to call or write the 
census bureau so they can be counted 
the results of the census taken every 10 years are used to 
reapportion seats in the house of representatives and to distribute 
billions of dollars in federal money over the next decade 
with such high political and financial stakes the effort has 
attracted close attention minority groups are concerned about 
being undercounted and cities have claimed that many of their 
people are missed especially in hard to count innercity areas 
a group of large cities led by new york has sued in an effort to 
get the final totals adjusted to account for this assumed 
undercount 
census forms were mailed out to most americans in march but 
only 63 percent were returned because of delivery problems and 
apparent public confusion thus the doortodoor effort starting in 
april had to be increased likely adding several million dollars to 
the 25 billionplus cost 
officials said more than 80 million of the completed census 
forms have been processed at census offices in the 1980 census 
that processing didnt begin until august 
the bureau is required to report the population of each state to 
president bush by dec 31 and census director barbara everitt 
bryant said she is confident that deadline will be met 
nationwide the census bureau said 100 percent of households 
have been counted in 27 states while work remains to be done in 23 
states and the district of columbia 
those with the count still incomplete are 
arizona 975 percent california 944 percent colorado 997 
percent connecticut 963 percent district of columbia 887 
percent delaware 943 percent georgia 991 percent maryland 
944 percent 
also massachusetts 974 percent michigan 994 percent new 
jersey 989 percent new mexico 989 percent new york 89 
percent north carolina 983 percent north dakota 995 percent 
and ohio 998 percent pennsylvania 981 percent rhode 
island 992 percent south carolina 951 percent south dakota 
995 percent tennessee 99 percent utah 997 percent virginia 
996 percent wyoming 997 percent 
major cities where the bureau says it has counted all the 
households are austin texas chicago cleveland columbus ohio 
dallas el paso fort worth houston indianapolis jacksonville 
fla kansas city milwaukee minneapolisst paul new orleans 
oklahoma city san antonio texas and seattle 
cities where the bureau said the count is still incomplete 
include atlanta 973 percent baltimore 97 percent boston 909 
percent denver 992 percent detroit 98 percent los angeles 
956 percent memphis 964 percent nashville 999 percent new

for many americans president bushs 
abandonment of his antitax pledge was a betrayal for house 
minority whip newt gingrich its the ultimate challenge of his 
closely watched career 
gingrich rga is the ideological leader of the conservative 
opportunity society he spent most of the 1980s engaged in 
rhetorical and parliamentary warfare against the democrats 
last year he hit paydirt with his ethics committee charges that 
forced speaker jim wright dtexas to resign from congress as 
wright went down gingrich rocketed into the no 2 position among 
the house republicans 
while maintaining his wonderfully hyperbolic rhetoric he joined 
the establishment he talks with democrats about vacation schedules 
and even supported the controversial house pay raise passed last 
fall 
now hes a republican negotiator in the big budget talks 
but bushs tax flip might be too much for him to take the 
neutron as his friends call him is fighting a political meltdown 
the tax issue is at the core of gingrichs political being his 
rhetorical package is anchored by attacks on the bureaucratic 
liberal welfare state fed by undeserved tax dollars 
and george bush is saying he needs a tax increase to get the 
budget talks moving and prevent cuts in needed government services 
gingrich wasnt invited to the meeting last tuesday when bush 
told the top congressional leaders hed go along with a statement 
calling for tax revenue increases 
apparently when gingrich first heard about it he couldnt 
believe it a heated argument over the telephone with white house 
chief of staff john sununu ensued 
gingrich afterward tried feeding reporters the sununu ruse that 
nothing had changed since bush had started the budget talks with a 
pledge that everything was on the table but his anger made it 
obvious that he didnt believe it himself 
im just frankly enraged he said 
by days end he was telling reporters that bush had thrown an 
interception and by weeks end he was distancing himself from 
the white house 
the president made a mistake on tuesday and i think it has 
been a severe blow to the presidents credibility and a significant 
blow to the republican party gingrich said 
i do not think he has to raise taxes im willing to stay in 
the summit but ill just say flatly that i think it is an error to 
give in to the democratic party he said 
gingrich says the democrats forced bush into reversing his 
pledge by refusing to negotiate and says the president should have 
gone to the american people and told them that 
but gingrich also states the obvious truth that the democrats 
werent going to pull out of the talks 
they didnt even threaten it and neither can he theres too 
much at stake and hes a part of the republican leadership now 
part of the establishment 
what gingrich can do is maneuver to make sure he and his 
supporters retain some influence in the budget talks 
gingrichs deputy rep robert walker rpa reacted to bushs 
statement last week by gathering the signatures of more than half 
of the house republicans on a statement opposing any tax rate 
increase gingrich wearing his negotiators hat didnt sign it 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has stated repeatedly 
that democrats wont vote for any tax increase unless most 
republicans support it also 
if foley sticks to that pledge it could give gingrich the 
equivalent of a veto if foley doesnt it might give gingrich back 
the tax issue which bushs statement has so badly blunted

the democratic party will choose new york over 
new orleans for its 1992 presidential convention barring a 
lastminute collapse in negotiations party officials say 
new york has been party chairman ronald h browns favorite from 
the outset of the search and passage of a tough antiabortion law 
by the louisiana legislature has all but quashed any hopes new 
orleans had to change browns mind two party officials said sunday 
night 
brown plans to make his choice public within a week and only an 
unexpected snag in negotiations would deny new york the convention 
said the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
a formal decision has not been made but hes closing in on new 
york very quickly one of the officials said 
unless theres a snag its new york said the other 
brown during a weekend meeting of the partys state chairmen in 
oregon refused to discuss his choice but acknowledged the 
antiabortion law was affecting his deliberations 
id be less than frank if i didnt acknowledge i have trouble 
with that he said in an interview saturday this is a tough 
decision with two firstclass cities that have made very serious 
proposals and worked hard 
later in a speech to the party chairs brown said the decision 
had him in a pressure cooker and i want to get out of the 
pressure cooker as soon as possible 
those in the party who favor new orleans believe choosing the 
city would be a needed gesture to the south where democrats have 
done poorly in national elections but the 1988 convention was in 
atlanta and nominee michael dukakis did poorly in the south and 
even worse in georgia 
new yorks madison square garden is a tight hall for the 
gathering and the media center would be blocks away but prominent 
party fundraisers in the city have been promising to fill the 
partys coffers for the campaign and new york has expressed no 
trouble with fronting the 20 million brown wants in advance from 
the convention city to pay for the event while new orleans has 
expressed reservations about that amount 
the party officials said dozens of party leaders and activists 
have said going to new orleans would send a bad signal at a time 
when democrats are trying to capitalize on the republican partys 
internal debate on the abortion issue 
while in oregon brown made repeated references to the 
democratic partys prochoice stance

the national organization for women is 
considering forming a third political party complaining the 
democrats and republicans are dominated by white men 
its high time we questioned the status quo and challenged a 
system that just isnt working that is leaving too many citizens 
out said now president molly yard 
the organization which concluded its annual convention here on 
sunday launched a commission to consider a new party that would 
represent feminists and others who say they are ignored or used and 
abused by the two main parties 
the 40member commission formed saturday will hold its first 
meeting this summer in philadelphia it will make its 
recommendations at the now convention next summer in new york city 
now delegates on sunday also reelected yard and endorsed 15 
resolutions including a campaign to elect women to office 
including former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein democratic 
candidate for governor of california 
patricia ireland now executive vice president noted that the 
organizations allies called now suicidal and naive when 
the idea of a thirdparty surfaced at the last convention 
but are we naive isnt it time with a congress thats 95 
percent male 95 percent white with only two out gay males and 
no out gay females isnt it time for a representative 
democracy ireland asked 
members on saturday said the gop abandoned all claim to womens 
support when the party came out against the equal rights amendment 
and legal abortion 
while they rated democrats as somewhat better they complained 
that too many party members resist abortion rights or take other 
repugnant stands 
now leaders said republican and democratic candidates who 
support women on issues of concern to them would not be hurt by 
their third party which could endorse a major party candidate 
instead of running its own 
west german parliament member petra kelly who helped form the 
antinuclear alternative green party in her country in 1979 urged 
2400 delegates to think about becoming an alternative political 
force 
if not now when are you going to do it the time has come

west germanys deutsche bank opened a branch on east berlins 
main square the alexanderplatz the moment the currency union took 
effect at midnight saturday it was believed to be the only bank in 
the country to open before 8 am sunday

thousands of people stood in line thousands of others crowded 
around them and a writhing mass of people packed the banks door 
which was eventually broken ambulances took two people away when 
they became faint 
in the same square mass demonstrations last fall had helped 
bring down the former communist government heralding the drive to 
unification of the two german states 
anke kirchner 24 a teacher thought the rush for west german 
money was rather depressing compared to the exuberant 
idealistic demonstrations that brought down the berlin wall 
still to many east germans sunday was the day the two nations 
became one 
the first man in line at the bank and the first person in east 
germany to withdraw his new west german marks was hansjoachim 
corsalle 41 a coal delivery man from east berlin 
corsalle showed up about four hours before the doors opened 
before i came here i told my wife this is going to enter the 
history books he said and it will 
he took out 2000 marks about 1200 and planned to use it to 
take his family on vacation he got a gift basket and a 100mark 
bonus for being the first east german in line 
never saw a line this long except for the line at elvis

and rebels rages just a few miles outside the city

fourth without electricity both were cut off when rebels captured 
the west african nations main water treatment plant and 
hydroelectric power station which are within 12 miles of monrovia 
rebels battled retreating government troops two miles from the 
capital on sunday according to refugees fleeing the fighting 
health officials feared a cholera epidemic as refugees flooded 
the overcrowded port city 
refugees from a village near sheiffelin a major army base 12 
miles east of monrovia said they heard sounds of heavy artillery 
and submachine gunfire before soldiers ordered them to evacuate 
the fighting was near caldwell a small settlement two miles 
from the atlantic coast port of monrovia 
the rebels who launched their insurgency six months ago and now 
hold most of the country of 25 million people also apparently 
seized a ship carrying rice to the capital where residents face a 
food shortage 
guerrillas were advancing from robertsfield international 
airport which they seized over the weekend after destroying the 
terminal with shell and mortar fire 
sundays battle took place three miles from a us radio 
transmission station used to relay diplomatic messages for 
subsaharan africa 
also near the rebel lines is the omega navigational station a 
major us navigation facility 
the rebels so far have kept a promise not to damage us 
government installations a voice of america relay station for 
africa that fell behind rebel lines last week has not been 
threatened by the guerrillas 
in the capital residents spent saturday night crouched on 
floors as soldiers fired wildly into the air in hopes of scaring 
away rebels 
western health workers in monrovia said they had reports from

the execution of one of the founding members of his national 
patriotic front taylor has made it clear that elections will not 
be an immediate priority if he takes power 
both sides have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians 
the us state department suggested saturday that doe step down 
the call came in a statement supporting proposals by the economic 
community of west african states to end the rebellion which has 
degenerated into a tribal war 
washington supported doe with 500 million in aid from 198085 
but the aid dropped to 75 million in rice this year because of 
reported human rights abuses and does failure to repay debts 
the 1980 coup ousted elitist descendants of freed us slaves 
who founded liberia in 1847

states one of the countries that sent aid after the devastating 
june 21 earthquake nouri said no 
nouri spoke after a london newspaper quoted another iranian 
official sayed hossein mosavian of the foreign ministry as saying 
it was possible a western hostage would soon be freed 
it is very optimistic news for you the sunday correspondent 
quoted him as saying without elaboration 
two american hostages frank reed and robert polhill were 
freed in april terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press is the longestheld hostage he was abducted

15285yen finish it opened at 15185 yen and ranged between 
15140 yen and 15225 yen the dollar fell 157 yen friday 
the dollars low opening followed a downswing on overseas 
markets it fell further as securities and life insurance companies 
actively sold it dealers said 
market players bought the yen mainly because shortterm 
interest rates have been rising said a dealer with mitsui taiyo 
kobe bank speaking on condition of anonymity also pushing the 
dollar lower was speculation over lower us interest rates 
such speculation has grown in the market since last tuesday 
when president bush said tax revenues might be raised to help 
reduce the budget deficit 
participants were trying to test how far the us currency 
would slide but 149 yen would probably be the bottom because the 
incentive is not strong enough to sell it further the dealer

the disputed kuril islands should be turned into a 
special economic zone owned by the soviet union and japan under the 
auspices of the united nations the communist party newspaper 
pravda says 
the soviet union occupied the mineralrich islands north of 
hokkaido after the end of world war ii in 1945 and has rejected all 
japanese demands since then to give them back 
writing in the sunday edition of pravda political commentator 
vsevolod ovchinnikov said the fate of iturup kunashir shikotan 
and habomai known as the northern territories should be settled 
when president mikhail s gorbachev visits japan early next year 
ovchinnikov said the dispute could be solved by agreeing during 
the summit to place the islands under un trusteeship as a special 
economic zone jointly owned by the soviet union and japan 
the two sides could also discuss other variants that would be 
mutually acceptable ovchinnikov said 
he said that until recently japanese officials have refused to 
budge on the issue of the kuril islands 
the meeting between south korean president roh taewoo and 
gorbachev during the soviet leaders visit to the united states in 
june and their agreement to work on regional problems should be 
noted by japan ovochinnikov said 
now that seoul has expressed its readiness to provide its 
capital techology and equipment for siberian projects tokyos 
tough stand is losing its meaning the pravda commentary said 
it said only a mutually acceptable compromise on the kuril 
islands will end the 45yearold dispute and that gorbachevs 
visit will be the best time to achieve that goal 
the islands economic value lies in its deposits of iron copper 
and gold the main occupation is fishing

scientists today said they employed genetic 
engineering to create a strain of midget mice a development that 
could be applied to other animals and lead to a treatment for 
gigantism in humans 
in a report in the journal proceedings of the national academy 
of sciences john j kopchick and wen y chen molecular biologists 
at ohio university said they developed a gene that suppressed the 
growth hormone in mice 
the mice were half the normal size the scientists said 
the discovery could lead to the development of smaller farm 
animals that would use food more efficiently and perhaps even to 
the development of new drug treatments for gigantism in which the 
body grows abnormally large because of excessive production of 
growth hormone by the pituitary gland the researchers said 
the gene was developed during experiments in which the 
biologists were attempting to grow super mice kopchick said 
as often in science you get what you dont expect this is 
the most exciting thing ive ever done kopchick said 
the researchers were building on earlier genetic engineering 
experiments in which mice twice as big as normal were produced by 
inserting a growth hormone from cows into the genes of embryonic 
mice 
the biologists intended to make the mice grow even bigger by 
making three changes in the hormone before inserting it the 
changes instead produced large amounts of a protein that retards 
growth 
the researchers said they will try to determine how genes can be 
created to control growth in specific ways 
the idea would be to design a drug that would mimic the 
activity of this hormone kopchick said

tamil rebels have intensified their

the 200yearold dutch fort in the center of jaffna since june 11 
when the latest fighting erupted between the government and 
separatist tamil rebels 
if the fort falls it would be a major blow to the government 
which controls only three other military installations on the 
jaffna peninsula the main stronghold of the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam militia 
an airfield and two naval bases in the peninsula 185 miles 
north of colombo are also facing continued attacks by the tigers

encounters in the eastern coastal town of pottuvil and two 
guerrillas were killed in ampara district during clearing 
operations they said 
the latest deaths bring to 1838 the number of combatants slain 
the fighting erupted after a tamil man complained to the rebels he 
was manhandled by sinhalese police 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the sri lankas 16 million 
people and dominate the police and the military tamils who make 
up 18 percent of the population complain of discrimination in jobs 
and education by the predominantly sinhalese government 
several tamil militant groups had been fighting since 1983 for a 
separate homeland in the north and the east where most of sri 
lankas tamils live the tamil tigers continued the campaign after 
the other groups surrendered their arms the separatist war has 
claimed nearly 13000 lives in seven years

mrs barry said she had no knowledge of any cocaine use by her 
husband 
the times ive seen him incapacitated were due to drink she

prime minister lothar de maiziere says he has 
no qualms about seeing east germanys sovereignty disappear as its 
moves toward merger with its powerful neighbor west germany 
after all de maiziere led his christian democrats to power by 
promising quick unification in the wake of last autumns 
anticommunist revolt 
the germanys moved a giant step closer sunday as a treaty took 
effect that joined the two states economically and eliminated 
internal border controls 
we want unity de maziere told the associated press we 
want that one sovereign state developed and you have to commit to 
that goal 
the prime minister criticized the widespread predictions that 
east germany will face heavy unemployment in the coming weeks as 
its enterprises are forced to compete with the west 
in recent weeks there has been too much talk about possible 
risks and not enough about the opportunities he said 
the west german mark became the official currency of east 
germany on sunday and west germanys central bank took control of 
east germanys money supply 
but the prime minister said he does not expect an 
inflationfueling buying spree by east germans who now have 
convertible currency to spend and western products filling their 
stores 
people are not plunging into vulgar materialism he said 
he also indicated that east germany will not accept unification 
completely on west german terms 
asked if east germany would seek to retain some of its own laws 
and institutions in a united germany he said were not coming 
with empty hands were bringing five states were bringing 16 
million people 
the prime minister a 50yearold lawyer is a close ally of 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and it is anticipated he would 
join the united german government if kohl is elected as its leader 
allgerman elections are expected in december when the 
unification process is expected to be complete 
but de maiziere sidestepped questions about his future 
those questions have been asked a lot of times and i dont 
like the wording he said 
de maiziere said he spent his first western currency 46 marks 
280 on lunch in the cafeteria of the government ministerial 
building 
potato soup with sausage including the drink he said

adopting the nations first righttodie 
legislation since the supreme court ruling on the issue last week 
the legislature voted to let the terminally ill designate someone 
to decide whether to pull the plug 
the bill was adopted by both chambers sunday after a threeyear 
struggle it goes next to gov mario cuomo who supports it 
it allows the sick to appoint a proxy to make health care 
decisions for them when they are no longer able to do so 
this legislation provides new yorkers with a vehicle to ensure 
that treatment is provided according to their own personal 
religious and moral convictions as conveyed by someone they have 
selected and trust cuomo said 
advocates for aids patients hailed the legislation which also 
was supported by the american association of retired persons and 
the state medical society 
we have seen many of our friends and lovers go through long 
and difficult deaths said tim sweeney deputy director for 
policy for the gay mens health crisis aids robs people of so 
much control in their lives and this bill restores a measure of 
control for people with aids and their families 
it was the first such legislative action in the country since 
the supreme court decision recognizing a right to die said a 
spokesman for senate health committee chairman michael tully 
the court ruling june 25 in the case of nancy cruzan a 
missouri woman injured in a traffic accident that the state could 
prevent her family from withdrawing medical care in the absence of 
clear evidence of the patients desires 
tully said the supreme court decision gave his bill the final 
push toward adoption 
more people talked about it and it opened the door to the fact 
that so many people and organizations supported the legislation 
he said 
the bill passed the senate 516 and the house 11628 
a person would have to state in the agreement whether artificial 
feeding can be cut off for the proxy to be able to make that 
determination 
private hospitals or clinics could refuse for moral or 
religious reasons to let a proxy order a cutoff of life support 
but the hospital would have to inform the patient upon admission 
that it wont honor a proxys decision 
that provision was among a handful of lastminute concessions 
made by lawmakers to avoid the active opposition of the states 
roman catholic bishops

an army sergeant was acquitted of 
murdering a civilian during the closing days of the us invasion 
of panama but was convicted of other offenses and sentenced to 20 
months in prison 
paul finsel jr 25 of arkoma okla was found guilty saturday 
of offenses including obstruction conspiracy and loss of a 
military weapon 
he was one of three soldiers charged in the slaying of leila 
diaz de panay 50 who was shot to death jan 25 while taking a 
bath outside her panama city home 
investigators said she was slain during a gunfight staged by 
us soldiers to conceal finsels loss of his pistol at a brothel 
col kenneth mitchell the military judge who decided the case 
also busted finsel down to private and gave him a badconduct 
discharge 
last week pfc mark mcmonagle 20 of philadelphia was 
convicted of unpremeditated murder and drew seven years in prison 
and a dishonorable discharge 
pfc marc gussen 19 of teaneck nj pleaded guilty to 
disobeying orders and obstruction april 23 and received two years 
in prison and dishonorable discharge 
mcmonagle admitted to an investigator that he went to a bar and 
brothel with finsel who lost his handgun when the two went into a 
back room to evade military police 
finsel convinced him that they should fake a firefight and say 
the gun was lost in the melee mcmonagle told the investigator the 
two fired their rifles in the air and soldiers nearby took up the 
fake firefight 
at one point mcmonagle said he had seen a shadow in the 
womans courtyard and fired six times

tens of thousands of blacks 
stayed away from work and schools today after the african national 
congress called a general strike to protest factional strife that 
has claimed thousands of lives 
up to 90 percent of blacks in many areas did not go to work in 
response to the ancs call for a 24hour stayaway according to 
police and local journalists 
johannesburg pretoria durban and east london on the east coast 
were all hard hit they said 
the anc called the strike to protest black factional fighting in 
the eastern province of natal where it has demanded the white 
government end a state of emergency and disband local zulu police 
police reported today that three blacks had been killed in 
factional fights in natal over the weekend 
troops were on nationwide alert today and heavily armed police 
in armored cars and trucks patrolled some areas but there were no 
immediate reports of violence bands of protesters erected 
barricades in black townships in durban but did not clash with 
police who demolished the barriers 
police patrols in some black townships offered transport to 
black workers trying to get to work police trucks took black 
hospital workers to their jobs in durban 
in pretoria a helicopter dropped police leaflets urging blacks 
to ignore imtimidation and go to work 
more than 4000 people have been killed in natal since 1986 in 
fighting between the anc and its allies and inkatha a zulu party 
the anc contends inkatha is responsible for the fighting 
the anc and inkatha both oppose apartheid but differ in their 
plans for a future south africa with inkatha favoring a more 
conservative philosophy that espouses zulu nationalism 
last month the government lifted a nationwide state of 
emergency everywhere except in natal government officials say the 
state of emergency must be maintained in natal to try and halt the 
bloodshed 
business groups warned that workers taking part in todays 
strike would not be paid and would face disciplinary action 
the white government and some black groups opposed the action 
saying it would only increase tension the national congress of 
trade unions the second largestlabor federation with some 500000 
black members told its members to go to work today 
we are concerned this call will aggravate the violence not 
only in natal but throughout the country said strini moodley 
spokesman for the azanian peoples organization a black group 
the strike is supported by several anc allies including the 
congress of south african trade unions the countrys largest black 
labor federation with about 1 million members 
at least one senior anc leader has expressed reservations about 
the stayaway archie gumede a top anc figure in natal said he 
could understand the strike in terms of black anger but i 
cant explain it in terms of logic 
black groups have become increasingly hostile to one another in 
recent months as they compete for supporters and influence 
hundreds of blacks have died in factional fighting since 
president fw de klerk legalized dozens of antiapartheid 
organizations in february

thousands of unhappy taxpayers some 
tossing rolls of toilet paper rallied at the statehouse to protest 
28 billion in new taxes 
chanting recall recall and florio must go the crowd 
sunday repeatedly castigated gov jim florio and democratic 
lawmakers who passed the package of sales and income tax increases 
most of the increases went into effect sunday 
hundreds wore tshirts and held placards with antiflorio 
slogans 
state police said the crowd numbered about 4500 at its peak 
and that as many as 4000 others attended portions of the 2hour 
rally thousands of others never arrived in trenton because of 
traffic jams caused by an automobile accident police said 
before the rally cars streamed across route 195 in a 40mile 
caravan from belmar to trenton and crowds cheered from highway 
overpasses 
most of the rallys wrath was directed toward florio who 
proposed a higher and expanded sales tax a higher income tax and 
increased taxes on items such as cigarettes and liquor the package 
is expected to raise 28 billion in the first year 
among the items being taxed for the first time are soap and 
toilet paper 
the state sales tax which increased from 6 percent to 7 
percent became the second highest in the country behind 
connecticut which charges 8 percent 
the 28 billion tax package will be used to close a budget gap 
of more than 1 billion provide 11 billion in added state aid to 
public schools and ease some property taxes 
the rallys organizers emphasized that their anger toward a 
democratic governor did not mean they supported republicans 
they make promises and they dont keep them said john 
budzash 39 a postal worker from howell whose idea led to the 
rally we cant take these tax increases but the republicans are 
as much to blame as the democrats 
budzash said the group which called itself hands across new 
jersey wants the tax hikes repealed the ability to initiate 
legislation and a complete audit of state government to see where 
our money goes

the west german mark was strong 
today on international markets during the smooth start of the 
historic merger of the east and west german economies 
currency dealers said the mark also was strengthened by the 
possibility of us tax increases to combat the american deficit 
the mark was fixed at 16538 to the dollar in frankfurt up from 
16715 marks on friday in london the mark was pegged at 16535 to 
the dollar up from 16635 marks on friday 
the dollar had already begun easing down following fridays 
fixing after president bush said he was reconsidering his stance 
against raising taxes 
bushs announcement that tax increases may be needed to cut the 
budget deficit could have the effect of dropping us interest 
rates and brake foreign investments dealers said 
in addition dealers said moderate withdrawals of west german 
marks by east germans in sundays first official day of economic 
unification was a clear indication that a consumers buying spree 
would not occur keeping inflation in check 
the drop of the dollar led to only light trading on european 
markets one dealer said the us currency could settle to about 
165 marks pending economic figures clarifying the trend in east 
germanys economy 
but another dealer said that warning strikes at two east german 
factories today demanding a shorter work week and more pay could 
spread to other businesses and hurt the marks strength

east germany plunged headfirst into the 
capitalist world today after its weekend economic merger with west 
germany but new worries and warning strikes blunted the euphoria 
of holding a new hard currency 
many east germans were snatching up long desired goods with 
their new west german marks but some were shocked by higher prices 
workers at two east german factories staged warning strikes 
today they were the first of what is expected to be a wave of work 
stoppages 
in another protest coal dealers used their trucks to block 
loading points in four places in east berlin 
the citys 66 coal dealers were protesting the end of state 
subsidies that were a hallmark of the nations communistrun 
economy state subsidies have been halted as the country adopts 
capitalism 
on the first business day since economic union long lines 
formed at most grocery stores and other shops 
the official adn news agency reporting from potsdam just 
southwest of berlin said prices for east germanproduced butter 
and cheese were about the same as before but the price of milk had 
more than doubled 
it said consumers were comparing prices and shopping carefully 
one shopper 70yearold werner ludwig of east berlin said he 
saw western electronic goods of lower prices and better quality 
than those available before but on the other hand things that 
you need daily like bread and flour are much more expensive he 
said how often do you buy a color tv you need bread every day 
todays warning strikes at the ludwigsfelde automobile parts 
plant just south of berlin and the brandenburg steel works west of 
berlin were for better pay and working conditions adn said 
east german workers are demanding to be brought up to parity 
with their rich neighbors in west germany others were expected to 
strike in a bid to keep their factories from closing 
both east and west german officials predict the next few months 
will be difficult mostly because many of east germanys 8000 
stateowned companies are expected to close 
burdened by heavy debt and unable to generate enough sales to 
pay their employees in west german marks many east german 
factories and businesses are expected to fold even before they can 
convert to private ownership 
there has been speculation some would file for bankruptcy as 
early as today one company elektrowerk electronicon of gera was 
quick to announce that a quarter of its 5000 workers would have 
reduced shifts beginning today 
the sobering reality contrasted with the outburst of euphoria 
that greeted the economic merger 
at the stroke of midnight saturday the west german mark became 
the official east german currency and the west german central bank 
took control of east germanys money supply border controls were 
eliminated 
east germans cheered honked horns and set off fireworks to 
welcome the currency they had long coveted west german businessmen 
everyone from furniture salesmen to travel agents offering tours 
to rio de janeiro rushed in to tempt them 
at border crossings that were impenetrable before the communists 
fell from power in last falls democratic upheaval smiling 
families walked drove and bicycled back and forth without a 
policeman in sight 
although full political union with west germany remains months 
away for most east germans sunday was the long awaited day of 
unification ending a failed 40year experiment with socialism 
under the economic merger most east germans were able to 
exchange up to 4000 east german marks in private savings at a 11 
rate receiving the equivalent of about 2400 additional ost 
marks could be converted at 21 
there is fear of mass unemployment as east germany a country of 
16 million people tries to quickly shift to a free market 
there have been predictions that up to 4 million could be thrown 
out of work as the country struggles to rebuild an economy ravaged 
by decades of communist mismanagement and inefficiency 
the credit reform economics institute of west germany predicts 
that more than half of east germanys businesses will fold 
still east germany is likely to achieve prosperity much quicker 
than other east european countries making the transition to 
capitalism including poland and hungary 
an average east german now earns about 1200 west german marks 
720 a month less than half the average west german salary 
however east german rents and other basic items will be kept low 
for a while to help compensate 
it will take hard work until we have reached unity and 
freedom prosperity and social balance for all germans west 
german chancellor helmut kohl said in a televised address sunday 
evening 
many west germans have been grumbling about the high cost of 
bringing east germany up to full western standards they fear tax 
increases further housing shortages and reduced oldage pensions 
officials of both germanys are working on a political 
unification treaty to prepare for full union and allgerman 
elections in december 
this is contingent upon the two germanys reaching agreement with 
the four victorious world war ii allies on the international 
ramifications of unification including the military alignment of a 
united germany 
the changes were launched with last years democratic revolution 
in east germany and other east european countries where communist 
regimes that had ruled during the postwar era were ousted during 
popular protests

life appeared to return to normal today 
for the first time in a week following an aborted military coup and 
the deaths of 23 protesters in the countrys worst urban violence 
in history 
president kenneth kaunda played golf and long lines formed 
before dawn outside state stores private supermarkets and gasoline 
stations such services were closed after studentled rioting over 
higher food prices broke out one week ago 
no unrest was reported but the government kept a nighttime 
curfew in effect 
state television sunday night reported that more than 1000 
people had been arrested mainly for curfew violations during the 
violence but witnesses said many people were arrested in daylight 
during the antigovernment protests 
today paramilitary police and troops patrolled the streets of 
lusaka the capital and other cities and towns of this southern 
african country of 75 million 
officials said no one was killed during the coup attempt 
saturday but witnesses and diplomats said three civilians 
celebrating kaundas reported death were shot dead 
kaunda 67 was in the central city of ndola early saturday when 
a signal corps lieutenant announced on state radio that the army 
had seized power 
but loyalist troops detained the soldier and at least four other 
officers involved in the coup plot diplomats said on condition of 
anonymity the government has acknowledged the arrests of only two 
people 
the broadcasts prompted thousands of zambians to take to the 
streets to hail the reported coup and denounce kaunda 
in an apparent move to consolidate control kaunda on sunday 
transferred army commander ltgen gary kalenge former air force 
chief ltgen hanniah lungu was appointed defense minister a post 
that had been vacant 
kaunda gave no explanations for the moves 
the antigovernment protests began last monday and were led by 
students who denounced a stateordered price increase for corn 
meal the nations staple and demanded kaunda resign and 
multiparty democracy be restored at least 23 protesters were 
killed in clashes with security forces 
over the weekend the president vowed to crack down on enemies 
and refused to budge on the 120 percent price increase for cornmeal 
kaunda is under pressure from a faltering economy and foreign 
creditors who are owed 75 billion 
in similar rioting in december 1986 security forces shot to 
death at least 15 civilians kaunda rescinded the price increases 
at that time

president bush said today nato 
leaders will make changes in the alliances nuclear weapons policy 
but i dont happen to believe its bombshell dimension 
bush preparing for this weeks nato meeting in london said he 
wanted to talk with defense secretary dick cheney and colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff about the current nato 
policy on nuclear weapons 
the washington post and the new york times reported today that 
bush is proposing a nato policy of using nuclear weapons only as a 
last resort current policy is that such warheads could be used 
first if an enemy was gaining the upper hand in conventional 
warfare 
bush talked with reporters as he stood outside his seaside 
vacation home with a coterie of advisers who flew up from 
washington 
asked if he expected changes in nato policy coming from the 
meeting of the 16member alliance he said 
what i expect is a document that is unanimously agreed to 
that will set the course for the future as conditions have 
changed nato will change some will call it dramatic policy 
changes and others wont 
there will be some changes but i dont happen to believe its 
bombshell dimension bush said 
bush said that his administration had been in close contact with 
the allies in advance of the london summit he said weve got 
broad general agreement on the issues but indicated differences 
remain in some areas 
theres still some work to be done he said 
joining bush on a blustery maine morning at his family compound 
were secretary of state james a baker iii vice president dan 
quayle cheney powell chief of staff john sununu national 
security adviser brent scowcroft treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and others 
us officials said earlier the administration is ready to look 
toward eventual withdrawal of some 1400 nucleartipped artillery 
shells from western europe bush will attend the nato meeting on 
thursday and friday 
the officials said the bush administration will consider 
eliminating us nuclear stockpiles including the artillery shells 
now deployed in west germany only if the soviets withdraw their 
troops completely from foreign soil in europe the shells have a 
range of about 18 miles 
addressing another matter on sunday bush said he was worried 
about the fate of a kidnapped peace corps worker in the philippines 
he noted that the united states is pulling its peace corps 
workers out of the pacific nation because of danger from communist 
guerrillas theyre coming out of there anyway he told 
reporters when asked about the matter on the golf course sunday 
the age of the terrorist its not good 
he said the news was contributing to an overall downbeat day of 
his vacation 
no fish he said of a midday fishing trip its been that 
kind of a day lost in tennis no fish no particularly good news 
from around the world 
but bush later made a birdie on the 13th hole of a local golf 
course its the second happiest day of my life from a bad day 
starting off he told reporters who pressed him on what the 
happiest day was he thrust his right thumb upward and said 
barbara 
on tuesday bush will host brady and other officials at his home 
on walkers point to plan for a second summit meeting this one an 
economic summit to be held july 911 in houston with other major 
industrialized nations 
bush leaves for the nato summit in london on wednesday evening 
and then flies back to houston on friday 
final language has not been completed for the communique that 
will conclude the nato summit but the officials said sunday that 
it will focus more on other issues than on nuclear weapons 
it is expected to emphasize the need for nato to shift more to a 
political rather than a military body and also urge the 
strengthening of the 35nation european security conference 
there also is expected to be discussion of a european suggestion 
to provide economic aid to the soviet union to help its ailing 
economy the bush administration has been somewhat cool to the idea 
from the us point of view but has said that other nations may 
want to provide aid

mikhail s gorbachev moved to take firm control of 
a watershed communist party congress today fending off a call for 
his resignation and aggressively defending his reform efforts 
the president and party leader seemed to have succeeded in 
averting a possible challenge to his leadership by hardliners and 
the threat of a walkout by radical reformers 
voices are being heard that all of our present problems should 
be blamed on perestroika gorbachev told the delegates to the 
28th soviet communist party congress in a keynote speech 
he acknowledged that the partys top leaders had made mistakes 
especially in ethnic relations where we did not see the dangers 
hundreds of people have been killed in recent waves of ethnic 
violence in armenia and azerbaijan central asian cities and other 
places also the three baltic republics are trying to secede 
in todays speech though gorbachev laid much blame for the 
nations pressing problems including the economic crisis on the 
heavy legacy of previous leaders dating to josef stalin 
gorbachev also attacked the soviet unions vast bureaucracy 
saying many functionaries only cared about protecting their own 
power and privileges 
radical reform is vital he insisted because the ussr is 
rapidly becoming a secondrate power 
he offered few specifics but said communists must 
stop the brain and talent drain abroad 
pass legislation ending the government monopoly on the 
manufacture of farm machinery to provide for an influx of foreign 
capital in this area 
quickly make the soviet currency convertible on the world 
market 
negotiate a new treaty uniting the 15 soviet republics on a 
looser basis while preserving the nation 
in the days leading up the party congress it appeared the 
soviet leader might face a challenge from hardliners for the top 
party leadership post and that radical reformers might walk out 
and split the party 
but today gorbachev seemed successful in his exhortations for 
unity among party reformers and moderates members of the radical 
democratic platform said they had dropped plans to walk out of the 
congress to form their own party 
also hardliners who last month demanded that gorbachev give up 
his post as communist party general secretary said they planned to 
support him although they might use the new policy of openness to 
criticize some policies 
gorbachev must be the party leader soviet premier nikolai 
ryzhkov told reporters at the congress 
public opinion polls indicate the peoples trust in the party 
until gorbachevs tenure the countrys sole political force has 
waned significantly as it fails to cope with mounting discontent 
coal miners have threatened a oneday strike for july 11 a day 
before the scheduled end of the congress to protest the failure of 
the communist leadership to improve living conditions 
the nationally televised opening session was tempestuous in 
contrast to previous congresses which were carefully orchestrated 
by the party leadership 
this time speaker after speaker rose from the floor to offer 
resolutions and proposals clearly not on gorbachevs agenda 
including a call for the party leadership to resign 
gorbachev who heads the party as general secretary did not 
comment on the demand and the 4683 delegates approved his proposal 
to return to the issue later 
conservatives had been threatening for two weeks to try to oust 
gorbachev as party chief but it appeared that threat had 
diminished hardliner ivan polozkov said he would not run against 
gorbachev for the top party post 
however polozkov elected last month as leader of the largely 
conservative communist party of the russian republic said he 
expected politburo members to explain what they see as the way 
out of the situation that has been created the loss of direction 
for which they must answer 
for the first time the 12 members of the politburo are 
scheduled to report to the congress on their work since the last 
party congress in 1986 
the progressive democratic platform demands that the party give 
up its cells in the police military the kgb and in nearly every 
workplace it had authorized its estimated 100 delegates to walk 
out and form a new party if they are not happy with the session 
such a split would have been the first in the party since 1921 
but sergei stankevich a leading reformer from moscow said the 
democratic platform leaders had decided against the walkout 
gorbachev who heads the government as president wants to use 
the congress to transform what have traditionally been the most 
powerful soviet institutions rewriting party rules that affect all 
19 million party members 
the proposed changes include replacing the general secretary 
with a party chairman and first secretary and renaming and 
expanding the politburo thus diluting the power of each member 
other proposals include nominating multiple candidates for party 
jobs and restricting elected party officials to two terms 
gorbachev wants to strip the party of involvement in daytoday 
administration of the government and economy he seeks to end the 
partys domination of government 
his most important proposed rule changes would affect the 
central committee the partys policymaking body and a bastion of 
conservative holdovers politburo member lev zaikov has said 90 
percent of the 249 central committee members should be replaced by 
younger people the congress will elect a new central committee 
gorbachev had one previous chance to win control of the 
committee at the 1986 congress but had been in office just 11 
months and lacked the power

americas foreign debt burden surged 25 
percent in 1989 to 6637 billion as foreigners holdings in the 
united states grew at a faster pace than americans assets abroad 
the new assessment based on data supplied today by the commerce 
department showed that the united states increased its lead as the 
worlds largest debtor country 
unlike past years the department did not publish the actual net 
debtor position of the united states although it did supply enough 
information on the component parts that simple math allowed the 
number to be derived 
the department defended its change by saying that the debtor 
figures as presently compilied were unreliable critics charged 
that the move was prompted by a desire to avoid publishing a report 
that has become a political embarrassment 
the commerce department report showed that us holdings of 
overseas assets rose by 1469 billion last year to 1412 
trillion a gain of 116 percent 
but foreign holdings in the united states climbed at an even 
faster pace of 156 percent rising by 2796 billion to 2076 
trillion 
the net debtor position is the difference between americas 
assets abroad and foreign assets in the united states 
that difference grew to 66375 billion last year up from 
53108 billion in 1988 some economists believe that debt total 
could surpass 1 trillion sometime in the next few years a 
stunning reversal for a country that began the 1980s as the worlds 
largest creditor nation 
as recently as 1983 the united states held the title of largest 
creditor when it had an investment surplus of 89 billion that 
surplus fell to 33 billion in 1984 and disappeared altogether in 
1985 the year the country became a net debtor for the first time 
in 71 years 
the surplus was erased by the huge merchandise trade deficits 
the united states piled up during the 1980s as americans 
transferred billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay 
for imported cars and television sets 
those dollars now in foreign hands have been reinvested in the 
united states in everything from us treasury bills to los angeles 
office buildings setting off cries that america was transferring 
control of its economic destiny to foreigners 
allan young head of the bea said there was no pressure from 
the bush administration to halt publication of the net debtor 
figure he said he took the action because of concern that the 
report understated the value of us assets overseas because the 
report measured those assets at their historical purchase price 
that undervalued the worth of us assets in foreign countries 
many of which were purchased decades ago in comparison to foreign 
holdings in the united states many purchased in the 1980s 
young said the bea is working to produce a report that will give 
an uptodate current value on all assets both foreign and us 
holdings and hopes to have that report ready in a year if it is 
the bea will resume publishing a bottomline figure he said 
but private economists said they believed the final results 
still will show the united states as a net debtor 
c fred bergsten head of the institute for international 
economics said that while the current report does understate the 
value of americas holdings overseas it also understates foreign 
holdings in the united states because of errors in gathering data 
on foreign ownership 
our view is that both the asset and liability numbers are 
substantially understated and as a result the bottomline figure is 
probably about right said bergsten who is completing a book on 
americas debtor status

an infant abducted from a hospital nursery 
slept in her own bed today after police arrested an 18yearold 
honor student who allegedly crafted an elaborate story to explain 
the babys arrival 
teresa and willie morse flew to butler mo to retrieve their 
firstborn 2weekold whitney ryann morse on sunday the infant 
was taken june 20 from deaconess hospital in oklahoma city by a 
woman dressed in hospital scrubs 
we had to travel a long way to get her mrs morse said at 
her home sunday night with whitney in her arms 
i remember when we were about halfway home i felt i dont 
feel any anger i dont feel any pain i dont feel anything but 
just love for my child mrs morse said 
an anonymous telephone tip helped officials find the baby max 
geiman fbi spokesman in kansas city said sunday the caller 
recognized a drawing of the abductor on a television news show 
geiman said 
former high school honor student heather brewster 18 was 
arrested in butler late saturday after questioning by bates county 
sheriffs officers 
ralph lindsey chief deputy in the bates county sheriffs 
department said ms brewster concocted a detailed plan to obtain a 
baby after she became pregnant by a boyfriend and then had a 
miscarriage in january or february 
she told friends that she was carrying twins and one baby was 
lost 
the woman went to great lengths to fool friends and family into 
thinking she was pregnant lindsey said she showed friends a 
document with an officiallooking seal that said the baby was born 
at 332 am at the boone county hospital in columbia mo 
she also told family and friends that she had enrolled in a 
prenatal class in columbia and had made a trip there lindsey said 
both sides of this story can pull on the heartstrings 
lindsey said its just too bad that we had to go through such a 
horror story because of it 
authorities said ms brewster was a student at central missouri 
state university in warrensburg she denied taking the baby during 
questioning saturday night but the child was positively identified 
as the morse child officials said 
federal authorities in oklahoma city probably would handle any 
charges that may be filed against the woman geiman said federal 
prosecutors in missouri and oklahoma will work out that decision 
he said 
the baby had gained a pound in the time she was gone mrs morse

a man lost his murder appeal today in the 
clifffalling death of a woman he met married and insured just 
weeks after running a newspaper personal advertisement 
the maine supreme judicial court unanimously turned down each of 
the challenges raised by dennis r larson who is serving a 50year 
prison sentence in the death of kathy frost larson 
mrs larson plunged 80 feet to her death at otter cliffs in 
acadia national park on oct 11 1987 authorities centered their 
investigation on larson after learning he had collected insurance 
money when his first wife allegedly washed away in a montana stream 
larson 40 was convicted of murdering the former miss frost in 
a plot to collect 400000 in life insurance money but he 
challenged his appeal by saying the state improperly took 
statements from him 
the great falls mont man also said that during his trial 
superior court justice jack o smith improperly let the state 
reopen its case after the prosecutor failed to prove that the body 
found at the base of the cliff was that of his bride 
larson also challenged the use of testimony from an old friend 
who recounted a trip when larson said he would like to marry a 
foreign woman arrange an apparently accidental death then collect 
insurance money 
the states highest court found no merit in any of larsons 
arguments 
the state presented more than adequate evidence to warrant the 
superior courts belief beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant 
did indeed intentionally or knowingly murder kathy frost larson 
wrote chief justice vincent l mckusick 
the high court also said that maine was able to bring the murder 
charge against larson because the state and federal governments 
share jurisdiction in acadia 
larsons first wife leslee reynolds larson vanished in 1975 
with larson being the only witness larson claimed that the woman 
was washed away in prickly pear creek some 50 miles south of great 
falls 
no traces of leslee larson were ever found which authorities 
considered unusual under the circumstances and she was pronounced 
dead seven years later larson collected a 20000 payment from

perestroika and party failures 
the soviet citizen of today no longer accepts what he meekly 
tolerated in the past he reacts with understandable alarm and 
anger to the negative phenomena that like foam on the surface 
accompany the turbulent and basically healthy process of 
perestroika 
a clear and wellfounded answer to the question why this has 
happened is important for formulating conclusions as to what should 
be done next and how it should be done it is also essential in 
order to fortify peoples faith in perestroika after all voices 
can now be heard even more this is now something like an 
attitude claiming that perestroika is to blame for all our 
present troubles 
in speaking of all this comrades i certainly do not want to 
mitigate assessments or conclusions concerning the activities of 
the central committee the politburo the communists working in the 
party or government and economic bodies in the republics or 
locally 
we have inherited a heavy legacy the deplorable state of our 
lands and economy and the disastrous state of the energy sector 
are not the result of recent years 
there are many things we could have foreseen and there are 
negative processes above all in the economic and social spheres 
in interethnic relations in the sphere of culture and ideology 
whose development we could have prevented 
the politburo does not deny its responsibility for these errors 
we must analyze the situation and we must see what 
revolutionary transformations will be made because the ussr is 
rapidly becoming a secondrate power

the economy 
improvement of the soviet economy depends to no small extent on 
how it integrates in the system of the international division of 
labor and the main thing is to work for the convertibility of the 
ruble this matter should not be put off 
at present the government is drawing up proposals for the 
entire set of problems related to economic activity abroad this 
applies to expanding ties with capitalist countries and going over 
to world prices and settlements in hard currency within the 
framework of the council for mutual economic assistance this also 
concerns revision and introduction of certain correctives in our 
cooperation with third world countries

chronic shortages 
i would subscribe here to everything that is said on this 
subject and express solidarity with the most scathing criticism 
but just fanning emotions wont increase the amount of goods yet 
at the same time the situation on the consumer market far from 
becoming less strained has in many cases grown more acute and 
become intolerable 
in any case and this should be admitted the consequences 
could have been less painful if the government had approached the 
economic reform comprehensively and had managed to stand up to the 
pressure of various industries and the old managerial structures 
that sought to keep their position and maintain command of 
administration

ethnic strife 
at present as we embark on a succession of deepgoing changes 
in our multinational state we need tranquility peace and 
cooperation in the interests of all nations i hope that this 
appeal of our congress will be heard in all parts of the country 
what we lived through and reflected upon in recent times has 
caused us to realize that the updating of the union cannot be 
confined to mere even though highly considerable extension of the 
rights of the republics and autonomies what we need is a real 
union of sovereign states

not expect president bush to propose an increase in income tax 
rates but the white house said today that bush has made no such 
assurances 
he has not made any assurances on anything everything is up 
for discussion white house press spokeswoman alixe glen told 
reporters accompanying bush on a fourth of july vacation in 
kennebunkport maine 
dole said he expects bush will not back tax rate increases but 
to support higher oil import fees and taxes on alcohol and tobacco 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny countered sunday on abcs 
this week with david brinkley that such an approach would not 
raise enough money to reduce huge budget deficits 
glen refused to characterize any proposals that were under 
discussion by administration and congressional negotiators who are 
trying to reach an agreement on reducing the deficit 
moynihan said democrats are prepared to force a 100 billion 
spending cut oct 1 as required by the grammrudman deficit 
spending law if bush does not increase income taxes and reduce the 
social security payroll deduction 
new york gov mario cuomo meanwhile said on nbcs meet the 
press that the top tax rate should be raised from its present 
level of 28 percent to reduce the budget deficit he mentioned the

marion barry today appealed a federal judges 
ruling that barred black leaders louis farrakhan and bishop george 
stallings from the mayors drug and perjury trial 
it is a violation of barrys constitutional right to a public 
trial to keep farrakhan and stallings from attending lawyers for 
the american civil liberties union representing the three said in 
papers filed in federal appeals court 
the appeal came as barrys trial was resuming with former model 
rasheeda moore back on the stand for a third day of 
crossexamination by barrys attorneys 
the rights of farrakhan and stallings right to attend the trial 
is guaranteed by the first amendment the court papers said 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson ruled that the 
presence of imani temple bishop stallings and nation of islam 
minister farrakhan would be potentially disruptive and very 
likely intimidating 
the judges discretion does not include orders barring 
wellbehaved members of the public from court without extraordinary 
and welldocumented reasons said the aclu 
if it is not inappropriate for the united states attorney 
who is not trying this case to appear in the courtroom it 
cannot be improper for a black leader to appear said the court 
filing 
stallings was barred from the courtroom last friday inside the 
jury heard barry attorney r kenneth mundy elicit testimony from 
moore that she doesnt remember using cocaine with barry on a 1986 
trip to the virgin islands 
convicted drug dealer charles lewis has testified that barry and 
moore repeatedly went into a bathroom on a sailboat with a bag of 
cocaine that was nearly empty by the end of the ride 
did she remember that asked mundy 
not to my recollection said moore i have not been able 
to remember the use of cocaine on that trip in 1986 
mundy has gotten moore to admit that she violated her 
instructions from the fbi during a videotaped sting operation the 
exmodel was told by her fbi handlers not to persuade or invite 
barry to take drugs and she testified that she got carried away in 
her duties on behalf of the government 
barry was videotaped the night of jan 18 taking two long drags 
of crack cocaine the riveting videotape including his arrest by 
federal and local authorities was shown in the courtroom and on 
local television on thursday 
the core of moores testimony was that she and barry used 
cocaine marijuana and opium more than 100 times from 1986 to 1989 
last week she provided details about her alleged drug use with 
barry but she was unable in most cases to recall the dates or even 
the month that specific incidents of alleged drug use occurred 
shes not good with numbers she testified 
mundy launched attacks on moores credibility and her motives 
she was seeking revenge on barry because he had abandoned her for a 
woman named maria mccarthy the mayors lawyer suggested 
moore denied that mundy brought out that she lied to a federal 
grand jury in 1989 by denying she and barry had used drugs she 
used cocaine as recently as april and is a recovering alcoholic 
she admitted she lied again to a grand jury in january by denying 
her own recent drug use she acknowledged 
meanwhile barry got a rousing ovation sunday as he and his 
wife effi attended the first anniversary service for stallings 
breakaway congregation 
they figured that since mayor marion barry couldnt get 
bought he had to get caught stallings told his imani temple 
africanamerican congregation thats why mayor marion barry is 
in trouble right now he is too smart too intelligent too black 
on saturday barry was cheered at an antidrug rally and told 
the crowd his legal situation is just a matter of good lawyers 
and good jurors 
stallings was excommunicated from the roman catholic church 
earlier this year after forming his breakaway congregation for 
disenchanted black catholics

two cargo ships collided in the chesapeake 
bay during a thunderstorm severely damaging one of the ships and 
spilling at least 35000 gallons of fuel authorities said 
cleanup crews remained on station today after working through 
the night to contain the spill from this ships fuel tanks after 
the sunday evening collision some oil washed up on city beaches 
we consider this a major marine casualty because of the damage 
done and the amount of oil spilled said us coast guard cmdr 
george naccara 
naccara said 35000 gallons to 40000 gallons of no 4 heavy oil 
and diesel were spilled when the columbus america registered in 
west germany and the neptune jade based in singapore collided 
shortly before 7 pm sunday about five miles north of norfolk near 
the hampton roads bridgetunnel 
the 635foot columbus america received extensive damage and the 
neptune jade was also damaged naccara said but no injuries were 
reported on either ship 
capt eugene johnson commander of the coast guard marine safety 
office in portsmouth said the 6mile norfolk shipping channel 
remained closed this morning while efforts were made to corral the 
oil 
some oil washed ashore on beaches from willoughby spit to little 
creek in norfolk a distance of several miles johnson said cleanup 
would take several days and a lot of manual labor 
coast guard workers and a private contractor strung 
oilcontainment booms along the harbor protecting marinas and the 
waterside festival park a major shopping and tourist attraction 
the regions main resort area virginia beach on the atlantic 
ocean would probably be spared johnson said 
the columbus america was taken to the norshipco yard on the 
southern branch of the elizabeth river the ship had a hole below 
the water line and 12 of its cargo containers were severely 
damaged he said six containers went overboard but were recovered 
johnson said however that none of the cargo containers leaked 
both vessels were carrying hazardous material including petroleum 
distillates paint and lacquer products 
the columbus america held about 140000 gallons of fuel naccara 
said coast guard and navy personnel spent most of the night 
stringing containment booms around the ship and using oil skimmers 
to pick up as much of the spill as possible 
naccara said a coast guard helicopter was in the air at first 
light to survey the extent of the spill 
the accident happened as severe thunderstorms and high winds 
battered the area the national weather service had issued a marine 
warning and severe weather watches for the area before the crash 
the cause of the accident was under investigation according to 
coast guard spokesman rick woods both the coast guard and the 
national transportation safety board will take part in the 
investigation 
johnson said the crew had been given drug tests as a routine 
matter but the results will not be available for at least a couple 
of days

back in europe after a triumphant us 
tour nelson mandela made an uncompromising appeal today to keep up 
sanctions saying the racist system in south africa remains 
fundamentally intact 
he also put himself at odds with the british and irish 
governments by calling on britain to negotiate peace with the irish 
republican army 
the deputy president of the african national congress arrived in 
ireland from california on sunday to a rapturous welcome he was 
made an honorary citizen of the city of dublin 
mandela today became the first foreigner except for heads of 
state to address a joint meeting of the 166member parliamentary 
dail and 60member senate 
he delivered a 25minute speech laced with allusions to 
irelands own struggle against unrelenting tyranny to achieve 
independence from britain 
he also declared that all the fundamental features of the 
south african racist system remain unchanged 
south african president fw de klerk has argued vigorously that 
foreign countries should end sanctions against his white government 
because of social reforms he has launched 
heralding the wave of change mandela was freed earlier this 
year he had been in prison since 1962 and was serving a life term 
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
mandela flew to ireland after an exhausting eightcity us 
tour although 71 years old and nursing a bad cold he looked well 
today as he took a walking tour of leinster house the seat of 
parliament before entering the packed chamber his wife winnie 
sat in the gallery 
earlier at a news conference he was questioned about his 
attitude toward the ira which is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland 
while giving no hint of approval for the iras violent methods 
mandela said the only way of resolving this conflict and of 
stopping this mutual slaughter is to sit down and talk 
the british and irish governments both maintain that talks can 
only be held with the constitutional parties of northern ireland 
that eschew violence they say the ira outlawed on both sides of 
the border represents only a small minority 
mandela however implied the situation was analogous to that of 
south africa where the white government had long insisted the 
african national congress lay down its arms before negotiations de 
klerks government has now launched talks though the anc has made 
no such concession 
it is not for anyone of the involved parties to say that i 
cant talk to so and so because this is a minority mandela said 
mandelas remarks risked annoying some of his british hosts when 
he flies to london later today prime minister margaret thatcher 
who herself has narrowly survived an ira bomb is firmly against 
any compromise with the militants 
she also disagrees with mandela on sanctions saying they should 
be eased in recognition of de klerks reforms 
but mandela was adamant saying this matter as to what the 
international community should be doing must be left entirely to 
ourselves that is the anc 
mandela said de klerk had asked to meet him as soon as he 
returned from his tour of europe and the united states and the 
reason for that is because sanctions are biting 
in his address to parliament mandela said a good start has 
been made toward negotiations between the government and the anc 
but he added we should not mistake the promise of change for 
change itself 
de klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will 
bring blacks into the national government but allow whites to 
maintain veto power over major policy decisions de klerk opposes 
the oneperson onevote system that the anc is demanding 
before his public appearances mandela met today with state 
president patrick hillery and held an hourlong talk with prime 
minister charles haughey

president bush will urge nato allies this week 
to modify nuclear weapons strategy and set the stage for the 
eventual withdrawal of nearly 1400 nucleartipped artillery 
shells us officials said today 
the proposed change would still leave us nuclear weapons in 
europe and retain a threat to use them in order to deter a 
blitzkrieg attack by soviet forces against western europe the 
officials told the associated press 
but the nuclear facet of the doctrine of flexible response 
that has guided nato since the 1960s would be changed under bushs 
initiative there still would be a threat to use nuclear weapons 
but only after nato tried other military measures and it was clear 
a massive invasion of the red army could not be stopped otherwise 
the officials said 
the threat now is early firstuse an official said the 
idea is to go to late firstuse or what might better be called no 
earlyfirst use 
the two main factors behind the proposed shift in policy are the 
projected withdrawal of thousands of soviet troops and tanks from 
europe and a decline in the strength of the sovietled warsaw pact 
the officials said 
bush and his nato partners will meet in london on thursday and 
friday to celebrate the end of the cold war and consider how to 
bring the nowoutdated military alliance into line with a changing 
world 
bush asked today if he expected major changes in nato policy 
said what i expect is a document that is unanimously agreed 
to that will set the course for the future as conditions have 
changed nato will change some will call it dramatic policy 
changes and others wont 
there will be some changes but i dont happen to believe its 
bombshell dimension bush said in kennebunkport maine where he 
is preparing for the london conference 
the allied leaders will examine the aging nato war machine and 
make some preliminary judgments about bringing it up to date but 
with considerably less firepower 
the bush administration in presummit planning has urged the 
nato allies to reaffirm the strategy of keeping nuclear weapons in 
europe 
the washington post and the new york times reported today that 
bush is proposing that the united states and its western european 
allies make nuclear arms weapons of last resort that would be 
a switch from the current flexible response strategy in which 
nuclear weapons could be used early in a battle if warsaw pact 
conventional forces appeared to be gaining the upper hand 
the new york times also said bush has proposed accrediting 
eastern european and soviet diplomats to nato although they would 
not be permitted to become members 
hungary whose parliament last week voted in a nonbinding 
resolution to leave the warsaw pact has quietly proposed to nato 
being allowed to participate as observers in political or 
nonmilitary committees a us official said today 
it was a trial balloon and we welcomed it the official who 
insisted on anonymity told the associated press 
meanwhile us officials who spoke sunday on condition of 
anonymity said the bush administration will consider eliminating 
us nuclear stockpiles including the artillery shells now 
deployed in west germany only if the soviets withdraw their troops 
completely from foreign soil in europe the shells have a range of 
about 18 miles 
the proposal is designed to reflect the warming cold war 
tensions and the weakening of the sovietled warsaw pact the 
officials stressed however that a communique to be adopted at the 
end of the twoday summit will reaffirm the policy of using nuclear 
weapons for deterrence 
bush in may responding to the changed situation in eastern 
europe decided against shipping new shortrange nuclear lance 
missiles to western europe but plans are proceeding to develop a 
new tactical nuclear airtosurface missile called tasm 
the officials said the summit communique would give far more 
attention to issues other than nuclear weapons specifically they 
said it would stress the need for nato to take on more of a 
political character and also urge the strengthening of the 
35nation european security conference that alliance was 
established in 1975 to lower eastwest tensions 
the 16 nato allies have been exchanging ideas for the windup 
communique since the nato foreign ministers held a preliminary 
meeting last month in turnberry scotland the final language has 
not been drafted the officials said

remnants of the wagon 
trains that crossed wyoming in the mid1800s deep ruts tin cups 
gravestones have been meticulously preserved as symbols of the 
cowboy states pioneer heritage 
but the 1990 wyoming centennial wagon train with as many as 200 
wagons and 1600 riders recreating the trek west is forbidden to 
leave traces of its own passing 
the group started its day this morning with a hearty breakfast 
of eggs bacon and pancakes to help them complete the last dusty 
miles of the jim bridger trail in honor of wyomings 100th birthday 
the wagons and riders on horseback broke camp for the final 16 
miles into cody along the way the group made sure not to leave 
behind any trash 
who knows what a pepsi can will be worth in another 100 
years said cowboy and outfitter kevin lauer we even have to 
cart our ashes out of camp each night 
but 100yearold trash is a different story 
under an agreement with the us bureau of land management 
participants on the 30day 260mile trip must not disturb the bits 
of history they encounter along the trail 
a couple times weve had to move our camp to avoid the 
artifacts said bj wertz a stagecoach driver and the wagon 
trains spokeswoman they say whoops another arrowhead move 
three feet to the right 
in addition the federal agency will not allow the wagon train 
to camp on riverbanks as the pioneers did for fear of 
environmental damage 
instead the modernday pioneers have been camping most of the 
last 29 nights on the rough dry prairie all the while loosely 
following the jim bridger trail established in 1864 as an 
alternate route to the gold fields of western montana when tensions 
with indians along the bozeman trail were high 
there was such a thing as shade trees along the rivers 
lauer lamented sporting a scraggly beard and a beatup cowboy hat 
that looked as though it had put out a few fires all we have is 
cactus cactus and dust 
but the riders are not complaining its the cactus cactus and 
dust that bring the experiences of the early trailblazers to life 
the only time i ever questioned being on this trip was when i 
found scorpions in my bed said carleen bennett 47 
the wagon train today began its final leg into cody where a 
grand reception from wellwishers and dignitaries was planned the 
wagon train left casper on june 2 to celebrate wyomings centennial 
for those on the trail the last day meant different things 
theres always the feeling that you made good friends and its 
hard to say goodbye said morris carter one of the head 
wranglers responsible for circling the wagons each night 
other riders had had enough and wanted nothing more than to tie 
up their horses to the nearest hitching post in town and abandon 
the beasts 
i definitely am ready for this wagon train to end said 
nancy breithaupt wearing a prairie dress and hat in the shade of a 
makeshift tent you caught me at a bad time its been a tough 
day sitting in the sun 
like the pioneers who preceded them the 1990 cowpokes are 
encountering rattlesnakes and frying them up for dinner taking 
apart wagons to get them through deep ravines nursing the injured 
that get bucked off horses and singing songs and playing fiddles in 
the center of the circled wagons at night 
the only difference is they used the old montgomery ward 
catalog and we use toilet paper said outrider ron brault 
the riders do have some modernday conveniences cellular 
phones twoway radios trucked in water and hay outhouses and 
daily newspaper delivery 
other contemporary conveniences are missed 
its been hot and its been freezing that rainstorm was 
unbearable and how do you get four or five layers of grit off your 
face and mud out of your teeth said helen boreczky i was 
blistered from the nose over on the first week of the trip to 
think they didnt have chapstick back then the avon lady would 
have had a ball 
in todays day were all used to the soft life hot showers 
phones back then they didnt know what they were missing lauer 
said i dont think we could have done what they did 100 years 
ago but our hardships are just as hard on us as theirs were on 
them 
still there are alternatives to such things as a hot shower 
you can always take a pail to the horse trough said lois 
artzis of billings mont horse slobbers never hurt anything

pride overcame dejection monday as 
cameroon prepared a grateful homecoming salute to its indomitable 
lions soccer team among the most triumphant losers in world cup 
history 
for a defeat it was more like a victory state radio said 
after the lions close 32 overtime loss t england sunday night 
honor to those who know how to struggle head high the 
radio added 
across africa the reaction was similar 
never before had an african team reached the world cup 
quarterfinals and the lions strong showing assured the continent 
of three representatives instead of two when the tournament is 
held again in 1994 
thanks cameroon said a headline in fraternite matin the 
governmentowned daily in the ivory coast 
hoping there would be a victory to celebrate cameroon president 
paul biya had declared monday a holiday many fans who had stayed 
up late to watch the match slept late then reunited with friends 
to relive the highs and lows of their teams last match 
there was a lingering sense of disappointment due to the fact 
that the underdog lions missing four suspended starters led 21 
with only seven minutes left in regulation time 
had the game ended that way it would have immortalized onomo 
disma one of cameroons bestknown sorcerers in a nationally 
circulated newspaper saturday he predicted a 21 cameroon victory 
apparently not foreseeing the lategame penalty call that allowed 
england to draw even 
preparations were under way to give the team a heros welcome 
when it returns after a few days rest in italy also awaiting the 
players are bonuses offered by businessmen in cameroon and 
elsewhere in africa including cars and cash 
a campaign has begun to raise funds for a monument to roger 
milla 38 who came out of retirement to score four world cup goals 
across africa it seemed that virtually everyone with access to 
a television watched sundays game 
abidjan the ivory coasts capital came to a virtual halt 
restaurants normally full on sunday nights were empty and viewers 
huddled around tv sets in unusual places including garages 
the world cup continues tomorrow without africa said 
fraternite matin but no one will forget that africa left its 
mark

fears of a united germanys potential economic 
and military strength are lingering among european leaders who are 
trying to keep pace with the continents changing political face 
the fears bred from two world wars this century and west 
germanys industrial power are in the background as the leaders 
gather to discuss the western alliance 
theyre meeting this week in london just days after the biggest 
step yet toward unification with a merger of east germanys economy 
into west germany 
german officials and american observers say neither the west nor 
the soviet union need fear military aggression and they say a 
single germany will provide healthy economic competition for new 
east bloc markets 
but the concerns over a new germanys possible strength are 
deeply ingrained by the painful history of germanys military past 
twice in this century the united states and european allies 
have fought long wars against a germany barely larger than the 
nation expected to be born of unification 
the new germany will have a population of approximately 80 
million far larger than that of britain or france and a gross 
domestic product equal to that of britain and france combined 
according to the private nonprofit council on competitiveness 
west germany already outstrips the united states in investment in 
plant and equipment and in nondefense research and development 
although not in investment in education 
the germans clearly will be the moving force behind the 
european union said george a carver jr a fellow at the center 
for strategic and international studies and former us official in 
germany 
however he added i do not think a united germany is a threat 
to the soviet union or anyone else 
the soviets devastated in world war ii see it far differently 
moscow has balked at removing some 380000 soviet troops who 
remain on east german soil and objects to natos plans to absorb a 
united germany into the western military alliance 
everyone has legitimate historical reasons to be concerned 
about german reunification there is no question about that said 
jay kosminsky deputy director of defense policy studies for the 
conservative heritage foundation the soviet union is no 
different in this respect except perhaps in the respect that it is 
better equipped to deal with germany 
last week rita suessmuth president of the west german 
parliament and her east german counterpart sabine bergmannpohl 
went to jerusalem to tell israelis that concern over a united 
germany are unfounded 
but the fear runs as deep for many israelis as their memory that 
6 million jews were slain by german nazis in the holocaust of world 
war ii 
we have the right and maybe the obligation to be afraid and 
alarmed said shevac weiss a deputy speaker of the israeli 
parliament who spent two childhood years hiding from the nazis in a 
basement in the ukraine 
henry siegman executive director of the american jewish 
congress interviewed by telephone in new york said that although 
jewish scars may make them more concerned than others they 
probably have far less at stake than most people there arent many 
jews left in that part of the world thats not where jews live any 
more 
noting west germanys record of democratic government and 
support of israel siegman said i dont believe that the 
circumstances that combined to produce an auschwitz are likely to 
reappear on the world scene again 
jan surotchek a consultant with the institute for foreign 
policy analysis which held a recent conference on german armed 
forces in a changing europe said he sees little likelihood of 
germany becoming a military threat 
i dont know how you can read over the history of german 
opinion of the military since the war and feel there is enough 
support either among the public at large or in the financial 
community or in the industrial community to do the kind of things 
that they have done before surotchek said 
in trade he said the germans are going to play it hard but 
we should expect that that doesnt seem to me to be an unfair 
thing 
kosminsky and kim holmes director of foreign policy and defense 
studies for the heritage foundation argued that the most dangerous 
course would be to cut germany off from its nato allies 
now most germans talk as if military power is something in 
the past holmes said at a briefing for reporters this is 
because of the new situation the dependence on the us nuclear 
guarantee what happens when that is gone my view is that the old 
military balance of power logic will reassert itself and one of 
things that could happen is that the germans themselves may some 
day want to find nuclear weapons

an elections board today declared ben 
nelson the winner of the democratic gubernatorial primary 
declaring he had beat the runnerup by 42 votes in the closest such 
election in state history 
the state board of canvassers voted 40 this morning to certify 
nelsons victory over fellow democrat bill hoppner the vote means 
nelson an omaha attorney will challenge gov kay orr in the 
november general election 
hoppner a former aide to sen bob kerrey dneb had urged the 
certification of his rival saying he was still not satisfied with 
the way the recount was conducted but believed nelson had won he 
said his party needed to get on with the effort to defeat mrs orr 
the final tally showed nelson won the election with 44721 votes 
to hoppners 44679 
the boards decision came 48 days after the may 15 primary in 
which seven candidates sought the nomination 
it followed an initial recount that was mandated by state law 
because the election was so close and a second recount of socalled 
undervotes in 21 counties undervotes are ballots read by machine 
that initially showed no vote for the governors race 
attorney general robert spire made the motion to certify 
nelsons victory spire said he was convinced that nelson had 
indeed won the nomination 
the washingtonbased consulting firm election data services said 
it was the closest primary or general election contest for governor 
in modern american politics 
spires decision meant he chose not to ask the state supreme 
court to order three counties gage cass and butler to reopen 
sealed ballot boxes and count their undervotes the three counties 
have refused to count undervotes contending that only a court can 
order them to reopen the ballot boxes 
spire noted that undervote recounts in the other counties made 
no material change in the outcome

blue skies blue seas brown bodies white 
sands the vista from the belmar boardwalk captures all the 
elements of a perfect summers day 
this is as it should be but not the way its always been few 
people here can forget the summer of 1988 when the tide ran brown 
and carried sewage and syringes onto abandoned shores 
this year the beach is back the water is clear and the ocean 
breezes carry the scent of salt water and suntan lotion and yet 
theres an undercurrent of uneasiness among those who care for the 
beach a sense that the days of innocence are over 
all it would take is two days of that northwest wind for that 
stuff to come washing in again said jack roberts lifeguard 
supervisor 
it hasnt been an entirely pristine summer here or elsewhere 
around the country 
just as the season was beginning an oil spill in new york 
harbor sent dribbles of tar onto beaches in new jersey and on new 
yorks long island a sewage spill closed three new york beaches 
last week oil from the tanker mega borg threatened beaches along 
the texas coast and at huntington beach in southern california 
heavy surf recently churned up buried oil from a tanker spill in 
february 
but there has been nothing comparable to the pollution that 
slimed large stretches of the east coast two years ago and tourism 
seems to be rebounding in areas that were hurt 
it looks to me like its going to be a very good season 
said ralph savastano the owner of ralphs snack shop on the belmar 
boardwalk the oceans been good theyve cleaned up the ocean 
really good 
the ocean is cleaner in fact at least that miniscule portion 
of it that laps onto new jerseys shores the state of new jersey 
has enacted some of the nations most stringent standards to 
monitor its water quality and pollutants havent exceeded those 
standards yet this year last year excessive pollution forced 
beaches to close 19 times in 1988 there were 68 closures 
in monmouth county which includes belmar public health 
coordinator lester jargowsky overflows with enthusiasm when he 
talks about the improvements positively unequivocally we have 
at this point the cleanest water you could ever jump into he 
said and i dont mean maybe 
one reason is that new jersey has stopped dumping raw sewage 
into the ocean sewage spills caused many of the problems two years 
ago also new york city has taken steps to keep its garbage from 
spilling close to shore but there also is some element of luck 
as roberts said freakish winds were partly responsible for the 
mess in 1988 
nationwide the natural resources defense council warned last 
week that water quality standards vary so widely from state to 
state and town to town that water thats considered polluted in one 
place might be considered clean in another 
the council a scientifically oriented environmental group 
urged the federal environmental protection agency to establish 
stricter national standards no one should have to swim in waters 
laced with human waste said council scientist allen hershkowitz 
roberts who heads a crew of about 40 lifeguards has been 
working on the beach for 25 years as his deep tan attests through 
long stretches of that time the water was brown and smelled foul 
but hes upbeat about this year 
this year there hasnt been one day when ive hesitated about 
going in the water he said other years there have been whole 
summers when i wouldnt go in unless i had to 
as befits someone whos spent his entire adult life on the 
beach roberts is eloquent about its attractions 
the ocean for one thing its like niagara falls or the 
northern lights or something it does something to your mind 
it makes you feel younger it makes you feel more romantic it 
unleashes something thats locked up the rest of the year and cant 
get out

nearly half of all americans say drug abuse is 
plaguing their neighborhoods and increasing numbers are skeptical 
about president bushs multibillion dollar war on cocaine a poll 
has found 
in september just after bush declared war on drugs 74 percent 
of americans believed the administration was making a serious 
effort to combat illegal drug use but that confidence has fallen 
to 59 percent 
at the same time nearly half the respondents to the media 
generalassociated press poll said drugs are a serious problem 
where they live that was up from 40 percent when bush announced 
the campaign 
many respondents more than four in 10 of those under age 45 
continued to say they know a cocaine user and while most believed 
the government can reduce drug abuse 55 percent expected the 
problem to worsen 
despite that concern the poll found a sharp drop in the number 
of americans citing drug abuse as the nations greatest problem 
down from 61 percent after bushs speech to 24 percent now 
but that gauge is one of the most sensitive to publicity and 
bushs remarks capped a monthslong media focus on the drug crisis 
even though it fell sharply in the new survey drug abuse remained 
the mostcited problem facing the country the federal deficit was 
nex named by 15 percent 
eighteen percent in the new poll said the problem of drug abuse 
is very serious in their own neighborhoods up from 14 percent 
in september and 30 percent said it was somewhat serious up 
from 26 percent 
the results confirmed the severity of the drug plague in poor 
areas poorer respondents were far more likely than the wealthiest 
to say drugs were a very serious problem in their 
neighborhoods of those earning less than 15000 a year 27 
percent called the problem very serious among those earning 
more than 50000 16 percent said so 
blacks were twice as likely as whites to call the drug problem 
very serious in their neighborhoods 35 percent to 17 percent 
and blacks were far more likely than whites to say they personally 
know someone who uses cocaine 52 percent to 31 percent 
the survey also found stark evidence of the addictive power of 
cocaine or its smokable derivative crack of the respondents who 
knew a cocaine user half said they believed the user was addicted 
that means one in six american adults personally knows a suspected 
cocaine addict 
the new poll was conducted by telephone may 1120 among a random 
sample of 1143 adults it had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
when it comes to combating drugs majorities continued to 
support strict measures against occasional users six in 10 said 
users cars should be confiscated if drugs are found inside and 
eight in 10 favored suspending their licenses 
but cracking down on domestic drug dealers was the preferred 
line of attack favored by 34 percent roughly two in 10 preferred 
cracking down on drug users or on foreign drug producers and the 
rest had no preference 
nearly eight in 10 also continued to support higher federal 
taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to finance the drug 
war sixtythree percent supported a 1 percent increase in 
corporate income taxes down from 70 percent last fall and 45 
percent favored a 1 percent increase in the income tax to pay for 
the fight against drugs 
still more than a third of the respondents 36 percent said 
they believe the federal government cannot significantly reduce 
drug abuse in this country despite the administrations efforts 
that level of doubt was up from 29 percent in the fall

can the irish love the english are they 
wrapped in a celtic shell or part of the european whole and when 
is an irishman an irishman 
these are some of the intriguing issues that arise in the 
euphoria sweeping ireland over its teams performance at the world 
cup soccer tournament 
from the prime minister to the 300000 welcoming irish who 
filled the streets of dublin on sunday from the editorials in the 
press to the banter in a thousand pubs all irish eyes have been on 
team manager jack charlton and his lads 
as one huge banner across the airport highway put it banally 
but truthfully irish eyes are smiling 
that the teams accents are more english than irish matters 
little nor does the fact that to irish purists soccer is a 
foreign import that manager charlton is a purebred englishman 
does not prevent some pundits proposing he be made president of 
ireland 
and that ireland was knocked out in the quarterfinals does not 
stop the nation behaving as though it won the cup 
reaching the quarterfinals in irelands first appearance in the 
tournament has been reason enough to fill the streets with the 
largest crowds seen in dublin since pope john paul ii visited in 
1979 
people stood for six hours for a glimpse of their heroes waving 
everything from irish flags to inflatable rubber shamrocks they 
hung from trees lampposts and the statue of oliver goldsmith 
outside trinity college 
the two opentopped doubledecker buses bringing the team from 
the airport needed three hours to inch through the throng and 
though the irish came home beaten the multitudes were singing 
oh well really shake em up when we win the wororld cup 
yes ireland is the greatest football team 
the event cast interesting light on the myriad cultural and 
linguistic strands that bind ireland to england its ancient foe 
many of the irish players belong to english league teams and are 
descendants of irish emigrants a couple of them claim irish 
citizenship on the strength of a single grandparent 
the team commented the irish times is a mixture of 
fullirish partbritish and a variety of other races thrown in 
the manager is a fullblown geordie from the newcastle area of 
northern england 
but the captain mick mccarthy said of the crowd sunday in a 
broad north england accent theyve made us feel very very proud 
to be irish and despite what many people may say every member of 
this team is 110percent irish 
irish sport can make potent politics the gaelic athletic 
association long a vehicle of irish nationalism has always 
regarded soccer as an alien sport and still wont lend its stadiums 
to soccer matches 
but an association official pat daley acknowledged that a 
greater degree of ecumenism is inevitable 
in an interview he noted that the associations limerick 
chapter had proposed lending its ground to an irelandsoviet union 
soccer game 
permission wasnt forthcoming he said but the very notion 
would have been unheard of 10 years ago 
during the world cup games the association ran tv ads extolling 
its sports trying to show that the sports of hurling and gaelic 
football are more exciting than soccer but for as long as ireland 
was in the world cup no sport but soccer mattered 
it was the most liberating few weeks ive ever experienced in 
ireland wrote columnist nuala o faolain in the irish times 
her paper felt the team brought us closer to the wider world 
including our near neighbors they have brought about a great 
boosting of national morale which is not limited by class or creed 
or politics 
they have shown that there is a way to be proud of being 
irish without triumphalism or resentment toward those of other 
races and traditions they have done well for ireland 
ireland played tenacious defense in the opening matches to gain 
a 11 tie with england a scoreless tie with egypt and a 11 
deadlock with a strong dutch team in the second round ireland 
defeated romania on penalty kicks to advance to the quarterfinals 
where italy defeated the irish team 10 on saturday 
the bighearted irish gave most of their adulation not to 
homegrown heroes but to charlton the blunt 55yearold former 
soccer star who turned a nondescript team into one of the world 
cups top eight 
the aircraft bringing the team home was renamed st jack in his 
honor and the crowds chanted over and over we want jack 
as the irish press commented if as our history shows we 
have had a pretty raw deal from england over the past 800 years 
then she has made some amends by giving us jack charlton

there was just one thing wrong with a 
commemorative cup issued to benefit the citys literacy program 
the mayors name was spelled wrong 
the cups were distributed by cocacola to vendors at the 10th 
anniversary celebration of baltimores redeveloped waterfront 
which began monday they declared that proceeds would benefit the 
literacy initiative of baltimore citys mayor kurt l schnoke 
mayor kurt l schmoke took the error in stride 
ive heard it was a problem with the cocacola print shop 
said schmoke laughing at the typographical error i guess ill 
just have to stay around for another 10 years and see that they get 
it right next time

authorities will negotiate with 
communist rebels rather than use military force to try to gain the 
release of a us peace corps volunteer a provincial official said 
monday 
timothy swanson 26 of cheyenne wyo was kidnapped june 13 
from his home in the village of patag on the central island of 
negros he was taken by four to eight new peoples army guerrillas 
who told his filipino wife they were just borrowing him 
daniel lacson governor of negros occidental province said he 
met monday with us officials who gave him authority to work for 
swansons release 
no military operation unless we exhaust political means 
lacson said he said he would form a committee to negotiate with 
the rebels 
the bottom line is to get swanson alive lacson said 
swanson was among seven peace corps volunteers assigned to 
negros where he worked in a nursery project 
the us embassy said it learned of the abduction only saturday 
because the rebels warned swansons wife a rural school teacher 
not to report the incident 
she did so only after us officials ordered the 261 peace corps 
volunteers to leave the philippines because intelligence reports 
indicated rebels might try to kill or kidnap them 
negros 300 miles southeast of manila is a stronghold of the 
rebels whose 21yearold insurgency is aimed at establishing a 
marxist state in the philippines 
on monday 15 people were killed in two separate battles between 
communist guerrillas and government forces on negros they included 
three rebels killed about 20 miles south of swansons village 
four militiamen an agricultural official and seven civilians 
were killed when rebels fired at them after their vehicle struck a 
rebel mine in the southern part of the island 
swansons kidnapping has revealed signs of strained 
usphilippine relations officials in president corazon aquinos 
government accused the united states of overreacting to the rebel 
threat and one even hinted that swanson may have defected 
after the abduction was reported sunday presidential press 
secretary tomas gomez said it might have been avoided if us 
officials had consulted with philippine officials on security 
gomez was asked monday whether given reports that swanson was 
friendly with the rebels the volunteer might have gone with them 
freely 
he said that was speculative but added of course the 
telltale marks are there he did not elaborate 
swansons father leonard said his son knew rebels in the area 
but that he never considered them a threat 
he tried to be friendly with all the folks in the village and 
all who he encountered swansons father said in an interview in 
cheyenne 
in manila military chief of staff gen renato de villa said the 
government would try to free swanson peacefully but would use force 
if necessary 
us embassy spokesman stanley schrager said american officials 
were in negros to discuss ways to win swansons release he said no 
payment would be made to the guerrillas 
president bush vacationing in kennebunkport me said sunday 
that us officials were very much worried by swansons 
abduction

teachers union leader albert shanker says the 
public is grasping at radical school reforms because the 
educational system is not taking the initiative and he blames 
footdragging administrators 
in an interview on the eve of the american federation of 
teachers annual convention the president of the 744000member 
union said administrators have responded to the national clamor for 
better schools with a lot of public relations and no action 
the country is 100 percent full of verbal commitment for 
change but thats where it ends verbal he said sunday 
as the convention got under way this morning he gave a 
stateoftheunion address telling the 3200 delegates that 
the groups membership has grown by 70000 in the past two years 
and outlining achievements during the groups 75year history 
shanker will deliver a second speech on wednesday dealing with 
educational issues he said in the interview it will likely include 
sharp criticism of school boards and superintendents who he says 
have failed to respond zealously to school reform 
shanker has said he also blames the bush administration for a 
very poor record of commitment on implementing the national 
education goals agreed upon in february by bush and the 50 
governors 
still shanker opened the convention by reading a brief message 
from first lady barbara bush congratulating the union on its 75th 
anniversary she said her work in literacy had taught her that 
teachers cannot do the job alone 
teachers reserved their warmest greeting for massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis who told cheering delegates we should be 
holding this convention in the east room of the white house there 
are some folks in washington who could use some education 
other scheduled speakers at the aft gathering this week include 
senator edward kennedy dmass and us secretary of education 
lauro cavazos 
in the interview shanker said a central theme of this years 
gathering will be his belief that radical school reorganization in 
chicago and the spreading popularity of choice plans that let 
parents decide where to send their children to school are among 
growing signs of public impatience with the pace of reform 
a resolution to be voted on by aft delegates later this week 
reiterates the unions openness to choice schemes but adds the 
unions opposition to any such plan that includes public funding of 
private schools 
shanker said his union has been open to such reform ideas as 
choice and merit pay but administrators have too rarely responded 
with leadership he said 
the convention runs through thursday the rival 2millionmember 
national education association will gather in kansas city on 
thursday through sunday 
later today the aft was to release findings of its annual 
teacher salary survey showing average us pay topping 31000 
other issues to be tackled this week by teacher delegates 
include a resolution calling for phasing out standardized 
multiplechoice testing a notion the aft considered dangerously 
radical less than a decade ago 
the convention will also play host to some 60 foreign delegates 
many of them from emerging democracies in eastern europe 
a resolution would commit the aft to helping budding democratic 
teacher unions in those countries 
jan urban a former czechoslovak teacher who was instrumental in 
helping elect czechoslavak president vaclav havel will address the 
convention later in the week

the japanese government moving to improve 
trade relations with the united states agreed to toughen 
enforcement of antimonopoly laws on companies in japan the 
justice departments top antitrust official said monday 
the changes in laws against pricefixing bidrigging group 
boycotts and other practices should improve the ability of 
american companies to sell products in japan said james rill 
assistant attorney general for antitrust 
lax antitrust enforcement in japan has been a major sticking 
point in talks to reduce the huge us trade deficit with japan 
we are very very positive about these steps by the japanese 
for they represent in a oneyear period a very very substantial 
departure from the practices that existed before rill said of 
the agreement reached last week in tokyo 
the japanese government has promised to step up criminal 
enforcement of existing laws propose higher fines for civil 
antitrust violations and make private lawsuits easier to pursue in 
japans courts 
tougher antitrust enforcement is expected to reduce group 
boycotts of products which some have called a way of life in 
japan rill said 
the changes should erase the hurdle posed by those boycotts 
on us importation and other countries importation of products 
into japan he said 
japans free trade commission also agreed to make public its 
legal and factual findings in antitrust cases so that private 
plaintiffs can pursue lawsuits 
the two nations announced agreement last week on a wideranging 
package of economic reforms aimed at eliminating many trade 
barriers and reducing disputes over trade issues that have soured 
the usjapan relationship the united states currently runs about 
a 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
rill dismissed the notion that the japanese have a history of 
not keeping commitments on trade matters 
we dont believe they would make these public commitments 
after such arduous talks over such a long period of time without an 
intention to follow through on them he said 
the procurement and transport ministries have agreed to increase 
efforts to root out bidrigging and to increase the time that 
companies guilty of such collusion would be barred from getting 
government contracts he said

the chief of the tactical air command learned 
after the panama invasion that stealth fighterbombers missed their 
targets but did not tell his superiors because he believed others 
had done so a spokesman said today 
col ron sconyers a spokesman for gen robert d russ said in 
a telephone interview from tactical air command headquarters at 
langley air force base va that it was at least 10 to 15 days 
after the operation before russ learned of the missed targets 
sconyers said russ assumed that officers who were in the 
operational chain of command for the invasion as he was not would 
have informed their superiors at the pentagon and that it was not 
necessary for him to do so 
the spokesman said russ did take steps to improve training as a 
result of the information he had received 
the new york times reporting on what it said was a classified 
air force report said in todays editions that the lack of 
information led defense secretary dick cheney to brag about how 
accurate the bombing had been when bombs actually missed by as much 
as 160 yards 
the newspaper also said the report concluded there were defects 
in planning the panama operation confusion over the mission of the 
planes poor coordination between the army and the air force in 
picking targets and inadequate pilot training for the weather 
conditions over the targets 
russ gave the newspaper a statement saying he had left it up to 
army commanders to tell the pentagon how the invasion fared 
sconyers said neither he nor russ had seen the classified report 
general russ eventually knew that the aircraft had missed its 
targets but not early on sconyers said 
in the panama operation the spokesman said russ whose command 
controls the air force fighter planes is basically just a 
supplier of aircraft he is not part of the operational chain of 
command 
because he wasnt part of the operational chain of command and 
doesnt receive or generate operational reports he made the 
assumption that that would be done through the operational chain of 
command sconyers said 
in hindsight he would have done it a little differently the 
spokesman said 
there was never any intent on gen russ part at all to 
withhold information he said in fact he acted on that 
information and made some training decisions based on that 
information 
there is always some confusion in the reporting of any 
military operation and i didnt want to add to it russ 
statement said 
he added when i look back at what has transpired it is 
evident that more detail should have been forwarded 
the report on the performance of the f117a called stealth for 
its ability to avoid radar detection was prepared by the air force 
inspector general lt gen bradley c hosmer 
cheney had demanded an explanation following reports that a bomb 
from one of the two planes had actually hit a hillside some 
distance from the intended target 
after receiving the report cheneys spokesman said may 31 that 
cheney was satisified that air force officials didnt try to 
mislead him

rising incomes and falling mortgage rates and 
prices boosted the typical american familys ability to buy an 
existing singlefamily home in may a real estate trade group said 
monday 
the national association of realtors said its housing 
affordability index was 1056 in may up from 1043 the previous 
month 
that means a family earning the national median income of 
34142 had 1056 percent of the income needed to qualify for 
conventional financing covering 80 percent of the medianpriced 
home costing 94800 
the median income means of half the families earned more and 
half less the median price means half of the homes cost more half 
less 
because the national median income in may exceeded the 
qualifying income a family earning 34142 could purchase a home 
priced at 100300 
the median price of a home declined 800 in may while incomes 
rose 110 mortgage rates edged downward from 1015 percent to 
1014 percent 
home buying conditions were good in may and while they could 
have been better 1056 is an extremely healthy level said 
realtors president norman d flynn during the early 1980s when 
interest rates were nearing the 20 percent mark the index was in 
the low 70s 
flynn said the realtors expect rates to hover just under 10 
percent for the rest of the year 
the mortgage rate used to calculate the index is a composite of 
closing rates offered for fixedrate and adjustablerate mortgages 
for existing homes as reported by the federal housing finance board 
changes in the national median home price and the average 
mortgage rate from april to may resulted in a 7 decrease in the 
monthly mortgage payment to 673 the realtors said

nasa engineers said today they must find and 
quickly fix a hydrogen leak that has grounded the space shuttle 
fleet or the agency will have to postpone still more shuttle 
missions 
space shuttle chief william lenoir said it was still not known 
what caused a hydrogen leak in two of the nations three space 
shuttles but he said the problem must be fixed within a few weeks 
to keep nasa anywhere near its ambitious flight schedule 
columbia was to have been launched in may on an astronomy 
mission the schedule called for other launches by atlantis in 
july columbia again in august and then discovery in october 
a leak in columbias hydrogen system in may and the discovery 
last week of a similar leak on atlantis scrambled that nasa launch 
schedule and lenoir said it is unclear now if the agency can 
recover in time to fly all the missions this year 
discoverys flight cannot be changed because its cargo is the 
ulysses science probe that is to study the sun the craft must be 
launched during a planetary alignment that occurs only once in 
every two years 
were right on the edge of the point where two flights no 
longer fit in the schedule before the launch of ulysses said 
lenoir fixing the leak he said will have to be quick and simple 
to avoid more changes in the nasa launch schedule 
parts of columbia are being tested in a laboratory and lenoir 
said that atlantis may again be tested on the launch pad at the 
kennedy space center in florida the engineers he said should 
have more answers by thursday 
meanwhile an investigation should start formally later this 
week on why the hubble space telescope was launched with a flawed 
focusing system 
engineers testing the orbiting space telescope found last week 
that either the primary or the secondary mirrors on the 15 
billion telescope were flawed so badly that starlight could not be 
focused as precisely as had been planned the poor focus seriously 
affects how well the telescope can study the universe 
nasa chief scientist lennard fisk said that scientists are 
working to determine how the unfocused light can be manipulated by 
computer to give clear pictures of the distant stars 
there are two characteristics of the people who work for nasa 
were stubborn and were clever said fisk were going to make 
this thing work 
fisk said that the agency will complete the appointment of an 
investigation committee this week he said the investigation would 
review the entire history of hubble and should find answers for why 
the mirrors are flawed

homeowners trimmed trees and 
cleared brush to deny fuel for future fires as officials warned 
relief from blazes that scorched tens of thousands of acres may be 
shortlived in the droughtplagued region 
at the scene of the worst devastation santa barbara county fire 
capt charlie johnson said firefighters would be putting out hot 
spots all day using a helicopter with infrared cameras to spot 
danger areas gusts to 35 mph had flared up without warning from 
forecasters he said 
it caused some edginess because those crews didnt expect it 
to come up johnson said 
the blaze was expected to be declared controlled by tuesday 
morning but because of the possibility of flare ups some 
personnel might stand by for a week or 10 days johnson said 
at least 50 people were cited on charges of sightseeing at an 
emergency scene a misdemeanor that can be punished with a 500 
fine and six months in jail sheriffs spokesman tim gracey said 
he said there was no evidence that anything had been stolen 
to be honest with you theres not a heck of a lot left to 
steal however the gapers were going around roadblocks and 
interfering with utility crews and residents he said 
theres nothing anyone could find in there but its 
irritating to think someone was trying said john warkentin who 
said someone combing the ruins of his house had moved a filing 
cabinet and opened its drawers 
the improved fire picture did not mean the states problems were 
over officials said 
its a reprieve not the end arnold hartigan spokesman for 
the national fire information center in boise idaho said sunday 
weve got a long summer to go yet 
the worst of the fires the 4900acre blaze that leveled an 
estimated 430 houses and 28 apartment buildings on the fringe of 
santa barbara was contained saturday evening ten businesses and 
four public buildings also were burned 
the glendale fire which destroyed dozens of homes in los 
angeles county was out major fires that burned thousands of acres 
in san diego riverside and san bernardino county also were either 
controlled or contained meaning fire lines had been cut around 
them 
the widely scattered fires ranging from santa barbara 200 
miles south to san diego county killed two people destroyed or 
damaged 520 homes and burned 22000 acres officials said 
early estimates of the financial loss topped 250 million at 
least five of the fires were believed set officials said 
elsewhere large blazes were brought under control in arizona 
and texas and firefighters hoped to have a 3875acre blaze in 
colorado under control by tuesday 
hartigan said there was a special danger of new fires in the 
region left tinder dry by four years of drought during this weeks 
fourth of july holiday if people do not curb traditional fireworks 
celebrations he said 
the idea were trying to get across especially now is that 
brush woods and fireworks do not mix hartigan said its not 
a good idea to take fireworks legal or not out into the woods or 
brushy canyons to set them off 
with a presidential disaster declaration for los angeles and 
santa barbara counties made saturday federal emergency management 
agency offices were expected to be opened by tuesday 
structural losses in santa barbara county were put at 238 
million but county supervisor bill wallace said the value might 
top 500 million 
the santa barbara fire which killed a woman was set about 6 
pm wednesday by an arsonist no arrests have been made 
scores of sightseers on sunday parked along san marcos pass road 
to gaze at the charred brush and firefighters at work 
i think the whole thing is incredible that an arsonist could 
do so much damage said irv bromberg a tourist from coral 
springs fla 
another fatality occurred in riverside county where an inmate 
firefighter died of burns suffered in a blaze near hemet 
in arizona meanwhile the worst wildfire in the states history 
was contained sunday after burning 28480 acres in the tonto

the construction industry remained in a slump 
in may as spending dropped 04 percent for its second straight 
monthly decline the government said monday 
private spending has been weak and probably will remain weak 
for the next few months said david berson chief economist for 
the federal national mortgage association government spending also 
will slow given the large budget deficits at all levels 
added david seiders chief economist for the national 
association of home builders the second quarter certainly is 
shaping up to be a negative 
the commerce department reported that residential 
nonresidential and government construction spending totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4456 billion after falling 22 
percent in april 
the april decline was even worse than the 07 percent drop first 
reported last month march spending on the other hand was revised 
upward from a 07 percent decrease to a 04 percent increase 
residential construction fell 22 percent to an annual rate of 
1997 billion after a 14 percent decline in april singlefamily 
building dropped 39 percent to 1158 billion on top of a 38 
percent decline a month earlier 
berson attributed the falloff in residential building to high 
interest rates and declining demand after 7 years of a growing 
economy 
builders also have complained of tighter restrictions on lending 
following the savings and loan debacle 
nevertheless apartment building posted a second straight 
monthly increase spending was up 10 percent to an annual rate of 
206 billion after gaining 20 percent in april 
nonresidential spending however fell 17 percent to an annual 
rate of 1016 billion after sliding 14 percent in each of the 
previous two months 
part of the problem in this sector berson said is high vacancy 
rates particularly in office buildings in many parts of the 
country 
the volatile government spending area nearly recovered its 49 
percent loss in april rebounding 44 percent to an annual rate of 
1091 billion 
the total construction figure was up 25 percent from the level 
of a year ago

a woman who falsely accused a man of raping 
her was ordered to run radio and newspaper advertisements 
apologizing to him but the man says the sentence will not undo the 
damage 
you cant change a wrong to a right said gary nitsch i 
lost a job i had to get a lawyer the kids at school were saying 
to my kids your dads a rapist 
and the ads may never be printed or aired 
elizabeth irene richardson 24 is considering appealing the 
sentence which the nebraska civil liberties union says may be 
cruel and unusual punishment 
ms richardson accused nitsch 44 of overton of raping her in 
september 1988 he was arrested and charged with sexual assault 
ms richardson testified that nitsch raped her but the case was 
dropped for lack of strong physical evidence 
word later reached authorities that ms richardson told friends 
the rape was a hoax she was convicted of perjury last february 
county attorney john marsh said the womans motives centered on 
trying to get the attention of her husband a truck driver who was 
often away from home 
a judge ordered ms richardson to apologize to nitsch in a 
halfpage advertisement in every newspaper and a spot on each radio 
station in dawson county a county of about 22000 in central 
nebraska 
the media campaign was expected to cost about 1000 her 
attorneys say she also was sentenced to 180 days in jail and was 
placed on two years probation 
a panel of state civil liberties union attorneys who reviewed 
the case said the sentence may violate ms richardsons rights 
under the eighth and 14th amendments 
the eighth amendment protects against cruel and unusual 
punishment and the 14th ensures due process 
the organization is concerned about the scarlet letter 
approach in sentencing said bill schatz nclu executive 
director suppose someone is arrested for shoplifting are we 
going to make him wear a sign saying hes a convicted shoplifter 
is there such a thing as punishment fitting crime 
if the case is appealed the organization will offer research 
services and may file a friendofthecourt brief schatz said 
nitsch said he was still puzzled how his name came up 
he said he met ms richardson once in the spring or summer of 
1988 when he went to her house inquiring about a painting job she 
had advertised 
i would just like to have someone tell me how i was named 
he said 
he says his ordeal has taken a toll on his family 
he said his wife naomi doesnt like to come to town and face 
people his 18yearold daughter quit high school in march 
because of the way she was treated nitsch said 
weve lived in a trailer house since 1973 he said were 
saving for a home but when you have attorneys fees its hard 
nitsch said he was fired from his job as a driver after being 
questioned at work by authorities and jailed three days hes now a 
parttime construction worker 
he said he wants a fulltime job but people want clean help 
they dont want somebody thats been in trouble with the law 
i used to go into town and drink coffee and joke with people 
but everything just kind of turned sour nitsch said 
the first year i was so depressed i didnt even want people 
to see me he said if i went into town i had to have somebody 
drive me so i could scoot down in the seat so nobody would see me 
nitsch said he is also bitter about the way authorities handled 
his case his attorneys are suing four sheriffs deputies for 
100000 alleging he was arrested and his home was searched 
without cause 
mr nitsch is apparently the victim of some lies but that is 
not the fault of the sheriffs department said randy goyette an 
attorney representing the dawson county sheriffs office 
jim orourke now a district court judge was dawson county 
attorney at the time 
i believe that the case was very professionally and accurately 
handled orourke said we went with what we had and we did the 
best we could 
orourke said ms richardson decided not to pursue the case 
after he told her the trial would be difficult for her without 
corroborating physical evidence orourke said he never doubted her 
story but added i think its been established that hes been a 
victim

a prosecutor urged jurors today to convict 
raymond buckey of child molestation but said the decision must be 
based on more than the testimony of three children 
i would not ask you to convict the defendant in this case 
based solely on the testimony of the children said deputy 
district attorney pam ferrero in her closing argument 
the childrens testimony is corroborated by the circumstantial 
evidence in this case she added 
she told jurors they should look at videotapes made during the 
childrens interviews at a child therapy center and read the 
expressions on the childrens faces rather than listening to their 
words to determine whether they were molested 
she said the children had sometimes denied being molested 
because of threats from buckey that the youngsters parents would 
be killed if they told what had happened to them at the mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach 
this particular case boils down to credibility the 
prosecutor said who do you believe if you believe the children 
then the people have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt 
however she conceded that the childrens testimony was not 
clear on all points and required corroboration she also warned 
jurors that the three girls who testified during the trial had been 
through so many different interviews and witnessstand appearances 
during the past seven years that their testimony might be 
contradictory 
buckey is being tried for the second time on eight counts of 
child molestation the first trial ended jan 18 with buckeys 
mother acquitted of all charges and buckey acquitted of 40 counts 
of molestation jurors deadlocked on 13 other charges against 
buckey however and prosecutors refiled eight of those counts 
what would you be able to relate to after this number of 
testimonies and interviews ms ferrero asked she said some of 
the children were telling the story for the umpteenth millionth 
time 
as ms ferrero spoke the 32yearold buckey wearing a dark 
suit and tie sat at the counsel table with his lawyers and looked 
directly at jurors he has testified that he never molested any 
children while he was a teacher at his familys nowdefunct 
preschool

west germanys biggest union 
gave a glimpse of its power to mobilize east germanys anxious work 
force monday by orchestrating a series of strikes by thousands of 
factory workers 
a west german employer group also is advising east germanys 
newly private enterprises on how to deal with their increasingly 
militant workers 
one day after east germany merged its economy with the west and 
opened its borders to the free market the west germans were taking 
their labormanagement struggle to the new economic frontier of the 
east 
about 3000 workers staged a onehour warning strike at the 
giant locomotive electronics works in hennigsdorf a city of brown 
brick factories and 25000 people about 12 miles northwest of 
berlin 
they were among 30000 workers in 10 factories around berlin who 
staged brief strikes or protests monday as a prelude to wage talks 
between management and the powerful ig metall labor union 
the union which has 27 million west german members has added 
17 million east german metalworkers to its new east german 
affiliate since last autumns revolt against communism 
the union is demanding wage increases and guaranteed jobs as 
east germany begins its transition to a market economy a process 
expected to result in widespread factory closings and joblessness 
if kohl wants to go into the annals of history hell have to 
pay for it said local union leader karlheinz graffenberger 
referring to west german chancellor helmut kohls swift push for 
german unification 
graffenberger and other union leaders spoke to thousands of 
workers who put down their tools at 1 pm and marched out of the 
sprawling factory complex which produces locomotives welding 
equipment and other metal products 
the crowd gathered at the factorys clubhouse to hear speakers 
demand better wages to keep pace with the higherpriced western 
goods now filling east german stores 
the rally concluded minutes before ig metall leaders from both 
german states began talks with representatives for 151 factories 
around berlin representing about 200000 workers 
ig metall has been financing and advising the east german labor 
movement and handed out 90000 fliers alone on monday to workers 
around the region 
we tell our colleagues how things like this work said 
wolfgang berger a union organizer from ig metall headquarters in 
frankfurt west germany who was at mondays strike rally 
but the employer group the association of metal and electronics 
industries is also being advised by its western counterpart with 
which it will merge on sept 25 said a spokesman 
christoph borchelt a west german who is spokesman for the east 
german employer association said east german factories are too 
vulnerable now to withstand serious labor unrest 
these companies have absolutely no money he said he called 
the demands by the union very massive 
prime minister lothar de maiziere warned workers last week that 
strikes only would worsen the threat of mass unemployment as the 
countrys aging overstaffed enterprises are forced to compete with 
western businesses 
the giant locomotive factory however is one of the stronger 
east german enterprises and exports goods to greece brazil and 
several east bloc countries said wilhelm kuenzel head of the 
supply division 
but he said some operations of the company are unprofitable and 
only are being continued to avoid layoffs he said 500 jobs on 
friday were eliminated all by early retirements 
under the currency union east germans had their wages converted 
from nearly worthless east german marks to west german marks at an 
artificially high 11 exchange 
but workers who walked off their jobs monday said they need 
westernstyle wages to keep pace with the prices of western 
products now filling east german stores 
workers at the locomotive factory make about 1000 marks or 
600 and the union is demanding a 400mark 240 increase 
the average east german now earns about 1200 west german marks 
720 a month less than half the average west german salary 
however east german rents and other basic items will be kept low 
for a while to help compensate 
but kerstin arendt 21 an inventory worker who makes 640 marks 
per month after deductions or 390 said housing heating and food 
costs already are skyrocketing 
with 600 marks you dont get very far she said

the west german mark remained 
strong monday in closely watched trading sessions that followed the 
powerful currencys introduction into east germany 
currency dealers said the mark also was strengthened by the 
possibility of us tax increases to combat an american deficit 
the mark was fixed at 16538 to the dollar in frankfurt up from 
16715 marks on friday in london the mark was pegged at 16535 to 
the dollar up from 16635 marks on friday 
the stock market in frankfurt on monday also reacted favorably 
to the first business day of economic union and the german stock 
index climbed to 191258 from 187990 on friday 
dealers remained optimistic that the west german stock market 
could be set for a continued rising trend if the economic union 
progesses smoothly to keep the inflation rate down 
although markets were steady to improved one dealer cautioned 
that warning strikes at some east german factories on monday could 
be troubling to money and stock markets 
according to the powerful ig metall metalworkers union which is 
heading negotiations for new labor contracts in east germany 
thousands of people took part in brief warning strikes at more than 
20 plants to press demands for more pay and better working 
conditions 
during the past several days west german central bank officials 
have repeatedly emphasized that the dangers of inflation from 
economic union previously anticipated by some experts had waned 
the west german government said it was very satisified with how 
smoothly the currency union was going 
the people in east germany have with the dmark won their 
freedom as consumers they will make intelligent use of that 
deputy government spokesman dieter vogel said at a news conference 
in bonn 
west germany sent 25 billion marks 151 billion from its 
national banks cash reserves of new bills to cover initial phase 
of economic unification 
no new money had to be printed to cover the project 
finance minister theo waigel said in a sunday news conference 
that only one fourth 379 billion of the new west german marks 
were withdrawn in cash by the east germans they were able to 
exchange a limited mumber of east german marks for west german 
marks at a 11 rate but kept most of it in their their bank and 
savings ccounts 
moderate withdrawals from accounts by the east germans averaged 
only about 800 marks 485 far below the limit of 2000 marks 
1200 set under the rules 
dealers said that kept the amount of new money in circulation 
far below the expected high resulting in a strong and steady mark 
on world markets 
stores throughout east germany reported that most customers were 
closely checking new prices and not rushing to make purchases

a lost and injured alaska sled dog retraced 
the route of a 250mile sled dog trip it took with its owner along 
the soviet coast 
the white husky named vixen was found at the starting point of 
the sled dog trip and was flown to alaska where it was reunited 
sunday with its owner sue steinacher of nome 
steinacher an artist and teacher thought she had seen the last 
of vixen on april 13 after completing a sled trip from the soviet

carrying her two soviet mushers and about 30 dogs crashed after 
takeoff from uelen on the bering strait which separates the soviet 
union and alaska

steinachers dogs vixen and another dog were missing 
i saw her running around outside the plane she was in bad 
shape said steinacher who suffered four broken ribs and bruises 
in the crash 
the people in uelen tried to catch these dogs a friend of 
mine there would take walks in the evening and try to find them 
one of the hunters was leaving food at the crash site she said 
but vixen eluded villagers 
she was a very shy dog 
steinacher disputed one report that vixen was seen in another 
village between uelen and provideniya then there was another 
account that vixen had been shot by siberian eskimos defending wild 
reindeer herds from wolves but it was her other missing dog that 
was shot and killed 
then asanassi makovnev the leader of an earlier sled dog 
expedition flew to provideniya to check out another whitedog

the united states tightened its grip on the 
title of worlds largest debtor nation in 1989 ending the year 
with a net debt of 6637 billion up a sharp 25 percent from the 
previous year 
the latest figures based on data collected by the commerce 
department are certain to heighten the emotional debate over 
whether the united states is losing control of its financial 
destiny to foreigners 
the commerce department report showed that us holdings of 
overseas assets rose by 1469 billion last year to 1412 
trillion a gain of 116 percent 
but foreign holdings in the united states climbed at an even 
faster pace of 156 percent rising by 2796 billion to 2076 
trillion 
the 6637 billion imbalance between what americans own overseas 
and what foreigners own in the united states is the countrys net 
debtor position many private economists believe it will top 1 
trillion within a few years 
as recently as 1983 the united states was still the worlds 
largest creditor nation a position now held by japan the 1983 
surplus of 89 billion fell to 33 billion in 1984 and disappeared 
altogether in 1985 the year the country became a net debtor for 
the first time in 71 years 
the surplus was eroded by americas huge merchandise trade 
deficits as americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign 
hands to pay for imported cars and television sets 
those dollars have been reinvested in everything from us 
treasury bills to prime real estate in many american cities 
raising cries that foreigners are buying america 
the commerce department reported that 54 percent of the increase 
in foreign holdings in 1989 came from direct investment defined as 
at least 10 percent ownership of a company 
britain retained its position as the country with the largest 
amount of direct investment in the united states at 11914 
billion a 17 percent increase over the 1988 level japan was no 2 
with 6970 billion in direct investment up 31 percent from 1988 
the largest japanese transaction last year was sony corps 34 
billion purchase of columbia pictures 
while supporters defend the foreign buying surge as proof of 
americas attractive investment opportunities critics contend that 
the development shows that the united states has become overly 
dependent on foreign capital to finance its huge budget and trade 
deficits 
the united states is going ever more in debt that keeps 
interest rates higher in this country because of the need to 
attract foreign capital and it hurts our ability to compete 
internationally in a number of ways said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
the commerce departments bureau of economic analysis took the 
unusual position of deleting the debtor position from mondays 
report although it supplied enough detail that it was a simple 
matter to arrive at the bottomline figure 
bea director allan young denied that there had been any pressure 
from the bush administration to obscure a politically embarrassing 
figure he said he ordered the net debtor figure omitted because of 
a belief that it had become statistically invalid a problem the 
bea is working to correct 
the problem involves the value given to the assets at the 
present time direct investment is valued at its historical 
purchase price thus tending to understate older us investments 
in relation to newer foreign purchases in this country 
but private economists said that even when all the assets are 
reported at current value the united states is still likely to be 
a net debtor by a considerable margin 
they said the debate over valuation of the assets neglects the 
more important question over americas evergrowing foreign 
borrowings 
we are competing for money on international capital markets 
with countries such as emerging democracies in eastern europe who 
desperately need investment funding said david wyss chief 
financial economist of drimcgraw hill in our case we are 
borrowing just because we are too undisciplined to pay our bills 
c fred bergsten head of the institute for international 
economics said that while us assets were undervalued there was 
also a serious problem in overlooking some foreign assets in the 
united states because of faulty datagathering he said the two 
errors probably cancelled each other out leaving the net debtor 
number at about the right level 
in our reading the united states is still the biggest debtor 
country but the government doesnt like publishing a report which 
makes that point said bergsten who is writing a book on 
americas debtor position

the chief of the tactical air command 
intensified training for stealth fighterbomber crews after 
learning that they had missed their targets in panama but did not 
pass the information on to the pentagon a spokesman said monday 
col ron sconyers a spokesman for gen robert d russ 
commented after the new york times reported that a classified air 
force report concluded russ the commands chief knew of the 
failures by the radarevading aircraft but did not tell his 
superiors 
general russ eventually knew that the aircraft had missed its 
targets but not early on sconyers said he said it was at least 
10 to 15 days after the operation when the general found out russ 
made training decisions based on that information he said 
but he said the general did not think it was up to him to make a 
report to the pentagon because he was basically just a supplier 
of aircraft he is not part of the operational chain of command 
the tactical air command is responsible for tactics and training 
for the f117a called stealth for its ability to avoid radar 
detection 
because he wasnt part of the operational chain of command and 
doesnt receive or generate operational reports he made the 
assumption that that would be done through the operational chain of 
command sconyers said 
there was never any intent on gen russs part to withhold 
information the spokesman said he added in hindsight he 
would have done it a little differently 
russ in a statement given to the times in response to two 
questions said there is always some confusion in the reporting 
of any military operation and i didnt want to add to it when 
look back at what has transpired it is evident that more detail 
should have been forwarded 
the times said a lack of information had initially led defense 
secretary dick cheney to brag about how accurate the bombing had 
been when bombs actually missed by as much as 160 yards 
cheney demanded an explanation following reports that a bomb 
from one of the two planes had hit a hillside some distance from 
the intended target 
after receiving the report cheneys spokesman pete williams 
said may 31 that cheney was satisfied that air force officials 
didnt try to mislead him

a government spokesman said tuesday 
that imelda marcos was still banned from returning home despite her 
acquittal on racketeering and fraud charges in the united states 
presidential press secretary tomas gomez also said mrs marcos 
acquittal monday may hamper efforts to recover money she and her 
late husband former president ferdinand marcos allegedly stole 
during his 20year administration 
a federal jury in new york cleared mrs marcos of charges of 
looting the philippine treasury of 222 million to buy real estate 
jewelry and art the second defendant adnan khashoggi was 
acquitted of charges he helped mrs marcos hide ownership of the 
property 
i am disappointed gomez said in my mind shes guilty as 
hell 
gomez said the government was still drafting an official 
statement on the decision the verdict was announced about 2 am 
manila time and gomez did not know whether mrs aquino had been 
informed 
on monday mrs aquino said she would not allow imelda to return 
to the philippines regardless of the verdict 
she will have her day in court gomez said of mrs marcos 
but not unless she is allowed to return the position 
yesterday was that she was not allowed to return for security 
reasons that stands as of now 
the philippine constitution bans trials in absentia the aquino 
government claims marcos and his associates stole 10 billion 
before he was ousted in the 1986 uprising that propelled mrs 
aquino to power 
but the government has never filed criminal charges against any 
member of the marcos family for fear they would demand their right 
to return and face accusers marcos died last september in hawaii 
and mrs aquino forbade his burial here 
asked whether the verdict would undermine efforts to recover the 
alleged hidden wealth gomez said i suppose it will have 
this will be an obstacle 
much of the money is believed to have been deposited in swiss 
banks swiss authorities have been reluctant to lift banking 
secrecy laws and transfer funds without criminal charges 
gomez said many filipinos including mrs aquino harbored 
bitter memories of the marcos presidency 
imelda marcos is responsible for the assasination of ninoy 
aquino and we should never forget that gomez said 
he was referring to mrs aquinos husband a former senator who 
was assassinated in 1983 moments after returning from exile in the 
united states to challenge marcos 
forty people mostly soldiers are on trial for the aquino 
assasination the trial began in april 1987 and is still dragging 
on 
dzmm radio urged listeners to telephone their reactions to mrs 
marcos verdict most expressed shock and disbelief a few were 
convinced the jurors were bribed 
until now i still cant believe that shes been acquitted 
said radio commentator bert berbon 
the acquittal is bound to convince many filipinos that the 
united states set mrs marcos free to pressure the government into 
extending the lease on the six us military bases after their 
expiration in 1991 
but public support for banning mrs marcos and her three 
children appeared to be slipping after the late president ferdinand 
marcos died last september in hawaii 
even if the government sticks by the ban political commentators 
believe mrs marcos will wield considerable influence in national 
elections set for 1992 either by endorsing a candidate or running 
herself 
although prospects for a president imelda seem remote 
philippine politics is in such disarray that anything is possible 
recent public opinion surveys show that mrs aquinos popularity 
has been steadily declining because of high prices deteriorating 
infrastructure and perceived inefficiency in her administration 
also the recent withdrawal of all peace corps members from the 
country and reports that one of them has been kidnapped by 
communist rebels heightened concern about a deterioration of law 
and order 
mrs aquino has said she will not seek reelection and no clear 
frontrunner has emerged 
but some commentators believe mrs aquino would change her mind 
if she believed imelda or an imeldabacked candidate stood a good 
chance of winning 
if so it will be a war between widows one who is in power 
and another who has lost it but still possesses enough resources to 
challenge a government wrote columnist emil jurado in the manila 
standard

a coalition of consumer groups is asking that 
a scientific review of the agriculture departments new beef 
inspection plan be held up until the government discloses new 
information about the plan 
one of the group the government accountability project plans 
to file a lawsuit in us district court asking that the usdas 
information be released under the freedom of information act 
the controversy is over the departments longpending plan for a 
streamlined inspection system for beef which has been 
undergoing pilot tests in preparation for final review by the 
national academy of sciences the nas was contracted by usda for 
170000 to review the proposal 
the plan called sisbeef would require participating meat 
plants to take greater responsibility for some of the chores 
traditionally done by federal inspectors 
agency officials contend the inspectors would then concentrate 
more on checking for disease and other defects that can affect meat 
in the consumer pipeline each participating plant would have to 
submit a quality control plan in advance for usda approval 
critics claim that means fewer inspectors would monitor plants 
and that beef would be turned out under speededup slipshod dirty 
conditions 
tom devine of the government accountability project said the nas 
review should be delayed until the department releases more 
information gap is a nonprofit public interest group that 
provides legal support for government whistleblowers 
its our contention that serious public health decisions 
shouldnt be made on the basis of secret reports devine said in 
a telephone interview the reason these things arent being 
released is they couldnt withstand scrutiny 
but the usdas food safety and inspection service which 
oversees the program said results at the pilot plants show the sis 
system compares favorably with the traditional system of 
federal inspection 
spokesman jim greene said the agency denied the request by 
devine and others for more information on grounds that some of it 
is proprietary and not allowed to be made public 
some of it has a direct bearing on the ongoing agency 
contract with nas and release of that information to a third party 
would interfere with the scientific process and possibly compromise 
the results of that contract with nas he said

kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov discovered 
democracy in the second balcony monday 
he and other members of the communist partys ruling politburo 
shattered tradition by sitting among the 4657 delegates at the 
party congress rather than in splendid isolation at the front of 
the hall 
instead of slipping out through a private door most of the 
leaders were exposed to ambush by party members on the first day of 
a congress that opened with an attack on mikhail s gorbachevs 
continued leadership 
despite the stormy opening most radical reformers and 
hardliners interviewed by reporters in the marble lobby of the 
kremlin palace of congresses avoided confrontation 
caught by a correspondent as he left his seat for a break 
kryuchkov stoutly affirmed his loyalty to gorbachev who faces a 
conservative challenge to his position as party general secretary 
i will remain with the communist party in the center 
kryuchkov said i am for gorbachev 
he added that he could not be quite so definitive about the 
inclinations of other kgb officers in these days of political 
pluralism 
not all the officials were so amiable kryuchkovs fellow 
politburo member yegor k ligachev a hardline critic of 
gorbachev brushed off a query on whether he will run against his 
boss for the communist leadership 
that will be decided by the congress he said and dashed 
off to the closed area backstage 
in the lobby american anchorman dan rather of cbstv rushed 
into a crowd of 50 people surrounding parliamentary chairman 
anatoly lukyanov to ask a question 
it was a striking contrast to past party secrecy which banned 
journalists from national policymaking meetings and left 
sovietologists scrutinizing the holiday lineup of politburo 
members on top of lenins tomb for any change that might signify a 
rising star 
this time only three of the 25 full and candidate members of 
the politburo sat on the dais as part of the group leadership of 
the congress they were the top three officials in the soviet 
government gorbachev lukyanov and prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
we must unite all the forces that support socialism said 
alexander buzgalin a member of the conservative marxist platform 
he left reporters shaking their heads in confusion with claims that 
his group could find common ground with the reformist democratic 
platform which calls for abandoning the 70year experiment 
with communism and opting for west european style social democracy 
one member of the democratic platform grigory omelchenko of 
kiev wearing a redandwhite dp button on his lapel said he 
did not want reformers to split from the party for the time being 
he said he wanted to prevent a coalition of centrist and hardline 
forces 
but arguing is only natural protested ivan polozkov an extreme 
conservative 
we are on our way to political pluralism said polozkov 
whose election as head of the russian branch of the party last 
momth strengthened predictions of a party split 
just nine minutes into the meeting a coal miner stood to call 
for the resignation of the top 250 leaders in the party including 
gorbachev for failure to improve the countrys standard of living 
but gorbachev swept it off the floor with the promise of a 
discussion later in the 10day meeting 
during gorbachevs 2 hour 20minute speech applause was rare 
and very light 
but delegates clapped long and hard for alexander yakovlev a 
leading reformer disliked by the hardliners 
yakovlev followed party ideologue vadim a medvedev to the 
podium medvedev had been jeered 
im also in for a tough few minutes yakovlev deadpanned 
drawing laugher from the conservative crowd 
yakovlev won the attention and apparently the respect of the 
delegates with his blunt uncompromising support for gorbachevs 
reforms and condemnation of the partys history 
in contrast to the soviet parliament where some delegates wear 
flowered headscarves flowing clerical robes and the square 
embroidered caps of central asia the party congress was nearly 
colorless a sea of graysuited managers and bureaucrats 
women were rare as were the workers and peasants the communist 
party claims to represent after party apparatchiks engineered 
their own election to nearly half the seats at the congress 
officials discovered that fewer than 7 percent of the delegates 
were factory workers and farmers so they invited 300 as guests

imelda marcoss supporters staged a noisy 
celebration in her east side apartment on monday afternoon but the 
former philippines first lady retreated to her bedroom rather than 
join the party 
everybody here is very very happy as you can hear a man

priest said in a brief telephone interview i can barely hear 
you

mrs marcos 
out for a whil stayed during her racketeering trial we are not 
surprised he said we said all along the truth makes us 
free 
the apartment near the united nations was lent mrs marcos by 
doris duke the tobacco heiress 
immediately after her acquittal monday mrs marcos and an 
entourage were driven from the federal courthouse in lower 
manhattan to st patricks cathedral in midtown there she walked 
on her knees down the aisle to the altar and bowed her head to the

mikhail s gorbachev said monday that most 
communists have rejected his plan to break the party chiefs job he 
holds into two and radically restructure other party organs to make 
them more democratic 
although gorbachev may eventually get his way the proposals 
have not yet come to a final vote his admission that the tide is 
turning against him underscored how much he has lost control over 
party policy 
at the same time it reflected his skill at sensing the mood of 
the meeting the 28th soviet communist congress where he is trying 
to balance the demands of radical reformers and hardliners 
party rules to be voted on at the congress which began monday 
would revamp what have traditionally been the soviet unions most 
powerful political institutions including gorbachevs post as 
party general secretary 
whatever is decided will not affect gorbachevs other job 
soviet president 
changes that gorbachev has proposed would replace the general 
secretary his present party title with a party chairman and 
first secretary the chairman assisted by a deputy chairman would 
set overall party direction while the secretary would manage the 
partys daily affairs 
in addition the partys top body the politburo would be 
renamed and expanded thus diluting the power of each present 
politburo member the politburo now made up of 12 voting and seven 
nonvoting members would be renamed the presidium with about 30 
members 
in his keynote speech gorbachev said he had learned in 
discussions with delegates that a majority of communists are for 
the creation not of a party chairman and his deputies and the 
presidium but for preservation of the post of general secretary 
his deputy as a no 2 party figure and the politburo 
applause that followed his remark indicated wide support for 
sticking to the current party structure 
the only change gorbachev indicated most communists would 
support would be designation of the no 2 party official as deputy 
general secretary such a post has existed only informally in the 
past 
gorbachev said the issue would be discussed further at the 
congress scheduled to last until july 12 
it was not clear where the critics referred to by gorbachev fit 
in the political spectrum if they are conservatives that would 
correspond to their earlier demands that gorbachev leave the top 
party job altogether in favor of someone who could devote full 
time to the post 
gorbachevs only explanation for the criticism was that some 
communists believed the proposed presidium would not be 
energetic he did not elaborate 
gorbachev has been pushing for the new structure as well as 
other changes to make the party more democratic and responsive to 
the membership and the people at large 
at a meeting of the partys policymaking central committee in 
march he said the presidium would be a broader executive body 
made up of workers peasants intellectuals servicemen party 
veterans and heads of the 15 republics communist parties 
the politburo now has 12 full and seven nonvoting members 
gorbachev has already eased some conservatives off the body and 
has shifted some of its decisionmaking functions to popularly 
elected government bodies

pap smears performed to screen for early 
detection of cervical cancer have been added to the list of 
medicarereimbursed medical expenses officials said monday 
the new coverage began sunday allowing medicare to help pay the 
cost of pap smear screenings once every three years or more often

previously medicare would paid for pap smears only if the 
patient were being treated for an existing gynecological cancer or 
disorder or showed signs of some abnormality 
congress added the expanded benefit in legislation passed last 
year 
the expanded benefit is expected to cost the program about 15 
million for the rest of this fiscal year and about 30 million in 
fiscal 1991 according to the department of health and human 
services 
for those enrolled in the part b medical insurance program 
medicare pays 80 percent of the approved charge after the 
beneficiary has met an annual deductible

about 1130 for a pap smear which does not include the 
physicians charge for an office visit according to the 
congressional office of technology assessment

invasive cervical cancer occur in women 65 and older it also said 
that only about half of the women in this age group have had a pap 
smear within the past three years 
about 13500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are expected 
to be diagnosed this year and the disease is expected to cause 
about 6000 deaths of these 3700 cases and 2500 deaths will be 
among elderly women the american cancer society estimates

twoprong offensive cutting all major land routes out of the 
liberian capital 
heavy automatic gunfire and artillery fire erupted in the 
eastern and western suburbs people streamed from the city center 
to escape the fighting and headed for areas believed already 
controlled by the rebels 
staterun elwa radio a christian missionary station said in 
its 7 pm broadcast 3 pm edt that the government was imposing 
a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am throughout the country the radio 
also said diplomats were advised to stay in their missions or 
residences

that were being handled by morgan there was no allegation of 
wrongdoing by morgan which suspended and later fired wang who was 
sentenced to eight months in prison 
lee although agreeing to settle civil charges with the sec 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing has not answered a 
criminal indictment stemming from the sec investigation 
as part of his settlement last august lee agreed to pay 19 
million into a fund to reimburse investors defrauded by the scheme

perestroika and party failures the soviet citizen of today no 
longer accepts what he meekly tolerated in the past he reacts with 
understandable alarm and anger to the negative phenomena that like 
foam on the surface accompany the turbulent and basically healthy 
process of perestroika 
a clear and wellfounded answer to the question why this has 
happened is important for formulating conclusions as to what and 
how should be done next it is also essential in order to fortify 
peoples faith in perestroika after all voices can now be heard 
even more this is now something like an attitude claiming that 
perestroika is to blame for all our present troubles 
in speaking of all this comrades i certainly do not want to 
mitigate assessments or conclusions concerning the activities of 
the central committee the political bureau politburo or the 
communists working in party government and economic bodies in the 
republics or locally 
we have inherited a heavy legacy the deplorable state of our 
lands and economy and the disastrous state of the energy sector 
are not the result of recent years 
there are many things we could have foreseen and there are 
negative processes above all in the economic and social spheres 
in interethnic relations in the sphere of culture and ideology 
whose development we could have prevented 
the political bureau does not deny its responsibility for these 
errors 
we must analyze the situation and we must see what 
revolutionary transformations will be made because the ussr is 
rapidly becoming a secondrate power

economy improvement of the soviet economy depends to no small 
extent on how it integrates in the system of the international 
division of labor but the main thing is to work for the 
convertability of the ruble this matter should not be put off 
we must have powerful export stimuli and barriers for 
ineffective import and growth of the foreign debt there must be 
mutually beneficial conditions for attracting foreign capital 
at present the government is drawing up proposals for the 
entire set of problems related to economic activity abroad this 
applies to expanding ties with capitalist countries and going over 
to world prices and settlements in hard currency within the 
framework of the council for mutual economic assistance this also 
concerns revision and introduction of certain correctives in our 
cooperation with third world countries

agriculture a few words here about a question that is the focus 
not simply of discussion but of real speculation i am referring 
to the collective and state farms people go to the length of 
saying that the new agrarian policy puts in doubt their very 
existence but its purpose is to give equal opportunities to all 
forms of farming 
let each of them prove its viability and effectiveness that is 
our position of principle and we certainly reject the demand for 
blanket decollectivization 
i am convinced that the collective and state farms which go 
about their business skillfully which advance on the social plane 
and provide peasants with worthy living conditions deserve every 
support they will naturally remain an organic part of the 
renovated soviet countryside 
those collective and state farms however that have not put 
their hearts into their work for decades that are in the red and 
live off subsidies and whose management is obstructing the reform 
of property relations and the introduction of new forms of farming 
those must undergo cardinal transformation 
and one more topical issue that of land reform lets be 
frank the land act has not been working so far 
and not only due to the prevailing administrative structure the 
posture of the managerial apparatus but also to the old 
psychology the petrified stereotypes which resulted from the 
peasants depersonalization the working mans detachment from the 
land and the means of production in a setting of guaranteed 
remuneration regardless of the end results all hindrances 
should be put out of the way for those who wish to apply themselves 
to free farming

chronic shortages i would subscribe here to everything that is 
said on this subject and express solidarity with the most scathing 
criticism but just fanning emotions wont increase the amount of 
goods yet at the same time the situation on the consumer market 
far from becoming less strained has in many cases grown more acute 
and become intolerable 
in any case and this should be admitted the consequences 
could have been less painful if the government had approached the 
economic reform comprehensively and had managed to stand up to the 
pressure of various industries and the old managerial structures 
that sought to keep their position and maintain the command methods 
of administration

asked that they certify his victory nelson will face incumbent 
republican gov kay orr in novembers election

party to get on with the election hoppner said 
mrs orr ordinarily chairs the board of canvassers but she 
declared a conflict of interest before the boards june 20 meeting 
and did not attend mondays session 
the certification was delayed by an initial recount that was 
mandated by state law because the election was so close and a 
second recount of socalled undervotes in 21 counties undervotes

governors race 
a washingtonbased consulting firm election data services said

orr said she would emphasize the good news of nebraskas 
economy during her four years as governor 
nelson said hed never be able to match mrs orrs advantage in 
fundraising but said that wouldnt hurt him 
the issues will drive the campaign its not going to be a 
matter of how much money one has itll really be a matter of who 
better expresses their position and is more in tune with the people 
of nebraska on issues such as taxes nelson said 
he commended hoppner for being graceful and gracious about 
the process and noted that the healing process in the party has

nancy wilson ahmad jamal and other jazz 
musicians saluted new yorks own jazzmobile on the closing night of 
the jvc jazz festival 
shortly before the concert ended another celebrity dropped by 
mayor david n dinkins presented jazz composer and pianist billy 
taylor an official proclamation declaring saturday jazzmobile day 
in new york taylor is the longtime chairman of the jazzmobile 
board 
the avery fisher hall audience was celebrating the 25th 
anniversary of an innovative organization that likes to call jazz 
americas classical music 
jazzmobile was the first performing arts group to bring artists 
to people in their neighborhoods this year its 26th summer it 
will present about 70 concerts by jazz artists in neighborhoods 
throughout the city its wednesday night concerts at grants tomb 
overlooking the hudson river are well known to city jazz lovers 
the terence blanchard quintet with blanchard on trumpet opened 
the concert but played too solemnly for the occasion 
the party brightened considerably though when ahmad jamal 
strode to the piano and unleashed his restless energy he was ably 
backed by dave boller on drums and james comack on bass the 
highlight of the trios performance was a duel between jamal and 
boller with comack playing the role of mediator 
miss wilson who played the second half of the concert enjoyed 
a strong rapport with her audience she sang her standards with 
verve but at times her delivery was strained 
the only regret the audience could have had was that taylor who 
cofounded jazzmobile with the late daphne arnstein didnt play 
some tunes himself 
tayor announced that he is resigning as the groups chairman 
because the revival of jazz which the arts organization has done 
much to help has resulted in increased opportunities for him

black workers nationwide 
stayed home monday in a strike to protest black factional fighting 
that has killed thousands labor groups said up to 3 million blacks 
took part 
black absenteeism in the major cities of johannesburg pretoria 
durban and port elizabeth ranged from 50 percent to more than 90 
percent according to estimates by police labor and management 
trade unionists reported one death in a township outside durban 
and several injuries in scattered clashes around the country 
also police said an 8yearold boy was fatally shot and three 
people injured when an officer fired at a mob stoning his vehicle 
it was not immediately clear if the attack in a township southeast 
of johannesburg was related to the strike 
in most places however the strike was peaceful 
no precise figures were available on the number of participants 
but labor groups claimed up to 3 million took part 
the congress of south african trade unions which joined the 
african national congress in organizing the oneday strike 
estimated that up to 3 million workers stayed home 
the response from our people demonstrates unequivocally the 
extent of mass support for the programs and policies of our 
organizations the labor group said in a statement 
the anc is the countrys leading group fighting the white 
governments system of racial discrimination the group whose 
deputy president is nelson mandela has denounced the deadly feuds 
between black factions saying they detract from the struggle 
against apartheid 
the south african chamber of business estimated mondays work 
stoppage cost the country almost 300 million in lost productivity 
the anc called the walkout to protest black factional fighting 
in the eastern province of natal the fighting has claimed about 
4000 lives since 1986 
the anc has demanded the whiteled government end a state of 
emergency in natal and disband local zulu police 
several black groups opposed mondays strike the opponents 
included the inkatha movement the conservative zulu organization 
that has been fighting anc supporters for supremacy in natal 
black groups have become increasingly hostile to one another in 
recent months as they compete for supporters and influence 
hundreds of blacks have died in factional fighting since president 
fw de klerk legalized dozens of antiapartheid organizations in 
february 
in natal at least twothirds of the black workforce took part 
in the strike according to congress of trade unions police put 
the participation figure at 60 percent in natal and said many 
people were intimidated into staying home 
people wanting to go to work have been prevented from doing 
so said mangosuthu buthelezi the leader of inkatha and the zulu 
homeland he accused the protest organizers of political 
thuggery 
police reported monday that three blacks had been killed in the 
latest factional fights in natal during the weekend 
authorities made efforts to break the strike monday 
police in some black townships offered transport to bring 
workers to their jobs after most black bus drivers went on strike 
police trucks transported black hospital staff to work in durban 
in pretoria a helicopter dropped police leaflets urging blacks 
to ignore intimidation and go to work

congressional backers of the v22 osprey are 
touting an internal pentagon report on the tiltrotor aircraft as 
conclusive evidence against defense secretary dick cheneys plans 
to scrap the plane 
the pentagons arguments about the high cost of the osprey are 
no longer credible rep curt weldon rpa said monday in 
response to the draft report delivered to lawmakers friday 
the congressmans comments came one day after sen arlen 
specter rpa released excerpts of the 1200page report by the 
pentagons own think tank the institute for defense analysis 
the cat is out of the bag now specter said and there can 
be no more stalling or equivocating by the defense department about 
the merits and costeffectiveness of the osprey 
citing budget constraints cheney last year proposed canceling 
the program to buy the osprey an aircraft that takes off like a 
helicopter but flies like a plane 
lobbying by lawmakers from texas and pennsylvania the osprey 
is built by boeing helicopter of lester pa and bell helicopter 
textron of fort worth texas was fierce with weldon and specter 
two of the most vocal supporters 
congress eventually put off a final decision and earmarked 255 
million for research and development of the aircraft in the defense 
budget for 1990 
cheney again called for terminating the program in 1991 arguing 
that a mix of ch46 ch53 and uh60 helicopters would be a cheaper 
alternative the proposal touched off another round of persistent 
lobbying that is not expected to end until congress approves the 
defense budgets later this year 
the draft report which congress called for last july said the 
original plan to buy and operate 502 of the aircraft for the marine 
corps would cost 33 billion in fiscal 1988 dollars 
the alternative of a mix of ch53 and ch60 helicopters would 
cost about 24 billion 
by limiting the osprey program to 24 billion or 356 aircraft 
the report said the v22s speed range and survivability 
advantages could enable even the fleet to be more effective 
sometimes significantly more and other times slightly more than 
all of the proposed helicopter alternatives in each of the four 
marine missions examined 
that assessment is certain to be used by backers of the aircraft 
in their longrunning battle with the defense department over funds 
for the osprey but cheneys spokesman indicated in may that the 
v22ischeaper argument will not sway the defense secretary 
if indeed the report makes the same argument thats not a new 
one and that would not be grounds for us to change our minds 
im unaware now of any plans for us to reconsider that decision 
said pentagon spokesman pete williams

a national conservation group declared the 
decadeold alaska lands act a failure on monday and called on 
congress to begin monitoring the protection of the states national 
parks and wildlife refuges 
opponents of this law have done everything they could to turn 
a resource protection act into a resource development act said 
george frampton jr president of the wilderness society its 
time americans had a look at whats being done to the 39 percent of 
the federal lands that lie within alaska its not a pretty 
picture 
during the past six months the wilderness society has studied 
the effectiveness of the alaska national interest lands 
conservation act signed in 1980 by president jimmy carter to 
preserve the states wildlife areas 
the act was hailed by conservationists as one of the most 
ambitious preservation initiatives ever enacted it set aside 1043 
million acres of national parks wildlife refuges and other 
protected areas in alaska 
in its study the society found that many of the lands that 
supposedly were being protected are facing serious threats 
we hope this report and the work that underlies it will serve 
as a basis for congressional oversight frampton said at a news 
conference called to release the 61page report 
the most serious threat to public lands in alaska is oil and gas 
development in the arctic national wildlife refuge according to 
the report 
there is less than oneinfive chance that a commercially 
viable oil field lies beneath the refuges fabled coastal plain 
it says if there is such a field the most likely annual yield 
would satisfy less than two percent of us oil demand 
the arctic refuge is located in the northeastern corner of 
alaska the refuges center of wildlife activity is a 
16millionacre coastal plain a roughly 25milewide area framed 
by the ocean and the brooks range 
a provision in the alaska lands act directed the us park 
service and the us fish and wildlife service to review all lands 
within alaskas national parks and wildlife refuges to see if they 
qualify for wilderness protection 
congress can designate public land as wilderness if it hasnt 
been developed that designation means the land can never be 
developed 
under the act the interior department was to complete that 
review in 1985 and the president was to recommend to congress which 
areas ought to receive protection the interior department still 
hasnt conducted the wilderness review 
society officials said the bush administration isnt seriously 
following the acts mandate to protect wildlife but is trying to 
preserve development options whenever possible 
in alaska there has been no significant change from the 
policy of the reagan administration said frampton were stuck 
in the crack of a broken record 
excessive logging in the 169millionacre tongass national 
forest is another serious threat society officials said 
the act set a minimum harvest of 45 billion board feet from 
tongass in one decade congress gave the forest service 400 
million to build logging roads and administer the harvest program 
and the forest service sold the trees to private industry 
however the price the forest service got was so low it lost 73 
cents for every taxpayer dollar paid said bennett beach a 
spokesman for the society 
the wilderness society wants congress to pass the tongass timber 
reform act in a form close to the bill passed by the house last 
july society officials said the version approved june 13 by the 
senate needs to be strengthened which is expected to go to 
conference after the august recess

its high time to talk at communists congresses about 
nobility charity morality and conscience its high time to 
end the civil war we have not been able to end so far 
i am convinced of the historical correctness of the choice made 
in 1985 and its profound moral value 
what has happened to us the party of the revolutionary idea 
has turned into the party of power 
a monopoly on truth is fatal in these conditions only a 
renewed more leftleaning and rejuvenated party will be capable of 
leading the country onward along the path of drastic 
transformation this movement is inexorable it will continue 
with or without the party 
conservative sentiments and trends that have recently made 
themselves felt are evidence to the fact that the party is still a 
captive of the system of social stagnation generated by the regime 
of personal power 
certainly this is the last congress for me and forgive me for 
being sentimental i consider myself a happy man as i have been a 
contemporary and an active participant of a great renewal in a 
great country of its historic march to the world of freedom 
nowadays a lot depends on the measure of courage and of 
conscience but also from a capability to nobly go through torments 
of reconsidering our existence of our life 
let us remember that not only empty store shelves forced 
perestroika but empty souls as well

east germans plunged into capitalism monday 
with west german money in their pockets strikes by thousands of 
worried workers and happy housewives buying bananas chocolate and 
fresh meat 
it was the first day of business after east germany merged its 
economy and social welfare system with west germanys on sunday 
officially ending east germanys 40year experiment with a 
communist system 
gerhard pannier a worried coal dealer said were rolling 
into a dark tunnel without even knowing therell be an engine to 
pull us out 
full political unification is expected in december 
with widespread layoffs expected in east germany there was 
immediate labor unrest 
a spokesman for the powerful ig metall union claimed during a 
rally that up to 30000 workers briefly downed tools in warning 
strikes in about 10 factories around east berlin 
karlheinz graffenberger a union leader said 3000 workers 
struck a locomotive factory in hennigsdorf where the rally was 
held 
one worker kerstin arendt 21 said she makes 640 marks about 
390 a month takehome pay with 600 marks you dont get very 
far she said 
other strikes were reported at the ludwigsfelde car parts plant 
south of berlin and a steel factory in brandenburg workers 
demanded higher pay and improved working conditions east germanys 
adn news agency reported 
graffenberger said they also wanted job security 
east berlin coal dealers used their trucks to blockade loading 
points at four locations to protest the end of state subsidies on 
brown coal the nations most important source of energy 
economists have predicted up to one third of east germanys 
8000 businesses may fail when the full force of west german 
competition decends on their inefficient production methods 
the number of unemployed east germans rose to 150000 from 
100000 a month earlier east german labor minister regine 
hildebrandt said in a radio interview monday 
experts have predicted up to 4 million people could end up out 
of work in this nation of 166 million 
adn said the robotron computer company was offering courses in 
office automation and business management to jobless east germans 
employees of robotron which used to be east germanys 
hightechnology showcase are taking part of the course themselves 
to become familiar with western management techniques adn said 
heiko lehmann 26 a research physicist working for a lamp 
factory grumbled first of all ill lose my job then ill live 
on 700 marks a month and i dont know how ill get by on that 
but he said he was optimistic about ultimately landing a new job 
his 424 benefit is 75 percent of his lastearned wage 
west germany sent 25 billion marks 151 billion from its 
national banks cash reserves to cover the initial phase of 
economic unification east germans could change some of their 
worthless east german marks for west german marks at a 11 rate as 
the country swung over to a capitalist system 
on international markets the west german mark remained strong 
and even made slight gains against the us dollar 
to east berlin shoppers unification meant that chiquita 
bananas tuborg beer and milka chocolate were available at the 
corner grocery 
buying those items used to involve what one housewife called 
exhausting trips to west berlin before the berlin wall came 
down in november there was no way shed have gotten them at all 
housewives praised the lean and more appetizing meat now on sale 
some things are cheaper some are more expensive but on 
average it should be ok said dietmar bauer as he emerged 
from a grocery store frustrated by a gargantuan checkout line he 
bought nothing 
salaries in east germany are less than half the average in west 
germany but east german rents and other basic items will be kept 
low for a while to help compensate 
on the whole prices of most foodstuffs and consumer goods were 
about equal to those in west germany 
but because east germany has ended all government subsidies on 
food the price of a roll tripled from eight to 24 pfennigs 515 
cents the price of milk more than doubled adn said 
trade minister sybille reider toured shops belonging to the 
konsum chain on east berlins outskirts and accused the formerly 
stateowned enterprise of shamefully abusing its monopoly in 
the countryside adn reported 
ms reider found a konsum store in beelitz southwest of berlin 
charging 229 marks 138 for a halfpound of butter as opposed 
to 179 marks 108 in areas where competition exists 
she complained of halfempty shelves and said whatever 
east german produce was for sale was miserably wrapped and of very 
poor quality 
also monday the elevated railway system known as the sbahn 
resumed services between east and west berlin for the first time 
since the berlin wall went up in 1961 
sbahn authorities plan to reopen six more crossborder lines 
but major repairs to stations and tracks are needed before they 
become operational

racketeering and fraud on monday said the us government did a 
terrible job in prosecuting the former philippine first lady 
the jury forewoman also said the panel felt mrs marcos should 
not be held responsible for the acts of her late husband ferdinand 
e marcos 
just because she was married to him doesnt make her guilty 
said catherine balton a retired office manager 
after a threemonth trial the jury cleared mrs marcos and her 
codefendant saudi financier adnan khashoggi of all charges 
we thought the government did a terrible terrible job said 
thomas orourke a mason with the transit authority they had 
halftruths and not the right witnesses it was a terrible case 
orourke said that on the first day of deliberations thursday

people thought different ways orourke said but everybody 
walked away happy 
it was a totally silly case he added 
ms balton reached at home said the jurors felt there was not 
enough evidence to convict mrs marcos and khashoggi 
it was a poorly prepared case ms balton said there was 
nothing to convince any of them that there was a case 
in a terse statement the office of us attorney otto obermaier 
praised the work of the trial prosecutors and said the jury has 
rendered its verdict our system of justice has spoken 
orourke said the government should have dropped the case when 
marcos died last september 
for three years they have made this poor womans life 
miserable he said it may have been a conspiracy but not a 
conspiracy by marcos 
orourke said the jurors took photographs of each other after 
the verdict and planned a reunion in about a month

labor unrest about 30000 workers in 10 factories around berlin 
staged brief warning strikes or protests union officials said 
east germanys 8000 companies conducted their first full day of 
business in a freemarket economy 
strikers included about 3000 people at the giant locomotive 
electronics works in hennigsdorf other strikes were reported at 
the ludwigsfelde automobile parts plant and at a steel works in 
brandenburg strikers demanded higher pay and better working 
conditions east germanys adn news agency said 
east berlins 66 coal dealers used their trucks to block loading 
points in four locations around the city they were protesting 
abandonment of state subsidies halted as part of the economic 
merger of the two germanys which took effect sunday

<TEXT>
currency the west german mark fared strongly on international 
markets despite increases in the amount of money in circulation 
due to the exchange of west german marks for east german marks the 
marks strength was attributed to the smooth start of the economic 
merger and the possibility of us tax increases dealers also said 
moderate withdrawals of west german marks by east germans indicated 
a consumers buying spree would not occur keeping inflation in 
check

the food and drug administration on monday 
announced stronger warnings against use of overthecounter aspirin 
products by women in the last three months of pregnancy unless 
directed by a physician 
the agency said the stronger warning on labels is being required 
because aspirin can affect fetal circulation and uterine 
contraction 
manufacturers have one year to add the stronger warning to all 
oral and rectal overthecounter products containing aspirin the 
fda said 
the warning must read 
it is especially important not to use aspirin during the last 
three months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by 
a doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or 
complications during delivery 
aspirin products now carry a general warning that says 
as with any drug if you are pregnant or nursing a baby seek 
the advice of a health professional before using this product 
an advisory panel of medical experts had recommended the 
stronger warning 
a similar thirdtrimester pregnancy warning is already required 
on nonprescription products containing the painreliever ibuprofen 
the regulation is to be published in the federal register on 
thursday

more than half of the nations cities and 
towns expect spending to exceed revenues in their current budget 
year and twothirds of the municipalities say budget crunches are 
worse than a year ago according to a survey released monday 
the national league of cities survey of 576 communities said the 
budget pressures are greatest in the northeast where the regional 
economy is slumping five of six cities and towns surveyed in that 
region reported that their financial problems were worse than a 
year ago 
a majority of communities in the south the midwest and the west 
also reported that budget strains were greater this year 
leaders of the organization whose membership is open to cities 
and towns with populations of at least 10000 said a major factor 
in the growing municipal budget problems is the lack of help from 
washington 
we see this as a crucial time for national leadership said 
donald borut the leagues executive director 
as president bush and congressional leaders seek an agreement on 
a deficitreduction plan likely to include some form of higher 
taxes the survey showed many cities also were looking for 
additional revenues 
fortyone percent of those surveyed have raised local property 
taxes 76 percent have increased fees and other charges the league 
of cities said 
just over half 51 percent reduced the rate of spending 
growth in their budgets and 39 percent contracted out certain 
services in an attempt to cut costs the survey found 
borut called the results a warning signal about stresses on 
our local revenue systems about our ability to maintain important 
services and about the consequences of unfunded mandates and the 
continuing withdrawal of federal and state participation in 
providing vital services 
the leagues board of directors plans to meet with house ways 
and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill next week 
before the organization makes its suggestions on deficitreduction 
priorities 
rostenkowski last month told another municipal organization the 
us conference of mayors that cities are unlikely to get any 
additional help from washington in the foreseeable future

a federal research group recommended on monday 
a more liberal policy on truck weights that it said could save 43 
billion a year in transport costs and cost railroads 750 million 
in lost revenue 
the national research council committee said all states should 
be given the option of exempting some trucks from a federal limit 
of 80000 pounds on the nations interstate highways it also 
recommended changes in the rules for bridge use that would allow 
heavier concrete mixers dump trucks and other trucks with shorter 
wheelbases 
the weight exemptions would be on the condition that they 
include fees to cover pavement and bridge wear said the committee 
which is made up of transportation experts from universities the 
industry and government the research council is linked to the 
national academy of sciences and the national academy of 
engineering 
the committee report recommends that heavy trucks still be 
restricted to designated routes comply with all other federal 
weight restrictions and comply with strict safety standards 
the exemptions would still be up to individual states but the 
report said it was not fair to prevent about half the states from 
allowing exemptions while the others who had exemptions before the 
current law can keep theirs 
if all states adopted the exemptions annual transportation 
savings for truckers could total 19 billion because of the use of 
more productive vehicles the report said this would lower costs 
by 16 percent attracting 750 million in rail business it said 
savings in trucking costs from a new bridge formula could total 
24 billion the committee said 
the report requested by congress brought praise from the 
trucking industry which estimates its services at 240 billion 
annually 
we feel the suggestions would have a great value to the 
economy as a whole and will make significant differences in the 
competitive situation of the united states as compared to the rest 
of the world said john reith policy director for the american 
trucking associations 
he said the report is the result of two years of research 
a rail industry spokesman said he had not seen the report but 
was concerned that any nationwide increase in truck sizes and 
weights could have a serious impact on railroads 
dan lang vice president of the association of american 
railroads said trucks pay only about half their share of highway 
maintenance costs and fail to pay other highway expenses including 
the social cost of pollution and added traffic 
if youre going to go out and upset the status quo this way 
you should really take another look at all the costs associated 
lang said 
the committee report did not call for substantially heavier 
trucks over 80000 pounds and did not address truck lengths said 
its chairman lester a hoel of the university of virginia 
we simply recommended a level playing field for fairness to 
give all states the option of imlementing a permit program said 
hoel 
federal law currently restricts gross vehicle weight to 80000 
pounds with a limit of 20000 pounds per axle and 34000 pounds 
for tandem axles bridgecrossing requirements are based on a 
formula which includes weight the number of axles and their 
distance apart 
the report recommends that axle weight limits be maintained 
which means the heavier trucks would not cause significant changes 
in pavement wear it said 
the committee concluded that it was arbitrary and 
inequitable to allow some states to give exemptions but said it 
would cost about 8 billion to remove all exempted vehicles from 
the highway this would result in more accidents pollution and 
traffic because it would take more smaller trucks to replace them 
the study said 
it said the current formula for bridge use is an overly 
cautious limit on weights for shorter trucks

mayor marion barry smoked crack cocaine the 
night he was arrested in an fbi sting operation although he 
suspected something was going on rasheeda moore testified 
monday in barrys cocaine and perjury trial 
if barry had been so hesitant why did he go on and use the 
pipe defense attorney rkenneth mundy asked 
because he had a desire to moore said 
under heavy crossexamination moore also testified that she 
continually brought up the subject of cocaine when barry repeatedly 
declined interest in using it 
in her second full day of questioning by barrys attorney moore 
insisted that although barry seemed suspicious throughout the 
evening he still acted on his own in purchasing cocaine from an 
undercover agent and then smoking it just before agents stormed 
into the room and arrested him 
mundy also replayed the videotape of the mayors hotel room 
session with the former model 
i felt from the beginning being in the room with him he was 
suspicious moore said i believe he felt intuitively something 
was going on 
the videotape showed barry continually berating himself after 
his arrest saying he should have trusted my instincts and not 
visited moores room 
but mundy hammered away at the methods used to produce the 
mayors arrest asserting that moore provided the pipe the 
light the knowhow the liquor the room the 
encouragement 
barrys attorney is arguing that the mayors jan 18 arrest in 
an undercover fbi sting operation should not lead to a conviction 
because he was lured to moores hotel room to smoke the crack 
cocaine 
moore has testified that she and barry used drugs together 
over 100 times during a twoyear intimate relationship that 
ended six months before the jan 18 sting operation 
mundy buttressed his argument by pointing to seven instances in 
which barry either declined to use drugs or expressed no interest 
in the subject when moore began talking about it 
but in portions of the transcript mundy did not go over barry 
tells moore im going up to the hilton i may get a tab 
moore testified earlier that barry was referring to cocaine when 
he used the phrase tab 
at one point after saying he did not want to use crack cocaine 
barry changed his mind and urged moore to have the undercover agent 
return with the crack cocaine that moore had just given back 
on the videotape that was released last week barry said that he 
no longer smoked cocaine and said he did not know how to use 
the pipe that moore provided 
mundy also concentrated on barrys unfamiliarity with the crack 
pipe he used the night of the sting saying that if the mayor were 
an experienced drug user moore would not have needed to show him 
how to use it 
it was unusual moore said of the directions she gave barry 
i dont understand why he was asking me to show him how to use 
the pipe 
moore had initially testified that barry was unfamiliar only 
with the type of pipe being used and needed instruction on it 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his 
alleged drug use one of the possession charges stems from his 
arrest in the sting operation 
moore also testified that she would have cooperated with the 
sting even if she had known of barrys alleged heart condition 
emergency medical technicians were on hand after barrys arrest to 
make sure that his ingestion of crack cocaine did not produce heart 
trouble however medical records barry released last year show no 
record of heart illness 
while mundy and prosecutors battled in the courtroom two black 
leaders filed suit to gain admittance to the proceedings 
the local chapter of the american civil liberties union filed 
papers with the federal appeals court asking that body to overturn 
judge thomas penfield jacksons refusal to allow nation of islam 
leader louis farrakhan and a dissident black catholic priest from 
entering the proceedings 
jackson said that the presence of farrakhan and george augustus 
stallings in the courtroom would be disruptive 
the burden is on the judge to say why it would be 
disruptive said arthur spitzer legal director for the local 
aclu there has to be real evidence to base that decision on 
spitzer said jacksons decision violates constitutional 
guarantees of the mayors right to a public trial and the publics 
right to witness the proceedings 
a dozen profarrakhan demonstrators also gathered outside the 
courthouse to protest jacksons decision 
a federal appeals ourt panel ordered us attorny jay b 
stephens to file by tuesday any opinion he has regarding the aclu 
suit the aclu was ordered to enter any followup papers by 
wednesday

cowboy attorney gerry spence can cut another 
notch onto his sixshooter he won an acquittal for imelda marcos 
on racketeering and fraud charges monday adding to his long list 
of courtroom triumphs 
many of the successes of the lanky silverhaired attorney have 
been played out before juries in courtrooms of the high plains and 
the mountains of his native wyoming although a nationally known 
attorney this was spences first trial in new york and it was a 
rough one he often wrangled with us district judge john f 
keenan during the threemonth trial the judge complained about 
spences manner and crossexamination of witnesses 
after one acrimonious blowup with keenan spence told him he 
never felt so unwelcome in any courtroom the jury adores you 
judge and they hate me 
but after the jury acquitted the former philippines first lady 
of looting her homelands treasury to buy real estate jewelry and 
art spence said he had always known the jury would be on his side 
spence who wore a stetson cowboy hat and boots to court and 
came to new york with a reputation of being virtually unbeatable 
had trouble as soon as the trial began 
he stumbled during his what he later conceded were the worst 
opening arguments of his career his colleagues said he blundered 
in crossexaming several government witnesses ignored or misread 
earlier testimony and elicited answers that were unexpected and 
damaging 
uncharacteristic behavior for a lawyer who time magazine once 
called the fastest gun in the west the magazine said a key to 
spences success was his exhaustive preparation 
the lawyer who has offices in a log cabin in jackson wyo has 
had a long string of successes many of them described in his book 
gunning for justice 
in a lawsuit against penthouse held in a courtroom in cheyenne 
spence referred to the magazines publisher bob guccione as an 
arrogant new yorker 
he pointed out the new york publisher to the jurors as the 
gentleman sitting over there in the velvet pants a type of 
attire rarely seen in the cowboy state 
in a 1979 lawsuit against kerrmcgee corp an energy 
conglomerate he repeatedly referred to the corporations lawyers 
as the men in grey 
spence made his national reputation by winning that lawsuit on 
behalf of the family of karen silkwood a nuclear plant worker who 
had become contaminated with plutonium 
but spence found that the shoe or the cowboy boot was on the 
other foot in the manhattan courtroom 
court officials and other lawyers scoffed at his cowboy attire 
spence said felt great irony at the ridicule 
other lawyers on mrs marcos fourlawyer team of which spence 
was the leader said his rambling opening statement and shambling 
courtroom manner had got him off to a bad start and that things had 
steadily deteriorated 
at one point the other marcos attorneys pressured mrs marcos 
to drop spence who was hired for a 5 million fee not long before 
the trial opened april 3 
during the dispute mr spence attributed the problem to a 
difference in styles 
in highprofile cases theres a lot of conflicting 
interests he told the new york times at the time im here 
because she wants me here 
in the end spence said prosecutors just didnt have the 
evidence to compel the jury to convicted mrs marcos

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan on monday defended the presidents veto of parental leave 
legislation saying the measure would have put an unfair burden on 
businesses 
sullivan said the family medical leave had a laudable goal 
this is indeed an ideal we would like to have 
but this is not the best way to achieve this because the 
unintended consequences in terms of our economic competitiveness 
viability of our businesses would really in the larger sense work 
counterproductive to that he said 
sullivan commented after defending the administration on the 
issue at a roundtable discussion by national commission on children 
the bill would have required companies to give as much as three 
months unpaid leave to workers with new babies or family illness 
bush vetoed it last friday 
but gary david goldberg president of ubu productions and 
creator of the television series family ties said bushs 
action is contrary to white house talk of strengthening the family 
he called the veto much more of an offensive act than anything 
2 live crew could ever dream of referring to the rap music 
group that has been attacked for sexually explicit lyrics 
goldberg said bushs message was clear that business counts 
more than family 
you can have mr rogers you can have michael jordan and bill 
cosby on television 24 hours a day but if theres no one here in 
washington willing to acknowledge and confront the changing face of 
the american family the impact will be whistling in the wind 
goldberg said 
sullivan and goldberg spoke at a roundtable discussion of the 
commission a 36member panel created by congress and the president 
to assess the health and wellbeing of children mondays session 
focused how children develop values 
the secretary said an erosion of basic values stemming from 
collapse of the family and community is the main reason behind some 
of childrens must urgent problems including teen pregnancy 
infant mortality and drug abuse 
he repeated his call for a new culture of character in 
which individuals celebrate selfdiscipline and family 
commitment rather than selfindulgence and shortterm 
gratification 
phyllis schlafly president of the conservative eagle forum 
said schools have failed to reinforce strong family values among 
children because they are not being taught what is wrong and 
harmful 
children today are too often given the facts about such things 
as drugs and sex and are then told to make their own choice 
why cant we teach that sex for unmarried minors is wrong and 
harmful it is wrong and harmful she said

in just six months gov jim florio has 
made his mark as an aggressive decisive and unconventional 
governor 
he has enacted major auto insurance reforms signed a ban on 
assaultstyle rifles and turned the states school funding system 
upsidedown he also has said yes emphatically to new taxes 
those actions have drawn the attention of the national media and 
prompted new york gov mario m cuomo a perennial noncandidate 
for president to suggest florio may be presidential material 
but while the national spotlight has cast a warm glow on the 
democratic rookie governor florio has made enemies at home 
more than 5000 angry residents spent a sunny afternoon at the 
statehouse sunday to protest the tax increases and castigate 
florio leaders of the rally which also targeted president bush 
promise to launch a tax revolt in new jersey 
florios stance on assault weapons enraged the gun lobby the 
new jersey education association the states powerful teachers 
union has promised political revenge for the school funding bill 
which took money from rich districts to improve education in poor 
districts 
the teachers group complained that the measure requires richer 
school districts to pay for teacher pensions a tab traditionally 
picked up by the state 
with the democratic majority in both the assembly and senate 
facing a republican challenge next year florio has fences to mend 
he admits pitching the tax increases to a wary public will be 
difficult 
but florio believes he will overcome the opposition at home he 
says he has taken on vexing problems in an era when fear of voter 
wrath has paralyzed politicians 
as joe louis used to say you can run but you cant hide 
said florio a former navy boxer i was elected to lead and im 
leading you cant run from these problems or theyll come back 
and bite you in a way that is very painful 
republicans however blast his tax increases and charge the 
governor with railroading his programs through the state 
legislature 
florio steamrolled republican opponent james courter in the race 
for governor last year with a campaign that was praised as 
effective and criticized as nasty 
barely a week after his inauguration the governor unveiled his 
auto insurance reforms and traded harsh words over the plan with 
allstate insurance co officials the legislature swiftly passed 
the reforms 
the auto insurance plan which promises to cut rates by 20 
percent next march is being challenged in court by several 
insurers because it forces the insurance industry to pay half of a 
3 billion debt facing a state pool for highrisk drivers 
florios biggest battle was over the budget he said he was 
being forced to break a campaign promise not to raise taxes because 
the state was facing a huge budget deficit left by former 
republican thomas h kean kean has defended his administration 
but steadfastly refuses to comment on florio 
democratic legislators delivered an increase in the sales tax 
from 6 percent to 7 percent the tax now includes items such as 
disposable paper soap telephone bills cigarettes and alcoholic 
beverages a new tax on oil and a higher cigarette tax also passed 
they all went into effect sunday 
florio also got a higher income tax for about 17 percent of the 
states residents to pay for the dramatic change in school funding 
florio pushed through a plan that would send more state dollars to 
poor districts and less to wealthy ones 
his school funding revision was later backed by a state supreme 
court ruling that the school system discriminates against poor 
urban areas however republicans have derided the florio plan as 
one that would hurt middleclass residents who live in richer areas 
florio was the clear target at sundays antitax rally 
organized by six private citizens with the help of a trenton 
talkradio station that publicized the event it drew the years 
largest crowd of protesters to the statehouse 
there is growing voter frustration and anger over tax 
increases said assembly minority leader chuck haytaian a 
republican 
florio says he is not worried about a tax revolt he says many 
residents will benefit from the property tax relief components of 
his plan and that his actions avoided a costly downgrading of new 
jerseys bond rating 
nobody likes taxes florio said hopefully people will 
understand that we are being responsible

nelson mandela said monday that promises 
of change in south africa should not bring an end to economic 
sanctions because the reality is that the apartheid system 
continues 
all the fundamental features of the south african racist 
system remain unchanged in other words no profound changes have 
taken place leading to the final abolition of the apartheid 
system the deputy president of the african national congress 
told a joint session of the irish parliament 
he also urged britain to follow the example of president fw de 
klerks south african government and not require a ceasefire 
before talking to an armed foe in this case the irish republican 
army 
mandelas remarks met swift criticism in london the next stop 
on his foreign tour prime minister margaret thatcher who herself 
once narrowly survived an ira bomb is firmly against any 
compromise with the militants 
mrs thatcher has also lifted some of britains sanctions 
against south africa despite mandelas pleas for continued pressure 
members of the governing conservative party and the opposition 
labor and liberal democrat parties said mandela was mistaken in 
drawing a parallel between south africa where the black majority 
cannot vote and northern ireland which has universal suffrage 
as he took leave from his irish hosts mandela said he was 
saddened to be dragged into a controversy that is not of our 
making and which we never intended 
we do not prescribe to anyone how peace should be achieved 
he said 
on arriving in london monday night mandela deflected questions 
and said he would hold a news conference at the end of his british 
visit on wednesday 
mandela arrived in ireland on sunday following an eightcity 
us tour 
mandela the first nonhead of government ever to address a 
joint meeting of irelands 166member dail and 60member senate 
delivered a 25minute speech laced with allusions to irelands own 
struggle against unrelenting tyranny to achieve independence 
from britain in the 1920s 
though he apologized for coughing due to a heavy cold the 
71yearold black leader looked well as he took a walking tour of 
leinster house the seat of parliament before entering the packed 
chamber his wife winnie sat in the gallery 
earlier at a news conference he was questioned repeatedly 
about his attitude toward the ira which is fighting to end british 
rule in northern ireland 
the only way of resolving this conflict and of stopping this 
mutual slaughter is to sit down and talk said mandela who 
noted that the british joined in negotiations in rhodesia now 
zimbabwe while an armed struggle continued 
the british and irish governments both maintain that talks can 
only be held with the constitutional parties of northern ireland 
those that uphold the law and eschew violence they say the ira 
outlawed on both sides of the border represents only a small 
minority 
mandela said the south african government had long insisted the 
anc lay down its arms before negotiations but eventually joined in 
talks without extracting such a concession 
regarding sanctions against south africa mandela said he 
expected to international community to follow the lead of the anc 
mandela said de klerk had asked to meet him as soon as he 
returned from his tour of europe and the united states and the 
reason for that is because sanctions are biting 
he said we are even more concerned than the government about 
sanctions because they are destroying our economy we dont want it 
because we are the people who suffer it is blacks who are thrown 
out of jobs 
this is the price which we are prepared to pay in order to 
dismantle apartheid and to have the principle of one person one 
vote introduced in our country

nasa engineers are focusing on a small 
misalignment of fuel tanks and spacecraft on two space shuttles as 
they search for the elusive hydrogen leaks that have grounded the 
shuttle fleet 
the continuing mystery of the leaks is throwing the shuttle 
schedule into disarray and threatens to postpone at least two 
missions this summer officials said monday 
most of the 35 orbitertank combinations flown so far have had 
some misalignments but the two found in the shuttles with the 
leaks are the largest to date space flight director william b 
lenoir said 
one of the areas we are looking at is the angle of connection 
between the external tank and the orbiter lenoir said ideally 
you think of them to be really aligned but its never perfect 
its always some small degree of misalignment 
lenoir said the leak problem which shows up while the tank is 
being filled with supercold liquid hydrogen a few hours before 
flight must be fixed within a few weeks to keep nasa anywhere 
near its ambitious flight schedule 
the schedule called for a columbia launch in may on an astronomy 
mission atlantis in july columbia again in august and then 
discovery in october 
the hydrogen leak on columbia in may and the discovery last week 
of a similar leak on atlantis scrambled that schedule and lenoir 
said it is unclear now if the agency can recover in time to fly all 
the missions this year 
discovery must go in october to take advantage of a planetary 
alignment that occurs only once every two years the shuttles 
cargo is the ulysses science probe that is to study the sun 
were right on the edge of the point where two flights no 
longer fit in the schedule before the launch of ulysses said 
lenoir fixing the leak he said will have to be quick and simple 
to avoid more changes in the nasa launch schedule 
the shuttle orbiter the airplanelike vehicle in which 
astronauts fly is attached to the 154footlong fuel tank at 
three points two on the lower end and one on the upper 
fuel flows from the tank to the orbiters three engines through 
a 17inch pipe that disconnects when the tank is empty and begins 
its fall back to earth 
one of the lower attachment points on columbias tank is 160 of 
an inch higher than the other and the one on atlantis is off by 
150 of an inch said shuttle boss robert l crippen 
that small misalignment is well within the tolerance built into 
the shuttle system he said 
but whether that is enough of a deviance to put strain on the 
fuel line also near the bottom of the tank is being studied by 
one of the four teams nasa has set up to look into the problem 
lenoir said he hoped to get some answers by thursday parts of 
columbia are being tested in a laboratory atlantis was undergoing 
tests with helium substituting for the volatile liquid hydrogen 
while still on the launch pad monday despite severe thunderstorms 
and high winds that raked the kennedy space center in florida 
weve been unable to say hey thats a problem area 
lenoir said on the other hand because of their coincidence we 
are not stopping there 
nasas science chief lennard fisk sought to put a brighter 
view on nasas other headache the faulty mirror on the 15 
billion hubble space telescope that prevents the accurate focusing 
that scientists sought 
there are two characteristics of the people who work for 
nasa he said were stubborn and were clever were going to 
make this thing work

savings and loan regulators on monday 
temporarily eased restrictions imposed by last years bailout bill 
on thrift institution lending 
as expected the office of thrift supervision said it would give 
healthy thrift institutions until the end of 1991 to meet stricter 
limits on the amount of money sampls may lend to one borrower 
the exemption applies only to loans for residential projects 
not commercial development also only the roughly 1100 thrifts 
of 2500 that meet strict new capital requirements effective in 
1995 are eligible 
aiming at highflying sampls that risked all of their capital on 
one loan last years law said thrifts could lend no more than 15 
percent of their capital to a single borrower 
however homebuilders used to borrowing from one thrift 
complained to congress and the bush administration that they were 
having trouble getting loans for sound projects 
the national association of home builders and other trade groups 
launched a lobbying campaign to get the standard temporarily eased 
the transition rule will permit healthy thrifts to lend 60 
percent of their capital to one borrower until the end of this 
year when the limit drops to 30 percent beginning in 1992 the 
limit returns to the 15 percent required by the law 
a month ago an agenc official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the thrift office had submitted a draft of its new 
lending rule to the treasury department 
thrift office director timothy ryan in a statement said he 
supports the intent of the original restriction to prevent 
institutions from risking everything on one or two projects 
but he said he believes the transition rule will give the 
bestcapitalized thrifts time to adjust to the new requirement in a 
carefully prescribed and prudent manner 
the loantooneborrower rule is one element of a reported 
credit crunch affecting borrowers particularly for real estate 
acquisition development and construction 
commercial banks who have operated under a 
15percentofcapital limit all along had opposed easing the rule 
however kenneth guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers association of america said his group was 
softening its stance in recognition that last years thrift 
reforms taken all together may be too onerous 
i think thrift regulators are trying to keep the healthy 
healthy and i think theyre also reacting in part to the real 
estate lending crunch that is sweeping across this country and has 
people very very worried he said 
separately monday the commerce department said construction 
spending slumped 04 percent in may the second consecutive decline

federal prison officials were accused in a 
lawsuit monday of trying to silence an inmate who claimed during 
the 1988 presidential campaign that he had once sold marijuana to 
dan quayle 
inmate brett c kimberlin accused federal prison authorities of 
canceling a press conference he had scheduled just four days before 
the election and in retaliation placing him in solitary confinement 
for a day 
the bureau of prisons acknowledged in a letter to kimberlins 
attorneys that it placed him in solitary again on nov 7 when he 
tried to arrange a telephone conference call with reporters 
according to court papers filed with the lawsuit in us district 
court 
the lawsuit charged that kimberlin was kept from meeting with 
reporters to repeat his allegation denied by quayle before the 
nov 8 election when the indiana republican won the vice 
presidency 
j michael quinlan head of the bureau of prisons and loye w 
miller jr then the justice departments chief spokesman were 
accused of concocting a false story that kimberlins nov 4 
placement on solitary confinement was to protect him from other 
inmates 
there was no answer late monday afternoon at the public affairs 
office at the bureau of prisons and at the home of miller 
the suit charged that the two officials intentionally caused 
and facilitated kimberlin to be placed repeatedly into detention 
for the purpose of stifling his attempts to communicate with the 
press about a matter of public interest and for the purpose of 
retaliating against kimberlin for such attempts 
the complaint charged that quinlan cancelled the nov 4 meeting 
kimberlin was to have with reporters even though it had been set up 
by officials at the federal prison in el reno okla where 
kimberlin was being held at the time 
kimberlin is serving a 50year sentence for marijuana smuggling 
and participating in a series of 1978 bombings in speedway ind 
kimberlin who has served 12 years of the prison term was recently 
told at a parole hearing he could expect to be released in 1994 
kimberlin who had claimed to several reporters in telephone 
conversations that he had sold marijuana to quayle nearly 20 years 
ago had granted an interview to nbc news on nov 4 
after being deluged with requests from reporters to interview 
kimberlin prison officials scheduled a 7 pm press conference 
which was canceled by quinlan the complaint said 
quinlan canceled the press conference even though frank keating 
the associate attorney general had previously advised that 
reporters should have the same access to kimberlin as with any 
other prisoner the lawsuit said 
the bureau of prisons said in a recent letter to kimberlins 
lawyers that the press conference was cancelled because it was in 
violation of federal prison regulations

jurors considering charges against a defendent 
in the bensonhurst racial slaying case said monday they couldnt 
agree on a verdict but the judge asked them to try once more 
before he declares a mistrial 
the development came on the eighth day of deliberations in the 
trial of john vento 21 the third man to stand trial in the 
slaying last summer of a black teenager in the bensonhurst section 
of brooklyn 
the wearylooking jurors filed back into state court shortly 
before 1 pm and sent judge thaddeus owens a note that said in 
part each and every juror understands the arguments however we 
do not agree on what we understand 
vento is charged with murder riot unlawful imprisonment and 
other charges if convicted of murder he faces up to 25 years to 
life in prison 
owens asked the jurors if they were deadlocked and nearly all 
of them nodded yes it was unclear if the jurors were deadlocked 
on all or only some of the counts 
you should attempt to resolve your differences owens told 
the jurors but he added if you come back tomorrow if you are 
in the same position you are in now i will take the necessary 
steps to discharge you 
after the jury filed out of court owens told the lawyers for 
both sides that he would declare a mistrial if the jur could not 
reach a verdict by tuesday 
owens dismissed the jurors around 6 pm but told them to 
return to court tuesday morning 
the events followed a frustrating weekend of deliberations in 
which the judge chided the jurors saturday when they asked for a 
definition of the riot charge for a ninth time 
on sunday the panel appeared to be concentrating on the charge 
of murder by depraved indifference and asked for further 
explanation on that count 
obviously no one is happy about a situation where it looks 
like were not going to get a decision ventos attorney gerald 
dichiara said outside the courtroom its just tough to go 
through all of this and not to get a decision prosecutors would 
not comment 
dichiara said he thought the judge handled the situation with 
great diplomacy and tact and said he believes the jury is 
deadlocked on all the counts

friends whod gone to bensonhurst to look at a used car were 
surrounded by a crowd of batwielding whites

the mayor of bordeaux on monday refused 
to allow the extreme right national front to hold its annual summer 
meeting in his city saying it would be a risk to public order 
jacques chabandelmas who is also a ranking conservative 
parliamentary deputy told a news conference he was breaking off 
negotiations with the national front which had sought to rent out 
meeting grounds belonging to the city 
bordeaux was the latest in a series of french cities which have 
refused municipal space for meetings of the farright 
antiimmigrant party 
the refusals started after the may 10 desecration of a jewish 
cemetery in carpentras in southern france which interior minister 
pierre joxe indirectly blamed on national front leader jeanmarie 
le pen 
protests have been numerous following the announcement of this 
meeting chabandelmas said according to the information i 
have received it is clear that public order would be threatened by 
serious disturbances if the national front meeting were held in 
bordeaux 
chabandelmas of the rally for the republic party said his 
decision did not amount to discrimination against the national 
front 
the national front political bureau immediately issued a 
statement charging that chabandelmas decision was made under 
pressure from rabbi joseph sitruk the grand rabbi of france 
supposedly acting in the name of the jewish community 
the statement said the front would use all lawful means 
against the decision and against all calumnious commentaries 
which motivated it 
le pen was recently charged with racial defamation for making a 
reference in an interview last year to what he called the jewish 
international he has been fined in the past for antisemitic 
statements 
following the carpentras desecration joxe said le pen had 
contributed to a climate of hatred that could lead to such acts 
le pens national front has been refused municipal space in more 
than a half dozen cities since then his home town in brittany 
trinitesurmer would not welcome him and a big paris meeting 
planned for a music hall nearly two weeks ago had to be held 
outside the capital in le bourget 
the national front which became a political force in france in 
1984 has the support of about 15 percent of the electorate 
according to polls

about 1500 students forced their way 
into a government ministry and occupied its courtyards for two 
hours monday to back an announced strike by government employees 
but most government ministries functioned normally monday 
despite the strike which was called by a sandinistadominated 
trade union to protest politically motivated firings 
the national employees union had called for a walkout by the 
100000 government workers to protest what it called massive 
firings in violation of agreements reached with the government of 
president violeta barrios de chamorro to end a strike in may 
an estimated 1000 workers in the mayors office and foreign 
ministry took part in the strike 
most government workers are holdovers from the leftist 
sandinista administration and fear cutbacks and political firings 
by the usbacked government of mrs chamorro who took office 
april 25 after winning elections 
work at the construction and transportation ministry was briefly 
disrupted after about 1500 students forced their way into the 
building to protest a government decision forcing them to pay to 
ride public transportation 
police did not intervene as the students pushed through the 
buildings doors and occupied the interior courtyards 
police threatened to use force to remove the students but the 
protesters left peacefully two hours later after the minister 
jaime icabalceta promised to allow high school and university 
students to continue riding public transportation free of charge 
the ministry had announced last week that it was removing the 
government transportation subsidy and ending free transportation 
for students 
we are trying to restore one of the achievements of the 
revolution said mario chamorro vice president of the secondary 
students federation referring to the 1979 sandinista revolution 
that overthrew dictator anastasio somoza chamorro is not believed 
to be related to the president 
workers at some ministries said that although they had not 
walked out they were ready to support the strike 
gloria hernandez secretarygeneral of the union at the 
agriculture and livestock ministry said the strike will be in 
stages 
here were not on strike yet but we are ready to start it 
she said 
the government said in a communique that workers can strike as 
long as they fulfill the requirements of the law 
the may strike drew the support of 65000 government employees 
who were protesting the suspension of a civil service law that 
protected their jobs and benefits 
after paralyzing the country for a week the strike ended when 
the government promised to grant workers a 100 percent pay increase 
and not to retaliate against strikers 
but jose angel bermudez the secretarygeneral of the national 
employees union said more than 800 government employees most of 
them sandinistas have been fired out of pure revenge 
the chamorro government in turn has accused the sandinistas of 
attempting to destabilize the new administration through strikes 
reducing the size of the government is part of mrs chamorros 
plan to slow the inflationary spiral and restore the countrys 
battered economy

president bush met with top foreign 
policy strategists monday to prepare for a nato summit he says will 
bring changes but no bombshell in the western alliances 
military strategy 
bush who used last years nato summit to unveil a proposal for 
major troop reductions in europe said there will be some very 
interesting developments at the session thursday and friday in 
london 
some will call it dramatic policy changes and others wont 
he told reporters there will be some changes but i dont happen 
to believe that its bombshell dimension 
vice president dan quayle secretary of state james baker iii 
defense secretary dick cheney chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff colin powell and other senior officials flew from washington 
for the morning strategy session at bushs vacation home 
overlooking the atlantic 
they met amid reports that bush had already sent the nato allies 
a blueprint for radically altering the alliances flexible 
response strategy on when and how the west would use nuclear 
weapons to stem a warsaw pact invasion 
later bush told reporters as he teed off for a round of golf 
with quayle and others we covered a lot of ground were ready 
ready for nato 
national security adviser brent scowcroft also in the golf 
party said we made a number of suggestions and proposals to our 
allies and a number of others have made suggestions he said bush 
wants to discuss the proposals first with his colleagues before 
going public with them 
but us officials said privately bush will urge the nato allies 
to overhaul their strategy for repelling a soviet invasion by 
making the use of nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort 
this would be a major change from the current strategy that 
explicitly maintains the option of early use of nuclear weapons to 
counter a massive warsaw pact invasion of western europe a 
scenario of almost vanishing possibility when the soviets are 
withdrawing troops from eastern europe and some warsaw pact members 
wish publicly they could be in nato too 
bush also is ready to consider scrapping the 1470 us 
nucleartipped artillery shells now based mostly in west germany 
and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1560 us nuclear bombs 
deployed in seven nato countries sources who insisted on anonymity 
told the associated press 
the washington post and the new york times first reported monday 
that bush would propose making nuclear arms weapons of last resort 
in europe 
the white house did not deny any of the news reports of the 
possible changes in nato strategy that bush was readying 
bush fielding questions on the lawn outside his walkers point 
home said were trying to get our act totally together were 
in good shape for the meeting i think our side is generally agreed 
on the big questions 
bush said he expects the nato summit to produce a document 
that is unanimously agreed to that will set the course for the 
future and as conditions have changed nato will change 
he said the united states already has had close contacts 
with allies on the proposals and baker was headed for brussels on 
tuesday to iron out some of the differences before we get there 
baker and other nato foreign ministers were attending a 
24nation conference in the belgium capital on aid to poland and 
hungary before the nato summit 
alixe glen a deputy white house press secretary said bush was 
encouraged by the early feedback he has already gotten from the 
allies 
on a separate issue the white house distanced itself from 
senate minority leader bob doles remark sunday that bush was 
unlikely to accept higher tax rates as part of the current budget 
negotiations with congress 
thats senator doles personal prediction said ms glen 
the president has said a thousand times no preconditions 
everythings on the table 
quayles wife marilyn accompanied him to maine and the couple 
were staying at walkers point as overnight guests of the bushes 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady was also staying overnight 
brady was also on hand for a second strategy meeting planned to 
prepare for the economic summit in houston that starts monday with 
the leaders of the worlds seven major industrialized nations us 
trade representative carla hills and a team of economic experts 
were flying up tuesday for that session

crews worked monday to clean about 30000 
gallons of fuel spilled from the collision of two cargo ships in 
the chesapeake bay it was one of the largest oil discharges into 
the estuary in more than a decade authorities said 
the spill was concentrated along the elizabeth river section of 
the inner norfolk harbor and in the bay where it had largely 
dissipated officials said some fuel oil washed ashore along two 
miles of bayside city beaches in the oceanview area of norfolk 
oil was still leaking during the afternoon but was being 
contained by booms and recovered by vacuum said capt eugene k 
johnson commander of the coast guard marine safety office in 
norfolk 
in addition to beaches the spill raised concerns about the 
areas prime crab nursery the crab harvest for the bay last year 
was 431 million pounds 
if oil sinks to the bottom it would kill or cover the crab 
larvae or eggs that are hatching said joe maroon president of 
virginias chapter of the chesapeake bay foundation 
but later in the day coast guard officials and national 
oceanographic and atmospheric administration scientists said the 
danger appeared to have passed for the bay fisheries 
were seeing minimal oil sheens out in the bay the area of 
the elizabeth river contaminated does not include any shellfish 
beds said ann hayward walker noaas scientific coordinator with 
the coast guard 
the cargo ships collided during a thunderstorm sunday night four 
miles north of norfolk outside the hampton roads bridgetunnel 
the outbound columbus america and the inbound neptune jade suffered 
extensive damage said johnson 
the columbus america a hole below its water line leaked about 
30000 gallons of no 4 heavy fuel oil as it returned to a shipyard 
on the elizabeth river the oil was from the ships fuel tanks not 
from cargo 
we consider this a major marine casualty because of the damage 
done and the amount of oil spilled said coast guard cmdr george 
naccara 
larry mcbride tidewater regional director of the state water 
control board said the spill was one of the largest in the bay 
since the early 1970s 
johnson ordered the main shipping channel into norfolk closed 
monday morning as crews from the coast guard navy water board and 
a private contractor worked to clean it the channel reopened after 
about four hours 
an aerial survey of the bay in the afternoon showed oil in the 
surf along a twomile section of beachfront by midafternoon work 
crews had collected about 50 bags of oily debris johnson said 
i think the environmental damage will be minimal he said 
but in the river things did not look so good 
were covered in oil right now said gordon shelton of the 
tidewater yacht services marina on the elizabeth river i want to 
know who the hell is supposed to clean it up 
shelton said the oil contaminated the 200 boats in the marina 
fouled his shoreline and covered the 20 or so ducks that live in 
the marina 
the coast guard is investigating the accident a board of 
investigation was scheduled to hear testimony tuesday 
johnson said both vessels were carrying containers of hazardous 
material including petroleum distillates paint and laquer 
products but none of the containers leaked 
the regions main resort area virginia beach on the atlantic 
ocean will probably be spared johnson said 
about 40 workers were on the oceanview beaches since dawn said 
stanley stein acting director of the citys department of parks 
and recreation 
the neptune jade owned by neptune orient lines of singapore 
was headed for halifax nova scotia its last port of call was 
panama city the columbus america owned by columbus america inc 
of hamburg west germany was bound for melbourne australia 
johnson said columbus america inc had taken responsibility for 
the cleanup costs and that west germany and singapore were 
cooperating in the investigation 
the bridge crews of both ships were tested for drugs and 
alcohol a normal procedure after accidents johnson said 
the chesapeake bay foundation a nonprofit environmental group 
called for more regulation of traffic on the bay 
given the fragility of the bay the large quantities of oil 
transported on it and the apparent inability of the current 
regulations to stop oil spills and clean them up the states and 
the federal government must do more to prevent such potential 
catastrophes said group vice president ann powers

that much in firefighting expenses and wages it was the worst 
forest fire in arizona history 
fire officials warn that northern california northern nevada 
and idaho are expected to reach the same level of dryness later 
this summer those helped renew calls by many fire officials to ban 
all fireworks even the socalled safe and sane variety 
i hate that term safe and sane fireworks because its a 
misnomer said fountain valley fire chief richard jorgensen 
jorgensen and other orange county fire chiefs boycotted a 
fireworks safety news conference two years ago when they learned 
that manufacturers of legal fireworks were also scheduled to appear 
first of all they burn at a temperature over a thousand 
degrees jorgensen said we teach kids all year long not to 
play with fire then we turn around on the fourth of july and put 
them in their hands and tell them its fun 
independence day revelers often show lapses in judgment like 
some young fountain valley adults caught lobbing fireworks back and 
forth at each other as they stood on a wood roof he said 
near santa barbara where 430 houses and 28 apartment buildings 
were destroyed an overnight scare reminded edgy firefighters that 
they had only won a reprieve in what promises to be a monthslong 
battle fire capt charlie johnson said 
at 4 am monday gusts suddenly reached 35 mph near where the 
firestorm began wednesday the humidity dropped into the teens the 
temperature rose to 79 sparks were churned up into the air 
it wasnt in the weather forecast johnson said just 
suddenly the winds were blowing similar to when the fires started 
because of that it actually helped us some the embers blew 
back into the burned area and some places that flared up had 
natural burnouts instead of us having to go in with shovels and 
picks 
because of the flareups however officials decided to delay 
declaring they had the fire controlled control is now expected at 
6 am tuesday 
in addition to three waterdropping helicopters one chopper 
carried an infrared camera to make sure firefighters got to the 
remaining hot spots johnson said 
he said the winds had convinced officials to keep firefighting 
equipment and personnel on the scene much longer than earlier 
planned 
it now appears were going to have people assigned to this 
fire for eight or 10 days as a precaution johnson said

a mentally retarded man went on trial 
for a second time monday in the 1979 stabbing death of a 
22yearold woman a crime for which he was nearly executed four 
years ago 
prosecutors told jurors that death row inmate johnny paul penry 
had nearly stomped the victim to death before calmly stabbing 
her with a pair of scissors 
defense attorneys said penrys retardation was at the root of 
the case 
penry now 34 has been on death row since 1980 when a jury 
convicted him of capital murder in the death of pamela moseley 
carpenter mrs carpenter was the sister of former washington 
redskins kicker mark moseley 
in 1986 he came within hours of execution by lethal injection 
before receiving a stay from the us supreme court the court 
vacated his death sentence two years ago saying jurors should have 
been told about penrys retardation 
prosecutors are retrying the entire case because under texas 
law in a capital murder case the penalty phase alone cannot be 
retried 
in opening arguments monday district attorney joe price 
described how penry allegedly forced his way into mrs carpenters 
home the morning of oct 25 1979 and how she was attacked 
he dragged her knocked her down into the bedroom price 
said he nearly stomped the life out of her stomped her into 
submission then he calmly and deliberately walked across the room 
picked up a pair of orangehandled scissors sat on her stomach 
looked her in the eye and stabbed her in the chest 
you will never for the rest of your lives forget these 
orangehandled scissors price told the jurors she reached up 
and pulled the scissors out of her chest 
she died within hours of the assault penry confessed in a 
signed statement after he was arrested 
in an ordinary case perhaps a signed statement would convince 
you penrys attorney john wright said of his clients 
confession to police 
this is no ordinary case johnny paul is mentally retarded 
all the horror story youve just been recounted had its start right 
there 
penry has said he was abused by his parents particularly by his 
mother and never attended regular school beyond a few days in the 
first grade because of his retardation 
he has an iq estimated at between 50 and 60 and the reasoning 
capacity of a 7yearold 
in testimony monday mrs carpenters husband bruce identified 
bloody clothing as belonging to his wife he also described his 
wife of three years as young and beautiful and then identified 
her battered body in a picture taken after her death 
penry who replied not guilty when asked monday for a plea 
sat attentively during the arguments and initial testimony at 
times he exchanged words with one of his attorneys 
penry has denied killing mrs carpenter i told them i did it 
but i didnt do it he has said i dont know who did it all i 
know is i didnt

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on monday 
defended policies that led to the ouster of hardline communist 
rulers across eastern europe saying the region is ridding itself 
of stalinism 
big changes are under way in eastern europe gorbachev said 
in his keynote speech to the 28th congress of the soviet communist 
party in the kremlin 
and when it is said it is the failure of socialism we ask 
in reply what kind of socialism the kind that was in fact a 
stalinist version well we are are getting rid of that 
ourselves he said 
the stalinist model of socialism is being replaced by a civil 
society of free men and women gorbachev declared 
many hardline soviet communists have questioned the wisdom of 
gorbachevs relaxation of controls over its allies in the warsaw 
pact military alliance 
gorbachev told his fellow party members monday that his policies 
had allowed change to occur peacefully in eastern europe except 
for romanias violent revolution in december little blood was shed 
as communists rulers were overthrown elsewhere 
every east bloc communist leader in power during the last soviet 
communist party congress in 1986 was ousted by this spring 
in hungary and poland the changes came at the ballot box 
peaceful revolutions swept away the old orders in east germany and 
czechoslovakia the communists in bulgaria ousted longtime rulers 
under the pressure of popular protests 
the upheaval was produced in part by gorbachevs social and 
economic reforms in the soviet union eastern european communist 
reformers and opposition activists quickly sensed the significance 
of the policies of glasnost and perestroika that gorbachev put into 
effect shortly after he took power in 1985 
in addition gorbachevs tacit renunciation of the brezhnev 
doctrine accelerated reform in eastern europe that policy 
outlined in 1968 limited the sovereignty of moscows warsaw pact 
allies and sanctioned the use of force to preserve socialism

thirty dusty days on the jim bridger trail 
ended in rain monday as the wyoming centennial wagon train rolled 
into cody with modernday pioneers who relived the past to 
celebrate the states 100th birthday 
approximately 200 wagons and 1600 riders on horseback were 
greeted with a great whooping and hollering from several thousand 
wellwishers who jammed streets and roof tops to watch the 
fourmilelong procession 
i wouldnt have bet there were this many horses in this whole 
united states lifelong cody resident frank mcjunkin 70 said as 
he watched the parade of covered wagons horses and exhausted but 
delighted riders ramble by 
the cavalry led the wagon train to the end of its 260mile trek 
along the jim bridger trail one of the main pioneer routes 
northwest through wyoming riders recreating the pony express 
followed with state centennial flags 
us sen alan simpson in a red western shirt and beaded vest 
rode the last few miles with the wagon train and predicted that 
years from now everyone will claim they rode along 
therell be as many people saying they rode the wyoming 
centennial wagon train as said they saw babe ruths last game at 
yankee stadium about 7 million said simpson who grew up in 
this frontier town founded by showman buffalo bill cody 
kayne pyatt the trail boss who oversaw the journey organized by 
a group of enthusiasts said its sort of like ive lived a 
great childhood adventure a fantasy if i died tomorrow id 
be satisfied 
the riders started the day about 16 miles east of cody and 
followed alongside us 14a encountering a torrential downpour 
about a mile out 
simpson and his wife ann were joined on the final leg by 
wyoming gov mike sullivan and his wife jane and wyoming rep 
craig thomas and his wife susan all on horseback montana gov 
stan stephens rode in a red surry 
the sun broke through as they reached the edge of town but 
distant thunder and lightning added a dramatic backdrop horses 
reared and bucked riders waved and hollered and a few wagon 
passengers played their fiddles to the cody crowd 
cody loves you some spectators yelled happy birthday 
wyoming 
some of the trail riders welcomed the return to modern 
conveniences while others regretted reaching the end of the line 
in a way its sad and in a way im glad to roll into cody 
said ken hagen 71 of roseau minn the dust was the worst some 
days there was so much dust you couldnt see the team ahead of 
you and for six days we never saw a tree 
the final miles brought together past and present as modernday 
vehicles on the highway buzzed by the rumbling replica wagons 
this is a chance for a person like me to be a part of history 
maybe not a significant part but a part said mike wozniak of 
casper who spent two days on the trail this wagon train is not 
going to happen again maybe not for another 100 years 
the train left fort caspar june 2 besides the dust it was 
accompanied by fears the organizers wouldnt be able to pay their 
bills 
arriving here the organizers estimated they were about 100000 
shy of the approximately 500000 they figured theyd need to pay 
for things like hay water and portable toilets 
participating costs ranged from 40 a day to just ride along in 
your own rig to 198 a day to ride on one provided 
the organizers also raised money through contests and auctions 
along the trail and plan to raffle off an elk permit donated by 
gov mike sullivan

tragedy and the hajj the pilgrimage to mecca that every moslem 
is expected to make at least once are no strangers and mondays 
disaster was the second in three years in which a great number of 
pilgrims lost their lives 
in 1987 clashes with saudi security forces in mecca killed 402 
people during the hajj 275 of them iranians hundreds were injured 
the year before the saudis had confiscated large quantities of 
explosives from members of the iranian contingent to mecca 
in 1979 religious extremists seized the grand mosque in mecca 
and held it for two weeks before saudi forces stormed it more than 
250 people were killed and saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more 
saudi arabia restricted the number of pilgrims and later broke 
off diplomatic ties with iran after the 1987 carnage the most 
serious of a series of incidents during pilgrimages since irans 
islamic revolution in 1979 
the incidents were fired by iranian efforts to politicize the 
hajj and encourage other moslem nations to seize shrines at mecca 
and medina from the control of the kingdoms saud royal family 
last month the saudi government said iranians were welcome to 
take part in this years islamic pilgrimage to mecca but would not 
be allowed to demonstrate it was an antiamerican demonstration 
that led to the 1987 slaughter 
iran denied in september 1989 that it was involved in two bomb 
blasts in mecca two months earlier and tehransupported terrorists 
vowed to avenge saudi arabias execution of 16 shiite moslems 
convicted of setting the explosions 
the bombs exploded as thousands of people took part in the 
annual pilgrimage to islams most sacred city killing one person 
and injuring 16 
the explosions erupted as hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were 
praying and walking around the kaaba islams holiest shrine 
inside the grand mosque 
the attacks were believed connected to the centuriesold feud 
between sunni and shiite moslems 
every moslem sunni or shiite has a duty to make the pilgrimage 
to mecca the birthplace of the 7th century prophet mohammed and 
to medina where mohammed is buried 
sunnis and shiites disagree about who should have succeeded 
mohammed who founded islam 
iran which has an overwhelming majority of shiites among its 
nearly 50 million people had been urging moslems to seize mecca 
and medina 
last year an estimated 18 million moslems from more than 80 
nations went on the annual pilgrimage an estimated 2 million 
people attended this year

the rev al sharpton a flamboyant black 
activist was acquitted monday of charges he stole money from a 
civil rights group he started as a teenager then spent it on 
himself 
the state jury deliberated for less than six hours before 
finding sharpton innocent on all counts of fraud and larceny said 
ed barbini a spokesman for the office of state attorney general 
robert abrams 
the trial lasted almost two months the state called more than 
80 witnesses the defense called none 
sharpton was charged with stealing about 250000 from the 
nowdefunct nonprofit national youth movement a civil rights 
organization he started as a 16yearold high school student and 
spending it on himself 
if convicted he would have faced up to seven years in prison 
we accept the verdict of the jury we could not ignore the 
body of evidence that pointed to improprieties at the national 
youth movement and we felt it was our obligation to take these 
allegations before a jury barbini said 
assistant attorney general victor genecin charged in his 
summation that sharpton sold ideals then cheated the people he 
was supposed to be helping 
sharptons lawyer alton maddox said he was pleased with judge 
joan careys handling of the case 
maddox said the charges brought against his client were baseless 
and accused abrams of acting out of vindictiveness because sharpton 
had advised tawana brawley the black teenager found by a grand 
jury to have concocted a tale of abduction and sexual assault at 
the hands of a gang of white men 
maddox 44 also represented brawley in may he was suspended 
from practicing law for refusing to appear before a grievance 
committee investigating his conduct in the widely publicized 
brawley case the judicial panel let him finish the sharpton case 
im not worried about anything sharpton said after the jury 
retired except maybe on which side of the bars im going to do 
my work im not tied to any geographical location

a federal judge says a town may arrest 
people who sleep on the beach or in their cars in beachside 
neighborhoods rejecting a challenge to an ordinances 
constitutionality 
the law for the town of westerly doesnt involve a fundamental 
right us district judge francis j boyle said in a ruling 
handed down friday and released monday 
the state american civil liberties union challenged the law on 
behalf of two connecticut men arrested in july 1988 the case was 
expanded to a class action covering 268 people arrested during the 
past three years 
the aclu said enforcement was unfair because rhode island 
residents were given summonses and released while outofstaters 
were jailed unless they appeared before a justice of the peace 
pleaded no contest and paid a 20 fine 
boyle ruled that westerly had a legitimate interest in treating 
outofstate residents differently because if they fled after 
release there was no way to bring them back to court on the 
misdemeanor charge 
the aclu also argued that the law discriminated against those 
who could not find lodging here during the busy tourist season and 
made them drive out of the area when dangerously tired 
westerly police chief mark s champlin contended the nearly 
30yearold ordinance was needed to reduce a rash of crimes in 
beachside neighborhoods 
by preventing persons from camping on westerlys beaches and 
parking lots without proper amenities and sanitary facilities the 
town protects important governmental interests boyle said 
he rejected what he called the plaintiffs contention that the 
constitution of the united states provides them with an assurance 
of an evenings lodging in westerly 
westerly is about 50 miles southeast of providence

war the negotiations have bogged down over the first point in the 
ceasefire resolution which called for a withdrawal to

troops on iranian territory and the longstanding dispute over the 
shattalarab the confluence of the tigris and euphrates rivers 
which forms the southern boundary between the two countries 
the stalemate has left an estimated 100000 soldiers in

a defense lawyer monday urged a jury to end 
the 7yearold mcmartin preschool case once and for all by 
acquitting raymond buckey of child molestation 
the truth never had a chance attorney danny davis said as 
he showed jurors an enlarged copy of a letter police sent mcmartin 
parents in 1983 suggesting buckey might have molested children 
end this case once and for all davis said in his final 
argument in the second trial in which buckey is accused of 
molesting students at his familys nowdefunct manhattan beach 
preschool 
but a prosecutor said buckey is guilty 
deputy district attorney pam ferrero urged the jurors to 
discount the testimony of former mcmartin teachers called by the 
defense who had been accused of molesting students and cleared 
i think its quite possible that people in this case were 
falsely accused ferrero said in her closing argument im not 
here to apologize for anyone that came before me nor am i going to 
say the investigation in this case was perfect but i think its 
clear that anyone whos been accused in this case has an ax to 
grind they in their own minds feel they have been wronged by the 
system 
ms ferrero and deputy district attorney joe martinez took over 
the case after two other prosecutors bowed out 
buckey 32 is on trial for a second time on eight counts of 
child molestation in what has become the longest and costliest 
criminal proceeding in us history 
in the first trial he and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
were accused of molestation and conspiracy it lasted 2 years and 
ended jan 18 with mrs buckey acquitted of all charges and buckey 
acquitted of 40 counts of molestation and conspiracy jurors 
deadlocked on 13 other charges against buckey and prosecutors 
refiled eight of those counts 
five other mcmartin teachers originally were accused of 
molesting students but charges against them were dropped for lack 
of evidence after a preliminary hearing 
mrs buckey 63 was called as a prosecution witness in her 
sons second trial which has lasted three months 
buckey has testified that he never molested any children 
ms ferrero ridiculed buckey as a young man who worked for his 
mommy a woman who was quite dogmatic 
she repeatedly cited the testimony of three young girls who 
claim buckey molested them up to 11 years ago 
conceding that the girls gave sometimes contradictory testimony 
she cited the time elapsed and the ordeal theyve experienced and 
said their testimony should be believed 
the childrens testimony is corroborated by the circumstantial 
evidence in this case ms ferrero said 
at another point she said this particular case boils down to 
credibility who do you believe if you believe the children then 
the people have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt 
davis said a number of parents bought into a story of 
molestations which did not take place he noted that at least two 
of the three girls who testified in the second trial had accused 
other mcmartin teachers of molestation only to see them acquitted 
he stressed that the childrens and parents stories have 
changed over the years noting that the three girls who testified 
were 12 and 13 years old but talking about experiences as toddlers

valdez have appealed his misdemeanor conviction arguing the judge 
should not have allowed prosecutors to use the skippers 
bloodalcohol test 
joseph hazelwood is appealing his conviction by a state superior 
court jury on one count of negligent discharge of oil he was 
acquitted march 22 of more serious charges that he had been drunk 
and reckless when the tanker ran around

alaska and to spend 1000 hours scrubbing stilloiled beaches on 
prince william sound the sentence was postponed pending the appeal 
before the alaska court of appeals

trial judge karl johnstone erred in allowing evidence of 
hazelwoods bloodalcohol test into the record the test was taken 
10 hours after the tanker grounded they also argued the judge 
should have allowed the defense to introduce tests showing traces 
of alcohol and marijuana in the blood of coast guard employees on 
radar watch the night the tanker struck the reef 
the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 1989 spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of north slope crude oil

the hajj an annual pilgrimage to islams holiest shrines in 
saudi arabia is the worlds largest religious gathering it brings 
together arabian princes merchants from indonesia peasants from 
soviet uzbekistan and paupers from bangladesh 
the hajj must be made at least once in a lifetime by all moslems 
who can afford it performing the hajj is one of the five 
pillars of the islamic faith the others are professing that 
there is only one god and mohammed is his prophet saying the five 
daily prayers giving alms to the poor and observing the 
dawntodusk fast during the lunar month of ramadan 
a moslem who performs the pilgrimage is called a hajji each 
year hundreds of thousands of moslems from around the world travel 
to the holy city of mecca by land sea or even on foot for the 
pilgrimage 
the pilgrims join in chanting god is so great and to him we 
pay high tribute waves of veiled women and men in white seamless 
robes signifying equality before allah take part in the prayers 
during the hajj pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not 
quarrel cut their hair or even kill a fly 
the hajj is performed during the islamic lunar months of 
shawwal zul quideh and zulhijjeh similar rituals performed out 
of the season are called umrah or lesser hajj 
the hajj proper is limited to six days a pilgrim may commence 
the rituals at any time during the three months 
hajjis start the pilgrimage by praying at the grand mosque in 
mecca they then circle seven times around the kaaba a granite 
cube draped with goldembroidered black brocade moslems honor the 
kaaba as the house of allah where the prophet abraham offered his 
first prayers to god 
as they circle the cube pilgrims bend to kiss the sacred black 
stone set in silver on the east corner of the granite structure 
moslems believe the stone is a meteorite which came from heaven 
the legend says the stone was originally white but became black 
over the centuries as hajjis washed away their sins on it 
hajjis are then required to run back and forth seven times 
between two rocks about halfamile apart called alsafa and 
almarwa this ceremony is meant to relive the agony of hagar 
abrahams second wife when she was looking for water for her son 
ishmael considered the ancestor of the arabs 
the main center of the pilgrimage then moves to mina a meeting 
place for the hajjis to gather before they climb mount arafat for 
the climax of the observances moslems believe arafat is where 
abraham showed his devotion to god by offering to sacrifice his son 
at mount arafat each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the 
three devil pillars a spot where moslems believe the devil 
tried to tempt abraham to disobey allah and refuse to sacrifice his 
son 
at twilight pilgrims offer the eid aladha or feast of 
sacrifice prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of 
sheep cows and camels 
the meat traditionally goes to poor saudis but since the 
discovery of oil virtually eliminated poverty in the kingdom most 
is flown to poor moslems in 26 countries 
hundreds of thousands of pilgrims then stream down mount arafat 
to the mina plain and on to mecca for the farewell prayer before 
dispersing creating what may be the worlds biggest traffic jam 
arafat is about eight miles from mecca 
it is at this stage that most accidents occur 
the saudi government has spent 15 billion in recent years on a 
development plan to move pilgrims in a more orderly fashion for the 
hajj building networks of roads tunnels dormitories and medical 
clinics the tunnel where mondays tragedy occurred is one of 
several equipped with giant ventilators and air conditioning

mikhail s gorbachev parried a demand on monday 
that he resign and urged unity among bickering factions of the 
communist party in what he said was a race to keep the country from 
becoming a secondrate power 
despite a lack of enthusiasm for his 2hour 20minute speech 
opening the communist partys crucial 28th congress the soviet 
leader appeared to have papered over differences between reformers 
and traditionalists with equal doses of confrontation conciliation 
and confession 
applause was rare and very light during his speech 
delegates displayed little strong emotion despite declarations 
by the party leader that the congress would decide the communist 
partys fate 
they came to life with a vengeance however with derisive 
whistles and a contemptuous waving of their red party cards when 
party ideology chief vadim medvedev tried to deliver a speech on 
the current political situation 
president bush was asked in kennebunkport maine about the 
criticism gorbachev was getting from hardliners 
i know the feeling bush quipped 
it was unclear whether gorbachev could continue to hold back the 
explosive disputes among the 4657 delegates threatening his 
leadership and the unity the party has maintained since the 1920s 
gorbachev defended his reforms and insisted radical reform is 
vital because the soviet union is rapidly becoming a secondrate 
power 
only nine minutes into the congress the soviet party chief and 
president faced a demand for his resignation coal miner vladimir 
bludov from the far east said the leadership had bungled a program 
to improve food supplies and implement other reforms 
another reformer yuri boldyrev of leningrad called for the 
nationalization of the partys property 
attacks on gorbachevs leadership are increasingly frequent as 
reformers and traditionalists find fault with a failing economy 
republics bent on secession and rampant crime 
i think we can return to this proposal the soviet leader 
said evenly in response to bludov and the congress overwhelmingly 
supported him 
at the end of the day politburo member alexander n yakovlev 
considered by many the brains behind gorbachevs reforms won an 
ovation for a fiery speech calling for delegates to rally around 
gorbachev 
tomorrow the party will not be alone in this violent political 
sea he said referring to new parties the communists have 
permitted criticism will be mounting this is when both unity 
and confidence will be especially necessary and we should learn it 
today 
when the 10day congress is over it will have elected a party 
leader and central committee and will have approved new party 
rules and platform 
yakovlev a frequent target of conservatives stepped out of 
gorbachevs shadow to warn that only a renewed younger and more 
leftist party will be able to lead the country forward to more 
serious reforms 
let us remember that not only empty store shelves forced 
perestroika but empty souls as well he said its impossible 
to stop the movement it will continue with or without the party 
gorbachev sharply attacked the party bureaucracy for impeding 
reform but did not yield to reformers demands that the party get 
out of the army kgb police and workplaces he received some of 
his strongest applause when he said party cells will remain 
he defended policies that led to the replacement of hardline 
communist leaders in eastern europe gorbachev said those countries 
were freeing themselves from stalinism as the soviet union itself 
is doing 
in a counterattack on traditionalists who seized control of a 
reconstituted communist party in the huge russian republic 
gorbachev chastised leading cadres who prefer the old and are 
quite incapable of integrating in the reform processes and who 
moreover refuse to accept them either politically or 
psychologically 
he said street crime and the soviet unions fragile unity have 
worsened 
his most visible rival on the ruling politburo yegor k 
ligachev said at a midjune meeting that gorbachev could not hold 
down both the party leadership and the soviet presidency on 
monday ligachev would not say whether he expected a formal 
challenge to gorbachev 
gorbachev acknowledged the politburo and other party leaders had 
been late or mistaken in making key decisions but he laid much of 
the blame for the nations economic political and ecological 
crisis on a heavy legacy of abuse and stagnation under stalin 
and other leaders 
reformminded delegates said they were unimpressed with 
gorbachevs report 
i expected it to be more constructive more radical with 
greater understanding of the fact that the fate of the party 
depends on this congress said reformminded leningrad mayor 
anatoly sobchak 
the radical democratic platform said previously that its 100 
delegates would walk out of the session and announce a formal break 
however grigory omelchenko a member from kiev said they 
decided to stay the most important thing is that there must not 
be a consolidation of forces from the center and the right wing 
he said 
another reformer sergei stankevich said the group would lobby 
legislatures after the party congress to divide up its property 
despite its small representation at the congress members believe 
they have the backing of up to 40 percent of the partys 18 million 
members 
there also were conciliatory words from traditionalists 
alexander buzgalin a member of the hardline marxist platform 
told reporters that leaders like stankevich and ligachev must stay 
in the party 
its difficult for such people to stay in the same party but 
it will be reality for now he said

panama has filed 16 criminal charges 
against toppled dictator manuel antonio noriega including charges 
of murder torture human rights violations and drug trafficking 
authorities said monday 
they said panama is also suing gen noriega for alleged offenses 
while he ran the military news reports said the suits amount to 
more than 5 million 
gretta marchosky an assistant to panamas attorney general 
said the criminal charges were filed by government prosecutors and 
private citizens 
noriega was ousted as chief of the defense forces by the dec 20 
us invasion and now awaits trial in miami on drug trafficking 
charges he surrendered to american forces jan 3 after holing up 
in the vatican embassy 
in miami noriega attorney frank rubino said he wasnt aware of 
the panamanian charges 
really im shocked i have no idea why the panamanian 
government brought the charges 
it should not affect his trial here in any way rubino said 
but added its possible the panamanian government could petition 
this government for extradition it then would be up to the us 
justice department to decide whether to send noriega back to panama 
we cannot speculate on what the government of panama will 
do diane cossin spokeswoman for us attorney dexter lehtinen 
said late monday in miami we have no further comment at this 
time 
attorney general rogelio cruz declined to say how panama plans 
to pursue the charges and civil suits in noriegas absence panama 
is working through the law firm of williams and connally which has 
its headquarters in washington 
a summary of charges prepared by cruz accuses noriega of 
murdering 10 military officers who led a botched coup attempt in 
october and of murdering hugo spadafora an opposition leader whose 
decapitated body was found in costa rica near the panamanian border 
in 1985 
cruz said about 500000 worth of noriegas bank accounts in 
panama have been frozen so far 
three luxury homes one worth 10 million remain in the custody 
of the panamanian government other property has been found in the 
name of noriegas wife felicidad and their children who live now 
in cuba and the dominican republic 
ms marchosky told the associated press that from the time 
noriega entered the armed forces as a lieutenant in 1962 until he 
was toppled his salary and other compensation totaled 648583 
american diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
estimate his fortune at 280 million to 300 million noriegas 
lawyers say at least 11 million of that was from the cia for 
which he once worked 
panamanian officials say the united states retention of 
thousands of boxes of documents is hindering attempts to trace 
noriega property illegally obtained with public funds 
cruz told a news conference his office received 14276 
accusations since january most of them against noriega and his 
associates

a jury monday cleared imelda marcos of charges 
that she looted 222 million from the philippines and hid the money 
by buying art and real estate with the help of saudi financier 
adnan khashoggi 
the us district court verdict on mrs marcos 61st birthday 
reduced the former philippines first lady to tears and sent her 
supporters into jubilant celebration 
the jury also acquitted khashoggi the jetsetter once known as 
the worlds richest man of charges that he helped mrs marcos and 
her late husband conceal ownership of four new york buildings 
this is the best birthday present i ever had said a beaming 
mrs marcos as she left the courtroom 
i am in great awe and respect for the jury system that 
symbolizes the soul of the american people she said 
mrs marcos went directly to st patricks cathedral where she 
walked on her knees down the aisle to the altar then bowed her 
head to the floor and prayed 
from st patricks she went to the manhattan apartment she has 
been staying during the trial where friends and supporters 
celebrated with her into the evening 
she emerged from the apartment shortly before 10 pm asked 
about her plans for the future she said home 
mrs marcos then got into a van with several friends they were 
reportedly headed to a party at a manhattan restaurant with 
khashoggi as host 
khashoggi 54 also praised the american jury system 
i feel very happy for myself and my family and for the united 
states he said earlier a moslem he said he planned to leave 
new york to make a pilgrimage to mecca islams holiest city 
as was his habit during the trial khashoggi returned to his 
posh midtown apartment via subway posing with strangers and 
signing autographs once above ground he and his wife used a 
cellular phone to call friends in france england and california 
with the news 
if convicted on all charges mrs marcos could have been 
sentenced to 50 years in prison and fined 1 million khashoggi 
could have drawn a sentence of 10 years and a 500000 fine 
the jury announced its verdict in the fifth day of deliberations 
after a threemonth trial prosecutors called 95 witnesses the 
defense led by marcos attorney gerry spence called none 
it was a poorly prepared case forewoman katherine balton 
said later in a telephone interview there was nothing to 
convince any of them that there was a case 
when balton read the first innocent verdict in court marcos 
supporters cried out ignoring judge john f keenans warning 
against outbursts 
mrs marcos was in tears she smiled and hugged her lawyers 
the prosecutors sat facing the judge eyes downcast 
in a terse statement the office of us attorney otto obermaier 
praised the work of the trial prosecutors and said the jury has 
rendered its verdict our system of justice has spoken 
the jury acquitted both defendants of all charges 
racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction 
of justice against mrs marcos and mail fraud and obstruction of 
justice against khashoggi 
carmen pedrosa a spokesman for the philippines government said 
in a hastily written statement issued here that even though mrs 
marcos was acquitted the trial showed that marcos regime was rife 
with unbridled corruption and total abuse of power 
a government spokesman in manila said mrs marcos was still 
banned from returning home 
estimates on how much the case cost the us government were not 
available obermaiers office said 
mrs marcos had been accused of conspiring with her husband to 
buy art jewelry and four manhattan commercial buildings with 222 
million stolen from their country 
ferdinand marcos was indicted with his wife in october 1988 2 
years after the president and first lady fled the philippines he 
died in hawaii last september 
during the trial the judge had called the case an 
unprecedented prosecution because it involved world figures 
including a former head of state who was a major us ally 
authorities charged that much of the tens of millions of dollars 
used for investments in the united states came in kickbacks marcos 
collected from government contractors while he was philippines 
president 
witnesses said the money was funneled to the united states 
through numbered bank accounts in switzerland hong kong manila 
and los angeles and was used to secretly buy the buildings for the 
marcoses through associates and offshore corporations 
the central issue the jury had to decide was how much mrs 
marcos knew about her husbands alleged corrupt practices 
spence of jackson wyo said during closing arguments that 
mrs marcos was a world class shopper but he said she did not 
know the source of her husbands wealth the defense attorney said 
she was guilty only of loving and supporting her husband 
the prosecution argued that even though its evidence was heavily 
circumstantial it proved that mrs marcos as a cabinet minister 
and mayor of manila knew the millions of dollars they invested was 
accumulated illegally 
the alleged offenses took place in the latter part of marcos 
two decades as philippines president marcos was deposed in 
february 1986 by a peoples revolution led by corazon aquino 
widow of a murdered marcos opponent she became philippine 
president as the marcoses fled to exile in hawaii 
the testimony was highlighted by witnesses accounts of mrs 
marcos shopping habits including spending sprees at 
bloomingdales and numerous new york jewelry stores witnesses also 
said she used close friends and a secretary to handle purchases and 
deliveries of large amounts of cash for her expenses 
the basic allegation of the racketeering charges was that mrs 
marcos violated us laws against wire fraud and the transfer of 
stolen money into the united states 
the racketeering charges also included underlying allegations 
that she defrauded american banks of millions of dollars in 
financing the new york properties and obstructed justice in a 
civil lawsuit brought by the aquino government to recover the 
buildings 
the mail fraud and obstruction of justice charges against mrs 
marcos and khashoggi stemmed from his alleged efforts to help the 
marcoses conceal their ownership of the new york buildings and some 
paintings after a court order in the philippine lawsuit froze the 
marcoses assets 
khashoggi is a financier and arms dealer who divides his time 
between homes in new york france saudi arabia and other locales 
he played a middleman role in the irancontra affair in which us 
arms were secretly sold to iran by officials of the reagan 
administration and the profits diverted to the usbacked contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
the properties at the heart of the case were three office 
buildings the crown building on fifth avenue 40 wall st and 200 
madison ave and a vertical shopping center called herald center 
the aquino governments claim on the real estate has not yet 
been decided because the civil lawsuit is pending 
the trial was clearly an ordeal for mrs marcos who wore black 
dresses to court every day in observance of mourning for her 
husband 
the trial was interrupted three times because mrs marcos fell 
ill with stressrelated ailments she was hospitalized for four 
days after collapsing in the courtroom with a stomach problem and 
was treated for high blood pressure

the hunt for the killer of an environmental 
activist is focusing on the bags in which his dismembered body was 
found authorities said monday 
james michael madden 24 of whitefish bay was last seen 
wednesday going door to door to enlist support for citizens for a 
better environment 
his remains minus the head and arms were found friday in two 
plastic bags they were identified through a tattoo sunday 
authorities said monday they had no motive 
the plastic bags were of a type environmentalists often oppose 
but investigators dont believe maddens killer was using them to 
make a political statement said deputy sheriff jim ivanoski 
i dont put a connection to that ivanoski said he was in 
the wrong place at the wrong time and he ran into a psycho thats 
what i think 
still ivanoski said the search for the killer was focusing on 
the two yellow industrially durable bags described as expensive 
and not readily available on the retail market 
officers were investigating who manufactures and distributes the 
bags as well as who buys and uses them ivanoski said 
the bags are one of the keys to our investigation he said 
maddens dismembered body was found in a field about three miles 
from the rural town of norway where he was last seen alive 
police were interviewing norway residents and said they 
received hundreds of calls offering information 
were still checking all of the area where the victim was last 
seen and we havent gotten any additional leads out of that 
ivanoski said 
racine county coroner john esayian conducted tests monday but 
said he remained unsure of the cause of death 
ivanoski said maddens remains may not be available for burial 
for at least two weeks theres a possibility we may not return 
the body until the crime is solved he said 
authorities refused to comment on how the body was dismembered 
madden who worked for citizens for a better environment for two 
months was soliciting donations alone when he disappeared said 
rosemary oliveira the groups administrative director 
he was reported missing when he failed to return to work 
this is a serious tragedy for all of us but on the other 
hand were continuing our work for the environment well carry 
him in our hearts ms oliveira said 
ms oliveira who said the organization wont return to racine 
until the killing is solved said environmentalists oppose the type 
of bag in which maddens body was found 
residents in the affluent milwaukee suburb where madden lived 
with his parents and brothers described him as civicminded and 
helpful

the body of an australian man who died 
after brain surgery was frozen and flown to the united states on 
monday in hopes he might one day be revived and cured a spokesman 
for a cryonic suspension society said 
the body of rocco schiavello 30 of melbourne arrived at the 
riverside facilities of the alcor life extension foundation said 
mike darwin alcors director of research 
he will be placed in longterm liquid nitrogen storage said 
darwin a member of the group that contends people can be frozen 
and later restored to life 
schiavello who died june 22 after surgery for a brain tumor 
had asked his family to have his body stored in cryonic suspension 
it took several days for alcor to make the necessary 
arrangements to transport the body said darwin 
alcor has attracted national attention with a couple of cases 
most scientists dismiss the foundations efforts as unrealistic 
preservation of a body costs approximately 100000 
one of those is that of a mathematician who wants to have his 
head frozen while still alive and then removed for frozen storage 
in another case the riverside county coroner investigated the 
freezing of an 82yearold womans body because the woman had died 
without a doctor being present 
the coroner had ruled the death was a homicide brought on by 
barbiturates but alcor said the drug was administered after death 
to preserve the head no charges have been filed

a jury on monday began deliberating the case of a 
christian science couple accused of involuntary manslaughter for 
using prayer instead of medicine to try to treat their sick 
2yearold son 
the jury in the suffolk county superior court trial of david and 
ginger twitchell both 34 began deliberations after closing 
arguments by defense attorney rikki klieman and special prosecutor 
john kiernan 
klieman said the case against his clients was one of 
speculation exaggeration and distortion 
kiernan said the twitchells must be held accountable for not 
seeking medical help for their son robyn who died in april 1986 
after a fiveday illness an autopsy showed he suffered from a 
bowel obstruction 
i dont suggest for a moment these parents intended to kill 
their child kiernan told jurors but they intentionally did 
things that caused his death 
klieman conceded that the twitchells made a mistake but said 
they didnt deserve to be convicted 
the jury hearing the case in the city that is home to the 
christian science churchs headquarters began deliberations late 
in the afternoon after instructions from judge sandra hamlin 
during closing arguments the defense and the prosecution 
returned to themes presented in two months of testimony by medical 
experts emergency personnel christian science practitioners and 
the twitchells former neighbors 
key issues have been the severity of robyns symptoms his time 
of death his parents actions in calling in christian science 
practitioners and whether their church allows medical treatment 
when prayer fails 
klieman made an emotional appeal to the jury to reject the 
notion that the twitchells were uncaring parents who callously 
treated robyns dead body like garbage 
she reiterated that witnesses who saw robyn from april 3 to 
april 7 said the boy was clearly sick but that his life did not 
appear to be threatened 
klieman disputed the prosecution claim that robyns bowel 
obstruction which was due to a birth defect could have been 
easily diagnosed and treated rather the bowel can twist and 
untwist making diagnosis difficult she said 
if it can fool a doctor it can fool any parent and it 
certainly can fool parents who rely on spiritual healing because it 
gets worse it gets better it gets worse it gets better 
klieman said 
kiernan said parents have a millenniumold obligation to protect 
their children 
what he termed the twitchells unabashed unbridled 
arrogance made the obviously suffering little boy a martyr to 
their belief that prayer alone could heal 
this little boy was sacrificed for his own parents 
intellectual purity he said 
describing robyn as moaning in pain kiernan gestured at the 
twitchells saying how could they sit there and not do anything 
how could they not call for a doctor 
as they have through much of the trial the twitchells sat still 
and held hands david twitchell had testified earlier his wife did 
not take the stand 
the twitchells now live in new york with their two other 
children

americans under age 30 know less about whats 
going on in the country and the world than any other generation in 
the past 50 years a new study shows 
twentyfive years ago 67 percent of people under age 35 said 
yes when asked if they had read a newspaper yesterday now 
only 24 percent say yes 
television newswatching has dropped too young people who said 
they watched the tv news yesterday fell from 52 percent in 1965 
to 41 percent this year 
the study said that from 1941 to 1975 young americans were on a 
par with their elders in public knowledge and in following most 
major news events closely but since 1975 young people have been 
less attentive and the trend is accelerating it said 
the information age has spawned an uninformed and 
uninvolved population the study said it was conducted by the 
times mirror center for the people and the press which is 
sponsored by the company that publishes the los angeles times and 
other newspapers the centers own polls and those of four other 
polling organizations taken over the years were analyzed 
even though the average 30yearold is more likely to use a 
computer to have attended college and even more likely to be 
reading a book than someone 20 years senior the younger generation 
knows less about the world the study said 
in the latest measurement 12000 random sample interviews 
conducted between may 1989 and last march were analyzed the number 
of young people who could correctly answer questions about current 
news was at its lowest level since pollsters started asking 
questions about familiarity with the news in the early 1940s the 
polls had a margin or error of plus or minus 2 percentage points 
the exceptions sports and the abortion issue there the young 
match their elders in news interest 
in 1989 25 percent of each group kept up with the world series 
41 percent of the young and 33 percent of people over 50 knew about 
the supreme courts most recent major abortion ruling 
but the survey reported younger americans are 20 percent less 
likely than those over 30 to know who won the recent election in 
nicaragua what happened to romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu or 
what the soviet unions role has been in the political upheavals of 
eastern europe 
the study said that in the 1940s a majority of people both 
those under and those over 30 could identify norman thomas the 
american socialist and in the 1960s twothirds of young people and 
59 percent over those over 50 could identify earl warren the chief 
justice of the united states from 1953 to 1969 
by contrast in a march 1990 survey less than a quarter of 
people under 30 and less than half of those over 50 could identify 
jim wright who resigned a year ago as speaker of the house of 
representatives or helmut kohl chancellor of west germany 
a newspaper editor william b ketter of the patriot ledger of 
quincy mass called the findings distressing 
i think it is symptomatic of our fastfood fastpaced society 
where they want everything instantly and dont want to concentrate 
on newspapers and apparently that even extends now to 
television said ketter he is chairman of the readership 
committee of the american society of newspaper editors which is 
seeking ways to make newspapers more attractive to readers 
i call it a dangerous camel under the tent because i think if 
our society becomes less informed about the events that go on in 
the world and at home it becomes less vigilant for the protections 
of the constitution and that could spell problems ketter said

a television news reporter began serving a 
sixmonth jail term june 27 for refusing to turn over the name of a 
confidential source to prosecutors and defense lawyers in a murder 
case 
i sure dont want to do six months in jail kmoltv reporter 
brian karem said before entering the bexar county jail but im 
going to keep my promise 
karem has defied three court orders to turn over his notes from 
a telephone interview last year with one of the two suspects jailed 
in the murder case 
both the prosecution and the defense contend they need to know 
who arranged the interview to prepare their cases karem has said 
the source fears for his life if his identity is revealed 
on june 26 the 5th us circuit court of appeals refused to 
issue a stay that would have allowed karem to remain free while he 
appeals the contempt citations the us supreme court refused to 
intervene on june 27 
kmol news director ron harig said the jailing was unnecessary 
the information contained in those notes could have been easily 
obtained by those attorneys and the agencies they represent he 
said we shouldnt be an investigating arm of law enforcement 
the jailing stems from an interview karem conducted last year 
with capital murder defendant henry david hernandez accused with 
his brother julian in the 1989 shooting death of police officer 
gary williams henry hernandez said during the interview that he 
shot the officer in selfdefense 
prosecution and defense attorneys say they have to know who 
arranged the interview so that they can determine whether it can be 
used in the trial under rules of evidence 
henry hernandez attorney does not want the interview admitted 
in the trial julian hernandez attorney does 
prosecutors want to know whether any law enforcement official 
was involved or whether any promises were made or extracted for 
arranging the conversation 
karem has been held in contempt by two state district judges 
most recently by state district judge pat priest in february he 
has been jailed three times in the case each time for a few hours 
before being released on bond 
after priests ruling karem and kmol took the case to federal 
court in midjune us district judge hf garcia ruled karem 
must surrender the notes the judge also said he would not extend 
the stay that has kept karem out of jail

a federal judge said june 25 he will order 
a reporter to spend six months in prison for refusing to reveal her 
source in a story detailing a policemans domestic problems 
us district judge edward cahn said he would impose the order 
on terry mutchler a former reporter of the morning call and now a 
writer for the associated press in harrisburg within 10 days 
cahn said he would suspend the sentence however while mutchler 
and the newspaper appeal to the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
the name of mutchlers source was sought by allentown officer 
kenneth scheetz jr and his wife rosann who have sued the 
newspaper mutchler and her source 
the scheetzes say a may 1989 story by ms mutchler and a 
followup article about a marital fracas put the couple in a false 
light and caused them emotional and mental distress 
without disputing the accuracy of the stories they contend she 
based her writing on a stolen police report apparently given to 
her by someone in the police department 
the scheetzes claim the article was designed to embarrass 
kenneth scheetz who had been named the 1988 officer of the 
year 
after the session ms mutchler said i gave my word that i 
would grant confidentiality to my source 
my reporting can only be as good as my word and im going to 
stand by it or in this case sit in the jail cell if thats 
what it takes 
the newspaper contends the story was written to illustrate the 
departments failure to thoroughly investigate domestic squabbles 
involving officers 
in this instance rosann scheetz twice sought sanctuary in 
police headquarters after being assaulted by her husband in their 
home according to the report

editors at high times magazine say they are 
bracing for a challenge to their first amendment rights a federal 
investigation into whether the publication is part of a drug

editor steve hager said june 25 that he and two other employees 
were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in new orleans usa 
today reported that federal prosecutors are investigating the drug 
conspiracy theory 
high times which distributes 250000 issues monthly plans to 
challenge the subpoena and hager said he did not plan to go or to 
provide the business records and other information that was 
requested 
if i do go down it will be to take the fifth amendment the 
bill of rights is being systematically dismantled in the name of 
the war on drugs he said 
im not exactly clear what it is theyre trying to do its 
basically just a big fishing expedition to try to put us out of 
business hager added 
john volz the us attorney in new orleans was in court and 
could not be immediately reached for comment 
hager said the magazine is outspoken in its support of a 
movement to legalize marijuana but advises people to stay away 
from hard drugs as well as tobacco and alcohol 
usa today said the drug enforcement administration in october 
searched businesses that advertised garden equipment in high times 
and arrested about 400 people for marijuana possession and other 
offenses 
high times subsequently lost twothirds of its advertising said 
hager 
this magazine would be bigger than playboy if it werent for 
government intervention he said

ruling southern baptist fundamentalists have 
ordered top editors of the baptist press the denominations news 
service to resign quietly or be dealt with harshly the 
editors said june 26 
the ultimatum came after two years of rising fundamentalist 
power and pressures on the service long considered the most open 
and objective denominational news operation in the country 
al shackleford the services director and target of the ouster 
order called it an attempt to control the right and 
responsibility of baptist church members to know what is happening 
in this denomination 
this is a violation of treasured baptist principles he said 
in a telephone interview from denominational headquarters in 
nashville tenn 
executive committee officers who are said to have ordered the 
ouster did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment 
reporters were tipped that both shackleford and news editor dan 
martin were told on june 19 that they were out after word of the 
ouster leaked martin issued a story confirming it the story said 
they would be given six months salary beyond sept 1 on condition 
that they kept silent 
theres no way we would try to put the cork in the volcano and 
attempt to stifle the news martin said it was fully engaged 
in the denominational rumor mill and when reporters called about 
it we responded 
what the action meant for the future of the nearly 
halfcenturyold baptist press remained unclear since shackleford 
and martin are the only two remaining staffers at its nashville 
base 
another nashville editor marv knox aware of a potential 
crackdown had resigned june 1 the service has five bureaus around 
the country and serves 400 outlets including 38 state baptist 
weeklies 
the services daily news report about religious affairs was 
widely recognized by journalism specialists as the most thorough 
and objective denominational news operation in the country 
however it has come under increasing fire from a fundamentalist 
wing that has achieved control of the 149millionmember

prosecution and the defense attorneys

the us supreme court has refused to reinstate 
the death penalty for the man convicted in the 1976 carbomb 
slaying of phoenix newspaper reporter don bolles 
arizona attorney general bob corbin said the june 28 ruling 
means that john harvey adamson still faces about 10 years in prison 
corbin said he was surprised by the decision which came one day 
after the court upheld the state death penalty law under which 
adamson had been sentenced 
the supreme court upheld the death penalty statute in arizona 
on wednesday so we figured that since adamson is coming up on the 
same issues theyd do the same thing corbin said 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1988 threw out 
adamsons death sentence after striking down a provision in arizona 
law that lets judges instead of juries choose between life and 
death for convicted murderers 
the appeals courts ruling called into doubt the validity of 
death penalty laws in idaho and montana which also allow for 
sentencing by judges but the arizona provision was declared 
constitutional by the supreme court in another state case 
prosecutors said adamson was paid 100000 to attach a bomb to 
the car of bolles who had investigated organized crime for the 
arizona republic in phoenix bolles died june 11 1976 nine days 
after his car exploded

a federal judge has ruled in favor of 
prison administrators who put an inmate writer in solitary 
confinement after he criticized the warden in print 
articles about matters within a prison can create a danger of 
violence or at least threats of violence and can weaken the 
staffs control of the prison said us district judge charles 
legge 
in the ruling june 26 legge said the us bureau of prisons 
security concerns justified regulations that prohibited inmates 
from acting as reporters from being paid for newspaper articles or 
from writing bylined articles for outside newspapers 
outside newspaper reporting by prisoners can cause rifts within 
a prison improperly focus attention on individual inmates create 
divided loyalties and turn the writer into a big wheel with 
disproportionate notoriety and influence legge said 
the ruling is not binding on other courts us attorney william 
mcgivern whose office defended the regulations said the 52page 
decision should be persuasive in future cases 
legge lifted his march 1989 order that prohibited enforcement of 
the regulations against dannie martin a convicted bank robber who 
has written more than 40 bylined essays on prison life and 
conditions for the san francisco chronicle since 1986 
martins articles from the federal prison in lompoc had been 
praised by the parole board and had not prompted any disciplinary 
action until june 1988 when he wrote a chronicle column describing 
tensions and warning of a possible riot because of restrictions 
imposed by new warden ah rison 
martin was charged with violating the regulations placed in 
solitary confinement for two days and then transferred twice 
ending up at a federal prison in phoenix legge said those actions 
were taken for martins own protection and for legitimate security 
concerns and were not attempts to punish him for criticizing rison

minority broadcasters said a june 27 supreme 
court decision upholding the federal communications commissions 
affirmative action rules will spur efforts to increase minority 
ownership of radio and tv stations 
james l winston executive director of the national association 
of blackowned broadcasters said the decision means the fccs 
ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward 
without fear of constitutional challenge 
while this still is not at the level we would like to see 
we are pleased that the ability of the fcc to utilize policies to 
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand 
before the fcc established the rules in 1978 blacks owned about 
30 radio stations and one television station according to the 
association now blacks own 182 radio stations and 17 television 
stations the group said wednesday 
that represents an increase from 1 percent to about 35 percent 
of the nations radio and tv stations the fcc said 
those numbers are likely to grow now that the legal 
uncertainties have been lifted from the rules broadcasters said 
eddie fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said the decision affirms the fccs ability to 
improve the underrepresentation of minorities in broadcast 
ownership 
the rules that were upheld award preference to minorities 
seeking broadcast licenses the fcc comparative licensing 
process also gives preference to competing applicants based on 
other factors such as whether prospective owners plan to operate 
the station female applicants also receive extra points but the 
court said it was not ruling on gender preference

confidence in president bushs war on cocaine is 
waning and concerns are on the rise about drug abuse in the 
nations neighborhoods a national survey has found 
nearly half the respondents in the media generalassociated 
press poll said drugs are a serious problem where they live that 
was up from 40 percent 10 months ago when bush announced his 
antidrug campaign 
many americans more than four in 10 of those under 45 years 
old continued to say they know a cocaine user while most 
believed the government can reduce drug abuse 55 percent expected 
the problem to worsen 
in september just after bush declared war on drugs 74 percent 
of americans believed the administration was making a serious 
effort to combat illegal drug use that confidence fell to 59

democrats say they see renewed signs of hope 
of winning the white house in 1992 largely because of the 
potential political travails facing the man who beat them so 
soundly in 1988 
moreover they now say the numbers of that crushing defeat are 
not really as bad as they appeared at first blush 
the party leaders wound up their weekend meeting in portland 
ore professing to be on a roll and eager to adopt a more 
aggressive stance against a republican president and party they 
maintain is being torn by festering internal strife a malady more 
often associated with democrats 
their next order of business is to select the site for their 
1992 convention party officials say it will be new york city

both liberals and conservatives can find 
decisions to cheer in the supreme courts 198990 term but there 
is little doubt the courts conservative majority is in control 
the past year has been a mixed one said steven shapiro of 
the american civil liberties union there were important 
victories most notably in the flag burning case and the two 
affirmative action decisions 
the court struck down a federal law that banned flag burning and 
upheld government policies helping blacks and other minorities 
seeking radio and television station licenses 
on the other hand shapiro said the courts decisions on 
abortion religion search and seizure have done serious damage

this is a town that is drowning in words 
swimming in information but parched for facts when decisions have 
to be made the decisionmakers in congress in the white house 
in the agencies of government afloat in data and analysis still 
yearn for the decisive fact that will tell them what to do 
would reducing the tax on capital gains give the economy a 
booster shot as president bush claims or merely deepen the 
deficit gap as his democratic opponents say 
if the house ways and means committee were to announce hearings 
on that question today the corridors would be crowded tomorrow 
with experts carrying briefcases loaded with facts to prove 
indisputably both sides of the argument 
predictive facts what would happen if are not the only kind 
that are hard to come by so are contemporary facts homelessness 
is a gnawing social problem high in the public consciousness the 
subject of strenuous government effort yet no one knows how many 
homeless people are out there or who they are or how long they 
have been homeless 
back in 1971 president richard nixon concerned by inflation 
took the unprecedented step of imposing peacetime wage and price 
controls on the economy overnight it became illegal to raise the 
price of a buick or a bagel it was a radical move for a republican 
president intended to stem inflation that he saw as threatening to 
the economy and his reelection prospects 
and yet says herbert j stein who was one of nixons economic 
advisers there was a lot of uncertainty about what the rate of 
inflation actually was inflation was and is measured in dozens 
of ways and no one can say which measurement most accurately 
reflects the rise in the price of goods and services 
thats not all says stein we still dont know what caused 
the depression in 1929 theres still disagreement over whether 
some international thing was moving the whole world or whether it 
was the way the monetary system was being managed 
its hard to get information on a lot of subjects he says 
take all the talk on the sampl business it is hard to find where 
all the estimates of losses which seem to change monthly come 
from we have very little information about what happened in the 
first place 
when president franklin d roosevelt died in 1945 and vice 
president harry s truman suddenly became president he learned 
about the secret work on the atomic bomb and one of the first 
decisions he had to make was whether to use it against japan 
fleet adm william d leahy chief of staff to roosevelt came 
to him truman recalls in his memoirs and in absolute certainty 
advised him not to use the bomb 
that is the biggest fool thing we have ever done he 
observed in his sturdy salty manner truman writes the bomb 
will never go off and i speak as an expert in explosives 
thats the trouble with experts of which this town is also 
full their opinions always parade as facts 
says charles schultze who played the same role for president 
jimmy carter that stein played for nixon there are zillions of 
facts the question is having all those facts what do you 
conclude 
if you ask me what a reduction in capital gains taxation would 
do to federal revenues i can get you two highly quantitative 
reports full of numbers one saying it will go up and one saying 
it will go down sometimes the facts come from people who want 
them to be true 
as long ago as 1931 charles evans hughes then chief justice 
reflected in a speech on the potency of facts 
said hughes an unscrupulous administrator might be tempted to 
say let me find the facts for the people of my country and i 
care little who lays down the general principles 
says jim jaffe a savvy aide on capitol hill since 1976 look 
at whats happening behind what we used to call the iron curtain 
you can say one of two things you can say the reagan plan of 
spending like a madman figure theyd run out of money before we 
would has been wildly successful or you can say the communist 
world was deteriorating anyhow and look at all the domestic 
concerns we ignored while we were wasting all this money on 
missiles we had no need for its an intellectual game its 
not a factual game 
there are lots of facts in washington but judgment is always 
scarce thats a fact

today is saturday july 14 the 195th day of 1990 there are 170 
days left in the year 
todays highlight in history 
on july 14 1789 the french revolution was in full swing as 
citizens of paris stormed the bastille prison and released the 
seven prisoners inside 
on this date 
in 1798 congress passed the sedition act making it a federal 
crime to publish false scandalous or malicious writing about the 
united states government 
in 1853 commodore matthew perry relayed to japanese officials a 
letter from former president fillmore requesting trade relations 
in 1881 outlaw william h bonney jr alias billy the kid was 
shot and killed by sheriff pat garrett in fort sumner nm

treasonous espionage and antisoviet agitation and sentenced to 13 
years at hard labor shcharansky was released in 1986 
in 1983 two members of congress illinois republican daniel 
crane and massachusetts democrat gerry studds admitted having 
sexual relations with congressional pages and were later censured 
by the full house 
ten years ago the republican national convention opened in

five years ago doctors at bethesda naval hospital said 
president reagan was making a spectacular recovery from major 
abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal growth that proved to be 
cancerous 
one year ago leaders of the seven richest nations opened a 
summit in paris which was also celebrating the bicentennial of the

there is something slightly strange about 
sitting in a darkened ballroom for three days watching television 
with about 1000 cbs representatives 
for one thing the hype is overwhelming the sound level is 
loud the speeches are a curious mixture of cheerleading and 
defensiveness 
welcome to the annual convention for the eye networks 
affiliated stations held last week at the century plaza the 
favorite hotel of former president ronald reagan 
like many conventions the cbs gathering was long on 
gladhanding and short on substance abc had its convention in the 
same spot two weeks before nbc held its convention infore going off to 
the mission mcclane does use his resourcefulness and it seems 
neverending just as the guy comes up for air he goes under again 
and comes back even stronger 
but where mcclane found himself in a crazed situation by 
accident in die hard hes superhero by choice in die hard 
2 this somehow makes it very different and lessens the 
sympathy or empathy we might have for him 
there are loads of laughs even when unintended by the 
filmmakers lots of raw macho action and a few surprises in this 
gordon companysilver pictures production and a lot of people 
probably wont want to fly again once they learn about the outer 
perimeter and that great parking lot in the sky 
produced by lawrence gordon joel silver and charles gordon 
die hard 2 is rated r for violence including an icicle 
impalement and language

the miller brothers jack harvey and arnold 
thought they ran their office supplies company with unusual 
efficiency until they came up against the biggest challenge of 
their lives 
in just a few years the multibillion dollar industrys 
historical arrangement of wholesalers and retailers was upset by 
the development of bigvolume lowprice retail superstores 
quill corporation which the millers had developed in 34 years 
to sales of 275 million making it perhaps the biggest 
businesstobusiness supplier of office supplies had to cut prices 
while improving service and efficiency 
it was an enormous and unexpected challenge to an industry 
accustomed to traditional ways of doing things 
we discovered unbelievable efficiencies said jack the 
president from his office in lincolnshire ill we thought we 
were rough and tough but we were just pussycats 
miller believes his is a message for independently owned 
businesses everywhere yes he says you too can raise sales and 
improve efficiency and service without resorting to largescale 
layoffs maybe even raise morale too 
the first step was to lower prices 18 percent and that forced 
us to say we had to be sharper than in the past he said it 
was a kick in the pants to profit margins we had to find savings 
from the smallest to largest 
here are a few of the smaller ones 
negotiating a new longterm contract with the primary 
longdistance telephone carrier a savings of about 32400 
annually quill is a direct mail supplier most of its business is 
done by mail fax and phone 
recycling scrap cardboard at an annual savings of about 7200 
conserving energy by replacing two 15watt incandescent bulbs 
in emergency signs with one 12watt fluorescent bulb savings 
1800 in the first year 3000 for the second year 
microfiching documents closer together annual savings 12000 
saving on benefits without reducing them since many 
medicalcare providers issue duplicate copies of bills quills 
benefits department stopped making copies for employees savings 
10000 a year in materials and labor 
encouraged by messages in the company newsletter in a special 
weekly bulletin and on a display outside the lunchroom to say 
nothing of their stake in the profitsharing plan employees 
cooperated 
the philosophy of efficiency spread workers asked 
themselveswhat is it i am doing nothing was too minor to 
recommend now that you think about it you too can turn old file 
folders inside out and relabel them 
you dont have to bribe workers says miller people want 
to do a good job 
major strategic ideas were implemented 
everyday low pricing was instituted sharply cutting the expense 
of frequent catalog changes whereas orders used to be shipped 
within eight to 32 hours a goal of no more than 24 hours was 
established 
while that immediately improved service on most orders it had 
additional beneficial consequences there was for example a quick 
dropoff in people calling to ask wheres my order thus saving 
time and labor 
whereas orders had been spotchecked for accuracy before 
shipment workers were added and the company went to 100 percent 
checking the savings were immediate in customer service freight 
and returned merchandise 
such efficiencies never would have been discovered or 
implemented had not the industry been turned upside down by the 
super stores or largevolume retail outlets that completely 
redefined pricing 
with profit margins permanently cut quill now must continue its 
policy of everyday efficiencies its fantastic to see the kind 
of efficiencies competitive pressures can generate says jack 
miller 
in short miller declares quill is a better business today for 
its management employees and customers no more work just to 
fill time he says 
while it is hardly pleasant to have competitors abruptly change 
old habits the initial shock is waning miller was heard recently 
saying its the best thing that ever happened to the industry

life at lenny ungs moshe dragon went from 
sweet to sour after the discovery of 18 suspicious ducks in the 
kosher chinese restaurant 
did the ducks conform with the ancient jewish dietary laws or 
were they treyfe hebrew for nonkosher abomination 
the ensuing dispute publicized in a series of investigative 
articles in the washington jewish week sent the washington areas 
orthodox jewish community into a frenzy and pushed ung toward 
financial ruin 
ung 29 an ethnic chinese escaped from vietnam and came to 
this country 14 years ago three years ago he was lured from 
philadelphia to washington by an investor who wanted the 30000 
orthodox jews in the washington area to have a fullservice kosher 
restaurant 
moshe dragon opened three years ago in the washington suburb of 
rockville md 
the food was kosher meaning it adhered to the ancient jewish 
principles that forbid mixing dairy and meat products and only 
allow meat from clovenhoofed animals who chew their cud pork is 
out as are shellfish and scavenger fish 
ung obtained the required certification from the rabbinical 
council of greater washington an eightmember monopoly that for 
some 80 years has been granting the kosher stamp of approval to 
area restaurants stores and caterers 
the rabbis hired michael mayer as moshe dragons mashgiach 
hebrew for supervisor things were going well mayer understood 
ung having served in vietnam during the war and he introduced him 
to the jewish community 
but last summer mayer found 18 ducks which he deemed nonkosher 
along with receipts from a nonkosher supplier nonkosher meat 
generally is less expensive than kosher meat 
mayer sealed the birds in the freezer as evidence and went to 
tell the rabbis 
tempers flared ung accused mayer of trying to destroy the 
restaurant and mayer was fired 
they did the classic roman thing they killed the 
messenger said mark palmer mayers lawyer 
concerned that moshe dragon might be harboring nonkosher food 
the rabbis destroyed the ducks just in case had they waited a 
simple lab analysis could have determined the ducks origins by 
their salt content to make meat kosher it must be soaked in salt 
water 
when the rabbis questioned ung he said the receipts belonged to 
his cousin but he later recanted became distraught and was taken 
to the hospital the rabbis said the questioning reminded him of 
interrogations in vietnam 
a private investigator was brought in and the rabbis 
subsequently cleared ung of all blame but the pi susan giller 
was unhappy 
the evidence i found was not consistent with the rabbis 
conclusion she said i dont want to be associated with those 
conclusions 
rabbi joel tessler a member of the rabbinical council said the 
rabbis stand by their finding that the restaurant complies with the 
kosher dietary laws ung he said is an honorable man 
meanwhile critics of the rabbinical council called for a law 
granting the state enforcement power over the implementation of 
kosher standards and mayers lawyer asked the maryland attorney 
general to investigate whether moshe dragon violated the states 
consumer protection act 
business declined as customers began doubting the restaurants 
standards after reading about the dispute in washington jewish 
week matters werent helped when regardies a local business 
magazine published a piece of its own about moshe dragon complete 
with lab analyses of the moo shu pancakes 
regardies reported that lab tests found traces of whey in the 
pancakes a nono when the pancakes are filled with meat the 
rabbis responded with their own lab tests saying those did not 
find any of the offending whey in two pancakes and only minute 
traces in a third 
enter mordechai kohler the orthodox food supervisor who 
replaced mayer 
one day kohler was incensed when a chinese cook used a spoon 
reserved for meat to ladle spices onto a fish also a nono 
kohler ended up quitting 
in an interview with jewish week kohler said he was uneasy 
about the practices at moshe dragon including the presence of a 
buddha statue in the kitchen he said workers some of them devout 
buddhists dedicated food to the buddha 
ung admits there was a buddha figurine on top of a refrigerator 
but he denied any sacrifices were made 
the only sacrifice he says was his own 
i tried to follow what the council said ung lamented in 
broken english i want to do the right thing for the community 
my father teach me to do the right thing not to cheat not to 
steal 
but ung said he lost more than 30000 and couldnt take the 
aggravation 
he is selling moshe dragon and plans to become an acupuncturist 
maybe that is less pain he said

editors note the dangerous legacy of 45 years of building 
atomic bombs is contaminated nuclear graveyards that will cost 
billions of dollars to clean up if indeed scientists can figure 
out a way to clean them up one researcher even says that trying to 
get rid of the radioactive wastes would cost more lives than 
leaving them alone

miles of 8foothigh electric fences 
stretch through bethel valley the oncesecret cradle of the atomic 
age they stand watch over burial grounds of deadly wastes that are 
the legacy of four decades of nuclear bomb production 
yellow and magenta signs proclaim radiation hazard keep 
out 
the fences encircling some of the hundreds of acres of 
contaminated land on the federal oak ridge nuclear weapons compound 
are reminders that while the cold war may be over it took a 
serious toll 
it cost about 250 billion for the roughly 65000 nuclear 
weapons that the united states has manufactured since 1945 when 
the first was assembled that bill is paid yet to be settled is 
the toll this secretive manufacturing process has taken on weapons 
workers and the environment 
at oak ridge alone the energy department has spent 1 billion 
since 1983 trying to control the environmental damage it is 
expected to take at least 10 more years just to determine what 
poisons have seeped into the soil and ground water here and 20 
more years to stop it from spreading 
the total bill for cleaning up oak ridge may top 12 billion 
costs at some of the 16 other active nuclear arms laboratories 
manufacturing plants and proving grounds in 11 other states will be 
much higher 
the full cost of environmental repairs alone may top 100 
billion estimates vary greatly because the government itself 
doesnt know how badly some sites are contaminated nor has all the 
necessary technology been developed 
in the meantime tennessee health authorities ban fishing and 
swimming in east fork poplar creek which winds through the 
56000acre weapons plant as well as the adjacent city of oak 
ridge and in a portion of the clinch river which borders the 
plant on three sides the stream is poisoned by mercury once used 
to separate lithium for nuclear weapons 
oak ridge originally called the clinton engineer works was the 
site of the first nuclear bomb production plants codenamed y12 
x10 and k25 today it remains a key link in the production chain 
although some of its operations have been closed permanently 
martin marietta energy systems inc which runs oak ridge under 
a government contract says 75 tons of toxic mercury and 
substantial amounts of the radioactive element cesium137 have 
spread from the weapons plant and contaminated the sediment in 
watts bar reservoir which remains open to the public for swimming 
and boating 
not only did the atomic age start here the problems did 
too says bill adams the energy departments chief of waste and 
environmental management at oak ridge 
unfortunately the problems dont end here 
the radioactive and toxic contamination is so bad at several 
nuclear weapons plants in colorado ohio tennessee south 
carolina california missouri and washington state that portions 
of these huge sites will become national sacrifice zones 
scientists say land deemed permanently unfit for human use 
we have one hell of a legacy to clean up says leo duffy 
the top adviser to energy secretary james d watkins on longterm 
environmental issues 
the question is how to get the money congress and the bush 
administration are under pressure to cut the budget deficit even as 
defense spending slows in response to moves toward democracy in 
eastern europe and the soviet union 
in the emerging national debate over the size of a peace 
dividend from expected military savings and how to spend it 
little has been said about the mortgage the atomic bomb 
builders took out to compete in the arms race 
during the world war ii development of the first atomic bombs in 
the armys secret manhattan project any thoughts of environmental 
or excessive health risks were subsumed by a feeling that the very 
survival of democracy depended on getting the bomb as quickly as 
possible 
later through the cold war period military authorities used 
the shield of strict secrecy justified on national security 
grounds to continue borrowing against the environment and 
workers health to speed up bomb production according to 
interviews with current and former arms plant workers government 
officials scientists and congressional investigators 
now payment is coming due 
officials who have surveyed the dozens of existing and former 
nuclear weapons sites around the country say hundreds of billions 
of dollars are needed not only to control environmental damage but 
also to reduce the health risks of nuclear plant workers and to 
make safety improvements long put off 
until the mid1980s the government would not acknowledge these 
failures 
nobody wants to look under the rug and a lot has been swept 
under the rug in the nuclear weapons industry says elizabeth 
paul of the snake river alliance based in ketchum idaho the 
citizens group opposes the idaho national engineering laboratory 
which recovers highly enriched uranium from naval reactors 
even an investment of 100 billion in environmental corrections 
wont completely reverse the damage 
the chief problems are contamination of the soil and ground 
water on the federal sites and in surrounding areas with 
radioactive materials such as plutonium tritium and strontium90 
and such toxics as mercury arsenic and a variety of solvents 
plutonium is so potent that lethal lung doses are measured in 
the billionths of a gram 
the burial grounds and some other parts of oak ridge as 
well as large sections of the hanford weapons plant near richland 
wash the savannah river plant near aiken sc and portions of 
other sites from coast to coast wont be fit for human use for 
hundreds perhaps thousands of years 
therell be hot spots that will never have any other use 
except for disposal of hazardous and radioactive waste says vic 
rezendes director of energy issues at the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress

the cost to human health is harder to assess 
the government has never acknowledged any human health damage 
caused by emissions from its plants or by radiation releases from 
atomic bomb tests in the desert southwest but increasing numbers 
of americans are going to court seeking compensation on grounds 
that chronic exposure to radiation caused illness and death even 
at levels the government considers safe 
bruce h deboskey a denver lawyer for some workers at the rocky 
flats plutonium processing plant says relatives of workers who 
died of cancer feel cheated by the federal government 
the widows of these workers who gave their lives to build 
these bombs are deeply embittered deboskey says theres a 
human tragedy here 
also at risk were thousands of uranium miners who dug out the

of the estimated 15000 men who worked the mines about 450 have

congress is now trying to make some amends in june the house 
passed a bill to establish a 100 million trust to compensate 
families of miners with radiationinduced illness as well as 
certain cancer victims in nevada utah and arizona who were exposed 
to fallout from aboveground nuclear testing from 1951 to 1962 the 
senate is expected to approve the bill president bush opposes it 
scientists have not yet determined conclusively whether 
accidental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons plants 
are a health threat nor are they yet sure of the risk posed by 
chronic exposure of workers to low levels of radiation 
until the mid1980s these issues were secondary production was 
king secrecy its serf 
things having to do with atomic weapons are born secret 
says j carson mark who spent 27 years designing nuclear weapons 
at los alamos national laboratory in new mexico and is now retired 
clyde hopkins remembers the mindset in the early 1950s when he 
was a production control worker at the oak ridge y12 plant which 
used tons of mercury to separate lithium for use as a fuel source 
in thermonuclear warheads 
the pressure was intense to come up with weapons components on 
a shortterm basis he says people back in those days didnt 
even think about the environment they thought about getting the 
doggone work out to support the countrys nuclear stockpile 
i can remember days when people were walking around with lots 
of mercury on the floor you kept operating because you wanted that 
product to come out so the emphasis then was on production the 
thought that we had mercury leaking on the floor obviously working 
its way down through the concrete into the ground it wasnt 
thought about back then 
hopkins thinks about it a lot now he is president of martin 
marietta energy systems which is locked in negotiations with the 
energy department over its financial and legal liability for 
failing to meet state and federal environmental laws 
oak ridge was not alone in its approach to meeting bomb 
production schedules 
cleve anderson recalls fighting against a productionfirst 
mentality while he headed a committee studying longrange waste 
management at hanford in the late 1950s hanford was the main 
producer of plutonium the most lethal element known for use in 
nuclear bombs although today its nine reactors are shut down 
at hanford we had been indoctrinated thoroughly that the 
nations survival depended on what we were doing that nothing was 
more important to national security than getting ever more 
plutonium anything else that might interfere was secondary he 
said 
in a classified report written in december 1958 for general 
electric co which was running hanford under a government 
contract anderson urged that more money be spent to develop safer 
disposal methods for radioactive wastes he wrote the 
probability of the superiority of alternate methods of waste 
disposal has long been recognized but the pressing problems of 
weapons production precluded any but the most cursory 
examinations of these alternatives 
he said his report was shelved years later he had to file a 
request under the freedom of information act to obtain a copy 
today hanford is considered the most extensively contaminated 
piece of land in the united states perhaps in the world 
the governments own advisers were sounding the alarm on nuclear 
waste as early as 1955 in that year the national academy of 
sciences formed a committee to advise the atomic energy commission 
on waste disposal 
the committee concluded in late 1955 that dumping radioactive 
wastes directly into the ground probably involves unacceptable 
longterm risks to the environment yet such practices continued 
for more three decades 
hopkins the martin marietta manager at oak ridge says id 
be surprised if officials there were told prior to the 1980s that 
dumping wastes directly into the ground carried the risk of serious 
environmental damage 
if they had i dont think wed have done it he said 
regardless of the reasons the hazards posed by huge 
accumulations of nuclear wastes now represent a technological 
challenge for america unlike any it has faced since the dawn of the 
atomic age 
weve scratched the surface says duffy the energy 
department waste czar we know the problems we dont know the 
solutions 
one of the least understood problems is how much of the nuclear 
graveyards can be excavated or treated without putting workers at 
unacceptable risk 
frank l parker who headed oak ridge national laboratorys 
radioactive waste management research in the late 1950s and early 
1960s and now teaches environmental engineering at vanderbilt 
university in nashville tenn says the country will have to 
accept that some nuclear wastes are too dangerous to remove 
the number of deaths youre going to incur to clean it up will 
dwarf the number who would be killed if you left it alone he 
says

oak ridge tenn ap for more than 30 years the national 
academy of sciences has been sounding warnings about the handling 
of radioactive materials at the nations nuclear weapons facilities 
a report to the government in 1958 cited the academys 
continuing concern about the disposal of intermediate and 
lowlevel waste liquids in seepage pits at oak ridge national 
laboratory because they contaminate the environment 
for several years the academy urged the government to crack down 
on the waste management problems of the private companies that run 
all the weapons plants 
in a 1966 report summarizing 11 years of recommendations on this 
issue the national academy said it had become commonplace for the 
plant operators to use the cheapest methods of waste disposal even 
though these carried large environmental risks 
such methods represent a concept of easy disposal that has had 
and will continue to have great appeal to operators but we fear 
that continuation of the practices eventually will create hazards 
that will be extremely difficult and expensive to eliminate the 
report said 
any compromise with safety for the sake of economy could lead 
in the long run to mushrooming of waste disposal into the most 
costly item in the use of nuclear power 
as with most weapons plant documentation from that period the 
national academy reports were not made public at the time they were 
submitted to the atomic energy commission a predecessor agency to 
the presentday energy department

oak ridge tenn ap the full cost of 45 years of nuclear 
bomb production wont be known for decades but already in subtle 
ways the social toll can be seen 
along quiet bethel valley road inside the boundaries of the oak 
ridge nuclear weapons compound stands the oneroom woodframe new 
bethel baptist church 
behind the boardedup building is a stone monument nearly as 
tall as the church roof with an engraving that reads erected in 
memory of new bethel baptist church 
opened 1851 closed 1942 it reads adding for explanation 
that the sermons stopped when the government took over bethel 
valley and thousands of acres around it to build parts and 
materials for the atomic bombs used in world war ii 
the weapons plants are still here so is the church if only as 
a whitewashed reminder of times past times when the tiny towns of 
wheat robertsville elza and scarboro had their own churches 
their own stores their own school their own tobacco and corn 
farmers their own histories their own hopes for the future times 
before the bomb builders wiped them off the map 
the new bethel baptist church has been spared but today it 
stands empty and alone except for piles of trash visible inside 
through its few unboarded windows and several dozen gravestones in 
a grassy cemetery at the back of the church grounds 
two signs are nailed to a cedar tree beside the church one 
white and wooden says simply new bethel followed by the sign 
of the cross below it a red metal sign of an obviously newer 
vintage says area closed to hunters

editors note the 40000 indians living on reservations in 
upstate new york are clinging to their traditional culture despite 
the encroachment of modern civilization but conflict with the 
white mans world sometimes erupts in violence and gunfire as 
evidenced by the recent shooting down of a national guard 
helicopter

centuries after the 
legendary hiawatha paddled the waters of onondaga lake with the 
great peacemaker to unite warring indian tribes the six nations of 
the iroquois confederacy endures 
onondaga lake is now so polluted by industrial effluent that the 
fish are inedible and the shoreline is dominated by the modern 
skyline of the city of syracuse yet just a few miles away chief 
leon shenandoah presides over confederacy meetings in the 
traditional longhouse and performs religious ceremonies dating back 
to hiawathas time 
the observances symbolize the dogged manner in which the tribes 
of the iroquois have kept their culture alive despite the 
encroachment of modern civilization 
we still have our own way of life our own government 
shenandoah says we didnt change much im still doing my 
ceremonies 
the confederacy is a nation within a nation issuing its own 
passports operating gambling casinos in a state where they are 
illegal taking advantage of tax breaks to profit in the sale of 
such things as cigarettes and gasoline 
some iroquois have withdrawn into armed enclaves to escape the 
white mans culture others have embraced it and still others have 
found a way to prosper while retaining their distinctive way of 
life 
what is remarkable about the iroquois is that they have 
survived as a coherent culture so long after coming into contact 
with us says jan wojcik humanities professor at clarkson 
university in potsdam ny eightyfive percent of the indian 
cultures are gone there are very few left the iroquois are very 
strong very healthy 
wojcik says in fact that the mohawks on the st regis indian 
reservation in northern new york are very prosperous compared 
with indians on most other reservations in the country 
they have jobs there are good houses people drive cars 
wojcik says they are almost indistinguishable from the 
middleclass mainstream 
there are about 40000 indians living throughout upstate new 
york about eight times as many as when henry hudson sailed the 
half moon up the hudson river nearly 400 years ago 
that journey signaled the start of centuries of uneasy relations 
between indians and white men in upstate new york 
the iroquois confederacy was founded between 500 and 1000 years 
ago to prevent bloody conflicts among the senecas mohawks 
cayugas onondagas and oneidas the tuscaroras joined the 
confederacy later when they were driven out of north carolina 
the influence of the iroquois waned when the confederacy sided 
with the british in the revolutionary war under a confused and 
still disputed patchwork of treaties in the late 1700s the tribes 
of the iroquois were relegated to reservations as waves of 
nonindian immigrants settled across upstate new york 
legal title to those lands and whether the reservations embody 
sovereign nations are issues that continue to plague the iroquois 
relations with the state and federal governments theyre also the 
basis of bloody conflicts among tribal members themselves 
on may 1 two mohawks were killed when a dispute over casino 
gambling on the st regis indian reservation along the new 
yorkcanadian border turned into a fierce gun battle between 
proand antigambling factions 
new york and canadian police are still manning armed roadblocks 
on the reservation to prevent further bloodshed 
earlier this year a doctor was wounded when a vermont national 
guard helicopter was brought down by gunfire while flying over the 
ganienkeh indian territory in northern new york that prompted a 
tense standoff between heavily armed militant mohawks and state 
troopers with indians vowing to die for their cause 
the iroquois insist on being treated as an independent nation 
going so far as issuing passports that are recognized by such 
countries as the united states canada and great britain 
yet most police officials believe they have responsibility to 
maintain order on new york reservations and to investigate reports 
of felonies at the same time they know they risk a violent 
reaction by ordering officers onto indian land 
during the standoffs at the ganienkeh indian territory powerful 
automatic weapons were brandished by defiant mohawks who said they 
were ready to take on troopers no arrests have been made in the 
downing of the helicopter 
county sheriffs deputies will not enter the onondaga indian 
reservation without permission of the chiefs even when they are 
pursuing a murder suspect 
sovereignty has its economic advantages indians are exempt from 
state and federal taxes and indian entrepreneurs have made a 
booming business of selling cigarettes and gasoline to outsiders 
who come to the reservation to evade taxes by making the trip to a 
reservation a person can save approximately 3 on each carton of 
cigarettes and 14 cents on each gallon of gasoline

and claiming sovereign exemption from outside laws against 
gambling the oneidas and mohawks have established lucrative 
casinos and bingo parlors on their reservations with tour bus 
service to transport customers in from neighboring cities 
the st regis casinos were particularly popular with canadian 
gamblers 
new york officials insist that some of the gambling is illegal 
and they estimate that the state loses up to 20 million a year in 
taxes due to the indian entrepreneurs 
the word tax is not in our seneca language dennis lay 
president of the seneca indian nation recently argued before state 
lawmakers in albany it is interpreted as being detrimental to 
our survival as a sovereign nation let the seneca nation govern 
ourselves without a taxing scheme created by your government 
lays tribe won a major victory this spring when the city of 
salamanca agreed to a new 80year lease that calls for payments of 
at least 800000 a year to the tribe the agreement includes a 
onetime grant of 60 million to the senecas to make up for past 
injustices against the tribe 
one of the reasons the iroquois have endured so well is by 
taking advantage of economic opportunities says clarkson 
universitys wojcik 
the iroquois especially the mohawks have earned a reputation 
in the highpaying high steel work on new york city 
skyscrapers the indians who display great balance agility and an 
apparent fearlessness of heights often share small apartments in 
new york city during the week and travel back to their upstate 
reservations on weekends 
iroquois life is full of other seeming contradictions between 
the traditional indian culture and modern america when the 
militant mohawks at ganienkeh were manning their barricades they 
issued statements to the media via a fax machine harold tarbell a 
traditionalist chief at st regis wears his hair in a traditional 
braid while sporting pleated pants and pierre cardin sunglasses 
despite outside pressures shenandoah who has been the iroquois 
chief of chiefs for two decades insists the traditional indian way 
of life is strong 
tom porter a mohawk chief at st regis says i think 
practically every mohawk to some degree follows the traditional 
way 
shenandoah is suspicious of white society and governments 
staunchly refusing to accept governmental aid that was not part of 
a treaty 
we accept nothing from the government he says no one 
from the state has any input here 
the longhouse continues to exert a strong influence over the 
iroquois says shenandoah gesturing toward the three churches on 
the onondaga reservation 
you can put all three churches together and well put more 
people in the longhouse shenandoah says 
were not pagan we dont idolize things in our way of life 
the government is the one that idolizes money the creator did not 
create money so we dont pray for money 
the land the iroquois control directly has been whittled away 
since the revolution 
the onondagas mohawks senecas tuscaroras and oneidas live on 
reservations scattered around upstate new york where their 
languages are taught to children in indian schools 
the cayugas have no land and have gone to court to reclaim 
property they claim was illegally deeded to the state 180 years ago 
without the necessary approval of congress 
the reason were fighting for land is so we can save our 
culture says cayuga chief frank bonamie we do not have a 
school so we miss out on teaching our children 
the oneidas are down to a 32acre plot in the city of oneida and 
have also gone to court seeking more land the mohawks also have 
land claims pending 
to this day the state of new york dutifully delivers 150 
bushels of salt annually to the onondagas to honor provisions of 
two treaties dating back to 1795 that turned onondaga land into 
what is now syracuse shenandoah does not recognize the salt 
payment 
chief bonamie believes the iroquois culture will endure 
when you sit at the grand council and look around and think 
this has been going on for hundreds of years there is a lot of 
power in that room he says it is an exciting time to be at a 
grand council meeting and feel the strength and power in that 
room 
it might have its ups and downs but i think it will endure 
forever

such american 
constitutional concepts as freedom of speech and representational 
government were derived from the iroquois confederacys great law 
some scholars say 
the ancient great law of peace that preceded the us 
constitution by centuries was based on strength through union it 
enunciated such concepts as individual rights as well as checks and 
balances among the various branches of government 
they copied our form of government says onondaga chief leon 
shenandoah who has been the chief of chiefs of the six nations of 
the iroquois confederacy for more than two decades 
according to the oral history of the indians the iroquois 
confederacy was founded 500 to 1000 years ago when the great 
peacemaker and the legendary hiawatha persuaded the senecas 
mohawks cayugas onondagas and oneidas to stop their warring and 
form a union the tuscaroras joined the confederacy later when they 
were driven out of north carolina 
the confederacy survives with the distinction of being the 
oldest league of nations in the world confederacy chiefs still 
gather at the longhouse on the onondaga reservation near syracuse 
ny to interpret the great law 
one of the strongest proponents of the theory of the iroquois 
influence on the us constitution is donald grinde a professor of 
american indian history at the university of california at 
riverside 
benjamin franklin john quincy adams thomas jefferson and james 
madison were some of the founding fathers who were known to discuss 
the iroquois system while they were formulating the us 
constitution grinde says 
the founding fathers for a generation or more before the 
american revolution looked at the iroquois confederacy as an 
alternative to the british model says grinde who has written 
two books on the subject 
they were definitely talking about it 
not all historians agree 
the evidence is flimsy at best says jan wojcik humanities 
professor at clarkson university in potsdam ny wojcik says the 
claim is based on hearsay 
supposedly benjamin franklin listened to them give a 
description of their confederacy before the constitutional 
convention he says in fact he was contemptuous of the 
iroquois and referred to them as savages i dont really think 
there is any direct link that is traceable 
to prove his point grinde cites a book john quincy adams wrote 
a month before the constitutional convention in philadelphia urging 
consideration of the indian government 
their separation of powers is marked with a precision that 
excludes all controversy adams wrote at the time 
in 1776 more than two dozen iroquois chiefs participated in the 
debates over the declaration of independence at the invitation of 
the continental congress the historian said 
the framers referred to the iroquois and the confederacy in 
their debates to create the articles of confederation which 
preceded the constitution grinde says 
its all in the records of the constitutional congress and in 
the correspondence of the delegates grinde says its just 
been ignored but indians especially the iroquois played a key 
role in the constitutional process 
the iroquois also provided the framers of the constitution with 
a model for linking separate governments across a great 
geographical expanse something the european governments did not 
do grinde says 
for centuries the iroquois dominated much of what is now 
upstate new york ironically most of the iroquois sided with the 
british and the confederacy lost much of its power after the 
revolution

editors note for decades she labored in obscurity writing 
the poems that no one would publish now at an age when most people 
are considering retiring amy clampitt has begun to attract 
attention in the literary world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the early 1980s a new york bookstore 
sympathetic to struggling writers returned four of the five copies 
of amy clampitts selfpublished poems she had asked the store to 
try to sell the only one that was sold was bought by a friend of 
hers 
but by the beginning of this year she had four collections 
published by a large publishing house and her work was being 
likened in significance to lowell stevens and plath one specialty 
publisher is now even producing a handmade volume of some of her 
work that will cost 700 per book 
at age 70 amy clampitt is enjoying success rarely visited upon 
american poets 
she first attracted attention with the 1983 publication of the 
kingfisher which unleashed to use a phrase from one of her 
poems a shower of bloom the praise has largely continued 
through three more volumes most recently westward 
all i can tell you is that it wasnt any cinch clampitt 
says 
for decades she wrote in the deep obscurity of a new york 
artists life even as the popular appeal of poetry seemed on a 
death spiral especially the sometimes demanding verse critics 
call it allusive that she writes 
clampitt must have hardly seemed up to such hardscrabble work 
when she left the farm in new providence iowa a town of 200 
people in the heart of the heartland she was a nervous elfin kid 
who had a phi beta kappa key from grinnell college but had not 
been enough of a hand around the farm even to have milked a single 
cow 
i wasnt very muscular or inclined to do strenuous things 
she concedes 
but she learned how to fetch a phrase she learned mostly from 
her grandfather a lover of reading and nature who once awakened 
one of his children and carried her into the night to point out the 
sound of a whippoorwill 
clampitts poetry is alive with such pastoral sights and sounds 
the cheekily anarchic dartings and flashings of birds the 
vaporous fripperies of clouds of bog laurel and lambkill 
the blurred flute note of a warbler they all come out in 
torques in curdlings cadenzas by the earful 
even when the reader is wading through seaweedclodded 
polyphloisboio thalasses or trying to see chiasmus through the 
lookingglass her wordplay is resonant musical 
over the years as her splendid words went unnoticed she 
sustained herself with a few attempts at traditional work 
including a brief stint as an assistant librarian at the audubon 
society in new york but she worked mainly as a freelance editor 
by the 1970s she was reconciling herself to never being widely 
read but she kept writing 
then in 1978 the new yorker one of the magazines which had 
been rejecting me for years took a long look and decided to 
publish some of her work she had found a kindred spirit in poetry 
editor howard moss 
he knew what a sundew is she says recalling with a fresh 
giggle one of their early conversations about her writing 
after the new yorker many of the other important magazines 
followed when the kingfisher came out the little world of 
american poetry was stunned by the thrill of the achievement of 
the thing 
clampitt meanwhile suffered the letdown that comes after 
publication of a first major work she also suffered from all the 
attention 
this kind of fame is limited to a little circle but it is 
very different says clampitt who was in cambridge for a reading 
of her poems i thought i was going to be a person who spent her 
life in obscurity and then this came it jolted me i wasnt ready 
to have people know about me 
then when the windfall of attention had subsided somewhat the 
gainsayers who had been crouching in discontent emerged and it 
hurt 
the comeuppance came mainly by way of three poetry magazine 
contributors she calls them aspiring critics who took issue 
with her dense language and literary allusions 
they were all women she says i guess some of them just 
dont allow for throwbacks like me 
some of the criticism was wellreasoned for at times clampitt 
can be excessive in her reference to other texts or in her 
language ie her preference for classical traditions over the 
sparse style so much in vogue 
but oh some of the things they said 
clampitt is not a poet of emotional depth 
it would be better for amy clampitt if at least for a 
while she tucked her notes from poetry 101 away in a trunk 
all her prosodies tend to cacophony sic 
clampitt can be vague but her work is more likely to sparkle 
with the bright particulars she has enjoyed in her long romance 
with the language she can be quick in her borrowings from other 
writers but she is also a jewel thief who can pick the pockets of 
hopkins or wordsworth when they have just what she needs she is 
stylistically somewhat outdated but refreshingly so 
her poems already are finding their way into anthologies and 
many critics are talking as if her work will last 
helen vendler harvard professor and poetry critic of the new 
yorker says in her recent book on poetry the music of what 
happens that clampitts poetry will endure because of her rare 
voice and because it will take on as well the documentary value 
of what in the 20th century made up the stuff of culture 
because she was discovered so late in life most of her close 
friends are much younger poets also just emerging she is a little 
cowed in the company of the established writers of her generation 
clampitt has been a visiting writer and lecturer at several 
colleges and is now working on more poems occasional reviews and 
on a play about dorothy wordsworth 
her latest volume westward has not received as much 
attention as her earlier works but it offers sensual delights and 
is accessible to even the most casual reader 
turn to the prairie a long poem in westward for the 
spirit that imbued her from this story of her family and the 
uncertainty and hard history of working the plains she exacts a 
rugged solemn beauty 
hard work hard work it calls out 
she answered the call and still she wonders if her grandfather 
would approve of her journey eastward 
i feel a halfway need to justify to whisper please dont 
disapprove dont think me frivolous

their sleek and sensual beauty captivated

egypt gave one to france and got a clock in return england 
shipped one to london to celebrate a victory over napoleon new 
yorkers spirited one away to central park 
but wherever it stands today pity the poor obelisk its magic 
is shrinking 
once king of the horizon its fighting a losing battle in a 
world of highrise skyscrapers 
even in egypt their home the few remaining obelisks are 
overshadowed by almost every other kind of monument tombs 
columns pyramids statues in cairo a tower built in 1962 for a 
revolving restaurant that doesnt revolve gets more attention than 
the 3250yearold gezira obelisk at its base 
new york citys obelisk the oldest skyscraper in a city of 
skyscrapers is a midget by todays standards 
erected with much fanfare in central park on feb 22 1881 it 
was the last obelisk to leave egypt but ravaged by the citys 
corrosive fumes it has suffered more from contact with the modern 
world than any of the others 
in ancient times obelisks were in such demand as trophies of 
triumph that roman emperors hauled away at least 13 to grace public 
places in rome city of obelisks fifteen hundred years ago 
the emperor theodosius erected an obelisk in the new byzantine 
capital constantinople todays istanbul 
paris london and new york went shopping for their obelisks only 
last century 
why obelisks nobody even knows what they are 
in his definitive work the obelisks of egypt the late 
archaeologist labib habachi egypts greatest authority defined an 
obelisk as a foursided single piece of stone standing upright 
gradually tapering as it rises and terminating in a small pyramid 
called a pyramidion 
they were sacred he wrote carved from granite basalt or 
quartzite and decorated with hieroglyphs

sheikholeslami says obelisks are among the leastunderstood relics 
of ancient egypt 
they became one of the most characteristic and unique egyptian 
symbols sheikholeslami says but we dont know for certain 
what they were for 
in ancient times obelisks at least their pyramidions may 
have been covered with gold or electrum an alloy of gold and 
silver reflecting the suns rays they would have been dazzling 
some people believe their stone shafts contain the origins of 
life obelisk magic secret societies such as the knights templar 
of the crusades and the freemasons linked obelisks with mysticism 
america chose the obelisk style as the monument to honor george 
washington a freemason 
architect robert mills designed the washington monument with an 
elaborate and expensive circular colonnade serving as the obelisks 
base government infighting over money continued for decades 
finally only the obelisk was left 
but building a real obelisk was an impossible dream as it 
had been for thousands of years sheikholeslami said 
the problem was nobody on earth possessed the skills to build 
an obelisk the technology had vanished 
ancient workers took months to create an obelisk pounding the 
mother rock with diorite balls 
the washington monument was fashioned of 36000 marblefaced 
granite blocks the 555foot monument was dedicated on feb 21 
1885 an obelisk in shape only 
nobody knows when the first obelisks appeared pharaohs of the 
fifth dynasty ardent sun worshipers whose period began almost 
4500 years ago are thought to have been the first to decorate 
their temples with obelisks in pairs 
sheikholeslami said some may have been put up to celebrate 
pharaohs anniversaries others their victories small obelisks 
were erected at tombs 
despite their pagan origin obelisks were blessed by popes and 
associated with early christianity 
they decorated french and english houses a wealthy citizen of 
philadelphia erected a large obelisk over his familys burial 
vault smaller versions served as grave markers 
but they are best known outside egypt as centerpieces in public 
squares and parks 
augustus caesar whose 44year reign began in 30 bc began the 
trend by taking one obelisk for romes circus maximus another for 
the field of mars 
cairo didnt get around to erecting an obelisk for show until 
1958 a rose granite needle shipped upstream from the ancient nile 
delta city of tanis to gezira island in the heart of the capital 
true to form the island now is famous not for its 47foottall 
obelisk but for cairo tower soaring 594 feet just behind 
when we brought it to gezira we had no idea that the cairo 
tower would be built behind it egyptologist kamal elmallakh a 
prime mover behind the project said shortly before his death in 
1987 if we had known we wouldnt have done it the obelisk is 
lost 
antiquities officials spent 12 million in 1984 to place an 
obelisk at cairo international airport its lost too because 
most flights land and leave cairo in the dark 
scores of obelisks once guarded entry into egypts sacred 
temples only four still stand in their original slots 
twin obelisks were moved in antiquity from the temple of the sun 
god ra home of the phoenix in ancient heliopolis to the 
mediterranean port of alexandria misnamed cleopatras needles 
one now stands beside the river thames in london the second in 
central park 
other obelisks lie in ruins toppled by earthquakes or 
desecrated by conquerors seeking to destroy a mysterious power said 
to lurk within 
the oldest standing obelisk dates from the reign of pharaoh 
sesostris i 4000 years ago at the site of the ra temple now 
enveloped by apartment houses it rises from a small park in a 
bustling crowded cairo suburb 
the largest 97 feet high and weighing 323 tons was built 3700 
years ago by queen hatshepsut for the karnak temple complex in 
luxor 450 miles south of cairo a smaller more damaged obelisk 
belonging to her father tuthmosis i stands nearby 
both are ignored by thousands of tourists daily who prefer to 
photograph immense decorated columns and monumental statues erected 
150 years later by pharaoh ramses ii 
egypts most famous survivor is ramses own obelisk at the 
entrance to nearby luxor temple 
its twin stands in paris place de la concorde a gift from 
egypt france reciprocated with a small clock placed in a 
courtyard adjacent to mohammed ali mosque in cairos citadel 
the timepiece doesnt work 
and ramses oncegreat obelisk outside luxor temple is leaning

editors note the nations growing appetite for fish has 
produced thriving catfish farms in the deep south and trout farms 
in the northwest now cashing in on the trend are farmers in 
appalachia who are growing bass and salmon insted of corn and 
wheat 
</TEXT>

metz wva joshua brickensteins home looks like the other 
rugged wooden dwellings in these treecovered hills of appalachia 
deep in coal country 
but inside he has signs books and even a stainglassed window 
that proclaim fish not coal or cattle is king here 
brickenstein is a farmer a fish farmer his cash crops are 
striped bass coho salmon and tilapia he is one of a growing 
number of landlocked farmers turning to fish as an alternative to 
such traditional crops as corn wheat and hay 
the us department of agriculture says the market for 
farmproduced fish is growing 
the 1990s should be an important decade for growth the 
usda said recently world population gains and limits on wild 
catch from the oceans should increase the demand for aquaculture 
products 
the government says increased fish consumption in the united 
states will be met through more imports and more farmers like 
brickenstein 
david harvey a usda agricultural economist in washington 
dc specializing in aquaculture said about one in every 10 fish 
eaten by americans now comes from fish farms 
aquaculture thrives in states such as mississippi louisiana and 
arkansas where the mississippi river and its delta provides 
excellent conditions for catfish farming 
it also is successful in western states such as idaho and 
montana where natural conditions make it profitable to raise trout 
joseph a marshall associate biology professor at west virginia 
university said the practice is most popular in china where one 
out of every four fish eaten comes from a farm asians first began 
growing their own fish about 4000 years ago 
marshall said fish farming is growing because ocean fishermen 
are finding catches harder to come by 
fish are cheaper to feed than livestock he says it takes up to 
9 pounds of feed for each pound of beef produced compared with up 
to 1 pound of feed for each pound of fish produced he says 
in addition he says many consumers are reluctant to buy 
freshcaught fish for fear of pollution contamination 
you dont know what youre getting when you eat oceancaught 
fish he says you have no idea what the mercury levels are in 
many cases there are no checks for many fish caught out of the 
country 
local restaurants also prefer a good nearby source of fresh 
fish he says 
when stores label fish fresh that only means it hasnt been 
frozen marshall says big stores have weekold fish and they 
call it fresh you can taste the difference 
brickensteins 98acre farm about 80 miles southwest of 
pittsburgh includes two 2000gallon indoor tanks which look like 
aboveground swimming pools and sound like giant aquariums 
the tanks are used to keep young fish alive when winter weather 
sours later maturing fish are transferred to outdoor farm ponds 
where they are submerged in 4by4foot cages that ensure their 
food stays in one place 
brickenstein 62 took up fish farming six years ago after 
retiring as a selfemployed plastics manufacturer in tel aviv 
israel and pittsburgh he also grows raspberries on his farm 
which he admits is more a hobby supplemented by money he 
accumulated as a businessman 
he calculates a prudent fish farmer could net up to 30000 a 
year with fish although he has yet to turn a profit in five years 
as he experiments with different methods of aquaculture 
brickenstein builds his tanks by hand and uses a homemade 
filtering system to clean water pollution created by the fish 
he raises the fish from fingerling stage or when theyre about 
the size of a tadpole he stresses the importance of making sure 
fish get just the right amount of food too much can leave them 
just as dead as too little 
the fish are kept indoors in a building thats something of a 
cross between a henhouse garage and a barn the ponds meanwhile 
are located about a quarter mile from his house and the road 
nestled in the hills and surrounded by rolling green meadows 
scientists say they still arent sure if fish farming hurts the 
environment 
maryland officials are offering up to 15000 in grant money to 
fish farmers who build wastewater treatment facilities 
essentially if you take fish and feed them the excess feed 
turns into a nitrogen product that may eventually turn into 
ammonia which can hurt other fish says brad powers marylands 
aquaculture coordinator 
what were saying is we dont know whether aquaculture is a 
problem what were trying to do is head it off in advance 
still marshall believes the prospects for aquaculture are 
unlimited 
what you make of it is really what you put into it he says 
youve seen farmers who raise scraggly cattle and youve seen 
farmers with sparkling cattle how you manage will determine how 
well you do 
marshall also says aquaculture can be simple for someone who has 
an occasional yen for fresh fish 
you just have to use a little ingenuity he said theres 
nothing saying that if you have an aquarium in your home you cant 
eat the fish

editors note in creating the national parks congress said 
they should be preserved as they were found that meant no new 
critters could be introduced or tolerated on park land but here 
are a bunch of stray horses that some people in missouri would like 
to keep and the park service says must go 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the bands of stray horses that have roamed 
the rugged and beautiful missouri ozarks for more than 20 years are 
heading for the last roundup 
fugitives from farms in the mid1960s they have wandered 
through the wildflowerdotted fields of waisthigh grass and drunk 
from the rivers and springs that flow through the lush forests and 
valleys theyve become as wild as mustangs 
but now the us park service contends the two dozen or so 
animals cant properly fend for themselves and should be captured 
and sold 
the government announced in may that it plans to hire cowboys to 
round up the horses from the 60000 acres of wilderness in the 
ozark national scenic riverways in southern missouri 
it will be a sad day when there are no more wild horses around 
here says rolland smotherman of birch tree who trains and shoes 
horses for a living and often ventures out on horseback with 
friends to observe the strays where else can you go and see wild 
horses except for out west 
smotherman and a number of residents of this sparsely populated 
region located about 150 miles southwest of st louis say the 
horses are thriving in the wild several new foals were seen this 
spring he says 
they believe the animals should be left alone to be enjoyed by 
the public including the thousands of canoeists campers and 
fishermen who flock to the current and jacks fork rivers each year 
those horses wintered fat i guarantee they are healthier than 
ninetenths of the horses most people have around here says 
richard wilkins of mountain view who owns a feed store and seven 
horses 
supporters have gathered about 1000 signatures on petitions 
asking the park service to reconsider its plan to catch the 
animals break them and then allow the public to adopt them for 
a fee 
its silly for the park service to think about removing them 
no matter how many times youve seem them its always a thrill 
says gay healzer of eminence a rodeo champion in barrel 
competition 
the government claims the animals are not truly wild like the 
mustangs roaming western ranges and therefore are not able to 
contend with harsh winters disease injury and food shortages 
in addition the horses create unwanted trails trample rare and 
endangered plants and occasionally raid the hay fields of farmers 
who lease federal land says tom graham chief ranger of the ozark 
national scenic riverways 
we heard from an individual that three horses were shot 
recently and left to die graham says there are occasional 
reports that humans are abusing them 
moreover the agency is legally bound to remove the horses 
because nonnative animals are not allowed to inhabit park service 
lands he says 
the government will choose this summer from bids submitted by 
individuals and businesses wishing to capture the horses the 
missouri humane society will be asked to monitor the roundup to 
ensure the animals safety graham says 
smotherman calls the governments reasoning a bunch of 
baloney 
its unlikely the horses three separate bands of about eight 
animals each led by a stallion would ever become overpopulated 
he says deer cause more damage to farm fields than the horses he 
adds 
the park service has enough room down there to pasture 400 to 
500 head smotherman says 
the horses are mostly mixed breeds including several 
appaloosas because they are inbred most of the animals wouldnt 
bring more than 400 to 500 a head at market smotherman says 
if somebody comes in here and catches them ill guarantee 
that 90 percent of them will be turned into dog food smotherman 
says a lot of them are mares 15 to 20 years old theyre not 
going to be able to break them colts theyll be able to break the 
older they get the harder it is to break them 
tom mooney of eminence remembers seeing horses running wild when 
he was a child at his familys home on blairs creek before 
congress established the ozark national scenic riverways in 1962 to 
preserve the natural beauty of the area 
those horses were there before the park service mooney 
says theyve never hurt anything i love to see them here and 
id love to see them stay here 
jim smith whose family has operated wilderness trail rides at 
eminence for 35 years questions the governments contention that 
the stray horses arent wild he said hes seen the horses swim 
across a river or flee up a steep rocky hillside at the mere sight 
of a human 
you cant catch them he says ive chased em a little 
bit myself shoot they outrun you you can run a horse to death 
and youll never get a rope on one people have tried for years 
despite public sentiment graham says the government wont budge 
from its position that the horses must go 
we have a legal obligation to do this he says

bob newhart who ended his sitcom with a 
surprise and a firstplace finish is now taking his act on the 
road 
newhart will make more than 30 comedy concert appearances this 
summer and will be host of a showtime special just for laughs 
the montreal international comedy festival 
ive never stopped doing standup work newhart says its 
where i started i wanted to keep my hand in its my first love 
the 90minute showtime special will be televised live on 
saturday july 21 during the final weekend of the montreal 
festival 
this is livelivelive television says newhart who cant 
remember the last time he did a live show this will not be like 
an improv show where you just introduce new young comics the 
festival has comics from all over the world ill probably do an 
opening monologue one of my old routines and maybe participate in 
a sketch 
at least four other comedians will appear on the show which 
will also present highlights of the twoweek festival 
newhart took time out from working with contractors on a new 
house to talk about the special and his career he virtually 
performs an act while telling about his woes building a new house 
he recalls routines from the six buttondown mind comedy albums 
that launched his career his first series on nbc in 196162 failed 
in the ratings but won an emmy and a peabody award 
i wrote all my own material and early on was torn between 
writing for a living or performing he says i offered some 
material to a wellknown comedian and he turned me down a few 
weeks later he did my material on the old steve allen show i 
figured the only way to protect myself was to perform my own 
material 
people kept telling me when i did a comedy album i was giving 
my act away i said it was the only way i had to attract attention 
i had to keep writing new material all the time i couldnt afford 
to hire a writer people still want to hear those old routines 
like sir walter raleigh the driving instructor king kong the 
school for bus drivers the submarine commander what each one does 
is lays an attitude over a situation 
newhart is polishing his act while a new television series is 
being developed he could return to the air as early as the fall of 
1991 
he ended the eighth year of cbs newhart with a funny and 
classy farewell that was also one of televisions bestkept secrets 
we had a red herring in the last script he says i get 
hit with a golf ball go to heaven and have a scene with god the 
crew had a pool going over whether we would get george burns or 
george c scott to play god that was so no one would know we had 
susie for the last show 
as virtually everyone knows by now in the final scene newhart 
woke up in bed with suzanne pleshette his wife from the bob 
newhart show that ran from 197278 bob hartley his character on 
the earlier show had dreamed the eight years of newhart the 
episode was first in the nielsen ratings that week 
we kept susie hidden in a trailer and we sneaked her into the 
bed in the dark for the last scene he says people applauded 
as soon as they recognized the set nobody knew the ending i think 
dday was more public im keeping a file of letters from people 
about it 
it was my wife ginnys idea we were at a party the year 
before and she suggested it to susie susie said if im in 
bangkok ill fly back for that 
cbs had wanted to renew the show for another year but mtm 
enterprises said producing the show was too expensive newhart who 
made both series with mtm has parted company and will make his new 
show in partnership with arthur price his manager and former 
president of mtm 
well come back when we have a good concept he says if 
you dont have a good concept theres no reason to come back im 
kind of glad were off for a while its a good time to take a look 
at television and how its changing its taking more risks now 
with shows like twin peaks putting the simpsons up against 
the cosby show and in living color 
sitcoms tend to be traditional but within that format you can 
be innovative i want to come back with a different show thats 
where my head is it must be a sitcom and it must be done with 
three cameras before an audience im looking for an innovative way 
to combine all those elements with a twist 
newhart says he has one other requirement for his new show it 
must be funny that comes first 
in the meantime newhart says he is developing several movies 
for television he hasnt made a tv or feature movie in the last 10 
years he recalls the making of catch 22 in 1970 and does a 
comedy routine of director mike nichols directing actor orson 
welles who was also trying to direct the movie 
the funniest parts of the movie were behind the camera he 
says

twice a week clad in a filmy purple gown 
wearing deathly white makeup and a heavy black wig lee meriwether 
stands outside a sound stage and waves at the passing trams of the 
universal studios tour 
this is not a common occurrence on the tour few wellknown 
actors deign to make an appearance but meriwether star of the 
syndicated program the munsters today enjoys the attention 
it started when i was standing outside the stage one day when 
a tram came by the tour guide told them who i was i waved at 
them and they got a kick out of it she said 
one day a tram load of japanese tourists came by and nearly 
tilted over as everyone rushed to the side to take pictures said 
meriwether i wish id had a camera to take a picture of that 
meriwether is now at work on the third season of the munsters 
today a revival of the 1960s comedy series the original was 
something of a copy itself coming as it did on the heels of the 
popular show the addams family it was then and still is a 
spoof of domestic family sitcoms 
the munsters live at 1313 mockingbird lane in a musty gothic 
mansion each member of the family looks like a refugee from a 
horror flick 
herman the father is a gravedigger and dead ringer for 
frankensteins monster grandpa who looks like dracula tinkers 
with inventions in the basement 
the children are eddie a teenager who seems to be on his way 
to turning into a werewolf and marilyn a pretty young woman in 
the original show the rest of the munsters thought marilyn was 
abnormal and pitied her 
meriwethers lily is a vampire lily is basically your 
everyday mother in a sitcom said meriwether who was miss 
america in 1955 she adores her children she just looks 
different 
the actress revels in the shows monsterisms when she found a 
transylvania cookbook she bought dozens and gave them to friends 
the show has been brought up to date meriwether said the 
children have changed the most eddie no longer dresses in the 
little lord fauntleroy clothes he dresses as other teens do today 
we no longer worry about marilyns looks there was some talk 
that i would get a job 
the series features john schuck as herman howard morton as 
grandpa jason marsden as eddie and hillary van dyke as marilyn 
the original show broadcast on cbs from 196466 starred fred 
gwynne as herman yvonne decarlo as lily al lewis as grandpa 
butch patrick as eddie and beverly owen and later pat priest as 
marilyn 
meriwether did not give the munsters today much chance for 
survival 
first she said i thought it would be just a pilot i never 
thought it would become a series then i didnt think it would go 
beyond the first year 
it is now seen on more than 100 stations 
meriwether is a television veteran she had recurring roles on 
mission impossible dr kildare the fbi and 12 
oclock high as well as the time tunnel the new andy 
griffith show and barnaby jones 
in the last show she played betty jones the daughterinlaw of 
the eponymous character played by buddy ebsen that show originally 
was an episode of cannon but before they had completed the 
filming it became a spinoff and a new series it ran for eight 
seasons on cbs 
after barnaby jones left the air in 1980 she did mostly 
stage work and spent five years as an aerialist with circuses in 
switzerland sweden japan australia and south america she worked 
as a substitute with the flying gaonas and her daughter lesley 
aletter often worked with her 
i wasnt a gymnast said meriwether i did the simple 
tricks but lesley could do the unusual tricks

sex lies and videotape rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 
8995 rated r 
 
sex lies and videotape is a very intimate movie styled 
with camera angles and sound reminiscent of home video and it 
works very well on the small screen at home 
in steven soderberghs striking movie winner at the cannes film 
festival the characters have trouble connecting to their own 
feelings as well as to the people around them in any meaningful 
way 
upandcoming lawyer john millaney peter gallagher playing a 
nasty yuppie to the hilt and his wife ann andie macdowell just 
go through the motions in their sterile baton rouge la home 
without intimacy and with little affection 
john has midday sex with anns sister cynthia laura san 
giacomo but their relationship while red hot physically has no 
depth 
ann and cynthia dont even try to understand each other 
but they go along as ann tells her therapist being happy 
isnt all that great 
into this rambles graham james spader johns old college pal 
who has spent nine years away perfecting a sense of control and 
distance ironically it is graham with his videotapes of women 
discussing their sex lives who upsets the balance and forces all 
the characters to pay some attention to their lives 
this is a stunning film the actors are wonderful and the 
conversation is gripping

federal soldiers at the hacienda he too ends up at the miranda 
estate 
and the third side of the triangle is tomas arroyo jimmy 
smits a general to pancho villa both men fall for harriet of

movie with a wild weststyle shootemup that goes on and on 
brave men facing death like men and music that hits you over the 
head that this is a big an epic movie 
fonda is fine peck is terrific and theres a lovely scene when

days of open hand aampm suzanne vega 
 
suzanne vegas voice is a remarkable instrument though thin and 
delicate it broke down barriers and opened a new market for female 
singers vegas popularity with a folkpop sound paved the way for 
such women as sinead oconnor and tracy chapman who made some of 
the best music of the late 1980s 
while the genre has thrived vega has struggled its been three 
years since her last album and surprise hit luka she 
complained of writers block after her first two records used up a 
lifetimes accumulation of material 
so with the release of days of open hand the question is 
how good are the songs and the answer is just fair the record 
doesnt have anything approaching the beauty of luka few 
albums do and the pace flags toward the end of the 11song set 
vegas lyrics are as fascinatingly opaque as ever men in a 
war about abortion and fiftyfifty chance about suicide 
both deliver lateverse twists and theyre the most 
straightforward songs on the record words are at the heart of her 
art which vega acknowledges on big space between the pen 
and the paperweight i know theres passion in the language 
the shimmering quality of vegas best music is absent here most 
of the time possibly because her acoustic guitar is less prominent 
than previously thats unfortunate the combination of vegas 
voice and strummed guitar is one of the prettiest in pop 
her search for new sounds brings to the foreground synthesizers 
big space and strings the philip glassish fiftyfifty 
chance vegas slower songs place more emphasis on texture and 
less on rhythmic punch than in the past 
clearly vega wants her music to evolve which is healthy and 
bound to produce interesting results but days of open hand is 
a dense record not anxious to win the affection of its listeners 
that thin delicate voice is most assertive suzanne vega 
continues to make music on her own terms

reading writing and arithmetic david geffen co the 
sundays 
 
britons harriet wheeler and david gavurin make songs about 
moments and like most moments the songs on reading writing and 
arithmetic fade quickly from memory 
she is the sundays multipleoctave singer he is their 
guitarist they are lovers according to the press materials 
there isnt much substance to the atmospheric songs on their 
debut album songs which gavurin refers to as largely 
impressionistic 
a track titled youre not the only one i know seems to be 
about the sudden realization that one is talking to oneself in i 
won wheeler wonders why she cant get to sleep after winning a 
fight in i kicked a boy she remembers several impulsive acts 
of childhood cruelty and concludes i couldve been wrong but i 
dont think i was 
the musical arrangements are spare and largely acoustic most of 
the songs rely on only two chords creating a droning effect 
against which wheeler sings in a detached passionless way 
the best of the collection is heres where the story ends 
in which wheeler recalls a broken romance while handling that 
little souvenir of a terrible year at one point she sings the 
only thing i ever really wanted to say was wrong 
the line is piercing but its not enough to recommend this 
record

later this month movie audiences will be 
able to see one of the few grated films of the violenceprone 
summer season featuring a fresh spunkier snow white 
the animated feature is called happily ever after the 
disney people objected to anything similar to snow white and the 
seven dwarfs the fledgling 1st national film corp is releasing 
the filmation feature with the voices of phyllis diller ed asner 
dom deluise sally kellerman carol channing tracey ullman 
malcolm mcdowell and zsa zsa gabor the role of snow white is 
voiced by irenegh sometimes you have to be tough i think 
theres a misconception that in order to be in control of your life 
you have to be tough and almost have a hard shell i think you miss 
most of life if your shell gets too hard 
after her last album touch branigan did her first world 
tour i went all over south america i love the latin people i 
think they love my music because its emotional theyre not afraid 
to show emotion you see people there striving less to be cool than 
people here she expected undemonstrative audiences in asia and 
was surprised they were just wild enthusiastic and screaming 
it was great 
in june shell start touring on the west coast reaching new 
york about the end of august 
as most performers discover theres more to the music business 
than making music branigan loves recording and performing and 
audiences the rest is a pain in the neck you have to be on top 
of everything always doublechecking you cant just sit back and 
relax and say ill leave it to business managers or whoever 
ive been taken for a lot of money because i didnt know what was 
going on 
and you have to be sure they dont overbook you you have to 
remember the voice is two pieces of flesh not two steel strings i 
find i have to say to my manager stop i need a vacation if you 
dont forcibly cut it you keep going and going 
she started the present album last june and worked for eight 
months 
i worked with three producers two had very definite 
personalities she said musically it was a wonderful 
experience it really tested my skill i had to juggle the 
personalities ive always had one producer on an album before 
producers can be pretty intense richard perry tries things 1000 
different ways in the end he nails it which is all that matters 
peter wolf works on synclavier does everything himself and does it 
quickly you couldnt find too more different people in the world 
if you tried 
i feel its the best album ive ever done but it was a real 
test for me she also coproduced some of the tracks with steve 
lindsey 
her marriage has survived during her career of making albums and 
touring and branigan takes to the road by herself 
ive always felt i was a loner she said when i was 
growing up i was an introvert i played the role of being gullible 
and dumb i didnt want to put myself out on the line that was 
safest so i just did it you fall into whats safe sometimes

five years ago the seattle symphony orchestra 
was close to collapse from debt that accumulated over nearly a 
decade of internal discord and artistic doldrums 
today the citys oldest performing arts group is on a financial 
crescendo and artistic fortissimo recording more than any other 
orchestra in the world expanding its audience and cutting debt by 
more than half 
music director gerard schwarz and managing director edward r 
birdwell who played trumpet and french horn respectively in the 
acclaimed american brass quintet in new york in the early 1970s 
are now beating the drums for a new 54 million performance hall 
and talk of touring the east coast and possibly europe or asia 
within five years 
the orchestras status is coming up rapidly said birdwell 
former music program director of the national endowment for the 
arts 
the next logical step and part of the natural recording 
process is to get us back east new york washington boston 
philadelphia because the reaction on 57th street where many 
music companies have offices in new york is that if it didnt 
happen here it didnt happen he said 
schwarz said the symphony has been invited to play at carnegie 
hall where birdwell once served as deputy director 
theyre not ready to pay enough for us yet schwarz said 
we will not make any tours that dont make sense economically 
which means we dont travel a lot right now 
the symphony did achieve a milestone this year with a west coast 
summer tour that includes three concerts at the hollywood bowl in 
los angeles 
schwarz says his longrange goal is recognition as one of the 
greatest orchestras in the world akin to the new york 
philharmonic berlin philharmonic or london symphony 
thats how far i think we can go he said we play better 
than them some of the time already but thats not the point the 
point is playing that way all the time 
principal percussionist randolph l baunton a 35year orchestra 
veteran and president of the unaffiliated seattle symphony and 
opera players association the musicians union said that in terms 
of music schwarz had helped make the job much more satisfying 
and there are the symphonys 12 recordings on the los 
angelesbased delos label ranging from richard wagner and robert 
schumann to the 20thcentury american composers walter piston and 
howard hanson 
no 13 released last month includes compositions by george 
gershwin samuel barber and leonard bernstein 
a compact disc of hansons symphonies no 1 and 2 and elegy in 
memory of serge koussevitzky reached third on billboard 
magazines classical music sales chart was named a record of the 
year for 1989 by stereo review and was nominated for three grammy 
awards including best classical album 
the symphony has another nine recordings ready for release this 
year and eight are planned for 1991 mostly 20thcentury us 
composers schwarz said 
in less than a year the symphony had 28 recording sessions 
each about 2 hours more than the new york philharmonic boston 
symphony philadelphia orchestra cleveland symphony and chicago 
symphony combined said rudy simpson delos marketing and media 
vice president 
the heavy recording schedule has helped the orchestras musical 
growth because they can play and then immediately hear it back 
baunton said 
schwarz a native of weehawken nj lives about six months of 
the year in a condominium near the pike place market with his wife 
jody and their three children we came here because of music 
obviously he said here we all make a difference you me 
anyone in new york nobody can make much of a difference 
not even james levine at the metropolitan opera or zubin mehta 
at the philharmonic 
take jimmy levine is he a part of the fabric of life of new 
york city no am i a part of the fabric of life of seattle i 
think i am schwarz said 
schwarz spends about five months a year in new york as music 
director of the new york chamber symphony a post he has held since 
that orchestra was formed in 1977 and music director of the summer 
mostly mozart festival he also is principal conductor of the 
waterloo festival in new jersey and was music director of the los 
angeles chamber orchestra from 1978 to 1986 
the seattle symphonys diminuendo began in the 1970s feathers 
were ruffled in 1976 when rainer miedel was hired as music director 
to replace milton katims a violist and arturo toscanini protege 
who had held the post since 1954 by 1978 things were falling 
apart baunton said 
musicians struck for 10 weeks early the next year 
it was bitter baunton said it took us probably six or 
seven or eight years to get past that 
a european tour in 1980 brought artistic recognition but the 
500000 debt left some major contributors so upset they stopped 
donating 
schwarz became music advisor in 1983 after miedel died from 
canger and began orchestrating the turnaround 
i went into it thinking that i would stay a couple of years 
help them straighten out their financial problems and leave he 
said i felt that there were the makings of a great orchestra 
here what i noticed here was that everyone was able to play and 
everybody wanted to play 
they had a wonderful spirit what they didnt have was a 
strong personality he said the second year they started to 
make great strides artistically and then i was hooked 
facing an accumulated debt of 15 million schwarz recruited 
key people to the board in 1987 the same year birdwell arrived 
selfmade multimillionaire and philanthropist samuel p stroum 
became chairman and seattlefirst national bank president richard 
cooley became president 
the annual budget 43 million in 198384 is now 75 million 
and the debt has been slashed to 747000 as of midjune 
the number of annual subscribers has remained fairly stable at 
about 19000 but the addition of music by mozart baroque chamber 
and american composer series has boosted individual ticket sales 
from 30495 in 198687 to a projected 58200 for average attendance 
of about 90 percent this year 
meanwhile a revolt in the ranks threw out the american 
federation of musicians as bargaining agent in favor of the newly 
formed independent association which negotiated its first contract 
last fall 
san francisco symphony musicians are considering a similar move 
baunton said 
the pact boosts basic pay from 607 a week as of last year to 
800 in the last six months of 1993 and medical benefits by 15 
percent 
rather than extra pay for recording sessions as required in the 
old union contract recording work is included in the standard pay 
and those sessions are subject to the same restrictions as 
concerts an arrangement being widely studied elsewhere schwarz 
and baunton said 
while schwarz and birdwell said they stayed on the sidelines in 
that dispute both added that the union change proved instrumental 
in the recording boom 
it should be replicated elsewhere schwarz said we are 
the future

philip roth held up a copy of deception his 
newest novel 
what do people do with this he asked 
this thing falls into somebodys lap and they do something 
with it they take it over they can hit somebody over the head 
with it they can be utterly indifferent to it 
every reading is a mystery theres misreadings 
misunderstandings 
the author of goodbye columbus portnoys complaint and 
the counterlife was seated at the manhattan offices of his 
publisher simon and schuster his intense stare softened by 
glasses and a blue tweed jacket roth reflected on his friends in 
eastern europe such czech writers as vaclav havel milan kundera 
and ivan klima 
they endured censorship imprisonment or exile for years and 
suddenly it all changed in the past few months now havel is the 
countrys president censorship has been lifted and 100000 copies 
were made for the initial printing of kilmas love and garbage 
his first czech publication in 20 years 
i thought they were doomed observed roth who has been 
promoting czech writers and making annual visits to prague since 
the early 1970s like anybody else i thought russia was this 
monolithic thing thats not going to change that was only going to 
get to worse 
roth once commented that the difference between writing in 
czechoslovakia and the united states was that there nothing goes 
and everything matters here everything goes and nothing matters 
but his own history refutes that he can never forget what 
happened in 1962 two years after goodbye columbus won the 
national book award for fiction when the author was a panelist for 
a seminar at yeshiva university on the crisis of conscience in 
minority writers of fiction 
in his 1988 autobiography the facts roth recalled being 
asked by the moderator if he would write the same stories if he 
were living in nazi germany the author went on to describe the 
scene as he attempted to leave 
i listened to the final verdict against me as harsh a 
judgment as i ever hope to hear in this or any other world i only 
began to shout clear away step back im getting out of here 
after somebody shaking a fist in my face began to holler you 
were brought up on antisemitic literature yes i hollered 
back and what is that curious really to know what he meant 
english literature he cried english literature is 
antisemitic literature 
for roth every reader offers a different interpretation 
counterreadings you might call them reactions to the writers 
reactions and the author cant resist some counterwriting 
selectively leaking information with the skill of a senior white 
house official 
for instance you can tell deception is fiction because 
theres no table of contents in front no bibliography in the back 
and no footnotes on the bottom 
but why does roth a famous jewish author married to english 
actress claire bloom write about a famous jewish author married to 
an english actress and why is this famous jewish author having an 
affair and arguing with his wife about writing a book about it 
you say to me well did any of this happen and i say 
well everything happened now ask me the next question roth 
said ask me what i did yesterday ill tell you what i did 
yesterday i ate a tuna fish sandwich i watched television i 
watched a ballgame thats what happened 
deception virtually all dialogue is a book about talking 
and listening roth says the raving cartooniish jews of 
goodbye columbus and portnoys complaint the kind of 
characters that so enraged his audience at yeshiva university are 
gone the wild humor offered from the psychiatrists couch in 
portnoys complaint has been softened into whispered insights 
offered in bed and by coffee tables 
still roth takes a further step on the wrong side of the 
tracks hes written several books about a jewish author called 
nathan zuckerman their lives linked so closely that zuckerman ends 
up writing about roth in the final pages of the facts 
but in deception roth drops that thin line of protection 
zuckerman is mentioned only in passing the famous jewish writer in 
this novel is called philip 
its like dropping dye into something roth said it 
touches something and it changes the coloration what happens if i 
put my name into it it wasnt going to make life pleasant for me 
i did think about using nathan but mischief led me to put my 
own name into it you see what happens if someone were to pull a 
pistol it changes everything if you drop your own name then you 
change the ante on adultery 
in the facts roth recalls of his early years id no 
intention as a writer of becoming controversial and in the 
beginning had no idea that my stories would prove repugnant to 
ordinary jews 
he doesnt feel that way anymore roth predicts that hell 
eventually be brought to court for something hes written and 
includes a mock trial in deception in which the author is put 
on the stand by angry feminists 
again he speaks of the surprises of books how theyre written 
and how theyre read the yeshiva conference was the luckiest 
break i could have had he wrote in the facts 
i was branded 
for roth all books are eventually about talking and listening 
conversations between readers and writers dialogues always in 
danger of spinning out of control 
art has consequences literature has consequences sentences 
have consequences we know from whats happened in eastern europe 
that it isnt just one little writer in america who discovered that 
sentences have consequences you learn something roth said 
of the yeshiva conference in my case it interested me what is 
this theres something going on here what is the exchange between 
the writer and the reader between the book and the writer

cw mccall who gave up singing 12 
years ago after selling 7 million copies of the catchy convoy 
is on record again 
this time he warns about something more critical than an 
approaching state trooper the environment 
mccall who quit performing in order to enjoy the mountain life 
in colorado has just released a collection of old songs and some 
new ones in the album the real mccall an american storyteller 
the music is hip occasionally tongueincheek but also has 
clear messages about protecting the environment 
the 61yearold mccall whose real name is bill fries ended his 
music career in 1978 to live in the mountains and go fishing 
he said recently in a telephone interview from his home in ouray 
colo 
but fans kept asking for his records so he and convoy 
collaborator chip davis got together to update old songs and work 
up new ones on davis independent label american gramaphone 
records of omaha neb 
cuts on the album include there wont be no country music 
which is a warning about keeping the environment clean 
wilderness is about pure air glenwood canyon questions the 
practice of clearing land for highways 
of course convoy also is included a no 1 pop and country 
music hit in early 1976 the song was about overthehighway truck 
drivers and their encounters with law officers in the tune mccall 
was a beleaguered trucker with the citizens band radio handle of 
rubber duck 
the song used cb jargon such as smokeys state troopers and 
the back door the rear where smokeys can sneak up 
the tune showcasing mccalls bass voice also inspired a movie by 
the same name which starred kris kristofferson ali mcgraw and 
ernest borgnine 
it was timely mccall said in analyzing the popularity of 
the song back in 197576 that craze was sweeping the country 
the jargon was colorful and the american public liked that too 
it was laced with humor but it had a rebellious feeling about 
it and people responded to it 
we took a slice out of this lifestyle and talk and put it into 
a number it was just phenomenal you turned on the radio and in 
two or three minutes you heard convoy we just sat back and 
watched in amazement 
mccall said he believes the most popular line in the song was 
were gonna roll this trucking convoy across the usa 
its very american he said 
the oneliners were memorable mccall said especially 
11 friends of jesus in a chartreuse microbus that meant it was 
for all kinds of folks 
but performing was a new profession for mccall who had spent 
his adult life as an advertising executive in omaha with 
convoy he suddenly was a public figure as a college student 
years earlier he said he had dreamed of playing clarinet in a 
symphony orchestra but nothing like this 
people came out to see me but didnt know what i looked like 
they just knew my voice so i had to learn to be a face this meant 
a lot of rehearsing and learning the business of stage shows how 
cw mccall was supposed to act and look it was an identity 
crisis 
after six albums and another solo hit country record with 
roses for mama in 1977 mccall had had enough hed made enough 
money to relocate from omaha to colorado and take it easy 
we had planned to do this but convoy put us 10 years ahead 
of schedule he recalled it was like winning a lottery 
since 1986 he has been mayor of ouray which he describes as 
a mining town with mountains all around and a population of 680 
when we are all here 
he doesnt plan to have a convoy touring the nation to plug the 
new album i might do a few promotional things but they had 
better come here to do the talk shows i have an aversion to going 
to hot cities 
i have a great love affair with this little town a town lost 
in time were not out to make a killing selling records this was 
a project of joy and to satisfy the loyal fans we did it as a 
creative outlet 
mccall a native of audubon iowa still has a cb radio in his 
fourwheel drive vehicle and continues to use the handle rubber 
duck but the cb radio craze is not what it once was 
we hardly ever use it he said its gathering dust we do 
use it in the mountains on the jeep trails where you have to stick 
together

in the shops and on the streets of west 
virginias westernmost town the topic these days is more likely to 
center on oil refinery emissions lawsuits and harassment than on 
high school football 
more than 3 billion in lawsuits filed by more than 1000 
residents against ashland oil inc have caused a bitter split in 
kenova neighbor is pitted against neighbor as the issue of jobs 
vs pollution is played out in this town of 5000 
its tearing our town apart said mayor frank heck i look 
for it to start splitting churches and families apart here 
the harsh words and hard feelings are found in places usually 
concerned with the chances of ceredokenova high school winning 
another state football championship 
the residents who have filed suit contend that emissions from 
ashland oils giant catlettsburg ky refinery just across the big 
sandy river have damaged their health and their property 
the kentucky division for air quality a state organization 
found the emissions consisted of flakes of caustic lime dust a 
claylike substance used in a refinery product 
the residents said they were alarmed by dying trees on their 
property and that they suffered from skin rashes and breathing 
problems they also said the emissions have peeled the paint off 
their cars a kanawha county circuit court jury agreed in may 
awarding 10 million in damages to the first four plaintiffs 
ashland oil has appealed the verdict and the company one of 
the biggest employers in an economically troubled area has plenty 
of supporters ashland oil says it employs more than 2700 people 
in west virginia 
supporters have been flooding newspapers from ashland to 
charleston 60 miles away with letters to the editor challenging 
the verdict 
one local insurance company is running a newspaper advertisement 
expressing its support for ashland oil calling the company good 
neighbors friends and a fine corporation 
some of the plaintiffs however say theyve been harassed and 
had their property vandalized since the verdict was announced 
their lawyer rod jackson says the company is directly or 
indirectly encouraging the acts 
some people are reluctant to talk about the lawsuits 
weve got people from both sides who come in here said a 
pharmacist who would not give his name it would be foolish to 
make a comment about it for any business to 
resident jan moore firmly supports ashland oil but says her 
neighbor is one of the plaintiffs she said they dont talk much 
about the legal case 
one of the plaintiffs floyd sowards said his car was 
vandalized after his daughterinlaw cheryl sowards was among 
those in the 10 million verdict someone poured an oily substance 
over his 1985 car two weeks ago ruining the paint he said 
sowards said he has installed floodlights around his house and 
leaves his porch lights on at night following what he called the 
act of terrorism endorsed by ashland oil 
people in the area have received death threats had their 
car transmissions ripped out received harassing phone calls at 
all hours of the night sowards said 
no one and i think i speak for everyone no one wants to 
impose any grief on any ashland oil employee sowards said i 
wish ashland oil to prosper but theyre not going to prosper at 
the expense of me and my family 
ashland oil spokesman roger schrum denies endorsing any 
harassment and blames the plaintiffs lawyer jackson for 
intensifying the hard feelings with his allegations the company is 
behind the harassment 
the dispute has prompted city councils in kenova ashland ky 
and ironton ohio to pass resolutions supporting ashland oil but 
a similar proposal before the huntington city council was defeated 
after members said they shouldnt get involved in a lawsuit 
dan vandermeer an official from the federal national institute 
of environmental health sciences says the emotional turmoil in 
kenova threatens to derail efforts to determine whether the town 
really does have a serious health problem too many people are 
unwilling to discuss their health with strangers because of the 
hard feelings he said

the government has come up with a novel 
approach for handling bad economic news it has decided just to 
stop reporting it 
the statistic in question is the annual assessment of americas 
global investment standing which in the past few years has shown 
that the united states has gone from being the worlds largest 
creditor nation to being the largest debtor nation 
the government says the figure is no longer reliable critics 
say the bush administration is playing politics by not releasing it 
the report for 1989 the us net international investment 
position was scheduled to be released monday but last week 
the government let it be known that because of concern over the 
data the report would not be released this year 
the commerce departments bureau of economic analysis said a 
scaleddown version of the investment flows would be made public 
but without the key bottomline figure 
at the end of 1988 the us debt burden stood at 5325 
billion up 41 percent from the previous year the bea reported 
last year 
that figure reflected the imbalance between what americans owned 
overseas and what foreigners owned in this country 
based on information contained in other reports private 
economists expected that americas net debtor position probably 
rose by around 110 billion in 1989 pushing americas net debt 
close to 650 billion 
but the bea release on monday will not have a figure on 
americas net debtor position there will be enough data provided 
on the component parts that make up the figure so that interested 
parties will be able to come up with their own unofficial estimate 
but the number will not appear in the report 
the bea reasoning the net debtor number as presently calculated 
has so many flaws that it is no longer reliable bea officials said 
they hoped to have a revamped report with more accurate figures 
ready for release in a year 
some critics arent persuaded 
the reason they are not publishing the number is that it shows 
the united states in an unfavorable light said jeff faux head 
of the economic policy institute a laborbacked think tank 
the united states was the worlds largest creditor country as 
recently as 1983 when it had an investment surplus of 89 billion 
that surplus fell to 33 billion in 1984 and disappeared 
altogether in 1985 the year the country became a net debtor for 
the first time in 71 years 
the plunge from largest creditor to largest debtor was caused by 
the huge merchandise trade deficits the united states piled up 
during the 1980s as americans transferred billions of dollars into 
the hands of foreigners to pay for such things as imported cars and 
television sets 
foreigners now have reinvested those dollars in the united 
states in everything from corporate stock and us treasury bills 
to hollywood movie studios and iowa farmland 
that has set off an alarm bells from city hall to congress over 
the buying of america with dire warnings that the united 
states was in danger of losing control of its economic destiny to 
foreigners 
allan young head of the bea denied that he was under any 
political pressure from the bush administration to halt publication 
of the net debtor figure 
i am an economic statistician and i decided the number is 
inappropriate because of the way it is put together young said 
the problem has been increasingly recognized by us and by 
others 
there have been complaints for a number of years that americas 
debtor position was being overstated because the report measured 
many of the assets at the historical purchase price 
that undervalued the worth of us assets in foreign countries 
many of which were purchased decades ago in comparison with 
foreign holdings in the united states many purchased in the 1980s 
the bea is working to produce a report that will give an 
uptodate current value on all assets both foreign and us 
holdings 
while applauding this effort at statistical consistency private 
economists said they believed the final result will still show the 
united states as a net debtor with the amount of debt growing at an 
alarming rate 
economist c fred bergsten who is completing a book on 
americas net debtor position said that while the current report 
does understate the value of americas holdings overseas it also 
understates foreign holdings in the united states because of errors 
in gathering data on foreign ownership 
our view is that both the asset and liability numbers are 
substantially understated and as a result the bottomline figure is 
probably about right said bergsten who is head of the institute 
for international economics a washingtonbased think tank 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said the debate 
over the exact valuation of the net debtor figure misses the more 
important point of americas growing dependence on foreign capital 
to run the us economy 
it was a scare number but people ought to be scared he 
said it is a very serious problem and it is one that we arent 
doing anything about

ratners group plc britains largest jewelry 
chain today launched a friendly 3281 million takeover bid for 
kay jewelers inc a us company that operates nearly 500 stores 
in the united states 
the deal will make ratners the second largest jewelry retailer 
in the united states after zales which is owned by canadas 
peoples jewellers ltd 
the addition of kays 494 stores will increase the number of 
ratners us outlets to 967 ratners said 
the british company said its offer has been accepted by kays 
board members who control 346 percent of the american companys 
shares 
ratners said it was offering stock worth 17 a share for the 
124 million shares outstanding of kays stock the bid values the 
whole of the company including the cost of assuming kays debt at 
3281 million ratners said 
specifically ratners said it was offering one new ratners us 
convertible preference share for every kay share the ratners 
preference shares will be convertible into three of its ordinary 
shares in the form of american depository receipts 
ratners effectively sealed the agreement against disruption by a 
counterbidder by gaining an option to purchase the 346 percent 
stake outright at 17 a share should another bid arise 
ratners said it also was given a conditional option to buy 249 
million new kay shares at 17 a share in the event of a higher 
counterbid 
ratners said it would pay for the takeover partly by selling 
228 million of new ratners shares to existing ratners shareholders 
the kays stores which are located mostly on the east and west 
coasts and in texas will fit in well with sterling inc a us 
jewelry retailer which ratners acquired in 1987 for 2028 million 
sterlings business is concentrated in the midwest 
ratners said it plans to sell kays marcus chain and its black 
starr and frost chain which together have 48 outlets with sales 
last year of 702 million 
kays one of the largest jewelery chains in the united states 
has seen its earnings suffer recently because of lower consumer 
spending on luxury goods and tighter us credit policies 
for all of 1989 kay managed only a 196000 profit on sales of 
4206 million 
regardless of the poor recent record ratners said the 
acquisition will fit in well with its plans to expand its us 
market share 
ratners wants to operate 1500 us stores representing 10 
percent of what it described as a traditionally fragmented us 
market 
the kays purchase in doubling the number of ratners us 
outlets would increase its market share to 57 percent from 28 
percent the company said 
ratners with 1200 british stores commands 50 percent of the 
british market 
ratners aftertax profit rose to the equivalent of 139 million 
on sales of 16 billion in the year ended feb 3

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states remains steady at 1020 with a loss of only one 
rig this week baker hughes inc announced monday 
last week the rig count jumped by 22 rigs to 1021 a year ago 
this week the count was 817 
baker hughes rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs 
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the 
number of producing wells 
the houstonbased oil toolmaker company has kept track of the 
rig count the widely watched index of drilling activity since 
1940 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states california showed the biggest 
gain for the week adding 11 rigs others showing gains included 
kansas which gained three and pennsylvania with two 
texas which last week added 10 rigs this week led major

asarco incs ray unit was struck sunday by 
unions representing about 700 copper workers it was the first 
copper strike in arizona since the turbulent phelps dodge strike 
seven years ago 
the old contract expired at midnight saturday and contract talks 
broke off here around 4 am sunday union and company officials 
said 
the union coalition had rejected the companys final offer 
robert guadiana the united steelworkers official who heads the 
talks for the unions said the 24member union committee had 
significant concerns over asarco proposals he said would damage 
pension insurance and disability benefits 
guadiana also cited forced overtime rules as another problem 
obviously no one wanted a strike he said but it makes no 
sense for a company with the profits they have and the expansion 
program that is under way to try to force that kind of agreement 
down peoples throats 
bruce malone general manager at ray and the companys chief 
negotiators said he was quite surprised that the union 
committee rejected the final offer which would have provided an 
average 250anhour wage increase over three years 
he said the companys offer proposed changes in the benefit 
plan all improvements that are very similar to what has been 
accepted at other properties 
malone said the company hoped to maintain about 60 percent of 
its normal production capacity using 165 salaried employees at its 
mine concentrator and other facilities at ray 
other asarco properties including the hayden smelter and the 
mission complex south of tucson are not affected by the strike 
the strike is the first in arizona since 1983 when copper 
workers at phelps dodge corps morenci operation went on strike 
that violenceplagued strike lasted until 1986 when the union was 
decertified

the philips electronics 
multinational europes largest consumer electronics company 
monday predicted more than 1 billion in losses this year and said 
it would have to cut its workforce by 10000 jobs 
new president of philips industries nv jan d timmer announced 
the projected losses at a stockholders meeting and said they would 
result from a major restructuring effort 
the expected losses for the year exceed even timmers own 
previous pessimistic forecast june 14 that net income for the whole 
of 1990 would be very low 
timmer said monday that the june 14 forecast had been made in 
the expectation that there would be normal restructuring costs of 
212 million rather than the 14 billion that now has been slated 
the philips president said 1990 sales would total more than 
297 billion although the restructuring will be aimed mostly at 
philips moneylosing information systems and components division 
timmer indicated that the group didnt intend to abandon these 
activities 
although timmer conceded that the losses he expects philips to 
absorb in 1990 are high he said they are not such a high amount 
that panic is necessary 
howevever he warned against any notion that the new philips 
leadership can wave a magic wand to solve the electronics 
giants problems 
timmer said that the company would begin the process of laying 
people off immediately most of the job losses will be in europe 
he said 
philips currently employs about 293000 people worldwide 
the restructuring effort is the latest of a series of drives 
over the past three years to improve philips performance 
under former president cornelis van der klugt philips spent 
709 million over the past three years to improve its 
competitiveness 
during that previous restructuring drive philips slashed its 
workforce by about 20000 employees and closed about 75 factories 
worldwide leaving it with 345 factories 
the company announced van der klugts resignation may 14 in the 
wake of unexpectedly poor first quarter results

corn and soybean futures prices climbed rapidly 
early in todays session on the chicago board of trade supported 
by forecasts for extremely hot weather in the midwest 
temperatures in the 90s or higher were expected today in the 
western and southern edges of the corn belt 
such hot weather wouldnt do much harm in the central midwest 
where conditions have been wetter than normal 
but heat could stress the crops in southern missouri and 
arkansas where the soil is drier said john frazier director of 
agricultural commodities trading for gerald inc 
the heat is not expected to last more than a day or two which 
would limit its effect on crop yields but the market is very 
sensitive to any signs of adverse crop weather 
as long as somebody says its there theyll buy on it he 
said 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 2 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 327 a bushel 
corn was 1 cents to 4 cents higher with july at 299 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with september at 148 a 
bushel soybeans were 13 cents to 15 cents higher with july at 
636 a bushel 
hot weather forecasts also drove up hog and porkbelly futures 
in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange most cattle 
futures fell slightly 
live cattle were 40 cent lower to 05 cent higher with august 
at 7267 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent lower to 45 
cent higher with august at 8372 cents a pound live hogs were 70 
cent to 127 cents higher with july at 6137 cents a pound frozen

brazil told other coffeetrading nations monday 
that it hopes to decide within the next few weeks whether to back 
proposed negotiations on a new pricestabilization agreement 
lindenberg sette brazils chief delegate to an international 
coffee organization executive board meeting proposed a special 
meeting of major exporters and importers in london on july 23 at 
which time brazil would reveal its position 
the board will decide tuesday whether to accept brazils 
proposal a coffee organization spokesman said 
sette told the board that the new brazilian governments basic 
philosophy favored free trade with regulation only for 
exceptional purposes 
a new regulatory pact for coffee is strongly backed by colombia 
the worlds second biggest producer and by the united states the 
largest consumer most african producers and the european community 
have also backed a new pact 
efforts to open negotiations on an accord with the powers to 
regulate the market have so far been blocked by the uncertainty 
about the position of brazil the leading exporter 
the present coffee agreement has no powers to regulate prices 
because its export quota system aimed at balancing supply with 
demand was supended indefinitely last july 
the suspension of the system triggered one of the sharpest falls 
ever in the price of coffee to a 14year low of 59 us cents per 
pound last october 
the coffee organizations latest indicator of the world market 
price was 66 cents compared with the high for the year of 80 cents 
reached in february

publisher ralph ingersoll ii said today he 
agreed to swap the controlling stake in his us newspaper chains 
for european publishing interests after failing to make an interest 
payment on highrisk junk bonds 
ingersoll is the latest entrepreneur to run into debt 
difficulties after building an empire in the 1980s with junkbond 
financing 
the announcement followed months of attempts by ingersoll to buy 
back his companies junk bonds at steep discounts to alleviate a 
heavy debt burden 
ingersolls announcement also comes a little more than two 
months after he folded the st louis sun a new tabloid that 
ingersoll claimed would revolutionize the slumping newspaper market 
by using new technology and marketing strategies 
under the agreement ingersoll is relinquishing his stake in 
three companies that publish dozens of daily and weekly newspapers 
to the new york investment firm em warburg pincus amp co the two 
had been joint owners although ingersoll exercised voting control 
warburg pincus gains full control of ingersoll newspapers inc 
which publishes nine dailies and 53 weeklies new haven acquisition 
co publisher of the new haven register and community newspapers 
inc which has newspapers mostly in ohio and on new yorks long 
island 
in return ingersoll will gain full control of a group of 
british and irish newspapers that he had owned jointly with 
warburg pincus the newspapers have combined circulations 
exceeding 1 million and annual revenues of 178 million 
in a telephone interview ingersoll said the deal matched his 
desire to get more involved in european publishing and the desire 
of warburg pincus to expand its role in the us market 
the missed bond payment has zero to do with the trade we did 
today ingersoll said the us companies are profitable but no 
one could forsee the collapse of the junk bond market that 
torpedoed the bond issue he said 
nevertheless when asked if he would have preferred to retain 
his us holdings while expanding into europe he responded 
would i like to have them both sure 
ingersolls companies went on an expansion spree with proceeds 
from junk bonds issued by nowcollapsed drexel burnham lambert 
inc the wall street investment bank that once dominated the 
market in junkbond securities 
but the collapse of the junk market in recent months sent the 
price of community newspapers 125 million of 13 percent bonds 
plunging to as low as 40 cents on the dollar that put ingersoll in 
a bind because community newspapers was required to reset terms on 
the bonds to make them trade at 101 
no one ever imagined that the reset would become unworkable 
he said 
community newspapers said it would not make the interest payment 
due july 1 on the 13 percent bonds in addition the company said 
it would not reset the interest rate on those bonds on july 7 as 
it was supposed to do 
those bonds were quoted at about 50 cents on the dollar after 
the announcement down from about 59 cents previously 
in a release announcing the agreement lionel pincus chairman 
and chief executive of warburg pincus said he hoped community 
newspapers would be able to work out its financial problems with 
bondholders 
those bondholders rejected ingersolls proposal earlier this 
year to buy back 80 percent of the bonds at 55 cents on the dollar 
the affiliates of warburg pincus that will own ingersoll 
newspapers and new haven acquisition have more than 3 billion in 
equity capital pincus said 
we are pleased to have agreed upon this transaction with mr 
ingersoll as it will enable our affiliates to use their resources 
to improve and expand the operations of ini and new haven pincus 
said

the cocacola co announced key management 
changes monday including the appointment of m douglas ivester as 
president of the soft drink makers us operations 
the moves were seen by some industry watchers as a glimpse of 
who might be running coke a few years down the road 
we now know with some degree of definitiveness who are the key 
players for the future president and even chairman of the cocacola 
co said jesse meyers publisher of the industry newsletter 
beverage digest 
ivester has been with coke since 1979 and president of the 
companys european community group since june 1989 
he succeeds ira c herbert as president of cocacola usa 
herbert will continue as executive vice president of coke and will 
have corporate responsibility for cocacola usa as well as the 
companys canadian subsidiary 
the company also announced that john hunter currently a senior 
vice president at coke and president of the companys pacific 
group will be given additional responsibilities as deputy to john 
w georgas who heads the international business sector 
ralph h cooper president of the northwest european division 
will succeed ivester as president of the european community group 
the changes are effective aug 1 
meanwhile coke said monday that donald r keough president and 
chief operating officer will remain in his job until fall 1993 
two years beyond the companys customary retirement age of 65 this 
decision had been announced to cocacola management about two 
months ago and was widely known within the company said 
spokesman randy donaldson 
the management changes are part of the companys natural 
evolution donaldson said 
meyers said the 43yearold ivester was instrumental in 
improving cokes european distribution system the european 
community group which accounts for nearly onefourth of cokes 
international gallon sales recorded 11 percent gallonsales growth 
last year 
any objective analysis will show you this man is on a heady 
track at the cocacola co meyers said from his office in 
greenwich conn his financial background is excellent and now 
his operational skills are excellent 
hunter 52 also has had success at cocacola meyers said 
running various division since joining the company in 1967 
meyers said he is clearly marked as one of the major 
international executives who in a relatively short time will be a 
key corporate executive hugh s zurkuhlen an analyst who 
follows cocacola for salomon bros in new york agreed that the 
three men involved in mondays announcement are candidates for the 
future leadership of the company 
i think thats the issue with coke over the next five years 
who will rise to the upper echelon some of the very senior guys at 
coke are getting older zurkuhlen said 
coke chairman roberto c goizueta is 58 while keough is 63 and 
herbert is 62 
meyers said the confirmation that keough would be staying on was 
welcome news 
at the moment the cocacola co without donald keough as 
chief operating officer is unimaginable meyers said if you 
open up your window you can hear 155 cocacola bottlers breathing 
a collective sigh of relief they idolize him

the nations manufacturing economy grew for the 
third consecutive month in june according to an influential survey 
of corporate purchasing executives 
it indicates that the manufacturing sector is not so weak as 
to suggest that a recession is drawing near said john lonski 
chief economist for moodys investors service inc 
other economists were less optimistic pointing out that 
manufacturing accounts for only about 20 percent of the economy 
david hale chief economist at kemper financial services inc in 
chicago said the key to avoiding a recession is consumer spending 
which comprises about twothirds of the nations economic activity 
if consumers continue to be cautious or cut their spending further 
it could spell trouble he said 
the manufacturing survey is taken monthly by the national 
association of purchasing management which includes chief 
purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies 
the group said its purchasing managers index rose slightly in 
june to 511 percent from 507 in may a reading above 50 indicates 
the economy generally is expanding below 50 that it generally is 
contracting 
june marked the third straight month the index was above 50 the 
11 previous months the index declined 
the index a composite of survey results on order levels 
prices inventory and other areas averaged 491 percent for the 
first half of the year 
if the june index reading is repeated for the rest of the year 
it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of 
about 19 percent based on past experience the group said from 
its tempe ariz headquarters 
the manufacturing economy ended the second quarter with a 
moderate but solid increase in growth said robert j bretz 
chairman of te groups business survey committee 
hale said the strength in the index is less significant than it 
appears because much if not all of it stemmed from rising car 
production automakers which scaled back production in april 
stepped up manufacturing in may and june he said 
other economists disagreed ken goldstein of the conference 
board a new yorkbased business group said manufacturing overall 
has been picking up strength 
if anything the purchasing managers report might be 
understating the momentum in the industrial sector of the 
economy he said 
lonski said the commercial aircraft industry is the only other 
manufacturing sector aside from autos that was strong but there 
were pockets of strength in other areas such as computers and 
pharmaceuticals he said 
the june survey also included questions on credit conditions of 
the 18 percent of responding members whose companies had sought 
credit from a financial institution since april few said they 
experienced tougher lending restrictions or felt the need to issue 
commercial paper as an alternative to bank loans 
but a number of members said their smaller suppliers or 
customers had trouble obtaining credit 
among the components of the purchasing managers index 
production by the member companies rose for the fifth consecutive 
month although at a lower rate than in may 
new orders placed with the manufacturers also rose for the fifth 
straight month at virtually the same rate as in may new export 
orders increased at a stronger rate than in may 
imports by the manufacturers fell for the second consecutive 
month 
deliveries from suppliers were slower in june for the first time 
in 14 months reflecting increased demand for raw materials and 
lower inventory levels maintained by these suppliers the group 
said 
prices of raw materials bought by the manufacturers rose in june 
for the second time in the last three months and the groups price 
index stood at its highest level since may 1989 
the level of inventories maintained by the manufacturers 
declined for the 19th consecutive month although the rate of 
decline was the lowest since december 1989 
lonski said the inventory decline could be good news if the 
nation enters a recession with little backlog manufacturing would 
have to pick up quickly once the economy resumes strength by 
contrast in the 1982 recession manufacturers particularly 
carmakers were caught with huge inventories that had to be sold 
before they could resume production

britains largest jewelry chain ratners group 
plc on monday announced a friendly 328 million offer for kay 
jewelers inc that would make it the secondlargest jewelry 
retailer in the united states 
kay a 494store retail network based in alexandria va said 
its board of directors endorsed the offer and would recommend that 
shareholders accept it the board controls about a third of kays 
shares 
ratners said it eventually wants to operate 1500 us stores 
representing 10 percent of the fragmented american market the 
addition of kays stores will increase the current number of 
ratners us outlets to 967 ratners said 
the largest jewelry retailer in the united states today is 
zales with 1938 stores owned by canadas peoples jewellers ltd 
kays earnings have suffered recently because of lower consumer 
spending on luxury goods last year kay managed only a 196000 
aftertax profit on sales of 421 million 
but ratners said the acquisition would fit in well with plans to 
expand its us market share it said the kay stores mostly on the 
east and west coasts and in texas would fit in well with sterling 
inc a us jewelry retailer that ratners acquired in 1987 for 
203 million sterlings business is concentrated in the midwest 
ratners said it was offering stock worth 17 a share for kays 
124 million shares the bid places the companys value at 328 
million including the cost of assuming kay debt ratners said 
the british company effectively protected its offer against a 
rival bid by obtaining an option to purchase the kay board of 
directors 346 percent stake outright at the same price of 17 a 
share should another offer materialize 
last year ratners hesitated in an attempt to buy gordons a 
500store us chain and zales its principal us rival 
succeeded with a lower bid 
ratners said it would pay for the takeover partly by selling 
228 million worth of new ratners shares to existing ratners 
shareholders 
after the takeover ratners said it would sell kays marcus

per day and 18 billion cubic meters of natural gas a month in 
april news reports said lost production costs norway up to 200 
million kroner or 31 million a day 
the legal strike began at midnight saturday after lastminute 
bargaining failed to produce agreement union members walked out in 
a dispute with the norwegian confederation of business and industry 
over wages and job protection against automation

standard amp poors corp a major creditrating 
agency on monday downgraded its rating on some of mci 
communication corps debt 
sampp said it lowered by one notch its ratings on mcis senior 
unsecured debt and subordinated debt due to mcis acquisition of 
telecom usa inc another longdistance phone company 
the acquisition which will likely be financed with borrowings 
of up to 15 billion should initially result in a sharp 
deterioration in the capital structure of mci and correspondingly 
higher fixed charges sampp said 
however the merger strengthens mcis position in the rapidly 
growing and profitable smallbusiness phone market it said 
sampp said mci should pay off the acquisitionrelated debt by the 
end of 1993 due to its ability to generate robust cash flow 
mci the nations no 2 longdistance carrier after american 
telephone amp telegraph co announced the merger with atlantabased 
telecom in april 
kathleen keegan a spokeswoman for mci said the company was 
disappointed by the ratings change but noted that the debt affected 
still was considered investment grade 
she also said mci expected to have paid down the debt incurred 
in its buyout of telecom usa in two and a half to three years

crude oil prices dropped in light trading 
monday weakened by word that norways government had moved to end 
a petroleum workers strike but wholesale gasoline prices rose 
slightly because of seasonal driving demand 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for key 
west texas intermediate crude fell 35 cents a barrel to 1672 
subsequent contract months also fell 
brokers attributed the decline largely to developments in the 
dayold norway oil workers walkout which had halted the countrys 
production of 163 million barrels of oil per day 
the strike at first raised speculation of a supply shortage that 
would drive up world prices temporarily and buyers jumped in to 
profit from that possibility 
but when the government issued a backtowork decree and a 
bindingarbitration order the supplyshortage theory was 
discounted and oilmarket speculators drove crude prices back down 
the drop in crude spilled over into the homeheating oil market 
on the new york mercantile exchange wholesale homeheating oil for 
august delivery fell 06 cent per gallon to 4856 cents 
latermonth contracts also fell 
among other refined products traded on the exchange unleaded 
gasoline for august delivery rose 047 cent a gallon to 5668 
cents largely because of what brokers called higher demand for 
gasoline in the summer later contract months were lower 
in natural gas trading the august contract was unchanged at 
1519 per 1000 cubic feet
