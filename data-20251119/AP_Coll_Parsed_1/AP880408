the government will publish stringent 
technical guidelines monday for the random drug testing of federal 
employees in sensitive jobs according to a published report 
the washington post reported in saturdays editions that the 
guidelines will guard against employee cheating by requiring that 
toilet water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of urine temperature 
readings will be taken from the samples to detect substitution 
quoting an unidentified government source the newspaper said 
next weeks printing in the federal register will be followed by a 
certification by health and human services that all federal 
agencies have a drugtesting program that meets the guidelines 
although all agencies have submitted plans outlining who will be 
tested and for what drugs the final certification date was 
unclear agencies will be required to test for cocaine and 
marijuana but may test for pcp opiates and amphetamines 
finally the office of management and budget must estimate the 
cost of implementation to congress before the regulations become 
effective the working estimate is thought to be about 7 
million the paper said 
the new guidelines draw heavily on the experience of the testing 
which has been conducted in the military for the last seven years 
currently the department of transportation is the only 
nonmilitary agency testing employees in sensitive jobs 
the american federation of government employees which has filed 
suit in federal district court in new orleans against earlier 
informal standards contends the random drug testing violates 
workers constitutional rights

the roman catholic church said 
thursday it was suspending its effort to mediate panamas political 
crisis as the first major split appeared in the opposition to gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
marcos g mcgrath the catholic archbishop of panama said in a 
statement he was withdrawing his mediation offer for three reasons 
opposition groups refused to talk to the government until it 
showed it was willing to discuss the departure of noriega 
the archbishop had not received noriegas explicit and 
personal backing of the initiative in writing 
there were no assurances that the four international leaders 
who proposed the talks could be present 
the breakdown came a day after noriega ordered the arrests of 
several leading opponents the general has defied us efforts to 
force his resignation 
in another development banking and diplomatic sources said 
panamas banks would not reopen friday and possibly not next week 
the government said last week it hoped to have banks functioning 
again friday 
police detained 15 people thursday night after using tear gas 
and rubber hoses to break up a march of between 500 and 1000 
antigovernment demonstrators in the western city of david 
civilian sources contacted by telephone said national civic crusade 
members were beaten but there were no immediate reports of serious 
injuries 
a major rift appeared thursday in the antinoriega opposition 
as two parties split from the opposition alliance to form their own 
antigovernment movement 
their leaders argued that us economic sanctions are hurting 
panamas people more than they are damaging noriega and the 
civilian government he controls 
roberto arosemena and mauro zuniga leaders of the popular 
action party announced formation of the popular civic movement in 
a break with the national civic crusade an alliance of about 200 
organizations that has led the 10monthold effort to oust noriega 
they told a news conference their movement also is backed by the 
authentic panamanian party the largest opposition political party 
washington has supported the civic crusade in its effort to 
remove noriega as chief of the 15000member defense forces which 
include the military and police noriega is under indictment in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges which he denies 
zuniga said the new movement rejects any us influence 
for us no recipe that comes from washington has been 
favorable to the panamanians he said the people of the world 
know that the recipes formulated in the imperial capitals the 
united states and the soviet union never are favorable to the 
interests of the people 
he added it is absolutely necessary for gen noriega to 
abandon his post for us this is fundamental 
leaders of the two parties have joined demonstrations strikes 
and other protests of the civic crusade while differing with some 
of its policies and generally favoring a harder line 
popular action for example refused to join the crusade 
authentic panamanians and three other parties in agreeing to the 
proposal for dialogue with the government mediated by the catholic 
church 
the dialogue was proposed by presidents oscar arias of costa 
rica prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain and expresidents 
carlos andres perez of venezuela and daniel oduber of costa rica 
political parties linked most closely with the civic crusade are 
the democratic christians and the liberal republican nationalist 
movement known as molirena 
those two parties the crusade and the united states all 
recognize deposed president eric arturo delvalle as the 
constitutional head of state popular action and the authentic 
panamanian party do not 
noriega orchestrated the ouster of delvalle on feb 26 the day 
after delvalle tried to fire the general 
zuniga brother of a former popular action presidential 
candidate said the movement will center its fight on the 
original principles of the civic crusade 
the united states should not continue economic and military 
action against panama arosemena said the panamanian people 
are capable of solving their own problems 
banking and diplomatic sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said bank would not open friday even on a limited basis 
they said bankers feared the government would use their deposits if 
they reopened 
the government whose deposits in us banks have been frozen 
has not met public payrolls since the crisis began 
the last of 1300 additional us soldiers arrived thursday at 
howard air force base outside panama city completing a buildup 
meant to provide greater security for the panama canal american 
installations and us citizens 
late wednesday the government said it had issued arrest 
warrants for three leading opponents including delvalle who has 
been in hiding in panama 
it also asked interpol the international police organization 
to arrest gabriel lewis galindo a former ambassador to the united 
states and juan b sosa who was delvalles envoy in washington 
and remains there 
in washington the state department said thursday the united 
states would regard any efforts by the noriega regime to attempt 
arrests or prosecutions of president delvalle and the others for 
their activities in urging and supporting us sanctions as the 
unlawful acts of an illegitimate regime

the race for best supporting actor of 1987 
provides academy voters a choice among a perspiring tv reporter a 
steely chicago cop a philandering brooklyn husband a wily new 
york city pimp and a south african martyr 
the nominees are a diverse lot ranging from the first james 
bond to a standup comedian none has ever won an oscar 
sean connery is generally considered the quintessential 007 a 
role that seemed impossible for him to escape but after 30 years 
in films he has finally been recognized for his performance as 
another enforcer the irish beat cop jimmy malone in the 
untouchables 
i thought it was a very clever concept to take the old cop and 
use him as a kind of old dog who teaches a new dog tricks says 
connery of his role as mentor to the young federal agent kevin 
costner 
yet connery is maintaining a classic bond cool over the 
possibility of winning his first oscar to be honest ive never 
really spent much time thinking about it before he said in a 
recent interview i just go on with my work 
neither is he bitter that it has taken the academy some 40 films 
to even nominate him its all a matter of timing and how your 
films and image are presented connery told the hollywood 
reporter there are a lot of my films which im very proud of 
which i think were artistic successes but werent huge box office 
successes like the bond pictures 
theres no chance though that connery will snub the academy if 
he wins itd be important to me and id definitely turn up to 
collect it im not one of those actors whod send along the 
cleaning lady instead 
morgan freeman accomplished the nearimpossible winning a 
nomination in a film released early in the year to scant notice 
his role as vicious fast black in street smart was dynamic 
enough to remain in academy voters minds 
born in memphis and raised in greenwood miss before moving to 
chicago freeman built up an impressive number of stage credits 
before appearing in such films as brubaker teachers and 
marie his performance in street smart prompted this 
outburst from the new yorkers pauline kael is morgan freeman 
the greatest actor in america today 
freeman admits to a rough life while growing up in chicagos 
south side i stole i conned i passed the tests but i was 
scared im not the violent type this contrasts the brutal role 
he plays in street smart 
instead of sliding into delinquency the young freeman found 
himself attracted to acting and sold bottles so he would have 
money to go to the movies 
vincent gardenia chers excitable father in moonstruck has 
been in the new york theater since 1954 and films since 1958 he 
also was a member of the all in the family cast on television 
gardenia was ideal casting as the italian plumber his family 
emigrated from naples and he began acting in new yorks italian 
theater he was delighted with the moonstruck script it was 
the first about an italian family in a long time that you dont see 
shooting killings bombings its about love about family 
denzel washington was cast in cry freedom after a worldwide 
search for an actor to play the vital role of steven biko the 
black leader who was beaten to death by south african police while 
in their custody 
washington admits that his nomination was both a letdown and a 
great honor the letdown came because universal pictures had been 
promoting him for best actor and he had been nominated for a 
golden globe in that category he adds that his reaction wasnt the 
result of an actors ego 
it has more to do with my own feelings about steven biko he 
says i would like to see him in a starring light and i think 
most people do he was not a supporting player 
washington faced an imposing challenge portraying a 
muchadmired even revered figure while making him a believable 
human being 
i dont know how to play a saint he says i couldnt get 
any advice from anyone on how to play a saint so that was no 
problem under richard attenboroughs direction he created a 
portrait of the martyr that was both human and convincing 
washington said the effect of cry freedom on the apartheid 
issue will be on a personal level 
most of the comments ive gotten from people were that they 
didnt know what goes on in south africa he said thats where 
it will have its most important effect i dont think its going to 
make a change in the governments attitude or the attitude of the 
black people there its just a movie commenting on something from 
the outside 
albert brooks the astute reporter and failed anchorman of 
broadcast news is noted for directing himself in films real 
life modern romance lost in america 
brooks a standup comedian before making films says that the 
role of aaron altman was different from his own life i dont 
work in the news business i dont have a 9 to 5 or even a 9 to 9 
job i dont wear suits i dont have friends over a period of 
four months i hung out with a dozen reporters i think what happens 
is you sort of compile little things from everybody

in dusty fields and stadiums across 
panama civilians turn out by the hundreds for military training to 
repel what the government says is an imminent us invasion 
we get political speeches and sometimes we see patriotic 
films said javier ortega a government housing ministry 
employee we do physical training and we have some weapons 
instruction 
the volunteer units called dignity battalions formed and 
have grown since the united states started announcing increases in 
troop strength in the former panama canal zone in midmarch 
there is closeorder drill replete with slogans vowing death on 
behalf of the homeland and questioning the ancestry of all yankees 
about 300 volunteers showed up on one field near the capital 
wednesday night and some said it is one of the smallest battalions 
in the country the battalion in the western city of davis is said 
to have more than 1000 participants 
there is no reliable estimate on participation nationwide 
in one corner of the field an instructor explained the basics of 
an m16 rifle and passed several among his charges 
some but not all handled it uncomfortably 
the americans have them with a grenade launcher attatched do 
we have those too asked one youth 
yes we do the instructor answered patiently hey dont 
point that thing at another comrade 
the government press is predicting loudly that the united states 
will resort to invasion troops to oust panamanian strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega as head of the 15000member panamanian 
defense forces noreiga is the power behind the civilian government 
the united states normally keeps 10000 troops in panama to 
guard the panama canal in midmarch 500 military police were 
added and 1300 more troops arrived this week 
the stated purpose of their openended assignment is to provide 
security for the troops american installations and american 
citizens 
the united states said 800 marines will start arriving friday 
for three weeks of routine jungle training evening papers 
wednesday ballyhooed the planned arrival but neglected to mention 
the short planned stay 
in ships of terror and death contingents of war veterans of 
vietnam and grenada arrive in open plan of aggression and 
intimidation read a headline in the governmentowned matutino 
newspaper 
gringo invaders begin to arrive read a headline in 
wednesdays critica also governmentowned 
a cartoon shows uncle sam fleeing from gunfire from the 
popular forces as the battalions also are known 
the government closed all opposition media more than a month 
ago all that panamanians watch read or hear comes from newspapers 
and broadcast stations owned at least partially by the government 
foreign newspapers brought in by travelers are confiscated at 
the airport 
the volunteer battalions are instructed by defense forces 
troops who appear patient and have their work cut out for them 
most participants appear in their late teens or early to 
mid20s a few are easily 50 many are women and all say they are 
not paid or required to attend the twohour evening sessions held 
seven days a week 
there is no roll call and no apparent other check of who shows 
up 
we fight for our homeland and our dignity the yankees only 
fight for money ortega said 
the instruction and the rhetoric were more reminiscent of 
nicaragua in recent years than a country where americans have been 
welltolerated if not always cherished for most of this century 
the feeling is growing it appears but is far from universal 
in a shabbier sector of downtown panama city a woman held up two 
shotgun shells fired by police during a minor demonstration 
this is what they shoot at the people like they are beasts 
she said as the tear gas lifted weve had it up to here 
panamanians are tired of this we want the gringos to attack 
not tomorrow today 
tonight suggested a young man in a crowd that was gathering 
near two journalists 
but those on the drill field felt otherwise 
we believe an american invasion is close very close said 
frank quintero 
quintero an office holder in the nearby municipality of san 
miguelito speaks sincerely of american bodies going back to their 
home towns and said he is not worried about weapons availability 
in revolutions in mexico cuba nicaragua and el salvador they 
didnt worry about weapons he said they took them from their 
dead enemies

a curious new program is going out over 
polands state radio every monday morning 
its called the west speaks and it is composed entirely of 
excerpts of polishlanguage broadcasts by radio free europe the 
voice of america the british broadcasting corp and other western 
radio stations 
the segments are broadcast without comment or counterpoint but 
since the program went on the air the polish media and officials 
have criticized the western broadcasts with greater frequency 
the western stations always have been characterized here as 
hostile propaganda tools but the communist government says the 
west speaks is one way to counter the influence of the broadcasts 
that deliver a mixture of uncensored news features and commentary 
poland stopped the electronic jamming of western broadcasts jan 
1 and poles now can freely tune in to them 
but government authorities have been raising the question of 
their fairness with western officials including the director of 
the us information agency charles z wick who was here on a 
visit in march 
the authorities say that in the struggle for the hearts and 
minds of the polish people they cannot afford to overlook the 
influence of the western stations 
it doesnt matter how many people listen to it when it is 
something very dangerous government spokesman jerzy urban said 
in an interview even if its only 100 people that is enough 
because the report will spread 
at one time particularly during the cold war years in the 
1950s it was a crime to listen to the western stations 
today however the strains of yankee doodle dandy the 
signon tune of the voice of america can be heard coming from 
apartments in housing blocks 
urban said polish authorities believed that countering the 
broadcasts with polemics and arguments was better than 
continuing the jamming 
a public opinion poll quoted by the official news agency pap 
said 80 percent of respondents approved the decision to end the 
jamming but it said the number of listeners has not risen 
significantly 
how many people actually listen remains a matter of dispute 
according to a survey quoted by urban the percentage of poles 
who listen to radio free europe either regularly or occasionally is 
16 percent up 2 percentage points since jamming ended only 3 
percent or 12 million out of the population of 375 million 
listen as often as once a week he said 
but the board for international broadcasting the body that 
oversees radio free europe in munich west germany says 59 percent 
of poles listen to its broadcasts occasionally and nearly 14 
percent at least once a week 
an informal survey of half a dozen warsaw residents indicated 
that most preferred the voice of america or the bbc to radio free 
europe known as rfe on grounds that their information was more 
reliable 
recent rfe broadcasts were heavy with reports of demonstrations 
and protests in poland speeches and statements by leaders of the 
outlawed solidarity trade union and accounts of opposition 
activities in other countries of the soviet bloc 
the west speaks was conceived to show what sort of 
argumentation is used by these stations said witold stankowski 
an executive of polish radio one 
he said the show which premiered in october was given a time 
slot when we have a pretty good audience but said he could not 
judge its popularity or say how long it would be continued 
in recent months a drumbeat of commentaries have shown up on the 
pap service and in staterun newspapers disputing specific news 
items on the western stations urban has made denunciations of the 
broadcasts almost a fixture at his weekly news conferences 
in the interview urban noted that listenership tends to rise in 
times of public anxiety such as during the 1986 chernobyl nuclear 
accident in the soviet union 
he claimed rfes disgraceful methods frightened people in 
its reports on chernobyl and in its coverage of polands 
announcement in late january of price increases totaling 42 percent 
in 1988 
radio free europe presents the opinion that prices in fact 
will go up twice as much he said they want to cause and 
really do cause an increase in wage demands 
us ambassador john davis defends the broadcasts 
the great bulk of what goes out seems to me to be a repetition 
of what already has been published in the west he said it is 
broadcast in sometimes with comment and comment is fair game 
wick the usia director who arrived in poland on march 23 for a 
series of talks with polish officials said the polish side raised 
objections about radio free europe and the voice of america and the 
complaints were discussed very forthrightly 
wick said the voice of america which is part of usia and radio 
free europe which is privately opeated but largely funded by the 
us government have charters that mandate that they be 
objective and accurate 
i invited the authorities to give me specific instances when 
they were not he said 
he added that editorials on radio free europe and the voice of 
america are not intended to be objective but to reflect the 
editorial viewpoint of the united states government 
as such he said they might not be pleasing to poland

the ladies of the club women always stung 
for presents society are throwing a bash today and as usual the 
guests of honor are themselves 
the dozen or so retired school secretaries plan to treat 
themselves to a fancy lunch toast their single status and present 
themselves with an extra special gift 
thats for the years and years of giving presents to their 
married friends but never getting anything back 
this is really to treat ourselves because no one else really 
has explained betty kieffer 63 whos serving as the queen or 
organizer of todays gathering of the society otherwise known as 
wasps 
oh lordy every time you turn around youre giving gifts 
wedding gifts and baby gifts and shower gifts you couldnt begin 
to count them youre giving all the time but youre not getting 
anything in return said alma eck mullen 81 a founding member 
of the 38yearold society 
miss kieffer is giving herself a new white coat mrs mullen a 
widow who married late in life is celebrating with a watch on a 
necklace 
gifts can be whatever the women need or want over the years 
presents have included diamond rings new cars houses european 
vacations even a custommade girdle 
she was quite a heavy girl and she could never get a girdle to 
fit her so she had one made mrs mullen said thursday 
each woman writes a poem to herself naturally and gives 
herself a card that reads i love me they also sing this peppy 
tune 
thats where our moneys spent on all the gals who went we 
bought them everything to keep them supplied we think the time is 
due to get a gift or two so wasps lets see what you brought you 
the conversation covers just about everything except for 
children grandchildren and of course men 
thats why its so nice i dont have to listen to stories 
about everybodys wonderful grandchildren miss kieffer said 
laughing 
the members ranging in age from their mid50s to late 80s have 
been gathering every april since 1950 when mrs mullen and 23 
other neverwed secretaries for the pittsburgh public schools 
decided enough was enough 
they formed the society after learning about a similar group in 
des moines iowa to be eligible women had to be single and 
employed as a secretary for the pittsburgh public schools for at 
least 10 years 
if you were married somebody would have had some plush party 
for you so that was it wed be the contributors mrs mullen 
said but you could be married after that because once a wasp 
always a wasp 
howard carroll a spokesman for the national education 
association says the society likely has its roots in the days when 
female teachers in some parts of the country were barred from 
saying i do 
they just extended themselves through their kids in school 
he said 
the women always stung for presents society grew to more than 60 
members around 1970 but has since dwindled to 14 seven of them 
founding members two women are now married mrs mullen is the 
only widow 
a lot of them members have died mrs mullen said 
secretaries nowadays simply arent interested 
they dont want to have that brand jane viehman 69 said 
to say theyve been working for 10 years and they arent married 
i guess its terrible it doesnt bother me but it does some 
people 
the society meets once a year on april fools day the date was 
pushed back this year since good friday fell on april 1 
the restaurant gettogethers are mandatory and planned months in 
advance members who can drive pick up those who cant just about 
everybody comes freshly coiffed and sporting a new outfit 
we enjoy seeing each other because who knows who will be there 
next year miss kieffer said 
our girls are all getting older mrs mullen agreed but 
we always say if theres one left that one will go well keep it 
up

a jury on thursday convicted former us 
rep sam steiger of theft by extortion for threatening a parole 
board member to get his vote on a personnel matter while serving in 
the evan mecham administration 
any time you go to court you can expect a guilty verdict but 
its difficult to believe steiger said in the courtroom moments 
after the jury returned its verdict 
steiger who was a top aide to the nowousted republican 
governor was accused of threatening ron johnson a member of the 
state board of pardons and paroles 
steiger allegedly threatened to withhold permission for johnson 
to work as a parttime tempe justice of the peace and to remove him 
from the board unless he voted to retain as executive director 
patricia costello a mecham appointee 
judge ronald reinstein of maricopa county superior court 
scheduled a may 6 sentencing for the 59yearold steiger who faces 
up to five years in prison 
asked whether the verdict would be appealed defense attorney 
thomas karas said well take it one step at a time steiger 
said thats up to counsel 
jury foreman greg jones a fire captain in suburban mesa said 
the deciding factor behind the verdict was the tapes of the phone 
call between steiger and johnson johnson called steiger at home 
from the office of the state attorney general who taped the call 
during testimony monday steiger denied that he threatened 
johnson or told him how he should vote 
but the state alleged that steiger followed up on the alleged 
threat in a letter and a telephone conversation after johnson voted 
with the board majority to seek ms costellos resignation 
the board voted 43 that ms costello should step down because 
of low staff morale 
steiger a former fiveterm congressman testified that he did 
suggest that johnson should back ms costello but denied that he 
tried to steal johnsons vote by threatening his job 
karas had asked reinstein to declare a mistrial contending the 
conviction of mecham at his state senate impeachment trial monday 
might prejudice jurors against steiger however reinstein ruled 
that great care had been taken to select unbiased jurors 
steiger gave up his 3rd congressional district seat in 1976 to 
run unsuccessfully for the us senate as a republican

independent counsel lawrence e walsh is being 
attacked in opposite directions by the irancontra defendants with 
one claiming he improperly ignored congressional testimony and the 
other three saying he illegally used it 
attorneys representing former national security adviser john m 
poindexter lt col oliver l north and arms dealer albert hakim 
moved thursday to dismiss the indictment against them claiming 
walsh illegally relied on testimony the three gave last year to the 
irancontra congressional committees after being granted limited 
immunity because of the immunity grants walsh was required to 
collect all of his evidence independently 
north piondexter and hakim claim that given the massive 
publicity surrounding the hearings walshs case was inevitably 
tainted by exposure to their immunized regardless of efforts to 
insulate investigators and grand jurors from that evidence 
but lawyers for retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
the fourth defendant claim that walsh unfairly ignored the 
congressional testimony of north and poindexter they say that 
testimony would have led the grand jury to decline to name their 
client in the 23count indictment 
secord who brokered the arms sales with hakim was the lead 
witness at last years televised hearings of the house and senate 
irancontra committees and testified without any immunity 
all four defendants are accused of conspiring to divert profits 
illegally from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
the socalled use immunity grants conferred by congress on 
north poindexter and hakim prohibit walsh from using evidence 
obtained directly or indirectly from their congressional testimony 
walsh imposed special precautions to prevent his staff and the 
grand jury from being exposed to the extensive publicity 
surrounding the hearings prosecutors and grand jurors alike were 
told to ignore news reports or conversations with friends about the 
hearings 
evidence was filed under seal in us district court to prove 
that it was obtained independently of the immunized testimony 
but in pleadings filed with us district judge gerhard a 
gesell lawyers for north poindexter and hakim said those 
precautions were not enough 
never in the history of this nation has the immunized 
testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live on all major 
networks to tens of millions of viewers and listeners the 
defense said 
given the widespread dissemination of immunized testimony 
throughout our society the broad use of immunized testimony has 
been inevitable undeniable and so pervasive that the indictment 
must be dismissed as a matter of law the defense argued 
as an alternative to dismissing the charges the defense asked 
gesell to conduct a hearing to determine if immunized congressional 
testimony influenced walshs investigation 
the defense says it wants to question grand jurors to determine 
if they learned about the congressional hearings from friends 
relatives or news broadcasts or from grand jury witnesses 
secords lawyers are taking a different course they contend 
that walsh unfairly refused to consider the congressional testimony 
of north and poindexter which they contend would vindicate their 
client of any wrongdoing 
the grand jury should have had an opportunity to consider this 
testimony before returning an indictment against secord his 
lawyers said 
the independent counsels decision to exalt prosecutorial 
convenience above general secords fifth amendment right to a fair 
and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and 
requires as a matter of fundamental fairness that the indictment 
be dismissed secords lawyers said 
gesell has scheduled a hearing next tuesday to discuss the 
immunity issue which could take months to resolve

extremely shy children and those who are very 
outgoing may be responding to a biological rhythm set at birth and 
continued throughout life researchers say in a study published 
today 
a scientist from yale and two from harvard said in a study 
published in the journal science that extremely inhibited children 
experience a more rapid heart beat a dilation of the pupils and 
increased muscular tension when they encounter novel experiences or 
social stresses 
it appears that a small percentage of children are born with a 
biological disposition that would tend to make them shy and this 
is independent of what the parent has or has not done said 
steven reznick a yale university psychologist 
although the study postulated a biological constitution for 
shyness reznick emphasized that this finding in no way indicates 
that the shy child will not be successful 
they learn to compensate reznick said they may learn 
strategies that would make them appear not to be shy 
reznick and harvard university researchers jerome kagan and 
nancy snidman drew these conclusions from a series of tests that 
followed a group of children from the age 20 months to 7 years 
ms snidman said in an interview that the scientists determined 
which children were extremely shy and which were outgoing by 
observing their response to novel situations in a playroom 
does the child immediately go to the center of the room and 
start playing or does the child stay close to the mother if a 
stranger walks in does the child retreat to his mother or go over 
and approach the stranger said ms snidman 
the researchers also observed how the children reacted to new 
toys to youngsters unknown to them and how often the children 
spoke 
if you took a random sample of children you would find about 
10 percent at either end of the scale ms snidman said the 
rest of the children will do a little of both thats most 
children 
after identifying the shy and the outgoing children the 
researchers tested them for physiological reactions they found 
that the shy youngsters tended to have faster heart rates that 
accelerated more rapidly in the presence of novel situations heart 
rates for the uninhibited children were among the lowest 
shy children also experienced marked dilation of the pupils a 
rise in a body chemical that is produced during stress and a 
change in the voice quality caused by muscle tenseness 
this fundamental pattern remained consistent through all the 
years of the study said ms snidman although as these children 
grow older you see the behavior responses in different ways 
when the children were 7 the scientists conducted a party for 
three shy youngsters another three who were uninhibited and four 
who were in between 
we find that the children whom we classified as inhibited at 
20 months were the children in this party situation who tended to 
stay a little distant from the other children and not talk as much 
in the free play situation said ms snidman 
although it has yet to be demonstrated by study reznick said 
it would seem reasonable to believe that the biological 
differences would continue through life 
but such a person said ms snidman can learn to cope very 
well 
some children who are very inhibited have parents who are very 
understanding and deal with it very well she said those 
children look less inhibited as they get older 
the shy child may be very successful in school said ms 
snidman they are quiet and attentive teachers love them

as if britains yuppies didnt have enough to 
worry about in the fallout from the stock market crash theyre now 
faced with anarchists plotting a national antiyuppie day 
adding to the misery of yuppie job losses pay cuts and 
dwindling stock portfolios is class war an anarchists group 
which announced a 22city rock concert tour in britain for august 
dubbed rock against the rich 
it said in a statement made available thursday to the associated 
press that it hopes the tour will culminate in an antiyuppie 
extravaganza on sept 10 
just who class war is has never been clear its not a club 
you join said a sympathizer who gave his name only as sean 
nor has the size of its membership been divulged 
group members sometimes surface in anticapitalist stunts like a 
1984 campaign in which bank windows were smashed a smoke bomb 
exploded near the bank of england and about 470 people were 
arrested 
but why pick on yuppies class war explained all over 
britain a plague of yuppies are descending on workingclass 
communities like locusts the time to resist is now lets rock 
against the rich 
in a telephone interview sean said it was because people have 
been pushed out from areas where they have always lived because of 
greed on the part of speculators because it isnt possible to 
afford to buy somewhere to live in london unless you have a hell of 
a lot of money 
the story of the antiyuppie campaign was broken appropriately 
enough in the independent newspaper londons newest daily and a 
favorite among yuppies its goodnatured report thursday on class 
wars manifesto said with this defiant if ungrammatical 
declaration a new musical movement has been launched 
but the newspaper wrote rock against the rich seems very 
unlikely to raise anything like the level of support given by 
musicians and audiences to the antifascist rock against racism in 
the 1970s or prolabor party red wedge rock tours before the last 
general election 
the concerts are to be held in cities like edinburgh scotland 
and exeter england whose rundown inner areas are being 
gentrified by wealthy young newcomers sean said 
an exception is guildford the heart of the stockbroker belt 
south of london where the concert has been dubbed rock against 
stockbrokers 
the planned antiyuppie days main attraction is an outdoor rock 
concert in the docklands in londons east end where gentrifiers 
have been clashing with the local residents the group said 
docklands developers say they have rescued the area from 
irreversible decline and provided affordable housing for local 
residents 
joe strummer previously guitarist with the clash a 1970s rock 
group has agreed to join the tour as well as other less 
wellknown musicians class war said 
the group is targeting yuppies because they come off flaunting 
wealth when theres none there to start with sean said 
londons yuppie class grew visibly during big bang the huge 
deregulation of britains financial markets in 1986 expanding 
investment firms paid top money to attract brokers and bankers and 
many yuppiehaters reacted with glee to the stock market crash last 
october 
britain still suffers from class antagonisms and the tugofwar 
between capitalism and socialism continues unabated 
some see class war as just another manifestation of british 
eccentricity others see a more sinister side in the groups 
reported support for taxing yuppies by mugging and burglarizing 
them 
class war is tapping real feeling in the east end nick 
cohen who wrote about the group for the independent said in a 
telephone interview 
but its hard to know what their real influence is opinions 
vary on the left about whether they are publicityseeking idiots or 
whether they are doing anything even on the far left 
their rhetoric is quite nasty cohen added nobody else 
political groups will have anything to do with them

a hearing on a commuter airline crash 
that killed 18 people focused thursday on why the federal aviation 
administration reduced a staff members recommendation of a 
250000 fine to 16500 
the faa official had recommended the fine against ryan air 
service for more about 250 safety and records violations the 
airline has been cited or fined several times for paperwork and 
safety violations in recent years 
a tailheavy overloaded ryan air beech 1900 crashed nov 23 at 
the homer airport in the countrys worst commuter airline crash in 
19 years eighteen people died and only three survived 
national transporation safety board members and their aides 
spent thursday questioning faa employees about the crash the 10th 
ryan air accident in eight years four involved fatalities 
ryan air now seeking protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws was grounded in january as part of a 
consent agreement with the faa before the agreement ryan air was 
alaskas largest commuter airline serving more than 80 cities and 
communities 
the investigators tried to piece together why three of the 
companys pilots who volunteered to provide records concerning 
overloaded flights in exchange for immunity were rebuffed by the 
faa one of the pilots robert deliman was killed in the homer 
crash 
lou gossen an faa operations inspector said he conducted a 
weeklong inspection in february 1987 and found scores of 
discrepancies in record keeping pilot competency checks and 
training records he recommended a 250000 civil penalty 1000 
per violation 
thats the largest civil penalty ive ever recommended he 
testified i felt like a high civil penalty would have more or as 
much impact as a flight certificate suspension 
his former boss richard gordon testified he supported the 
recommendation 
the suggested fine was passed up the line but was bounced back 
with instructions to gather more evidence gossen said he again 
submitted the recommendation it was rejected by former faa 
regional counsel donald boberick 
gossen said he tried again reducing the suggested penalty to 
25000 boberick reduced the fine to 16500 
thomas westall the faas director of flight standards in 
anchorage told the board the proposed fine was reduced because of 
purely legal defects 
courts in the past have not supported the notion of a 1000 
fine per violation he said 
westall said he first supported the proposed 250000 fine but 
then changed his mind after talking with boberick in this case 
he convinced me westall said 
the 16500 fine will not be assessed unless the airline again 
gets airborne faa spokesman paul steucke said 
despite his airlines history of problems wilfred ryan jr who 
was forced from his position as president of ryan air by the 
january consent order testified wednesday his company had been the 
target of faa harassment 
ryan air was our largest carrier so they got a larger part of 
our inspections gordon said thursday i dont think ryan air 
was over inspected because of the size and complexity of their 
operation 
after the november crash the airline was cited by the faa for 
flying beech 1900s that were tailheavy at least four times in the 
month before the fatal accident

the reagan administration must answer tough 
questions about whether its support for the nicaraguan contra 
rebels led it to wink at multimilliondollar drug deals sen john 
f kerry says 
the foreign relations subcommittee headed by kerry dmass has 
heard a week of testimony about the daring nighttime flights and 
huge profits made by cocaine and marijuana traffickers along with 
allegations that us officials knew about some of the trafficking 
but did nothing to halt it 
two convicted drug smugglers testified thursday that weapons 
were illegally flown to costa rica for the contras and hundreds of 
pounds of cocaine were brought back on the return flights the 
contras have denied that they were involved in illegal drug 
trafficking 
i think it is important to look at the link between the 
contras and drugs kerry said thursday but this is not meant 
to be focused on the contra effort the issue is whether a specific 
foreign policy goal aiding the contras assumed a largerthanlife 
importance so that some things were permitted that should not have 
been 
kerry chairs the foreign relations subcommittee on narcotics and 
terrorism which is investigating the relationship between latin 
american governments and the drug trade 
i think what weve shown is that there is an enormous amount 
more that needs to be done to improve enforcement of the drug 
laws said kerry you cant ever stop it but you can slow it 
down with more effective enforcement 
gary betzner who is serving a 27year prison sentence for drug 
trafficking testified thursday that he had twice flown planeloads 
of weapons from florida to costa rica in july 1984 the weapons 
were replaced with hundreds of pounds of cocaine he said 
as betzner described his career flying illegal drugs from south 
america he described a series of highrisk trips in which he flew 
at wavetop level to avoid radar 
he said that on one occasion he entered miami by flying between 
highrise condominium buildings along the citys coastline on 
another occasion he said mechanical and navigational troubles 
forced him to fly over cuba where he was chased by mig19 jets 
until he dived down to treetop level 
the profits were huge according to betzner who said he was 
paid to 200000 per planeload for delivering drugs to the united 
states 
betzners story was echoed by george morales a colombian native 
who says he began dealing drugs in 1979 within several years he 
had made enough money to build an empire that included a fleet of 
10 to 15 planes helicopters and speedy boats 
betzner is serving a 27year prison term for cocaine 
trafficking while morales is doing a 16year term for his 
conviction on the same charge 
morales said he gave the contras several million dollars 
from his drug profits on one occasion he estimated the amount at 
between 3 million and 4 million but he later said the figure was 
5 million to 6 million 
morales also said he arranged six times between 1984 and 1986 to 
ship weapons from the united states to the contras because he said 
contra officials who claimed to be cia operatives promised to try 
to get drug charges dropped against him 
both morales and betzner said the weapons were delivered to an 
airstrip near a northern costa rican ranch owned by john hull an 
american who has been linked to both the contras and the cia 
hull met the plane each time and watched as the small arms 
including m16 rifles mines and c4 explosives were unloaded 
betzner said the plane was then loaded with cocaine betzner said 
and he flew back to florida he estimated that he carried about 500 
kilograms 1100 pounds of cocaine on each return flight 
abc news on thursday described a network that it said shipped 
eastern european arms to the contras and latin american drugs to 
the united states 
citing unidentified us panamanian and israeli sources the 
network said that from 1983 to 1986 israeli agents with us 
financial support purchased arms in poland and czechoslovakia 
shipped them from yugoslavia to bolivia and on to panama 
from there the network said the arms were flown to contra 
supply drops in el salvador and costa rica abc said the same 
planes and pilots then flew illegal drugs from panama and colombia 
to the united states 
the network said the operation was launched with 20 million in 
israeli government money which was later reimbursed from us 
covert funds 
abc said michael harreri an israeli liaison who also served as 
an aide to panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega was the 
middleman it said former cia agent felix rodriguez was the 
american connection 
abc said the israeli government denied thursday that it supplied 
arms to the contras and rodriguez has denied he was involved in 
such a supply network

national democratic chairman paul g kirk jr 
says he wants to minimize the clash of interest groups so his party 
can draft a 1988 platform that democrats can run with and not shy 
away from 
but michigan gov james j blanchard chairman of the platform 
committee says at least one interest group will be courted this 
year the business community 
they think socially they have to be republicans for whatever 
reason but the majority are really independent people blanchard 
said i would like to see special efforts with the business 
community 
kirk and blanchard said thursday there will be state and 
regional platform hearings around the country over the next two 
months 
some interest groups said they welcomed this news since kirk 
earlier suggested there might be only two in washington and 
atlanta 
but they scoffed at what they called an effort to keep 
controversial planks out of the platform 
we are concerned about statements that they did not wish to 
cater to special interests they want to open up the process and to 
bring in new groups said molly yard president of the national 
association for women 
it seems to us that business is also a special interest and 
we dont understand quite how women who are over half the 
population can be categorized as a special interest 
kirk and blanchard pledged to draft a lean document and avoid 
the kind of divisive battles that have marked previous efforts at 
writing party platforms 
id like to think that someone will read it other than 
opponents blanchard said the platform is more than just what 
michael dukakis or jesse jackson thinks it has to be one all 
democrats are comfortable with 
even so kirk said that jackson would have significant 
representation on the platform committee regardless of who 
becomes the party nominee he called jacksons campaign an 
important constructive force within the democratic party 
at the same time kirk seemed to soften suggestions he made last 
december that platform writers would avoid emotionally charged 
issues on which there was not common agreement 
he vowed thursday the party would not sound a retreat from 
issues it had championed in the past including the equal rights 
amendment and abortion rights 
asked specifically about abortion kirk said i think our 
party has always embraced the rights of privacy the rights of 
individual choice 
however he tempered his comments by saying that such issues 
can be addressed in a way without being divisive or 
controversial 
i think we can put together a platform that a national 
audience can respond to and that all elected democratic officials 
can run with and not shy away from kirk said 
i would have been much happier if he said we will of course 
keep equal rights and abortion planks said eleanor smeal 
president of the fund for the feminist majority 
turning to the democratic campaign kirk joined new york gov 
mario cuomo in urging sen albert gore jr to tone down his 
negative campaigning he called cuomos admonition to the tennessee 
senator to stop criticizing jackson and dukakis helpful and on 
course 
kirk also reiterated his view that cuomo would not become a 
presidential candidate even in a brokered convention there is a 
game going on on the field he said thats where the nominees 
going to be be chosen from

spring is in the air and so is courting 
especially among the democratic presidential hopefuls as they woo 
the partys unpledged delegates to the national convention 
faced with the possibility that the primary process will not 
produce a clearcut delegate leader the candidates are focusing on 
the 645 super delegates who could tip the balance in atlanta 
july 1821 
campaign brochures news clippings and position papers fill the 
mailboxes of the super delegates 25 governors 362 democratic 
national committee members 253 members of congress and five elder 
statesmen who could push a candidate closer to the 2082 total 
needed to nominate 
some campaigns rely on phone calls such as those made to 
patricia russell a democratic national committeewoman from keene 
nh who remains uncommitted 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis phoned twice and his wife 
kitty called too tennessee sen albert gore jrs staff called as 
well mrs russell says she has heard from all the candidates 
except jesse jackson 
since last fall the dukakis campaign has been laying the 
foundation with the super delegates through phone calls mailings 
and personal contact said delegate counter tad devine in recent 
weeks aides have stepped up the pressure 
its much more focused an intense effort devine said 
when it looks like hes pulling away at that time well seek 
a more formal pledge of support 
the gore campaign has relied on congressional communication on 
capitol hill as well as phone calls and mailings to the delegates 
said richard hutcheson delegate counter for the senator 
theres great potential among the super delegates said 
hutcheson who describes the field as fertile territory for his 
candidate the super delegates are most interested in a ticket 
that can win 
the jackson forces however are just getting started in their 
campaign for super delegates 
i looked into what kind of a strategy he had to deal with them 
and who he had doing it said john white former chairman of the 
democratic national committee who is advising jackson it turns 
out they apparently had very little theres some mail being passed 
back and forth 
its something they have to do and theyre probably very late 
in doing it he said 
rep mickey leland of texas a member of the congressional black 
caucus said last week he will lead the jackson effort to court the 
super delegates 
the front line is the congressional black caucus to talk 
to our colleagues in our states to lobby people who are super 
delegates leland said 
jackson contends that if he leads in pledged delegates after the 
last primaries on june 7 he deserves the support of the super 
delegates and should get the nomination 
we know that the super votes give rise to super delegates 
jackson said last week after meeting with a select group of 
democratic leaders the delegates must respect and respond to the 
will of the people 
if we do not believe that why have a primary have a 
superdelegate convention and let the super delegates choose 
someone of their own he said 
willie brown california assembly speaker and jacksons national 
campaign chairman said the campaign would use primary results to 
convince the super delegates 
we will take the popular vote in their state or their district 
and say this is a factor you should consider brown said 
the constant communication by telephone and by mail is all 
too familiar to some super delegates

attorney general edwin meeses choice to 
become the no 2 official in the justice department is under fire 
for his membership in an allmale athletic club and an allwhite 
country club 
it makes it hard to imagine hell be able to administer 
justice in government in a way thats nondiscriminatory when in 
his own personal life he doesnt live up to that patricia 
ireland executive vice president of the national organization for 
women said of john c shepherd 
the senate judiciary committee will vote on whether to confirm 
shepherd as deputy attorney general if president reagan goes ahead 
and nominates him committee members said thursday that it is too 
soon to comment on shepherds membership in the missouri athletic 
club which has no female members and the bellerive country club 
which has no blacks both are in the st louis area 
shepherd 62 a st louis attorney could not be reached for 
comment thursday he was not in his office and his home phone 
number is unlisted but on wednesday he told the st louis 
postdispatch he had not yet decided whether he should resign from 
the clubs 
i havent made up my mind on whether that would be 
necessary he told the newspaper i am going to washington for 
nine months to help the attorney general as his deputy 
shepherd said he told meese and other justice department 
officials about his club memberships in conversations in washington 
earlier this week he added that the fbi is aware of this 
in the same interview shepherd also said he was confident he 
would be cleared by the fbi of allegations that he had an affair 
with a former bookkeeper at his firm and that he had authorized her 
to write 147000 in checks to herself 
he added that the allegations by denise sinner 29 of st 
peters mo are absolutely untrue and unfounded 
sinner was convicted last month in st louis circuit court on 
charges of making false statements and stealing more than 100000 
from shepherds law firm shepherd sandberg amp phoenix 
sinners attorney darrill s beebe said thursday he was 
surprised when he heard that meese had chosen shepherd for a top 
justice department post however he said he and sinner would 
testify before the senate judiciary committee about shepherd only 
if were subpoenaed were not volunteering 
shepherd a former president of the american bar association 
was tapped by meese on tuesday to fill the deputy attorney 
generals job following the march 29 protest resignation of arnold 
burns 
burns quit along with assistant attorney general william weld 
because of concerns that the 11month criminal investigation of 
meese was dragging down the justice department department sources 
have said 
meese left wednesday on a trip to latin america to discuss 
antidrug efforts 
shepherds memberships in the missouri athletic club and the 
bellerive country club were first reported by nbc news jim baer a 
spokesman for the athletic club in downtown st louis confirmed 
thursday that shepherd is a member and said the club founded in 
1904 does not accept women 
arthur wright president of the country club in suburban st 
louis said shepherd has been a member there since 1970 there 
are no black members wright said but our bylaws specify that 
the club is open to everybody 
wright said however that membership in the country club is 
through invitation only and to the best of my knowledge no black 
has ever been proposed for membership 
a spokeswoman for the american bar association gail alexander 
said the groups code of conduct prohibits members who are judges 
from belonging to private clubs that practice invidious 
discrimination 
ms alexander said the aba also has a policy that prohibits 
meetings from being held in such private clubs 
the issue of membership in exclusionary clubs has arisen before 
with mixed results president carters nominee for attorney 
general griffin bell told the judiciary committee during his 
confirmation hearings he would resign from such clubs president 
reagans first attorney general william french smith refused to 
follow that example and was confirmed anyway 
more recently us circuit judge anthony kennedy resigned from 
membership in two exclusionary clubs when his name was first 
mentioned as a possible nominee for the supreme court he was 
subsequently confirmed as a justice

nasa says the first space shuttle to fly since 
the challenger accident will be equipped with the equivalent of a 
firemans pole so astronauts can slide to safety if the craft has 
to ditch in the ocean 
the national aeronautics and space administration chose the pole 
escape method thursday over an alternative that would have used 
rockets to propel the crew away from the shuttle discovery in an 
emergency 
by sliding down the pole the astronauts would clear the 
shuttles tail before parachuting into the sea nasa says 
for all the strength that allows the shuttle to withstand the 
buffeting that accompanies a climb or descent through the 
atmosphere the vehicle probably could not survive a crash landing 
on the ocean 
the telescoping pole was selected as it has shown to be safer 
simpler to operate lighter weight and easier to support than the 
tractor rocket system said arnold d aldrich a top shuttle 
program official 
barbara selby a nasa spokeswoman said the 10foot pole 
already is being installed in discovery and will be ready for the 
first flight scheduled for aug 4 
the aluminum and steel pole weighs 241 pounds 70 pounds lighter 
than the rocket system 
moreover top nasa officials have said all along they were 
uncomfortable with storing explosive rockets in the crew cabin 
the rogers commission which investigated the 1986 challenger 
accident found that no escape method would have saved the seven 
astronauts who died in that explosion but it said the crew 
should have a means of escaping the orbiter in controlled gliding 
flight 
the pole is intended for just such a purpose if the shuttle had 
to ditch either on an aborted launching or on return from space 
the pole would be extended out the side hatch and the crew would 
attach themselves to it with rings on their parachutes and slide 
down one at a time 
during launch and landing the unextended pole will be pointed 
toward the hatch it will be stowed while the shuttle is in orbit 
the challenger astronauts died during ascent while the solid 
rocket boosters were still firing and attached to the shuttle 
engineers say the new escape system cannot be used while the 
shuttle is connected to the rockets 
this decision completes the crew escape system package a 
nasa statement said the agency already has replaced the 
spacecrafts hatch so it can be jettisoned with explosive bolts and 
it is installing a partial pressure suit oxygen equipment a 
parachute a life raft and survival equipment for each crew 
member 
under the rocket system the astronauts would have to jettison 
the hatch and onebyone lie on a metal ramp that slanted out 
the door each one would have to attach a line to a small rocket 
housed in an adjacent rack and be pulled out 
the pole system was tested in february and march using a fixed 
pole that extended through a hatchlike opening in a c141 cargo 
plane navy parachutists completed 66 jumps using cords attached 
to their parachute harnesses to slide down the pole and descend to 
a safe landing 
nasa said the side hatch jettison system can also be helpful if 
an emergency should require a quick crew exit once the ship is on 
the ground the new hatch contains an escape slide similar to those 
on commercial airliners

teamster truck drivers and warehouse workers 
are giving up some of the wage increase their union has just 
negotiated for them in exchange for more pension and other fringe 
benefits 
the new proposed national master freight agreement unveiled 
thursday differs from the tentative pact signed last week by the 
union and trucking management inc the industrys bargaining arm 
duke zeller a teamster spokesman acknowledged thursday that 
some key provisions in the proposed contract were renegotiated 
this week in response to pockets of opposition to them within the 
union 
there were always some is to be dotted and ts to be 
crossed zeller said obviously pension matters were of primary 
concern and the negotiators responded to the dictates of what the 
membership felt was important 
zeller said the union plans to begin mailing out ballots next 
week for a rankandfile ratification vote with ballot counting 
and announcement of the results to occur in midmay 
under the teamsters constitution rejection of a negotiated 
contract requires a twothirds membership vote against it about 
200000 workers are covered by the contract 
when signed a week ago the proposed threeyear accord included 
an immediate 50cent hourly wage increase followed by 35cent 
raises in april 1989 and again in 1990 
the 15cent difference the first year is being switched to 
contributions by employers to the unions pension and health and 
welfare funds the unions pension fund now provides retirees with 
a monthly pension check of up to 1500 
instead of a 20centsperhour increase in contributions to the 
two funds in each of the three years trucking companies would now 
kick in 35 cents more an hour this year 
if ratified the contract would raise the base wage rate for 
truck drivers from the current 1471 to 1506 hour retroactive 
to april 1 wages would rise to 1541 an hour in april 1989 and to 
1576 in 1990 
socalled casual parttime workers now paid about 3 an hour 
less than the top scale also will get the same hourly wage and 
benefit increases under the renegotiated pact zeller said 
richard belous a labor market analyst for the conference board 
a business research house said the renegotiated contract belies a 
myth that with lower tax rates workers would opt for more pay 
than benefits 
given the choice between cash and security workers are 
telling their negotiators to go back and get more security 
belous said once they reach a certain pay level they want more 
protection against the vagaries of ill health and old age 
the contract also recoups for teamsters some of the concessions 
the union yielded to the industry in 1985 
a twotier wage system in which new hires started out at 70 
percent of the base scale and rose by 10 percent a year to 100 
percent at the end of three years is diminished by half 
under the new accord new hires will start at 85 percent of the 
top scale rising by 5 percentage points every six months until 
they reach 100 percent after a year and onehalf 
many within the union had complained the twotier scales were 
allowing the largest trucking companies who are adding new hires to 
their payrolls to undercut freight rates of small companies with 
older work forces

the nations budget director and the 
postmaster general disagree over whether the us mail ought to be 
turned over to private companies and postal workers are siding 
with their boss 
budget director james miller said in a seminar thursday that the 
postal service should not have a monopoly on letter deliveries 
postmaster general anthony m frank indicated to the same group he 
doesnt like the idea of socalled privatization 
as the two attended meetings sponsored by the conservative think 
tank cato institute union leader moe biller led 100 picketers 
outside in a cold drizzle 
miller miller hes a jerk privatization just wont work 
the group chanted 
biller president of the american postal workers union called 
millers proposal cockeyed and said it would cause chaos with 
the mail and increase costs to the public the apwu is the largest 
of four mail unions representing about 365000 of the nations 
800000 postal workers 
biller said that accusations that the postal monopoly is causing 
increased costs are unmitigated lies the cato institute in a 
report issued as postal rates went up sunday said mail service is 
getting slower more expensive and less reliable because of the 
lack of competition 
wearing a sign accusing miller of betraying postal reform 
biller stood at the doorway of the seminar room for a few minutes 
before the budget director arrived as the doors were closed he 
told seminar organizers youre afraid of a free society 
biller later followed miller into the hotel and shook his hand 
saying he wanted to debate him on the idea of turning over the 
postal service to private business 
miller said in a speech there is no good reason why it the 
postal service should remain part of the us government and no 
good reason why it should enjoy a monopoly over the delivery of 
letter mail 
he accused the service of wanting to be a governmentprotected 
monopoly when it comes to letter mail and a federal agency when it 
comes to federal subsidies and other benefits 
miller denied allegations from the postal unions and others that 
his office of management and budget has tried to intrude into 
management of the postal service which is an independent 
government agency 
frank who took over the postal service march 1 suggested 
privatization could be a code word for unionbusting he said he is 
against eliminating the lettermail monopoly the service has and 
does not believe private companies should be allowed to skim off 
profitable segments of the postal service 
he said however he would support a genuine effort to promote 
efficiency by sharing work with private mailers and contracting 
more noncritical postal services 
frank said the postal service should be the most efficient 
reliable convenient public service in the country he noted that 
private package services deliver only a tiny fraction of the 500 
million items a day handled by the postal service 
he said even advocates of privatization realize changes must be 
gradual adding i sense a desire to go slowly a recognition 
that the mail system like humpty dumpty once broken couldnt be 
put back together again

the earths slowly rising temperature may be 
to blame for the recent increase in icebergs breaking off from 
antarctica government ice specialists say 
they cant be sure yet but officials of the navynoaa joint ice 
center note that as the global temperature has increased so have 
the size and number of icebergs 
an abnormally high amount of ice shelf calving is occurring in 
antarctica national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
meteorologist glenn rutledge said thursday 
increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the 
atmosphere over the last century or so have been associated with 
rising temperatures around the world 
some scientists believe that the temperature increase amounting 
to one or two degrees fahrenheit in the last century could lead to 
major climate changes including melting the ice in the polar 
regions 
this could cause a rise in the ocean level around the world and 
cause major changes in weather patterns climatologists have warned 
the poles are sensitive indicators of change in the earths 
climate rutledge said 
but while the increase in icebergs may be a result of the rising 
temperature there isnt yet enough information to be certain said 
russell koffler who heads the satellite services at the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration 
we have only 12 years of data added rutledge that is 
nothing in the geological bucket 
but he noted that both abnormally large icebergs and an 
increasing number of bergs have been breaking loose in the last 
year or two 
whether this will be a continuing trend he declined to forecast 
saying the earth as a system is difficult to predict 
rutledge said the iceberg increase was notable in the antarctic 
area its harder to determine if more bergs are arising in the 
arctic where they tend to be smaller and larger in number anyway 
he said 
but in antarctica two exceptional iceberge have broken loose in 
the last two years 
last year a berg called b9 broke off the ross ice shelf 
measuring 86 miles by 23 miles b9 covered 1978 square miles 
nearly as big as delaware 
at 800 feet thick it contains enough water to supply los 
angeles for 700 years said rutledge and loose in the ocean it 
could be a serious hazard to shipping 
b9 has run aground on an underwater mountain he said but is 
likely to break free eventually and could take from two to seven 
years to melt he said 
an even larger iceberg broke free from the other side of 
antarctica in 1986 rutledge added but that has since split into 
pieces leaving b9 as the largest floating mass of ice 
other smaller bergs have broken free also though numbers were 
not available indeed many bergs are too small to register on the 
satellites used to watch them which track items about a halfmile 
across and larger 
navy commander donald hinson director of the joint ice center 
said that within a few years improved satellites will be in place 
to allow smaller bergs to be followed 
the center is responsible for monitoring ice conditions in the 
great lakes and most of the oceans of the world the lone exception 
is the north atlantic where bergs are tracked by the international 
ice patrol a coast guard operation set up in 1912 following the 
titanic disaster the two groups share data

it seems that elephants can get by with 
whispering where most of us would have to shout 
katherine b payne an elephant researcher in etosha park 
namibia says that elephants can be heard for as far away as three 
miles when they talk 
but most of the time only other elephants can hear twothirds 
of the sounds they make are too low for humans just as a dog 
whistle makes sounds too high for the limited human ear she says 
if you get close enough to the elephant though you can feel 
them the cornell university researcher said thursday at a news 
conference hosted by her sponsor the world wildlife fund its 
like thunder sometimes or being in church close to the lowest 
pipe on the organ 
pigeons and guinea fowl can hear such infrasounds an asian 
grouse called the capercaillie is known to make some and fin 
whales make quite a lot but elephants seem to be the first land 
animals found to have the talent 
the existence of these calls may help explain how elephants 
coordinate their society over long distances ms payne wrote in 
a summary of her work 
she knows about a dozen different sounds that elephants make 
such as the kind of greeting chorused by a group of females when a 
male has found them 
the males can tell one another things like thats caroline 
and her group over there or theres big aggressive bull out that 
way she said 
its a repertoire not a language 
other identifiable sounds include those between baby elephants 
and mothers she said there is some evidence that a mother and calf 
can distinguish one another by sounds they make 
between the elephants eyes where there might be a nose if 
there were no trunk lies a thick fold of skin that she says can be 
seen vibrating when the sound is made 
in one experiment the researchers played the prerecorded call 
of a female elephant in heat to a pair of males the call was not 
too easy to record because a given female elephant may be in heat 
for only one day in four years 
it goes like this said ms payne peering earnestly through 
her goldrimmed glasses only of course im 10 octaves too high 
she made a soft undulating sound whoohoo whoohoo 
there are usually a series of such sounds each about seven seconds 
long she said 
she showed a film of the episode shot from a specially built 
tower last august by a water hole in northern namibia 
near the tower other members of the team manned concealed a 
loudspeaker clocks were coordinated down to fractions of a second 
when two young male elephants appeared the filming began at a 
moment that was not signalled to the photographer the loudspeaker 
began playing the female elephant sounds inaudible to the humans 
concerned 
a moment afterwards the two males stopped their play the film 
shows them standing altogether still something elephants rarely 
do their huge ears fan out they both turn and start moving 
quickly in the direction of the loudspeaker 
the boys at the loudspeaker were praying said ms payne 
the males came close but they went right by and kept on going in 
the same direction we dont know how far 
the two males would probably have fought if there actually had 
been a female at the other end of the call she said

the longneck beer may be the beverage of 
choice for more texans but five wineries from the lone star state 
are hoping to make a big splash at italys largest wine festival 
the wineries hope exposure at the vin italy show in verona will 
increase their credibility with financial institutions that have 
been slow to lend them money for expansion in a state better known 
for its chili than its chenin blanc 
i think it will enhance the prestige of texas wines to have 
competed at the premier wine festival in europe rep kika de la 
garza dtexas said before leaving for the show which opened 
today 
secondly the marketing part of it will allow the wine brokers 
and merchants to know we have good quality wines in texas de la 
garza said as head of the house agriculture committee de la garza 
helped arranged us participation in the show 
the texas participants are hoping international exposure will 
lay the groundwork for exports once financing through obtaining 
such financing has been hard industry and government officials 
say for a young industry in a state riddled with a record number 
of bank failures 
wines from a new producing region are greeted with skepticism 
and i think our wines are beyond that in terms of quality and i 
think that will be recognized in italy says john lowey 
president of the participating llano estacado in lubbock 
were making a statement about the quality of the wines we 
produce here said jennifer cox a coowner of the participating 
pheasant ridge winery also in lubbock 
also sending wines are messinahof wine cellars in bryan fall 
creek winery in the hill country town of tow and the bluebonnet 
hill winery in ballinger in west texas 
texas had one winery in 1975 today it has 22 five of those 
wineries will join 30 others across the country from five other 
states california new jersey pennsylvania new mexico and 
washington in the first official exhibition of american wines at 
vin italy 
the us department of agricultures foreign agriculture service 
is sponsoring the us exhibit it will be among 1700 at the trade 
show where more than 80000 people are expected including wine 
critics importers and distributors from 50 countries according to 
de la garzas office 
we are planting the seeds of a longterm harvest de la 
garza said 
my interest is that the wine show is looking down the road 
several years lowey said wednesday from lubbock were 
currently selling all of the wine we produce here in texas 45000 
cases this year were very well supported here at home so we 
dont have a lot of wine to go to europe with id like to lay the 
groundwork for developing a european market and this is a good 
vehicle to do that with 
interest in american wines is growing and they are now a hot 
export item says joe dugan a spokesman for the house agriculture 
committee 
wine exports rose 64 percent in volume and 75 percent in value 
in 1987 over 1986 dugan said wednesday for a total value of 608 
million last year 
thats still a fraction of the us wine market which had sales 
of 72 billion last year of imports and domestic wines industry 
figures indicate wine imports totaled 1 billion in 1987 dugan 
said 
but the depreciating dollar makes american wines a better buy in 
europe and pacific basin countries like japan and taiwan where an 
upscale segment of the population has plenty of disposable income 
to afford fine wines and enjoys experimenting with new products he 
said 
american exporters hope to appeal to that part of the market and 
arent attempting to compete with the less expensive italian wines 
dugan said 
texas wines and those from new mexico new york and other 
states have an opportunity to find a market niche theres a 
certain cache in having an unusual american wine dugan said

in a simpler time when the united states was 
better able to throw its weight around it took little more than a 
snap of a finger in washington to bring down a central american 
strongman who ran afoul of american interests 
but those days are long gone as the reagan administration is 
finding in its efforts to depose panamas manuel antonio noriega 
the generals resilience in the face of relentless american 
pressure has caused surprise and anguish and even a degree of 
grudging admiration here 
as yet there is still no happy ending to the crisis in sight 
and as a result the reagan administration has been getting it from 
all sides 
some criticize it for cooperating with noriega for so long 
despite suspicions of his involvement in drug trafficking 
others say it has not gone far enough since breaking with him to 
force his ouster while still others maintain that administration 
policies are misguided because they have harmed the panamanian 
people more than noriega 
among other measures the administration has blocked panamanian 
access to 50 million in official panamanian funds on deposit in 
american banks and suspended payments for canalrelated services 
this has contributed to a financial collapse in panama that in 
turn has led to widespread deprivation noriega has sought to 
portray the crisis as the product of american interventionism while 
the united states insists that noriega himself is responsible 
through actions that have led to deep alienation among panamanians 
the administrations latest tactic is to try to create 
dissension in the panamanian defense forces which noriega heads 
the administration believes that the more the defense forces think 
the united states may resort to military intervention the more 
likely they will be to turn against noriega and force him into 
exile 
this explains why the administration has refused to foreclose 
publicly at least the option of military intervention it also was 
probably a contributing factor to the administrations decision to 
send 2100 military forces to panama over the past week 
the administration insists that the troops are being sent to 
protect american citizens and interests in panama and for routine 
training exercises the troop deployment has nothing to do with 
noriega the pentagon insists 
still us officials would not be unhappy if the arrival of all 
these american soldiers generates nervousness within the panamanian 
military 
there are only a few thousand members of the pdf who are 
supposedly battletrained said one official insisting on 
anonymity they are not eager to take on the american military 
they might conclude that their best hope of avoiding that 
possibility is to get rid of noriega 
noriegas staying power contrasts with the way things used to be 
in the caribbean in 1903 when panama was a part of colombia the 
combination of a few hired hands sent to stir up trouble in panama 
city and the deployment of american naval forces offshore led to 
panamas secession from colombia almost without effort a new 
nation was created 
the united states promptly recognized the fledgling state and 
within two weeks panama signed a treaty giving the united states 
the perpetual right to a canal zone and the authority to build a 
transoceanic waterway 
it was easier to get things done in those days but the united 
states is now paying for the heavyhandedness of that era as 
evidence no latin american country has voiced support for current 
administration policy toward panama because each is worried it may 
some day be a us target if it does something to displease 
washington 
six weeks after the crisis erupted no quick solution is 
apparent the reagan administration could increase the pressure on 
noriega by imposing a total trade embargo against panama but many 
officials fear that as before the primary victims of such a 
strategy would be panamanians and not noriega 
beyond that trade embargoes seldom achieve the desired 
objective a 3yearold trade ban against nicaragua has not 
loosened the sandinista grip on power there 
and it was 28 years ago that the united states imposed a trade 
embargo against cuban president fidel castro who next january will 
celebrate his 30th anniversary in power

when the presidential campaigns of paul simon 
pat robertson and richard gephardt faltered the secret service got 
a break to the tune of 45000 a day 
thats how much it cost to provide the three candidates with 
secret service protection according to administration officials 
and government documents 
at one point in the 1988 presidential campaign five candidates 
were under secret service protection not counting vice president 
george bush who gets it anyway by virtue of his office the cost 
15000 a day 105000 a week for each candidate 75000 a day 
525000 a week for all five 
now there are only two democrats jesse jackson and albert gore 
jr michael dukakis the governor of massachusetts passed up 
secret service protection because according to his wife kitty 
it would be just one additional layer from the people 
however as expensive as 75000 a day might sound it pales 
against the 49 million it cost to guard pope john paul ii during 
his 11day visit to the united states last year 
secret service director john r simpson and francis a keating 
assistant treasury secretary for enforcement told congress 
recently that the popes visit to the united states was the 
single most dal 1989 
candidate protection is determined by a fivemember panel 
consisting of a supreme court justice the senate majority and 
minority leaders and the house speaker and minority leader who 
meet and make recommendations to the treasury secretary among the 
things taken into consideration the number of delegates a 
candidate receives and whether any death threats have been made 
against the candidate 
if the secretary accepts the panels recommendations the 
candidate is notified to decline protection a candidate must 
inform the secretary in writing 
simon gave up his secret service protection wednesday the day 
before he announced he was suspending all campaign activities 
gephardt quit the race march 28 surrendering his protection a day 
earlier 
robertsons protection ended wednesday he has all but abandoned 
campaign activity 
keating said the advisory panel did not recommend protection for 
erstwhile candidates bruce babbitt alexander m haig jr or former 
gov pete dupont of delaware 
along with dukakis sen bob dole of kansas also declined 
protection during his unsuccessful run for the presidency 
walt riker doles press secretary said dole believes that 
secret service protection is too expensive and limits where you 
can go and what you can do he likes to go out meet the people and 
shake their hands 
the converse applies too 
on his first day without secret service agents nearby simon was 
quick to exercise his new freedom 
he jumped into his chevy caprice drove to a mall and bought two 
new sport shirts for a weeklong family vacation in puerto rico

as top cop for the academy awards jerry 
moons job is to conjure up nightmarish scenarios and make sure he 
can respond to any calamity that might disrupt hollywoods biggest 
night 
woe be unto anyone who tries to disrupt the show moon said 
intruders simply wont get past moons security phalanx at 
monday nights 60th annual oscar ceremony which has moved to the 
refurbished shrine auditorium five miles south of downtown 
moon 60 a former professional wrestler expoliceman and 
retired security chief for disney studios has been oscars 
bodyguard for 17 years and hes ready for just about anything 
by monday you just sit back and wring your hands and hope you 
thought of everything he said 
in addition 6000 of the wellheeled and glamorous the academy 
awards attracts a worldwide audience of millions a curbside throng 
of squealing fans and sometimes a seamy contingent of malcontents 
derelicts and fanatics 
in the past there have been bomb threats political 
demonstrations imposters publicityseekers and starstruck fans 
with elaborate schemes to get inside there has never been a 
serious offense however 
we talk to young people and find out what the latest fad is 
moon said when asked about anticipating untoward acts there was 
the pie in the face fad the streaker fad you name it and there is 
usually a new fad 
but discussions with students this year havent given him any 
clues 
apparently the younger people are more intent on their 
studies he said we cant find any one thing that is really in 
the mind of the kids we have to think of everything as being a 
possibility and use our imaginations 
many have tired to pass illicitly through entrances in the past 
but only a few have succeeded there was robert opel the infamous 
oncamera streaker of 1974 
opel since deceased was able to obtain credentials that 
permitted him backstage moon said that security hole has been 
plugged i have yet to convince myself there wasnt some 
collusion there he said 
there was once an imposter in a california highway patrol 
uniform who looked like actor erik estrada and a camper was once 
flushed out of a music center mens room stall the day before the 
awards show 
demonstrators come almost yearly to the academy awards drawn by 
the presence of the worlds news media or irked by the nomination 
of a certain movie or star such as jane fonda vanessa redgrave 
and charlie chaplin 
demonstrators clashed with police in 1979 when the deer 
hunter won best picture and angry vietnam veterans surged across 
the street fronting the music center 
moon began planning oscar security in january he set up shop at 
the shrine two weeks before showtime a week earlier that usual 
because of the move from the music center his job finishes when 
the last guest slips away from the postoscar board of governors 
ball 
more than 300 officers under the direction of moon will be on 
hand monday night and he is guaranteeing the safety of academy 
guests into and out of the area near the university of southern 
california campus 
once they arrive they wont have to leave for the renovated 
shrine with new bathrooms paint red carpets and air 
conditioning will be the site the governors ball instead of the 
beverly hilton hotel crosstown 
it will be a wonderful night moon said

here is the text of the a piece of my mind 
column entitled its over debbie from the jan 8 1988 edition 
of the journal of the american medical association

the call came in the middle of the night as a gynecology 
resident rotating through a large private hospital i had come to 
detest telephone calls because invariably i would be up for 
several hours and would not feel good the next day however duty 
called so i answered the phone a nurse informed me that a patient 
was having difficulty getting rest could i please see her she was 
on 3 north that was the gynecologic oncology unit not my usual 
duty station as i trudged along bumping sleepily against walls 
and corners and not believing i was up again i tried to imagine 
what i might find at the end of my walk maybe an elderly woman 
with an anxiety reaction or perhaps something particularly 
horrible 
i grabbed the chart from the nurses station on my way to the 
patients room and the nurse gave me some hurried details a 
20yearold girl named debbie was dying of ovarian cancer she was 
having unrelenting vomiting apparently as the result of an alcohol 
drip administered for sedation hmmm i thought very sad as i 
approached the room i could hear loud labored breathing i entered 
and saw an emaciated darkhaired woman who appeared much older 
than 20 she was receiving nasal oxygen had an iv and was sitting 
in bed suffering from what was obviously severe air hunger the 
chart noted her weight at 80 pounds a second woman also 
darkhaired but of middle age stood at her right holding her 
hand both looked up as i entered the room seemed filled with the 
patients desperate effort to survive her eyes were hollow and 
she had suprasternal and intercostal retractions with her rapid 
inspirations she had not eaten or slept in two days she had not 
responded to chemotherapy and was being given supportive care only 
it was a gallows scene a cruel mockery of her youth and 
unfulfilled potential her only words to me were lets get this 
over with 
i retreated with my thoughts to the nurses station the patient 
was tired and needed rest i could not give her health but i could 
give her rest i asked the nurse to draw 20 mg of morphine sulfate 
into a syringe enough i thought to do the job i took the 
syringe into the room and told the two women i was going to give 
debbie something that would let her rest and to say goodbye 
debbie looked at the syringe then laid her head on the pillow with 
her eyes open watching what was left of the world i injected the 
morphine intravenously and watched to see if my calculations on its 
effects would be correct within seconds her breathing slowed to a 
normal rate her eyes closed and her features softened as she 
seemed restful at last the older woman stroked the hair of the 
nowsleeping patient i waited for the inevitable next effect of 
depressing the respiratory drive with clocklike certainty within 
four minutes the breathing rate slowed even more then became 
irregular then ceased the darkhaired woman stood erect and 
seemed relieved 
its over debbie

the food and drug administration has told 
prospective developers of home aids test kits they must limit 
market research to hospitals clinics and other traditional health 
care settings 
that and other restrictions contained in a march 30 policy 
statement effectively bar home test kits by heading off 
accumulation of the very kind of data that would be needed to 
convince the fda to approve them 
despite the clear signal that the fda is not disposed to look 
kindly on such mass distribution of an aids test the policy letter 
said the agency will seek public comment that could lead it to 
revise the guidelines 
fda spokeswoman susan cruzan said thursday the fda will publish 
its guidelines for considering approval of home aids test kits in 
the federal register along with its intention to convene public 
workshops on the issues surrounding such premarket research 
the policy letter went to 17 people or companies who had 
expressed interest in marketing an aids test kit those parties 
none identified by the agency had been told earlier that fda 
permission would have to be granted before they could be sold 
fda officials have long expressed skepticism about any home aids 
test kit winning approval because the disease is fatal and us 
public health service guidelines say any testing should be 
accompanied by appropriate counseling 
the fda is a part of the public health service 
an official who insisted on anonymity for fear of being accused 
of prejudging applications before they are filed said the existence 
of home tests for pregnancy is no argument for the home aids tests 
the official said the emotional impact of learning one has a 
lifethreatening disease is far different 
the policy letter signed by paul d parkman director of the 
fdas center for biologics evaluation and research tells companies 
not to even bother filing applications for premarket approval 
unless 
their kits are labeled and marketed for professional use only 
within a comprehensive health care environment eg hospitals 
medical clinics doctors offices std clinics alternative test 
sites and mental health clinics 
blood is drawn only by a person recognized by a state or 
local authority to perform such procedures in other words a 
licensed technician 
the testing sequence includes a currently licensed screening 
test 
all results are reported directly to professional health care 
providers for reporting and interpretation of results as well as 
for counseling of the individual

it remains to be seen if struggling author alan 
rosenberg ever will get his books published but hes already 
auctioned off his manuscripts and other memorabilia 
he raised 965 much less than the 15000 he spent staging to 
stage it thursday in the penthouse of the new york hilton a huge 
publicity stunt that surpassed even his own expectations 
im thrilled people even thought this was worth something 
he said we did good 
rosenberg watched as an old boston herald baseball cap sold for 
50 a dogeared dictionary for 40 and a manuscript of an 
unpublished book he wrote about the second claus von bulow trial 
fetched for 270 
the money was of little importance it was television news 
crews magazine writers newspaper reporters and other journalists 
that he hoped to snare 
and snared they were as they came to his show which included 
door prizes and an auctioneer who has sold memorabilia of ernest 
hemingway richard nixon and babe ruth 
rosenberg failed to find a publisher for his first two books so 
he planned the publicity stunt after finishing his latest novel 
run red riding hood run a book that he said mixes murder 
suspense and comedy 
as was the case with his books on the second claus von bulow 
trial and his experiences at the boston herald theres no 
publisher 
as part of the hoopla rosenberg started the day by marrying 
cathy lee counts at city hall 
he also attempted to lure several betterknown make that known 
authors such as stephen king and john irving both said no but 
sent messages irvings in the form of a rejection post card 
armed with the published evidence of his hype the 34yearold 
maine author plans to go to a booksellers convention in anaheim 
calif to peddle his product 
this book has never been rejected he said of his latest 
work after selling his collection of 30 rejection notices from 
publishers for his other books at the auction for 65 
about 50 people attended the auction mostly family friends 
reporters and the 10 models rosenberg hired to read his work to the 
group 
several serious bidders also showed up including herb 
goldsmith president of members only the clothing manufacturer 
this is as contemporary as art can get he said explaining 
his interest in the works of a writer whose books have never been 
published 
he bought a first draft of rosenbergs new book for 45 at the 
auction which like most items began with a bid of 275 
anything that starts at 275 ill bid he said this is 
unique 
joyce burger of manhattan said she bought a 431page manuscript 
of rosenbergs new unpublished novel for 270 for a friend who 
became interested after reading about the auction in an 
advertisement 
she said her friend was betting on rosenbergs future and hoped 
the manuscript would grow in value 
i think its the bargain of the century because i am going to 
be famous rosenberg said

a libyan defector who says he worked as a 
decoder for libyas foreign ministry accuses col moammar gadhafi 
of trying to assassinate the presidents of france and egypt 
libyan authorities say the defector is a lowlevel diplomat 
wanted on morals charges who was recruited by the cia to discredit 
gadhafi 
at a news conference thursday organized by gadhafis main 
opposition movement the national front for the salvation of libya 
salem a saity said he defected from his post at the libyan mission 
to the united nations after being recalled for consultations 
saity 29 said he realized then that his cover as an activist 
in the opposition movement had been blown especially when he 
noticed he was being followed and his phone was tapped 
he declined to say whether he would seek political asylum here 
adding that the movement would take the necessary precautions 
against possible threats from libyan agents 
mahmoud azzabi the spokesman for libyas ninemember un 
mission in new york said saity disappeared at the end of january 
after being given an airline ticket and told to return home to face 
morals charges he said he did not know what the specific charges 
were against saity 
two things were on his mind all the time booze and women 
azzabi said that was all he talked about 
this is an allout effort of the us administration to 
discredit the political liberalization gadhafi introduced last 
month azzabi added 
he wasnt very important and he was not wanted for political 
reasons so we didnt pay attention or send letters to the united 
nations when he disappeared he added azzabi denied that saity 
worked with classified material 
saity who spoke in arabic through an interpreter said he had 
been on the staff of the foreign minister in libya working as a 
decoder in the classified section of the ministry as well as at the 
un mission in the course of his work saity said he saw 
communications from tripoli to libyan missions abroad 
one such communication relayed through the ministry in 1984 was 
from abdallah sinousi the head of military intelligence ordering 
the libyan embassy in tanzania to kill visiting egyptian president 
hosni mubarak saity said 
sinousi also sent an order to the embassy in burundi to 
assassinate mubarak and french president francois mitterand at a 
francophone countries summit in 1985 saity said 
gadhafi sent a man by the name of mohammed zabeida to the un 
mission to carry out attacks against his opponents living in the 
united states saity said he said us authorities had gotten wise 
to zabeida and he had fled back to libya in 1986 
the libyan mission spokesman said he had never heard of the 
incident 
his rule is synonymous with endless hostile interventions 
around the globe saity said of gadhafi he has ransacked 
libyas wealth to fulfill his evil schemes 
saity denied being recruited by us authorities but did not 
rule out contacting them in the future its too soon to tell 
about his plans he said 
the state department said it had no knowledge of saity or his 
activities 
saity said he was certain his parents in libya would be 
persecuted because of his defection but he felt compelled to 
denounce gadhafi who has reduced libya to a refuge of crime 
bankruptcy and corruption

archbishop marcos mcgrath called off 
his attempt to mediate between gen manuel antonio noriega and the 
opposition which has refused to negotiate unless the general first 
agrees to leave the country 
also thursday there was a split in the main antinoriega 
coalition and police using tear gas and rubber hoses dispersed 
hundreds of antigovernment demonstrators in the western city of 
david 
a roman catholic church communique said mediation efforts were 
suspended because the opposition had insisted noriega the 
nations de facto ruler agree to depart and the general had 
failed to agree in writing to mediation 
the church in no way surrenders the difficult task of 
mediation it still considers it urgent and every day more so 
said the communique which asked all parties to remove obstacles so 
that talks might begin 
the opposition national civic crusade which has led the 
panamanian fight to oust noriega said in a statement issued after 
the church announcement that it stood by its negotiating conditions 
a sign from noriega that he was willing to step down remained an 
indispensable and essential condition for opening talks it 
said 
in a communique that was not signed by noriega the government 
had agreed to church mediation without preconditions 
earlier thursday two leaders of the opposition popular action 
party announced they were breaking with the 10monthold civic 
crusade to form the popular civic movement it was the first major 
split in the opposition 
roberto arosemena and mauro zuniga told a news conference the 
new group had the support of the authentic panamanian party the 
countrys largest opposition party zuniga said the splinter group 
also wants noriega out but thinks it is a job for panamanians not 
americans 
the civic crusades campaign to oust noriega chief of panamas 
15000strong defense forces has been backed by washington 
the new opposition group opposes church mediation and does not 
recognize eric arturo delvalle deposed by pronoriega lawmakers on 
feb 26 as panamas president government prosecutor alvaro 
visuetti disclosed wednesday that an arrest warrant had been issued 
for delvalle who is in hiding in panama 
delvalle in a videotape released to cable news network 
thursday said he would continue to fight to oust noriega who he 
tried to fire the day before he himself was removed 
fellow countrymen we cannot allow a gang of inhuman drug 
traffickers to be the owners of our public institutions and of the 
country itself he said 
the tape was reported made thursday 
in february noriega was indicted in florida on federal drug 
trafficking charges the united states has frozen panamanian 
deposits in american banks and panamas banks closed during the 
first week of march 
civilian sources contacted by telephone in david said civic 
crusade members were beaten and arrested when police broke up a 
protest march thursday evening 
carlos secchi a crusade member said police used tear gas and 
rubber hoses to break up the march by more than 500 demonstrators 
he said about 15 marchers were arrested there were no immediate 
reports of injuries 
with the arrival this week of 1300 extra us troops this week 
there now are about 11800 american soldiers in panama to protect 
the panama canal and guard american installations 
another 800 us marines were to arrive today for jungle 
training that had been scheduled months ago the marines are slated 
to stay for three weeks 
banking officials put an end thursday to government speculation 
the countrys banks might open today or next week sources speaking 
on condition of anonymity said they feared the government would 
attempt to bleed deposits for its own use if the banks were to open 
lacking hard cash the government has failed to meet its payroll 
for a month people paid by check cannot cash them panamanians 
with dollars are using them sparingly and many now depend on 
charity for food

secretary of state george p shultz wound 
up a fiveday quest for middle east peace talks today 
acknowledging progress could be measured only in inches 
but shultz said he expects to return to the region he did not 
say when to to struggle against the odds 
he said his goal remains a comprehensive settlement between 
israel and its arab neighbors and selfrule but not statehood for 
the palestinians 
i think the stakes are very high and the opportunities very 
great even if the probabilities are against you the secretary 
told a news conference 
he praised king hussein of jordan for having engaged seriously 
with us for peace in the region earlier in the week he called 
the king a partner for peace 
shultz did not offer an assessment of prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of israel whose position toward a middle east peace 
conference was an obstacle shultz could not overcome 
the secretary had hoped to convene a peace conference by 
midapril to launch talks between israel and a mixed delegation of 
jordanians and palestinians 
i dont think we are going to make it and thats obvious 
shultz said 
but he bristled when one of the reporters at a news conference 
suggested his mission was doomed to failure 
you have to be willing to do it shultz said what am i 
saving myself for anyway i have a few more months to go here and i 
want to try to leave something constructive for the region and for 
my successors and so im going to put my back into it why not 
the reagan administration has a little more than nine months 
left the current trip is the third by shultz to the middle east 
since october to try to break a 40year impasse between israel and 
its arab neighbors 
since early december palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip have been rioting against their israeli occupiers at least 
141 arabs and an israeli soldier have been killed in the wave of 
violence 
shamir objects to the us proposal for a peace conference 
because he finds in it opportunities for the soviet union to side 
with the arabs as it usually does and try to impose an 
unfavorable settlement on israel shultz gave assurances the united 
states would stand by israel and not let that happen but shamir 
held to his position 
shultz said he expected to return at some point in the 
future because it takes a special us effort to bring the two 
sides together 
you measure headway in inches not miles he said 
the secretary said he was leaving special us envoy wat 
cluverius in the region to continue talks

a spokesman for the international banking 
community said today that creditor governments not banks have 
done too little to help third world countries with their debts 
the third world governments want either grants more new loans 
or relief from the burden of paying many billions on old ones every 
year said horst schulmann a west german who heads the 
washingtonbased institute of international finance 
creditor governments have not done enough in bilateral 
relations to provide more official financing to open their 
economies or to improve the regulatory and tax regimes for private 
lenders and investors said schulmann 
schulmanns comments were in a letter to leaders of the 
international monetary fund and the development committee a joint 
group of the fund and its sister organization the world bank 
the fund and bank are owned by 151 countries many of those 
governments top economic officials including treasury secretary 
james a baker iii are expected to attend the two institutions 
joint semiannual meetings here next week 
baker and other government leaders have criticized commercial 
banks for their slowdown of lending in recent years and have 
recently been encouraging a menu of possible actions by the 
banks many of these actions would require the banks to get rid of 
loans at less than their face value 
barber conable president of the world bank has quietly 
suggested that banks might also waive some of the billions of 
dollars of interest they collect every year 
we have repeatedly noted the dramatic decline in commercial 
bank lending to developing countries and stressed the necessity for 
signficantly increased flows from the private banks as an essential 
ingredient of the debt strategy he said in a report to be 
delivered to the development committee april 15 
schulmann said many debtor governments have refused to seek the 
funds help because it insists on such adjustment conditions as 
cutting government subsidies and devaluing currencies that lower 
their peoples living standards 
fund officials argue that third world countries will be worse 
off if their govnernments do not ask its help 
schulmann said the world bank had been only partly successful in 
getting debtor countries to make similar changes in their policies 
and that its lending has grown less than expected 
there is a need for the world bank to be more innovative in 
its approach to the debt problem he said 
he suggested that it should do more in the way of credit 
enhancements the kind of financing that lessens risk for banks 
schulmann came out for an issue of special drawing rights 
the funds own kind of money to member governments this measure 
has long been urged by third world governments but opposed by the 
united states on grounds that it would encourage inflation 
thirdworld debt is expected to reach 1245 trillion at the end 
of this year

the newspaper said several antinoriega members of the 
15000member panama defense forces went to the central american 
nations main arsenal in panama city last month to obtain guns for 
the attempt pretending to be on official military business 
the guard commander at the arsenal however locked the plotters 
inside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was in 
progress the newspaper reported 
swift action by noriegas supporters put down the conspiracy and 
resulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen antinoriega 
officers during the last several weeks the tribune reported 
the newspaper quoted a source identified only as a wellplaced 
military expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates the 
depth to which the administration planners have underestimated 
noriega and misunderstood the situation there

economist john kenneth galbraith says he 
admires jesse jackson but supports massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis for the democratic nomination for president 
i think jesse jackson has certainly been a good force in our 
time he has given voice to people who previously did not have 
voice and is bringing a whole new group of people into the 
political process i think were going to look back on jesse 
jacksons campaign with great approval galbraith said at a news 
conference at miami university on thursday 
asked if he thought jackson could be elected president 
galbraith said my dear fellow ronald reagan is president 
galbraith said that if reagan can be president surely jackson 
can be president 
galbraith attacked the economic policies of reagan and his 
predecessors because of the large deficits and high interest rates 
resulting from those practices

by the hand and pulled him from the podium the two rolled down a 
stairway leading from the podium to the main floor as they scuffled 
chu later told reporters that about 10 nationalist party 
legislators kicked and punched him after he fell to the floor 
chus face was bruised and his glasses were broken 
after the threeminute melee the vice president called for a 
vote and the lawmakers overwhelming moved to debate the budget 
proposal at a later session 
chu said earlier in the session that the cabinet which

the fiscal year beginning july 1 by drastically cutting defense and 
other expenditures 
about a third of the proposed budget of 568 billion taiwan 
dollars 198 billion would go to defense the government says

the national legislature today elected chinas 
most powerful general yang shangkun president in onecandidate 
balloting that was open for the first time to foreign reporters 
yangs election puts a close ally of senior leader deng xiaoping 
and staunch supporter of dengs economic reforms in the largely 
ceremonial but highly visible post 
the 84yearold deng remains chairman of the central military 
commission his only government post like yang deng was the only 
choice for the post in voting among 2883 delegates of the national 
peoples congress 
the legislature also elected wan li who had been vice premier 
to head the congress standing commitee which is responsible for 
legislative matters in between the full congress onceayear 
sessions 
the national peoples congress which has been meeting since 
march 25 is scheduled to elect the premier on saturday and vice 
premiers on tuesday 
li peng has been acting premier since november and is expected 
to be confirmed in that post 
foreign reporters watched from a balcony in the great hall of 
the people as the congress delegates minus 87 who were said to 
have other business marked large orange red and yellow 
ballots and dropped them in boxes 
it was the first time foreign reporters were allowed to watch 
the selection of communist chinas leaders 
in a touch of democracy 144 candidates were listed for the 135 
ordinary seats on the congress standing committee delegates also 
were told they could write in other names if they did not like the 
144 choices 
also for the first time legislators could mark their ballots in 
secret in enclosed areas in the rear of the hall most delegates 
however remained in their seats 
deng and communist party chief zhao ziyang were among the 
delegates who voted 
the official xinhua news agency announced the results but did 
not give vote counts 
yang and wan are both strong supporters of dengs decadelong 
program of introducing marketstyle economic reforms and shaking up 
the stagnant government bureaucracy 
the officials they replace 78yearold li xiannian in the 
presidency and 86yearold peng zhen as congress chairman were 
regarded as more conservative 
as president yang will play a highly visible role in meeting 
visiting foreign heads of state and presenting chinas policy to 
them his close ties to deng give him an influence beyond the 
presidency 
wans new job as head of the national peoples congress was a 
powerless one for many years but under peng the legislature became 
more active in debating bills and even pressing for amendments 
dengs decision to stay on as head of the central military 
commission had been anticipated the military has been his power 
base since he became top leader in 1978 
in other posts wang zhen 80 a long march veteran and central 
military commission member was elected vice president 
nineteen vicechairmen of the congress standing committee were 
elected including 11 who had served as vice chairman of the 
previous congress standing committee 
among the eight elected for the first time were fei xiaotong 
77 a sociologist and head of the china democratic league one of 
chinas eight officially approved noncommunist parties

raw or undercooked eggs even from perfect and 
sanitized shells may be spreading the salmonella bacteria in the 
northeast says a federal researcher who fears the problem may be 
spreading 
even sound grade a eggs which are screened for defects and 
cleansed outside with chemical disinfectant appear to be 
implicated in the sickening of hundreds of people in recent years 
the researcher said thursday 
previous eggrelated salmonella food poisoning has been limited 
to eggs that were cracked dirty or in some other way defective or 
mishandled said dr michael e st louis of the national centers 
for disease control in atlanta 
st louis said in a telephone interview though that his 
findings now implicate grade a eggs the most widely sold egg in 
whole shell form he said however that fully cooked eggs appear 
to present no danger 
in all of the outbreaks we investigated people ate the eggs 
raw or undercooked st louis said consumers dont need to 
stop eating eggs but if they wish to avoid salmonella infections 
they need to cook the eggs 
cathy mccharen a spokeswoman for the egg industryfunded egg 
nutrition center in washington dc said were doing everything 
possible to correct and identify any problems 
st louis and his colleagues began their investigation after 
learning of a sixfold increase in the number of infections caused 
by the bacteria salmonella enteritidis in northeastern states from 
1976 to 1986 
the researchers found that in the nine affected states from 
january 1985 to may 1987 65 foodborne outbreaks of salmonella 
enteritidis occurred and were associated with 2119 foodpoisoning 
cases and 11 deaths 
in 35 outbreaks the food bearing the infection could be 
identified the researchers said twentyseven of those 35 
outbreaks were caused by grade a shell eggs or food that 
contained such eggs the researchers added 
a separate survey of records concerning all us salmonella 
outbreaks from 1973 to 1984 revealed that eggcontaining foods 
were disproportionately associated with salmonella enteritidis 
infections both in the northeast and in the rest of the united 
states the researchers said 
they reported their findings in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
dr robert c baker a food science professor at cornell 
university in ithaca ny said however that he believes the 
danger may be over and that the rash of outbreaks may have run its 
course 
baker a longtime researcher into egg safety said in a 
telephone interview wednesday that lab tests at 53 new york state 
farms last year failed to turn up any trace of salmonella 
enteritidis contamination 
we dont think the problem is going away st louis 
countered outbreaks continue to occur its continuing to 
rise in the northeast and its actually spreading out of the 
northeast 
ms mccharen added in a telephone interview wednesday that cdc 
researchers established a statistical link between some not all 
northeastern salmonella outbreaks and eggs and what they dont 
know is why 
st louis agreed saying one possible explanation is that 
salmonella infection may contaminate the ovaries of chickens and 
infect yolks before shells are formed 
but he emphasized we think the frequency of eggs being 
contaminated with salmonella is very low 
he said about onethird of all chicken and turkey sold in stores 
is salmonellacontaminated and slightly less than a third of the 
ground beef but those infections are destroyed by cooking 
in contrast eggs often are eaten raw in hollandaise sauces 
caesar salad dressings homemade egg nog and ice cream the 
researchers said 
where eggs are concerned sufficient cooking is difficult to 
determine but a previous study has suggested boiling for at least 
seven minutes poaching for five minutes and frying on each side 
for at least three minutes the study said 
the northeastern states included in the study were connecticut 
maine massachusetts new hampshire new jersey new york 
pennsylvania rhode island and vermont

its over debbie a doctors essay on the 
mercy killing of a patient has focused debate on euthanasia much 
like the karen ann quinlan case did in the 1970s says a prominent 
medical journals editor 
the newly galvanized debate over euthanasia will be fruitless 
however unless it results in guidelines enabling doctors to deal 
with ethical dilemmas dr george lundberg wrote for todays 
journal of the american medical association 
such discussions should not be confined to whispers in 
doctors dressing rooms and hallways says the editorial in jama 
which started the debate by publishing the unsigned essay jan 8 
in addition to the editorial todays issue of jama included two 
commentaries on the essay and excerpts from 18 of the more than 150 
letters the journal received 
the essays author described injecting a potentially lethal dose 
of morphine into a 20yearold hospital patient dying of ovarian 
cancer 
the physician a gynecology resident awakened in the middle of 
the night to attend the woman indicated the patient was a 
stranger but that her pain and her plea lets get this over 
with were moving 
i believe the stark nature of the essay and the ambiguities 
within it when coupled with a profession and public ready to talk 
about dying in greater detail produced this massive national 
response said lundberg 
debbie crystallized attention on euthanasia for this 
decade much as the karen quinlan case in the previous decade he 
added 
the parents of miss quinlan who lapsed into a coma in 1975 
obtained court permission in 1976 to withdraw lifesupport systems 
miss quinlan never regained consciousness and died nine years 
later 
in his editorial lundberg sought to guide the course of the 
euthanasia debate by identifying six types of euthanasia ranging 
from withholding resuscitation of terminal patients to killing a 
patient through such means as drug injection 
he warned that without action laws may eventually result 
without sufficient input from the public and the medical profession 
the essay has already caused legal action by a local prosecutor 
cook county states attorney richard daley served jama with a 
subpoena shortly after the essays publication seeking the name of 
the author in an effort to determine whether a crime occurred 
journal editors refused saying the essay was offered on 
condition of anonymity a judge quashed the subpoena on march 18 
citing illinois freepress law 
questions also have been raised about whether the event 
described actually happened lundberg said he believes the case is 
real 
lundberg noted that active euthanasia already is performed in 
the netherlands and a public referendum on the practice may be on 
the california ballot this year 
the issues raised by this particularly abhorrent case and the 
consequent discussion about the ethics of euthaniasia are profound 
eternal questions of humnan existence for which there are no 
necessarily correct and certainly no clear answers he said in 
the editorial 
in an interview wednesday lundberg said most of the early 
letters were from doctors they ran 4to1 against the action 
described in the essay and 3to1 against jamas decision to 
publish it he said 
dr william fiorini of somerset ohio wrote i ponder the 
prospect that in my final struggle a similar whitecoated figure 
will cast a shadow over my deathbed poised to quickly administer 
the knockout blow and go back to bed when i simply rang for a 
companion to ease my pains 
the public response was more favorable lundberg said but he 
provided no figures those letters suggested support for euthanasia 
in some situations he said 
look at the courts and you will see a very small percentage of 
convictions for mercy killings and assisted suicides wrote 
eileen moran of everett wash juries are filled with people of 
conscience who wish the same deliverance from a life whose quality 
has passed 
to all those physicians who would deny me a lethal injection 
on request as i lie dying i say whose life is it anyway

iranians voted for a new parliament today 
hours after iraqi missiles crashed into several cities in an 
election that will help determine the course of the islamic 
revolution 
the nations 87yearold revolutionary patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini voted at an openair election station near his 
home in the northern tehran suburb of jamaran 
staterun television showed the blackturbaned leader dropping 
his ballot into the box followed by his son ahmad the elections 
are the third to the 270member majlis or parliament since the 
1979 revolution toppled the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
the vote is seen as a test of strength between fundamentalists 
who support an islamicstyle capitalism and radicals who favor a 
socialiststyle economy the future course of the islamic 
revolution is uncertain and khomeini is reported in ill health 
iranian leaders had expressed fear the iraqis would blitz tehran 
and other major cities to disrupt the polling but nevertheless 
urged the countrys more than 20 million voters to cast ballots in 
defiance 
a loud explosion rocked the area near a tehran railroad station 
just hours before irans 30000 polling stations opened officials 
had no immediate details of the blast 
but tehran radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp 
reported that iraqi missiles crashed into the capital and the 
central city of isfahan it also said iraqi warplanes raided the 
western cities of bakhtaran and hamadan killing an unspecified 
number of civilians 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
did not give any turnout figures but reported the iranian peoples 
massive presence at the polling stations 
khomeini declared last week the people will attend the 
election with gods help even if they are under missile attack i 
will vote under any circumstances 
he warned the people must beware and choose candidates among 
those loyal to islam they must choose their deputies from 
among those who have suffered from poverty and are real moslems 
not those who obey americas islam 
tehran was decked out in election posters including 
bedsheetsize cloth banners bearing the names of the candidates 
the 7yearold war with iraq the countrys most pressing 
problem has not figured in the campaigning khomeini has decreed 
that the war will not end until his adversary iraqs president 
saddam hussein has been toppled 
about 1400 candidates ran for the fouryear terms as 
parliamentary deputies they were approved by provincial and city 
governors controlled by interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
thats about 400 more than campaigned in the last election in 
1984 this year for the first time about 30 women ran 
the results may not be known for 10 days and the new parliament 
may not sit until june while a new cabinet is screened and nominees 
scrutinized by the deputies

willie b one of americas most famous gorillas 
has a new human roommate whos trying to coax the pudgy primate 
into taking his first step outside in 25 years 
later this month his keepers at zoo atlanta plan to introduce 
willie and his fellow apes to a new outdoor habitat which replaces 
the tile walls and steel bars of their old quarters 
gorillas tend to be very reticent and after 25 years in the 
same place hes just gotten used to his old home zoo director 
terry maple said this change although its a very positive 
change is going to be viewed with some suspicion were going to 
have to induce him to enjoy his new habitat 
once he gets over this period we think hes going to really 
enjoy it 
for willie who arrived in atlanta 25 years ago at age 3 it 
might be the first time in his memory that he will have grass 
beneath his feet and the open sky above his head 
and zoo officials have other surprises for willie they hope 
that within a year they can introduce him to another gorilla 
probably a female 
were going to have to do it very carefully so they dont 
fight too much maple said thursday eventually he said its 
hoped willie will breed 
on wednesday zoo atlanta officials gave willie his first 
complete physical then showed him the new indoor quarters he will 
use for sleep and shelter they hope hell get used to that within 
two weeks and then they will open the door 
to coax him outside keepers will place willies food near the 
exit of his night quarters he already can see that something is 
going on zoo staffers are keeping a roundtheclock watch in the 
night quarters including his keeper of 14 years charles horton 
who is sleeping in the next chamber 
hes literally willies best friend maple said charles 
is a very important part of our strategy of making him 
comfortable 
in wednesdays physical willie b named for longtime former 
atlanta mayor william b hartsfield weighed in at nearly 460 
pounds with a 40inch neck and a 64inch chest 
thats about 60 pounds overweight but for a gorilla whos lived 
in a cage for 25 years its not too bad maple said 
the preliminary results are that hes in very good health 
maple said were surprised at his muscle tone and the quality of 
his condition 
willies first steps outdoors will be important for him and 
equally important for zoo atlanta maple said 
the us humane society named the 99yearold zoo one of the 
nations worst just four years ago before maple a specialist in 
primate psychology was hired and launched a plan to convert the 
old facility into a modern outdoor animal habitat 
this is the dawning of a new era at zoo atlanta i have no 
doubt about that he said you can call it one small step for a 
gorilla one giant step for gorilla kind and certainly for the 
zoo

a misidentified dinosaur skull found in the 
cleveland museum of natural historys basement came from a 
previously unknown meateating reptile that was a pygmy cousin of 
tyrannosaurus rex scientists say 
the skull was found on a southeast montana farm 46 years ago by 
a museum expedition but was misidentified as a gorgosaur a 
relatively primitive common carnivore scientists said at a news 
conference thursday 
the new genus has been named nanotyrannus or pygmy tyrant 
by the three scientists who discovered it 
this animal is so different from any other meateater that it 
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree said robert 
t bakker adjunct curator of paleontology at the university of 
colorado in boulder 
bakker said he found the skull believed to be the only 
nanotyrannus specimen while rummaging around the museums basement 
last spring 
the best place in north america to find new kinds of 
dinosaurs is to look in basements he said there are never 
enough scientists to study specimens as soon as they come out of 
the crate this came out of the crate in 1942 but no one did a 
detailed study 
tyrannosaurus rex roamed the earth some 60 million years ago 
nanotyrannus resembled the bigger dinosaur but was only about 
onethird as large and onetenth as heavy it probably weighed less 
than 1000 pounds stood about 10 feet tall walked on its hind 
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail bakker said 
the skull about 22 inches long and 10 inches high is about the 
size of a brown bears head bakker said 
nanotyrannus had the same advanced anatomical features as 
tyrannosaurus rex including eye sockets that faced forward instead 
of sideways and a neck joint that bent downwards 
the expedition that found the skull yielded other dinosaur 
skeletons in the musuems collection but no other nanotyrannus 
parts 
its very rare to find a perfect head and no backbone or no 
hind leg or tail or ribs bakker said its not impossible that 
the body is still out there entombed in very hard sandstone 
there are no plans to excavate the site again said michael 
williams curator of vertebrate paleontology at the musuem the 
third scientist involved in the discovery was philip currie 
assistant director of the tyrrell museum of paleontology in 
alberta canada 
williams said the skull had been on display but not for at 
least the last 10 years 
bakker said tyrannosaurus rex is the most popular dinosaur among 
children he gives talks to 
i think tyrannosaurus rex wil continue to be the favorite 
dinosaur but i bet you the pygmy tyrant becomes the second most 
popular he said

the city has fired a police officer 
who waited outside an apartment building for a key for nearly 30 
minutes while officials say a 12yearold girl was being raped 
inside 
james horka 39 was dismissed thursday night after a divided 
city commission found him guilty of violating five departmental 
rules horka an officer for 14 years said he would appeal his 
dismissal 
if i could have changed it in any way if i would have known 
what was going on believe me it would not have happened that 
way horka said i still think i did the right thing no one 
got killed 
horka was accused of breaking 10 department rules the police 
and fire commission dismissed the most serious allegation failing 
to request assistance at the scene 
city attorney howard rosenfeld said he was shocked by dismissal 
of that count but pleased that horka had been dismissed 
officers who have a right to carry a gun and a badge have a 
tremendous obligation to the public rosenfeld said they must 
meet that obligation if they wish to remain police officers in our 
opinion officer horka did not meet those obligations 
horka was found in violation of conduct unbecoming an officer 
unsatisfactory performance in the line of duty improper filing of 
a report abuse of command at the scene and violation of rules 
the last means that since horka was found in violation of any 
department rule he was found in violation of that regulation as 
well 
the disciplinary hearings began shortly after horka and two 
other officers answered a report of a home invasion on dec 21 
horka maintained he did not break into the apartment upon 
arriving because he feared the assailant might harm the girl and 
her 10yearold brother inside 
they waited outside almost 30 minutes with the girls frantic 
mother for the landlord to bring a key rather than breaking in to 
rescue the girl 
four officers later entered the apartment through a back door 
which had been unlocked and arrested benjamin valentine 19 of 
chicago valentine was charged with rape burglary home invasion 
and aggravated kidnapping he is awaiting trial 
the two officers who accompanied horka also are scheduled for 
disciplinary hearings

the marine corps has carried out 
witch hunts for lesbians while tolerating homosexual men says 
a marine who says she is a target in a lesbianism investigation at 
the services east coast boot camp 
the corps denies the accusation although statistics show a 
disproportionate number of women have been dismissed for 
homosexuality 
the naval investigative services investigation at the marine 
corps recruit depot centers on 10 women and is likely to expand 
said the woman marine who denies being homosexual and has not been 
charged 
five marine women have been charged with various counts 
including committing indecent acts two other women who were due to 
go before administrative hearing boards are seeking discharges 
every base ive been on has had one of these socalled witch 
hunts said the woman a member of the marines for six years who 
spoke on condition of anonymity this is the only time ive know 
of that anyone has gone to the press 
she said she did so to show theres an injustice being done 
if theyre going to conduct these investigations they need to 
do it on the male side of the house as well she said 
it would be such an embarrassment for the men to do this 
she said they would have to admit that among the few and the 
proud they also have some gays in there 
each year 20000 recruits men and women pass through parris 
island the corps only basic training base for woman marines 
there are 10060 women in the marines 
according to defense department figures 90 women and 219 men 
have been dismissed for homosexuality in the past three federal 
fiscal years although women comprise less than 5 percent of the 
corps 
during the same period 662 marine homosexuality cases were 
investigated the figures show about a third of those 
investigations centered on women 
however corps spokeswoman joanne schilling in washington said 
lesbians do not get special attention while homosexual men are 
tolerated she said there is no clear reason for the disparity and 
that the matter has never been studied 
she said that it would be a commanding officers responsibility 
to check out any reported violations of a military law 
the parris island investigation is not routine but its not 
an unprecedented thing said maj robert mclean a base 
spokesman the base doesnt announce such hearings but will answer 
media inquiries about them mclean said 
he said that while records of such cases are usually kept only 
about two years he understands there were similar proceedings 
three or four years ago the current proceedings are article 32 
hearings which are similar to civilian grand jury hearings 
they amount to an open investigation into the allegations in 
which the defendants have certain rights and witnesses for both 
sides can be called following the hearing the investigating 
officer makes a nonbinding recommendation to the marines 
commanding officer 
the recommendation may be that the charges go to a 
courtmartial that the marine go before an administrative 
discharge board or that the charges be dismissed 
an administrative discharge board would determine whether the 
defendant has the potential for further service a courtmartial 
could lead to a prison sentence 
in addition to committing indencent acts the defendants face 
various charges including dereliction of duty sodomy conspiracy 
to obstruct justice and assault 
mclean noted that not all the charges are related to 
homosexuality and in a larger sense we are talking about 
breaches of good order and discipline 
the corps doesnt tolerate homosexuality because it is 
contrary to good order and discipline not because there is a 
statement being made about lifestyles he said 
he added that recruit training must be conducted with the 
highest standards of order and discipline

the international committee of the red cross said 
it is defying an ethiopian government order to leave that countrys 
wartorn northern tigre and eritrea provinces where there is 
drought and famine 
the red cross asked authorities to let relief agencies continue 
their work in the provinces 
intensified fighting has made the needs of the civilian 
population living in conflict zones particularly urgent the 
committee said in a statement thursday night there is now an 
even greater need to continue and even increase the protection and 
assistance activities 
the agency has stopped virtually all relief work in the two 
provinces but its roughly 25 delegates are staying in the area in 
hopes the marxist government will revise its stand committee 
official catherine peduzzi said 
the agency said it is committed to uphold its mandate as a 
neutral intermediary in conflict areas citing a humanitarian 
responsibility for the fate of some 5 million people in the two 
provinces 
children are showing very high levels of malnutrition the 
statement said 
the ethiopian government told international relief agencies 
wednesday to recall all foreign workers from tigre and eritrea for 
security reasons president mengistu haile mariam said last week 
that government troops are mobilizing to crush a longstanding 
rebellion in region 
the red cross said it immediately asked the government to 
reconsider the expulsion order

in neighboring tigre another separatist group the tigre 
peoples liberation front has been fighting for 14 years

the governmentcontrolled media blamed 
south africa today for a car bombing that seriously injured a white 
member of the african national congress 
south africa denied responsibility 
albie sachs a south african lawyer remained in a maputo 
hospital after the thursday morning explosion that occurred as he 
entered his car outside his apartment in downtown maputo 
sachs was jailed by south african authorities for more than 
three months without charge in 1963 he also defended members of 
the congress 
the congress banned in 1960 is the major guerrilla group 
fighting south africas whiteled government 
he has lived in mozambique for 10 years and works at the 
countrys ministry of justice 
the long and criminal arm of the pretoria regime has again 
reached into maputo to carrry out another savage and odious 
crime said noticias a maputo daily 
sachs committed what is in the eyes of pretoria the greatest 
of all crimes he frontally opposed apartheid he openly challenged 
the racist regime the frontpage editorial added 
reports on mozambican radio and television also blamed south 
africa the national news agency aim reported 
south africas governmentrun television quoted foreign minister 
roelof botha as saying that south africa could not be held 
responsible for the conflict in mozambique and certainly not for 
violence which emanated from faction fighting in the anc 
none of the mozambican reports cited any evidence linking south 
africa to the blast but they noted a recent series of attacks 
carried out against anc members 
at least six congress members have been killed in countries 
outside south africa this year south africa has denied 
responsibility for the deaths although it repeatedly warns it will 
cross its borders in pursuit of members 
tom lodge a political scientist at johannesburgs university of 
the witwatersrand and an expert on the congress said sachs was a 
member but that he was not actively working for the group in 
mozambique and was not an officer in the organization which is 
composed mainly of blacks 
the us embassy in maputo condemned the attack and said we 
note that the incident takes place after several recent attacks 
against purported members of the anc 
south africa and mozambique signed a mutual nonaggression pact 
in 1984 but both sidely regularly accuse the other of violations 
sachs born in 1935 was the son of a prominent trade unionist 
sachs was one of the few whites who participated in the african 
national congress defiance campaign that led to the organizations 
banning in 1960 the campaign urged people to ignore apartheid 
laws resulting in thousands of arrests 
after being released from detention in 1963 sachs wrote a book 
about his experiences the prison diary of albie sachs which 
was turned into a stage play in britain 
he worked in britain before going to mozambique as an employee 
of the justice ministry he had just begun drafting a new family 
law for mozambique aim said 
the explosion shattered windows in the nearby portuguese embassy 
and hurled pieces of the car as much as 50 yards away aim reported 
by law and custom in south africa apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

police patrolling ganginfested neighborhoods 
awash in drugs bullets and blood are preparing to saturate the 
streets of the nations secondlargest city in a declared war on 
violence 
were putting together a task force to suppress gang activity 
in the city wherever its at officer bill frio a department 
spokesman said thursday we are not going to broadcast how and 
when were going to do it 
were out there to let these gangbangers know that were 
here were not going to go away and this city belongs to the good 
people said detective tony celli using the street slang for 
gang member 
in recent weeks police have arrested hundreds of gang members 
most plying a burgeoning drug trade and enforcing the perimeters of 
their turf with driveby shootings 
gangs were blamed for 387 killings in los angeles county in 
1987 and as many as 85 so far this year violence has continued 
despite recent enforcement sweeps with five people wounded 
wednesday in three driveby shootings a common style of attack in 
gang wars 
the anticipated roundup involving as many to 1000 police 
officers would be the biggest in a series of mass patrols in 
gangridden areas south of downtown 
gov george deukmejian said thursday that he would send the 
california highway patrol and possibly even the national guard to 
help local authorities control gang violence if asked to do so by 
local officials 
county supervisor kenneth hahn wrote deukmejian asking that the 
guard be sent to ride with police officers as a show of force 
police chief daryl gates who has compared the violence to 
lebanon has won the unprecedented support of politicians fed up 
with gang activity 
earlier this week the city finance committee vote 30 to 
approve a police request for 25 million to cover overtime for the 
gang sweeps approval by the full city council appears certain on 
tuesday 
the council also has approved a request for 16 million to hire 
400 police officers largely because of complaints from residents 
of poor neighborhoods that they werent getting enough police 
protection 
and a private group mothers against gangs in communities has 
been formed to fight gangs it plans to push for antigang 
legislation to help pay for the funerals of innocent victims of 
gang wars and to keep the issue before the public in the style of 
mothers against drunk driving 
police provided few details on plans for a sweep that could be 
launched this weekend refusing to elaborate on gates promise to 
flood the lowincome and workingclass neighborhoods south of 
downtown with blue uniforms 
incensed by the good friday gang shooting that killed one person 
and injured 12 none believed to be gang members gates said hed 
deploy 1000 officers drawn from across the city and working on 
overtime 
in previous sweeps officers have cruised the streets 
concentrating on streetcorner drug markets and stopping people 
wearing gang colors on wednesday and thursday police arrested 210 
people for misdemeanors felonies and outstanding warrants and 128 
of those arrested were alleged gang members 
gangs including the violent crips and the bloods which have 
spread their activities to cities nationwide have long been active 
in the inner city and police statistics show no dramatic increase 
in the level of violence 
but authorities say traditional turf battles are giving way to 
drugdealing wars here and throughout the west as los angeles gangs 
try to control distribution of crack the smokeable form of 
cocaine 
warring gangs said councilman zev yaroslavsky are creating 
homicide thats worse than beirut

ussupported rebels have agreed to 
resume highlevel talks with nicaraguas government to end a nearly 
7yearold civil war but said several conditions must be fulfilled 
first 
the directorate of the nicaraguan resistance said thursday in a 
letter that it had agreed to come to managua april 15 for the 
talks the first since leaders of the two sides agreed to a 
ceasefire plan on march 23 
the second meeting had been scheduled for april 6 but the 
contras said they were postponing it because the sandinistas had 
failed to fully comply with provisions of the ceasefire agreement 
signed in the southern border town of sapoa 
defense minister humberto ortega head of the government 
delegation and the brother of president daniel ortega had offered 
to hold the negotiations either april 9 or april 15 
spokesmen for the rebels known as contras charged the 
government withheld newsprint from the opposition newspaper la 
prensa violating the accords provision for full press freedom in 
nicaragua 
the government also failed to include all the prisoners the 
contras had asked for when it released 100 political prisoners on 
april 1 as called for under the agreement the contras said 
in thursdays letter to humberto ortega rebel leaders accepted 
as an involuntary error the failure to release all of the 
requested political prisoners it said the government lacked enough 
time to arrange for all of the requested names to be released 
sandinista and contra military delegations were to continue 
talks today on technical details of providing humanitarian aid to 
the rebels and controlling zones where the insurgents are to gather 
during a 60day ceasefire that began on april 1 
on thursday the delegations finished defining exact locations 
of the seven rebel zones and began considering a 34point rebel 
plan governing conduct in those zones said maj gen jaoquin 
cuadra head of the sandinista military delegation 
we already have discharged an important part of the agenda 
which was the point on localization of the zones cuadra said 
after thursdays session in sapoa 
cuadra said the government had not formally responded to the 
34point plan presented by the contras outlining rebel conduct 
inside the zones but he said the plan has several positive 
points that perfectly can be considered by the government 
the march 23 accord does not specify if and under what 
conditions the contras are to lay down their arms contra leaders 
have vowed not to 
roberto urroz a member of the rebel military delegation called 
for complete contra autonomy in the zones 
what we want is that in the zones we have real control 
urroz said adding the rebels were seeking security integrity 
and communications without interference from the government 
still unresolved were pledges of security for the contras how 
they would receive food and other supplies who would control the 
areas and how compliance would be verified 
meanwhile president oscar arias of costa rica announced his 
government was prepared to administer a portion of a 48 million 
humanitarian aid package for nicaragua approved by the us 
congress last month to treat nicaraguan children injured in the 
civil war 
nicaraguan president ortega rejected as illegal plans to 
have the us agency for international development administer the 
aid including assistance for the contras 
the sapoa accord calls for a neutral party to administer any 
outside humanitarian aid for the contras 
we can never neglect our aid to the children victims of the 
war it is a matter of a humanitarian gesture and i will try to do 
it arias said 
arias received the nobel peace prize in december for authoring 
the regional peace plan signed by central americas five presidents 
on aug 7

gave no details after the meeting gemayel returned to lebanon in 
the army helicopter which brought him on the 100mile flight to 
cyprus he made no statement 
shultz told reporters before leaving amman jordan that 
stability in lebanon would be a great advantage in our efforts 
against terrorism in seeking the release of nine americans held 
hostage in lebanon 
he said a new division of power among the competing factions 
would help all countries in the area including israel and syria 
itself 
we want to see an election go off successfully in lebanon 
shultz said referring to presidential balloting which must be held 
by september when gemayels term expires 
gemayel a maronite christian has sought for nearly six years 
to gain control of his country but syria lebanons more powerful 
neighbor to the east plays a dominant role in lebanese politics 
a new distribution of political power in lebanon could reduce 
syrias military presence there which is becoming an economic 
drain on damascus 
whether it would help american and other hostages is not clear 
although a senior us official said thursday that shultz also 
talked to syrian president hafez assad about their plight 
many of the 22 foreign hostages are believed held by an 
iranianinfluenced group possibly beyond the reach of syrian 
power although syria has close ties with iran the longestheld 
hostage is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
an administration source said thursday in santa barbara calif 
where president reagan is vacationing that reagan sent a letter to 
gemayel expressing concern about the continuing conflict in lebanon 
the official said he had not seen the letter but i would 
characterize it as underscoring the mutual interests that the 
united states and lebanon have in building peace in the region 
in washington a state department official said the united 
states was serving as a postman between assad and gemayel who 
have not spoken to each other in over a year 
the two us officials spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the aim of a new lebanese constitution would be to modify the 
national pact devised in 1943 that allocated the top positions 
in the government to specific religious groups 
the president is a christian the premier is a sunni moslem and 
the speaker of parliament is a shiite moslem in the ensuing 45 
years moslems overtook christians as a majority and demanded a 
larger role 
if the diplomatic effort succeeds it will mark a turnabout in 
shultzs fortunes in lebanon 
five years ago he thought he had worked out an agreement 
between lebanon and israel for the two to cooperate economically 
politically and diplomatically syria undercut the accord and it 
fell apart 
in the meantime syria increased its power in lebanon 
in southern lebanon near the israeli border the situation is 
especially unstable palestinians fought with the shiite amal 
movement while hezbollah an iranianlinked group was suspected of 
kidnappings and hijackings 
israel which drove to beirut in a 1982 invasion is arming the 
christianled south lebanese army militia and occupies a strip of 
land north of its border 
reagan accused syria in 1986 of promoting terrorism he ordered 
us ambassador william eagleton to withdraw barred highlevel 
meetings with syrian officials stopped sales of high technology 
and imposed other sanctions 
last september eagleton was sent back to damascus and most of 
the sanctions quietly disappeared shultz stopped in damascus twice 
last month and returned again tuesday 
assad is an outspoken supporter of the plos having a separate 
seat at proposed middle east peace talks shultzs plan would 
exclude the palestine liberation organization and seat palestinians 
as part of a jordanian delegation 
assad also demands israels withdrawal from the golan heights a 
security belt syria lost in the 1967 sixday war that now serves as 
a buffer to protect northern israeli villages from a resumption of 
bombardment from across the border

parliamentary campaigning officially 
began today and the government set national assembly elections for 
april 26 
the central election management committee called for fair and 
orderly elections and warned against any illegal campaigning 
the elections will be the first time in 17 years that just one 
lawmaker is being elected from each district 
president roh taewoo of the governing democratic justice party 
elected dec 16 is seeking a majority in the onehouse 
legislature division among opposition parties may give the 
governing party the edge 
candidates immediately began to register with the committee 
about 1300 candidates were expected to register by the wednesday 
deadline 
some campaigning already has begun with posters going up in 
many places and politicians taking advantage of various gatherings 
to attack the opposing side 
under a new constitution that took effect feb 25 aimed at 
democratic reform 224 lawmakers will be elected to fouryear terms 
from singlemember districts 
an additional 75 seats will be decided under a bonus system 
based on the parties nationwide polling strength 
in recent elections two lawmakers were elected from each 
district but that system has been scrapped in response to public 
criticism that voters wishes were not truly represented when the 
first runnersup were elected too 
the governing party is hoping for a total of 163 seats in the 
direct voting giving it 55 percent of the 299 assembly seats 
in the presidential elections on dec 16 roh won with just 366 
percent of the vote main opposition leaders kim youngsam and kim 
daejung received 55 percent of the vote but split it between them 
the main opposition reunification democratic party controlled 
by kim youngsam aims at 80 seats in the direct voting other 
opposition groups like kim daejung party for peace and 
democracy also have urged voters to give the opposition enough 
assembly seats to allow it to effectively check the roh 
administration 
the two kims and other opposition politicians charge that the 
roh administration is an extension of the preceding government of 
chun doohwan who left office feb 25 after a sevenyear term 
chuns younger brother chun kyunghwan was arrested last week 
on charges of embezzling more than 10 million influence peddling 
and tax evasion while heading saemaul undong new community 
movement a semiofficial rural and urban development program the 
arrest was seen as a move by roh to distance himself from chun 
kim daejung has accused former president chun of amassing a 
fortune while in office and illegally taking huge sums of money out 
of the country to invest in foreign stock land and other real 
estate in the united states and australia 
the former president now traveling in the united states has 
yet to respond to the charges

more than 10000 residents of an industrial city 
in the ural mountains staged a street demonstration to protest smog 
that has burned skin and caused lung and heart problems a 
newspaper reported 
komsomolskaya pravda the daily of the youth organization 
komsomol said the protesters in the city of nizhny tagil demanded 
that two 45yearold cokeburning furnaces at a steel plant be 
closed 
who will answer for the 54 stillborn children in 1987 a 
crying woman said at the demonstration 
komsomolskaya pravda did not say when the protest occurred in 
the city of 405000 people 900 miles east of moscow but it 
appeared to have been in february or march 
there have been several reports of environmental protests in the 
soviet union since communist party general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev came to power three years ago and encouraged freer 
expression 
komsomolskaya pravda in an article published wednesday said 
the government lists nizhny tagil among the 50 soviet cities whose 
pollution level exceeds sanitary standards 
smog is common in the city and in the morning the faces of 
children on the way to kindergarten burn the newspaper said 
one doctor said the number of children hospitalized for serious 
lung and heart ailments caused by pollution had risen by 33 
percent he didnt say over what period 
a commission of the presidium of the russian republics council 
of ministers the republics highest governmental body ordered the 
two cokeburning furnaces at the nizhny tagil metallurgical complex 
closed last september because of excessive pollution the newspaper 
said 
but the ministry of ferrous metallurgy decided to keep the 
furnaces open until new cleaner furnaces were completed 
the complex which includes plants that build railroad cars and 
boilers and a cement factory spews out 629000 tons of harmful 
substances a year according to komsomolskaya pravda 
the health problems led to what komsomolskaya pravda called an 
explosion in public consciousness 
children sent the top party official of the metallurgical 
complex drawings of smokestacks smog enveloping living areas and 
the handwritten words i dont want to die 
after the demonstration the minister of ferrous metallurgy 
ordered one of the two coke furnaces stopped but the other 
continues to pollute the city the newspaper said a petition 
signed by 8500 nizhny tagil residents demanding further action has 
been sent to the national council of ministers the newspaper said

a former top aide to impeached gov evan 
mecham has been convicted of theft by extortion for threatening a 
parole board member to get him to support a mecham appointee 
sam steiger 59 a former fiveterm congressman was found 
guilty thursday by a maricopa county superior court jury that 
deliberated for 3 hours 
neither steiger nor his attorney tom karas would say whether 
they planned an appeal well take it one step at a time karas 
said 
its safe to say im not real pleased steiger told 
reporters 
steiger was found guilty of threatening to withhold permission 
for ron johnson a member of the state board of pardons and 
paroles to work as a parttime tempe justice of the peace and 
threatening to remove him from the board unless he voted to retain 
executive director patricia costello a mecham appointee 
judge ronald reinstein scheduled a may 6 sentencing for steiger 
who faces up to five years in prison steiger is free on his own 
recognizance 
we dont take joy in a conviction but we feel it was a fair 
trial said prosecutor michael cudahy an assistant attorney 
general we felt it was a just verdict 
jury foreman greg jones said the deciding factor behind the 
verdict was the tapes of the phone call between steiger and 
johnson johnson called steiger at home from the office of the 
state attorney general who recorded the call 
jones said the jurors had no difficulty reaching a verdict we 
listened to all the tapes and examined all the evidence again but 
it was unanimous he said 
steiger asked what hed do differently said id have 
probably hung up on ron johnson when he called me at home 
reached shortly after the verdict was announced mecham said 
im sad to hear it sam meant no harm to anybody and im sorry 
to hear it 
mecham was removed from office monday when the state senate 
convicted him of two impeachment charges 
steiger denied on the stand monday that he threatened johnson or 
told him how he should vote 
but the state alleged that steiger followed up on the alleged 
threat in a letter and a telephone conversation after johnson voted 
with the board majority to seek ms costellos resignation on 
grounds of low staff morale 
steiger testified that he did suggest that johnson should back 
ms costello but denied that he tried to steal johnsons vote 
by threatening his job 
he acknowledged lying to an attorney generals investigator when 
he originally denied making the threat 
steiger gave up his 3rd congressional district seat in 1976 to 
run unsuccessfully for the us senate

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis held a widening lead over jesse jackson two weeks before 
new yorks primary a poll indicated today 
the marist college institute for public opinion said 47 percent 
of likely new york voters picked dukakis 31 percent backed jackson 
and 6 percent chose tennessee sen albert gore jr 
an additional 8 percent said they would vote for an 
uncommitted slate of delegates that hopes to draft new york 
gov mario cuomo for the nomination at the national convention the 
primary is april 19 
illinois sen paul simon who put his campaign into mothballs on 
thursday was supported by 2 percent of the democrats surveyed and 
6 percent said they were undecided 
the margin of error for the poll conducted tuesday and 
wednesday was 5 percentage points 
in a similar poll conducted in midmarch by the marist 
pollsters dukakis was the choice of 37 percent of the democrats 
jackson had 28 percent gore had 5 percent uncommitted was at 10 
percent simon was at 4 percent and 13 percent said they were 
undecided 
lee miringoff director of the marist institute said dukakis 
appeared to be doing best in the suburban counties surrounding new 
york city and in upstate new york he said dukakis was running 
about even with jackson in new york city 
jacksons support among white voters remained at about 14 
percent in the latest marist poll the same as in the midmarch 
poll 
among jewish voters who make up about 25 percent of the new 
york democratic primary voters dukakis was the choice of 68 
percent of those surveyed gore was at 10 percent and jackson at 9 
percent in the midmarch poll dukakis was the choice of 60 
percent of the likely jewish voters gore was at 9 percent and 
jackson was at 4 percent 
the race appeared to be a bit tighter when only democrats who 
said they were very likely to vote in the primary were 
questioned said miringoff among that group which could be 
important if there is a low voter turnout dukakis was at 42 
percent jackson at 34 percent gore at 8 percent uncommitted at 8 
percent simon at 2 percent and 6 percent said they were undecided 
regarding cuomo 46 percent of those democrats surveyed said the 
governor should run for president down from 59 percent in 
midmarch while 16 percent said they expected him to eventually 
run down from 24 percent 
with cuomo declining to endorse any of the candidates the 
marist pollsters also asked democrats if cuomo should endorse 
someone before the new york primary 
almost 31 percent said the governor should endorse 25 percent 
said he shouldnt and 43 percent said it didnt make any difference 
to them what cuomo did 
cuomo has said he doesnt want to be a candidate but has 
refused to rule out accepting a draft if there is a deadlocked 
national convention

panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega failed ignominiously 
when an officer loyal to noriega locked the plotters inside an 
arsenal a newspaper reported today 
citing unidentified senior administration officials the chicago 
tribune reported in todays editions that the failure of the 
allegedly usbacked coup has left the reagan administrations 
antinoriega plans in chaos

15000member panama defense forces went to the central american 
nations main arsenal in panama city last month to obtain guns for 
the attempt pretending to be on official military business 
the guard commander at the arsenal however locked the plotters 
inside and reported to his superiors that he thought a coup was in 
progress the newspaper reported 
swift action by noriegas supporters put down the conspiracy and 
resulted in the purge or arrest of nearly three dozen antinoriega 
officers during the last several weeks the tribune reported 
the newspaper quoted a source identified only as a wellplaced 
military expert as saying the abortive coup demonstrates the 
depth to which the administration planners have underestimated

in the end the fouryear corporate war that 
forced oil giant texaco into bankruptcy and the largest civil award 
in us history came down to a silent 10minute electronic payment 
of 3 billion to pennzoil 
the transfer settling pennzoils takeover lawsuit against texaco 
took place thursday in a highsecurity room at texas commerce 
bankhouston and coincidentally halfway between pennzoil 
headquarters and the texaco building 
as a halfdozen tightlipped bank and pennzoil executives 
watched a green computer screen signaled the arrival of four 
texaco payments starting at 1003 am and ending at 1013 am 
about a dozen reporters and photographers watched 
the transfer had to be broken down into four payments since the 
federal reserve system can transfer amounts only as high as one 
cent short of 1 billion 
when the transfer was complete a few people applauded 
were all very glad its all over said david alderson 
pennzoil assistant treasurer 
quite frankly weve been in a holding pattern for over four 
years pennzoil chairman j hugh liedtke said later thursday 
we think were now in a position to invest these funds and to 
make up for lost time liedtke said 
the settlement of the suit which stemmed from texacos 1984 
acquisition of getty oil co allowed the white plains nybased 
company to emerge from bankruptcy protection 
it was part of texacos bankruptcy reorganization plan which a 
federal judge approved march 23 texaco also will begin paying 26 
billion to other creditors 
pennzoil looking for longterm ways to invest the windfall 
actually borrowed 3 billion a couple of weeks ago so it could 
begin investing it in an orderly manner spokesman bob harper said 
the war began with texacos acquisition of getty pennzoil sued 
texaco claiming interference with a planned merger between 
pennzoil and getty 
in november 1985 a houston jury shocked texaco by agreeing with 
pennzoil and awarding the houston company 1053 billion in 
damages the largest civil award in us history 
a state appeals court upheld the verdict but reduced the 3 
billion in punitive damages to 1 billion 
nearly a year ago texaco filed for bankruptcy protection 
saying it had to do so to avoid posting a potentially ruinous 
appeal bond 
in november the texas supreme court refused to hear texacos 
appeal and let the verdict stand texaco then said it was going to 
the us supreme court but a committee of shareholders proposed 
the settlement 
the premise of pennzoils case was that a handshake and a 
persons word was as good as a written contract and that texaco 
violated that rule by plucking getty from pennzoils grasp 
texaco contended getty had invited it to bid and that there was 
no valid contract between pennzoil and getty because all the papers 
had not been signed by the appropriate parties 
texaco also put texas court system under scrutiny challenging 
the trial judges credentials and complaining that texas supreme 
court judges were influenced by large campaign contributions from 
houston lawyer joe jamail who led the pennzoil case 
although he was delighted to settle the case liedtke said the 
outcome probably was not as good for pennzoil as gaining getty 
would have been 
i dont think that 3 billion in any way replaces totally 
the loss the company has suffered but it remains to be seen how 
astutely these funds are reinvested and perhaps we can make up for 
lost ground he said 
attorneys fees including jamails come to about 400 million 
according to pennzoil jamail declined to reveal his share 
ill spend the money on the important things like whiskey 
and women he said smiling 
texaco officials had no comment on the payment 
pennzoil also announced thursday that its board adopted a new 
antitakeover defense a preferred stock purchase rights plan to 
replace a similar poison pill put in place after the jury made 
its award 
the old plan was designed to block a corporate raider from 
appropriating the benefits of the texaco case before it had been 
resolved harper said 
the new plan also was designed to protect pennzoil from unfair 
or coercive actions by opportunistic parties and give pennzoil 
time to make acquisitions using the texaco money liedtke said

the aids virus must make a precise 
change in its protein coat before it can infect cells and drugs 
that can block that change might be able to prevent aids 
infections researchers say in a study published today 
the researchers from the stanford university school of 
medicine said they dont know whether such drugs could be 
developed in a form that could make tham safe and effective for use 
in humans 
the scientists discovered that the aids virus a piece of 
genetic material housed in a complex envelope of fats and proteins 
can infect cells only if its outer envelope protein is clipped into 
two pieces 
if this cleavage doesnt occur the virus particles assemble and 
appear normal but are disarmed and unable to infect new cells said 
the leader of the study dr mike mccune who works in the lab of 
dr irving weissman professor of pathology at stanfords school of 
medicine the results appear today in the journal cell 
the scientists demonstrated their findings by constructing a 
mutant strain of the aids virus that could not complete the 
critical step they found it was unable to enter and infect human 
cells in tissue culture 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome has struck 58270 people 
since june 1981 the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
reported this week the disease has killed 32545 
the researchers believe the cleavage step is critical to the 
virus infectivity because it makes the virus envelope protein 
sticky which allows it to fuse to the membrane of a cell it 
seeks to infect 
after the virus has fused to the cells membrane it can enter 
the cell and remain hidden from the bodys immune system reproduce 
and eventually begin to spread infection throughout the body 
the scientists believe that if they can prevent the aids virus 
from sticking to cells they might be able to suppress infection 
the study was sponsored by grants from the national cancer 
institute and the national institutes of health

the state assembly has approved a bill 
to allow the death penalty for people who kill children and set the 
stage for a vote next week on a wiretap measure aimed at drug 
dealers 
both votes were considered defeats for speaker willie brown and 
were led by minority republicans and the socalled gang of five 
dissident democrats opposed to brown 
the votes came during a fivehour floor session thursday marked 
by closeddoor party caucuses numerous small floor huddles and a 
constant undercurrent of rumors that brown might soon be ousted by 
the 36 republicans teaming with the gang of five it takes 41 votes 
to elect or remove a speaker in the 80member assembly 
the two anticrime bills had been stalled in the public safety 
committee 
the death penalty bill was killed by that committee on march 21 
on monday republicans and the gang of five combined to withdraw it 
from committee on a 4130 vote the first such successful 
withdrawal motion in 28 years such motions are considered a 
challenge to the authority of the speaker who appoints committee 
members 
the bill would make child murder a special circumstance 
qualifying a murderer for the death sentence along with such other 
specified crimes as murder of a police office or elected official 
or murder committed during a felony 
the bill was approved 627 after a long and emotional debate and 
sent to the senate 
the original wiretap bill was approved by the senate last june 
and has been in the public safety committee since then 
supporters could not try to withdraw that bill because it hadnt 
been rejected by the committee so instead they took an unrelated 
bill introduced by the same lawmaker sen robert presley that was 
already on the floor and with his permission voted 4813 to amend 
it by adding the wiretap measure 
the amended bill is scheduled for a floor vote next thursday 
the bill would allow police with approval of the attorney 
general or a district attorney to petition a superior court for a 
wiretap authorization the police would have to show that it was 
likely that a drug possession or sale offense had been or would be 
committed

police raided and seized a house where 
crack was sold and operated it themselves for seven hours in a 
sting operation in which 32 people were arrested officers say 
the arrests were a new strategy aimed at sowing fear among crack 
users said capt b ray armand head of the city police narcotic 
squad 
you always go after the top people selling the drugs but now 
were attacking the demand factor armand said were probably 
going to do this again it was very successful 
during the operation wednesday night and early thursday 
officers were leading people they had arrested out the front door 
of the house while new customers were coming in the back he said 
at times officers said people were lined up at the back door 
and as many as six customer cars lined the curb while police 
hurriedly packaged the crack form of cocaine in plastic bags 
several female customers left children including one less than 
a year old in their cars while they went inside to purchase crack 
officers said 
officers said customers continued to enter the house even after 
a woman reported on a citizens band radio that police had taken 
over the house 
we turned away twice as many suspects as we arrested 
armand said they will go to any lengths to get drugs 
people were arrested on investigative charges of possession of a 
controlled substance

an autopsy of an israeli girl killed in a clash 
with palestinians found that she was struck in the head by a bullet 
and a large object and cast doubts on army reports that arabs 
stoned her to death 
details provided by israel television and radio raised the 
possibility that 15yearold tirza porat was shot accidentally by 
one of the guards accompanying teenage jewish settlers on a 
holiday hike in the west bank 
two arabs were killed and two were wounded in the incident 
wednesday in the village of beita 
today two palestinians were shot and wounded in separate 
clashes with troops in antioccupation unrest in the west bank and 
gaza strip arab hospital officials said 
on jerusalems temple mount several dozen palestinians shouted 
nationalist slogans after noon prayers on the moslem sabbath 
demonstrators dispersed quickly after about 10 border policemen 
approached 
it remained unclear how tirza was killed the army first said 
she and the two arabs were shot to death it later said tirza was 
stoned to death by villagers 
an army official citing autopsy results then said tirza was 
struck in the head by both a bullet and a large object possibly a 
stone the official said the cause of death was not yet known and 
that investigators did not know from which weapon the bullet was 
fired 
israel television quoting a military source said the bullet 
was fired from one of the two guards m16 rifles but that it 
wasnt known who pulled the trigger the source also was quoted as 
saying that when arabs wrested the guns away from the israeli 
guards they probably were already empty 
israel radio quoted an army report as saying that tirza also was 
struck in the head by a rock hurled by the mother and sister of one 
of the arabs killed the two women were arrested the report said 
the next day the army blew up five homes of beita arabs 
allegedly involved in the clash and rounded up hundreds of arabs 
for questioning soldiers fatally shot an arab youth who the army 
said ignored orders to stop 
tirza the first israeli civilian killed in four months of 
unrest in the occupied territories was buried near her home in the 
west bank settlement elon moreh according to un figures 141 
arabs and one israeli soldier have died 
the girls death increased tension between the 15 million 
palestinians and the 65000 jewish settlers living the territories 
occupied by israel since the 1967 middle east war 
on thursday armed israeli civilians beat residents broke 
windows and fired shots into the air in two villages near beita 
israel radio citing army investigators said wednesdays 
violence began after a group of 16 teenagers from elon moreh 
accompanied by two armed guards were stoned by arab youths as they 
hiked near beita 
the two guards disagreed over what to do next the radio report 
said one of the guards romam al dubi 26 wanted to open fire 
but the second guard menachem ilan 55 asked him not to 
according to the report 
al dubi then told the children to gather around him to serve as 
a barrier and started shooting the radio report said the arab 
youths eventually disarmed him and took the israelis to beita 
where they were attacked by villagers the report said 
thirteen israelis were wounded in the clash 
israeli media reports have identified al dubi as an extreme 
religious nationalist and a follower of the antiarab kach movement 
of us born rabbi meir kahane 
last year the army barred al dubi from entering the west bank 
city of nablus for three months after he repeatedly sought 
confrontations with arabs over prayer rights at a site in the city 
which is holy to both arabs and jews 
the armys west bank commander maj gen armram mitzna told 
israel television that hundreds of beita villagers played a 
role in wednesdays clash 
however army officials also have said many villagers helped the 
teenagers hiding some in their homes and calling ambulances 
beita remained under curfew as soldiers searched for residents 
many of whom had fled to nearby ravines and neighboring villages 
israel television said the army distributed leaflets in the area 
calling on beita residents to surrender

an executive of a second magazine has echoed a 
complaint that this years pulitzer prize to a philadelphia 
inquirer reporter should be reconsidered because the winning entry 
did not break new ground 
harpers magazine publisher john r macarthur said thursday he 
agreed with the contention of a washington weekly the national 
journal that the series on secret pentagon spending by tim weiner 
leaned heavily on information another reporter published in the two 
magazines 
the formal complaint of the journal will be discussed by the 
executive committee of the pulitzer board and some kind of judgment 
should be made by next week the boards secretary robert 
christopher said 
christopher added that breaking new ground is not a 
requirement for winning the national reporting prize 
richard frank editor of the national journal said in a letter 
to the board that weiners series was built on an earlier story in 
the journal by david c morrison and plows no new journalistic 
ground 
macarthur said weiners stories were accompanied by an annotated 
document similar to a feature morrison did for the january 1987 
issue of harpers 
it doesnt seem quite right that the inquirer gets a pulitzer 
prize unless originality has nothing to do with prize giving these 
days macarthur said in a telephone call to the associated press 
he said he did not plan to write the pulitzer board 
christopher said only he and the board chairman david 
laventhol had seen the complaint but copies were being circulated 
to the half dozen members of the executive committee 
laventhol president of times mirror co which owns the 
national journal said the magazine checked with him before 
protesting 
laventhol said he told the journal to go ahead if it felt 
strongly about the issue he said his acquiescence did not 
necessarily mean he agreed with its position 
another board member eugene l roberts jr the inquirers 
executive editor said his only role in the review would be to 
respond to the journals complaint and answer questions of other 
board members

charles merrill mount is a man of contradictions 
born and raised in brooklyn he has the accent and manners of a 
british gentleman a published biographer and guggenheim foundation 
fellow he wears natty suits from the salvation army 
perhaps the biggest contradiction however is whether he is a 
scholarly collector of rare documents or a thief 
today a jury will be asked to decide if he is a scholarly 
collector of rare documents or a thief closing arguments were 
expected to be completed by midday with jury deliberation to 
follow 
mount is charged with interstate transportation of stolen goods 
letters and documents he allegedly stole from the library of 
congress and the national archives the charge carries a possible 
sentence of 10 years in prison and 500000 
mounts friends say the charges are unbelievable his lawyer 
says they are unprovable 
i dont think he could have done it psychologically said 
gloucester artist john manship who testified for mount during his 
threeweek trial he has too much respect for history and 
scholarship to steal from archives 
an engaging man with a sharp wit and piercing blue eyes mount 
contends he has been reduced to poverty since the government seized 
his savings he was evicted from his washington boarding house and 
has stayed at a ymca during the trial the court rejected his pleas 
for money to bring witnesses over from ireland who he claims can 
prove his ownership of the documents 
im not allowed witnesses he said its not a trial 
mount is charged with selling a boston bookshop letters written 
by artist james mcneill whistler winston churchill and author 
henry james that belonged to the library of congress he was 
arrested while allegedly trying to sell letters and documents 
signed by abraham lincoln and various civil war generals that had 
been taken from the national archives 
mount has not been charged with theft but assistant us 
attorney martin murphy said in the trials opening arguments that 
it is the governments contention that mount took the papers 
the prosecution presented testimony establishing that mount had 
access to the documents in may and july 1987 
mount testified he bought the whistler papers at paris shops in 
the 50s and 60s and received the civil war papers from an irish 
parish priest in 1961 who gave him the documents in a biscuit tin 
the priest has since died 
the defense also has noted that mount has over the years donated 
many of his papers to the library of congress 
why would i steal from my own heirs mount asked 
charles mcginty mounts public defender has attacked the 
governments case as a shoddy arrest not justified by any kind of 
investigative effort 
they never had definitive word from the institutions that the 
letters were missing from their files he said 
the defenses case has largely rested on mounts testimony and 
the prosecution has raised questions about his background at the 
time of his arrest in august the government revealed mount was 
born sherman suchow 59 years ago in brooklyn and once was charged 
with making false statements in a passport application 
mount freely admits he is a product of brooklyn and 
attributes his accent to his irish neighbors his conviction on the 
passport charge was reversed on appeal 
mount has been recognized for his work as an artist and writer 
he has written wellreceived biographies of painters john singer 
sargent gilbert stuart and claude monet he received a guggenheim 
fellowship in 1956 
but mount frets his reputation has been destroyed by the case no 
matter what the verdict 
to be charged with something of a sleazy nature at this time 
in my life its a disgrace he said

a day after lawyers for teamsters president 
jackie presser challenged federal prosecutors to put up or shut 
up a potentially key witness for pressers labor racketeering 
and embezzlement trial entered a guilty plea 
john a jack nardi jr 46 appeared before us district 
judge george w white and pleaded guilty thursday to being a 
ghost employee of teamsters local 507 in cleveland from 1972 to 
1978 he was paid about 109000 without doing any work for the 
local of which presser was secretarytreasurer 
the guilty pleas put in effect an agreement that requires nardi 
to testify as a government witness the judge deferred sentencing 
and said that nardis cooperation with government prosecutors would 
be considered when sentencing eventually occurs 
nardis plea came as pressers lawyers were seeking to have 
white dismiss all charges labor racketeering embezzlement and 
falsifying documents against the teamsters boss 
in documents filed with the court wednesday defense lawyers 
alleged that an internal memo to former fbi director william 
webster showed that webster knew that presser was authorized to 
hire nardi and others who did no work 
pressers role as an fbi informant has been confirmed repeatedly 
in various legal proceedings 
pressers defense team stated if authorization existed then 
no crime was committed but now when the proceedings have 
reached the appropriate juncture for prosecutors to come forward 
with its evidence and in effect put up or shut up it fails to 
put up anything 
pressers trial is scheduled to begin july 12

the dominant type of flu this season has evolved 
into four separate variations complicating the task of developing 
the proper vaccine for next winter federal health officials say 
deaths from influenza and pneumonia have exceeded the centers 
for disease controls statistical epidemic threshold for the 
past seven weeks that figure is one indicator that the flu season 
remains under way although the agency does not attempt to 
tabulate the specific numbers of americans dying from flu data is 
collected from 121 cities but the cdc does not attempt to project a 
national figure 
although the 19871988 flu season is winding down some activity 
continues the cdc said new york connecticut and new hampshire 
reported widespread flu outbreaks last week covering areas 
including more than half the population 
eight other states alaska delaware montana new mexico 
north dakota oregon vermont and washington reported less severe 
regional outbreaks 
the type ah3n2 flu prevalent this season has long been 
associated with excess mortality the cdc said 
late last year when the influenza season got under way the cdc 
saw evidence of an apparent drift in the type ah3n2 one of 
three major types of flu 
the ah3n2 virus the cdc said at the time was drifting 
away from the leningrad flu the ah3n2 strain the 19871988 flu 
vaccine was designed to stop and toward a somewhat different form 
the cdc said thursday in its weekly report it has now identified 
four different variants of ah3n2 flu virus circulating in the 
united states in recent months they are known as the sichuan flu 
the victoria flu the sydney flu and the shanghai flu 
the 198788 vaccine did not protect patients against the various 
ah3n2 viruses as well as it could have against the leningrad 
flu said suzanne gaventa a researcher with the influenza 
branch 
the four different viruses present a problem for immunization 
experts ms gaventa said 
the atlantabased cdcs immunization practices advisory 
committee each year recommends which flu types the next winters 
vaccine should protect against and which specific strains of those 
types should be targeted the reports of the four different ah3n2 
strains circulating this past winter will be used in deciding 
which h3n2 antigen to use in next winters vaccine ms gaventa 
said 
a flu vaccine cant protect optimally against four different flu 
viruses belonging to the same type she said instead vaccine 
experts will try to determine which virus to target and how much 
protection that vaccine might offer against closely related viruses 
cdc recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and 
those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu

poor indoor air quality caused by 
energyefficient heating cooling and ventilation systems is a 
serious health problem that may be aggravated by ignorance among 
contractors says an industry spokesman commenting on a study 
released today 
the study found that us army trainees housed in modern 
barracks were about 50 percent more likely to contract a 
respiratory infection during basic training than those who stayed 
in older better ventilated buildings 
the study examined the incidence of influenza and other 
respiratory illnesses among about 400000 trainees at four us 
army training centers from october 1982 to september 1986 
the study says the findings may apply to office buildings and 
other structures designed for maximum energy efficiency 
in tight buildings with closed ventilation systems 
airbornetransmitted pathogens are not only recirculated and 
concentrated but also efficiently dispersed through indoor living 
spaces the researchers wrote in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
by contrast in leaky older buildings airbornetransmitted 
agents are diluted by fresh outdoor air and are relatively 
quickly exhausted from indoor spaces said the researchers from 
the walter reed army insitute of research in washington 
it is a serious problem and theres a lot of talk about it 
but it doesnt seem like too many people are doing too many 
things to correct it maybe its because they dont know what to do 
to correct it said david bevirt director of research for the 
sheet metal and air conditioning contractors national association 
in vienna va 
as soon as you take in additional ventilation youre losing 
more energy and so its a tradeoff between energy efficiency 
and air quality he said in a telephone interview thursday 
although there are modern ventilation systems that offer energy 
efficiency as well as improved air quality they tend to be more 
expensive and many contractors may not know about them bevirt said 
his association is putting together a manual for its members 
worldwide that includes information on how to test air quality and 
what can be done to maximize it while offering energy efficiency as 
well he said 
most office buildings and other structures built during the 
energyconscious 1970s feature tight insulation and ventilation 
systems designed to keep outside air outside bevirt said 
in such buildings up to 95 percent of the air in the building 
is recirculated exposing occupants to used air that may be 
filled with viruses and other contaminants said paul klein a 
spokesman for the army institute 
the walter reed study was not the first to examine the socalled 
sick building syndrome but it covered a larger population over 
a longer time period klein said in a telephone interview thursday 
the researchers led by dr john f brundage noted that 
respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious 
illnesses in adults they said recent studies indicate that such 
infections annually account for 75 million us physician visits 
125 million hospitalizations 15 billion in direct medical costs 
and about 150 million lost work days 
klein said the army is reviewing the studys results to see how 
much the buildingrelated illnesses cost and whether any changes 
are needed in the design and construction of its buildings

the emerging agreement in afghanistan would 
send the red army home but may not stop the bloodshed in that 
wartorn country 
under the united nationsbrokered deal the soviet union could 
continue arming the kremlinbacked regime that seized power a 
decade ago and the united states could continue arming the moslem 
guerrillas 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev and his afghan ally najib 
said jointly thursday that the last obstacles to concluding the 
agreements have now been removed and that soviet troops can start 
leaving on may 15 if the agreement is signed quickly 
un mediator diego cordovez later told reporters the agreement 
is now finalized and open for signature he said the signing 
ceremony is expected to take place within a week 
president reagan was cautiously optimistic but wants to 
see the fine print said howard baker white house chief of staff 
secretary george p shultz said today on cbss this morning 
that judging from public statements perhaps what we 
suggested will be agreeable to them but we still want to see the 
answer 
privately administration officials interpreted the 
sovietafghan statement as acceptance of us conditions on aid 
with the apparent resolution of the aid issue cordovez is 
expected to turn his attention to a pakistani demand for the 
formation of an interim government during the soviet withdrawal 
according to us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the composition of such a government would be settled outside 
the united nations talks by the afghans themselves according to 
cordovez american officials and a dispatch by the official soviet 
news agency tass 
with no interim government say the pakistanis civil war will 
rage preventing the return to afghanistan of an estimated 3 
million afghan refugees driven into pakistan and another 2 million 
in iran 
guerrilla leaders and many us government analysts believe 
the prokremlin regime will collapse as the red army leaves but 
najib and his soviet allies believe the regime will survive 
and the warring afghan parties remain far apart over how to 
govern their nation 
the sovietafghan communique urged formation of a coalition 
government with the participation of all forces representing afghan 
society including those who are currently opposed to one 
another and it urged a multiparty system rather than 
oneparty rule patterned after the soviet union 
the resistance has rejected najibs calls for national 
reconciliation on thursday it announced the formation of a 
government to rule over guerrillacontrolled territory and the head 
of the resistance alliance gulbaddin hekmatyar said the 
guerrillas will try to intensify the war 
no doubt when the russians leave afghanistan najibs regime 
will collapse he said to avoid anarchy and possible armed 
clashes to seize power its necessary that all parties agree to a 
temporary government in those parts of afghanistan under 
guerrilla control 
not all the leaders of the sevenparty resistance agreed that 
formation of a guerrilla government was a good idea ahmad gailani 
of the moderate national islamic front of afghanistan said it could 
cut the nation in half 
if there are two governments in afghanistan there is the 
danger of partition into north and south or east and west as with 
north and south korea or east and west germany he said 
advocating a transitional government in exile until the prokremlin 
regime is overthrown 
one congressional source who closely follows events in 
afghanistan reached a similar conclusion based on the formation of 
a new province in northern afghanistan where the soviets have 
taken steps to fortify natural gas fields 
the guerrillas also are split over whether afghanistan should 
have an islamic or secular government 
yunis khalis of the hardline hezbiislami faction said that 
colonialist countries the superpowers east or west american 
or russian have joined hands to prevent the creation of a total 
islamic government in afghanistan 
soviet analysts believe the prokremlin government has a good 
chance of surviving the us embassy in kabul sent a cable to 
washington last september advising the soviets that najibs 110000 
troops in the army police and secret police might be strong enough 
to resist the guerrillas 
a leading soviet expert on afghanistan yuri gankovsky said in 
a lecture in washington on wednesday that the regime of the 
peoples democratic party may survive 
it is impossible to predict the future of najib and his 
colleagues gankovsky said their life is in the hands of the 
almighty 
and vladimir semyonov in a commentary distributed by the 
semiofficial soviet news agency novosti said that gorbachev and 
najib concluded that the policy of reconciliation has found a 
broad response in the opposition including the armed opposition 
us government analysts scoff at the notion that a prosoviet 
government will survive the red army withdrawal 
the soviets have been handing out passes to government officials 
for safe exit from the country according to a new yorkbased 
organization called freedom house which has ties to the resistance 
western intelligence in kabul has also reported that lists are 
being drawn up for possible evacuation 
and one administration observer of afghan events asked why 
gorbachev found it necessary to hold a surprise meeting with najib 
in the soviet central asian city of tashkent said najib must 
have been demanding a bigger dacha than he had been allotted on the 
black sea

an attractive inexperienced undercover 
police officer entrapped john zaccaro jr into selling her cocaine 
zaccaros lawyer told jurors today 
zaccaro the son of former vice presidential candidate geraldine 
ferraro is on trial in vermont district court on allegations he 
illegally sold a quartergram of cocaine to the officer two years 
ago zaccaro was a senior at middlebury college at the time 
charles tetzlaff zaccaros lawyer told jurors in his opening 
statement this morning that the defense doesnt dispute the sale 
but does challenge the police actions 
the defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a 
regulated drug tetzlaff said this is a case of improper and 
overzealous police conduct 
tetzlaff said an attractive female police officer who had 
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped zaccaro 
into making the sale 
john quinn the prosecutor conceded in his opening arguments 
that the undercover agent was inexperienced but he asked jurors to 
keep in mind that the middlebury police department is a lowbudget 
smalltown operation 
quinn also urged jurors not to be swayed by tetzlaffs attacks 
on the police id ask you to focus on what the charge is he 
said dont let anybody put anybody else on trial other than the 
defendant

accounts of the trial 
the trial could last into tuesday said quinn adding that the 
four days of jury selection was unusual for vermont

hour and a half he said thursday its unusual for a case to 
get this kind of publicity

the syrianbacked shiite moslem amal 
militia held control of south lebanon today after a fourday battle 
with iranianbacked rivals police said 
the fighting killed 62 people and wounded 150 police reported 
two west german relief workers who were being held by hezbollah 
members in the basement of a mosque in the coastal town of ghaziyeh 
were freed when amal militiamen overran the town 
they had been abducted thursday but their disappearance had not 
been reported they were identified as heinrich strubig 47 and 
petra schnitzler 24 of the asme humanitas organization 
the mainstream amal led by justice minister nabih berri held 
all major towns and villages in the south and their supply routes 
police said amal is syrias closest ally in lebanon 
diehard fighters of the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah 
or party of god were holed up in three hamlets west of the market 
town of nabatiyeh with shiite mediators negotiating terms for their 
surrender and safe conduct police said 
amals triumph reflected syrias determination to crush a 
growing challenge by iran to its role as the main power broker in 
lebanon 
syria is irans main arab ally in the 7yearold persian gulf 
war against iraq 
but it has been alarmed at hezbollahs widening influence and 
its efforts to seize control of lebanons 12 million shiites the 
countrys largest sect 
police said that one of the hamlets where hezbollah was still 
holding out was jibsheet its main stronghold in the south 
jibsheet is 15 miles southwest of the provincial capital of sidon 
amal fighters surrounded it along with neighboring sharkieh and 
houmin alfouka police said berris fighters were expected to 
occupy the villages once hezbollah evacuated them 
friction between the secular leftist amal and the fundamentalist 
hezbollah which seeks to create an iranianstyle islamic republic 
in lebanon has sharpened since the kidnapping of us marine lt 
col william r higgins 
higgins 43 of danville ky was kidnapped near the ancient 
port of tyre feb 17 while serving with a un observer group in 
south lebanon 
an underground shiite extremist group calling itself the 
organization of the oppressed on earth claimed responsibility 
amal accused hezbollah of being behind the abduction and rounded 
up several hezbollah members it said were involved in the 
kidnapping but a major dragnet failed to locate higgins or his 
captors 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for several shiite 
factions holding many of the other 21 foreigners missing in 
lebanon nine of the hostages are american

jesse jackson said today he has sent a message 
no one can miss to jewish voters troubled by his past actions 
while a new york democratic official said he sees a clear sense 
of some movement by the states party hierarchy toward michael 
dukakis 
jackson dukakis and sen albert gore jr canvassed new york 
city in search of votes in the april 19 primary which will decide 
the breakdown of 255 delegates 
in manhattan jackson would not say whether he has agreed to 
meet with jewish leaders to talk over his 1984 reference to new 
york city as hymietown or his call for a palestinian homeland 
but he said we continue to build relationships we continue to 
heal relationships 
he said that he has reached out to all ethnic groups including 
jews our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism of 
antisemitism or sexism weve sent a message no one can 
miss he said 
new york gov mario cuomo and state party chairman laurence 
kirwan sent a signal to other democratic officials to line up 
behind one of the three democrats in the race and not await an 
endorsement from the governor gore and jackson picked up some 
support but party executive director john marino said he thought 
the massachusetts governor was the beneficiary 
after yesterday i got a clear sense of some movement to 
dukakis marino said today 
a poll released today said dukakis was the choice of 47 percent 
of likely democratic voters while 31 percent backed jackson gore 
was the choice of 6 percent 
the marist college institute for public opinion questioned 404 
democrats tuesday and wednesday for the survey which had a margin 
of error of 5 percentage points a similar survey conducted by the 
institute in midmarch had dukakis the choice of 37 percent of 
democrats and jackson the pick of 28 percent 
a fourth democratic presidential candidate sen paul simon of 
illinois put his campaign in cold storage on thursday and drew 
sharp criticism from jackson for technically remaining in the race 
to keep control of the block of 47 atlarge delegates he will get 
as a result of his illinois primary victory 
if simon dropped out those delegates would go to jackson who 
finished second in illinois 
i would hope that in time mr simon now that he has made 
the decision to leave the race will leave so honorably and hide 
behind no technicalities to block those as my delegates which in 
fact belong to me said jackson 
vice president george bush considered a sure bet for the 
republican presidential nomination even by his only remaining 
rival pat robertson was heading for texas to wind up the 
fundraising phase of his campaign 
robertson who has said he will not campaign in new york 
dropped his secret service protection on thursday but an aide said 
the former television evangelist would remain an active candidate 
up to the gop convention in new orleans in august 
barbara gattullo said robertson hoped to bring a strong 
conservative message to the convention 
the democratic candidates crossed paths often in new york 
appearing at forums sponsored by the state party and the democracy 
project a liberaloriented group 
they often found it difficult to escape the shadows of gov 
mario cuomo and new york city mayor ed koch 
who cares what mario cuomo says responded cuomo when 
pressed about whether he would endorse one of the contenders 
cuomo also has advised gore to tone down criticism of his rivals 
a request seconded by party chairman paul g kirk jr 
i spoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep 
the debate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any 
negative campaigning kirk said 
for the most part weve been quite successful in that regard 
the admonitions that have been addressed to sen gore by gov cuomo 
just help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues in 
a positive way 
no sooner had kirk and cuomo spoken than gore let loose with a 
fresh attack he accused the dukakis campaign of trying to fuel a 
stop jackson movement by spreading the word that a vote for 
gore is a vote for jackson 
the dukakis campaign denied that and jacksons campaign 
manager gerald austin said gore has used that strategy himself 
asked if he would persist in his attacks gore said i think 
there is a legitimate role for drawing a contrast between ones 
approach to the issues ones experience ones philosophy of 
government and those of ones opponents 
koch also was unwilling to heed the admonitions of the governor 
and party chairman and said jews would have to be crazy to vote 
for jackson because of his views on israel 
jackson brushed aside the remark saying let us keep this 
campaign above any form of racial or religious bigotry 
jackson came under strong criticism in 1984 for his relationship 
with louis farrakhan leader of the national of islam a black 
muslim group fahrakahn once described judaism as a gutter 
religion 
asked what his relationship now is with farrakhan jackson said 
we do not have one it is precisely that

attorneys for john demjanjuk filed court papers 
today to have the retired autoworkers us citizenship restored 
more than a week before a panel of israeli judges is to announce 
its verdict in demjanjuks yearlong war crimes trial 
the papers also claim that the us justice department 
suppressed information from witnesses that would have helped 
demjanjuk substantiate his claim of mistaken identify 
demjanjuk was stripped of his citizenship in 1981 when a us 
district court judge ruled that he lied on his immigration papers 
to cover up his past demjanjuk 68 was extradited to israel more 
than two years ago to stand trial a threejudge panel heard 
evidence about whether he was the death camp guard called ivan the 
terrible who ran the treblinka gas chambers in nazioccupied 
poland in 1942 and 1943 an estimated 850000 jews were murdered at 
treblinka during the period 
demjanjuk who lived in a cleveland suburb claims he is the 
victim of mistaken identity the israeli judges are expected to 
render a verdict april 18 
in the documents demjanjuks attorneys ask that the order 
stripping him of his us citizenship be overturned demjanjuk a 
ukrainian became a us citizen in 1952 
demjanjuk has said he was drafted into the soviet army captured 
by the germans and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the 
war 
ed nishnic demjanjuks soninlaw said his family has 
anonymously received documents belonging to the justice 
departments office of special investigations which prosecuted 
demjanjuks denaturalization trial 
weve acquired documents through unknown sources that really 
lay out plain and clear what osis intentions were from the 
beginning that they did not believe mr demjanjuk was in fact ivan 
the terrible and they went ahead and prosecuted him and suppressed 
the evidence that would help him prove his case nishnic said 
today outside the courthouse 
the osi materials were received in 1986 and 1987 according to 
the court documents the family claims there were many more 
witnesses than represented by the united states and that those 
witnesses likely to know ivan the terribles identify could not 
make an identification of demjanjuk

secretary of state george p shultz 
headed for home friday without a breakthrough on mideast peace 
talks but he vowed to find the time to try again and struggle 
against the odds 
en route shultz made a surprise stop in cyprus to make some 
headway on a new powersharing arrangement in battered lebanon 
a us army helicopter flew lebanese president amin gemayal from 
beirut to meet with shultz a senior us official said gemayal was 
willing to consider syrian demands to dilute the powers of his 
office which traditionally is reserved for a maronite christian 
shultz worked out the terms with syrian president hafez assad in 
damascus on tuesday the syrian leader did not offer to withdraw 
his army from lebanon but the united states is hoping that could 
occur if the country torn by civil war for 12 years is stabilized 
shultz cautioned reporters in an airborne news conference not to 
assume the surge of lebanon diplomacy means some big new 
development in lebanon or on the hostages 
nine americans are being held hostage in lebanon by groups that 
us terrorism experts believe are controlled by iran 
in acknowledging only inches of progress over six days in 
the middle east shultz did not assign blame to israel or jordan 
the key parties who did not accept his proposals and he said he 
was not discouraged 
whether you are discouraged or not has to do with your 
expectations of what might happen he said if you have the 
expectation everything all of a sudden is going to fall into place 
youd be discouraged but i am not that naive to think the 
difficult problems fall away 
in fact shultz said i think weve probably gotten a little 
further than i expected we might so well keep at it and i will 
find time as time goes along to come back and work at it myself 
after several days of praising king hussein of jordan for taking 
a constructive approach to a us plan for negotiations and 
implying israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir had not shultz 
said the israelis are as interested in peace and stability as 
jordan and the palestinians perhaps even more so 
he said both shamir and foreign minister shimon peres had urged 
him to keep at it although shamir still has reservations about 
a middle east peace conference 
shultz had hoped such a meeting could be called in midapril 
but he acknowledged that obviously was now impossible he said he 
had not altered the time line of his proposal however it 
calls for a conference attended by the united states the soviet 
union china britain and france to launch negotiations shortly 
afterward on palestinian selfrule 
the talks would be held between israel and a mixed delegation of 
jordan and palestinians approved by the palestine liberation 
organization 
the selfrule would give palestinians on the israeliheld west 
bank and gaza control over their daily lives but not over security 
or foreign affairs for three years meantime wider negotiations on 
an overall settlement of the arabisraeli dispute would begin seven 
months after the opening of the first stage of the talks 
theres a big need and a very explosive kind of area 
shultz said of his determination to hold negotiations before the 
reagan administration leaves office next january so its worth 
swimming upstream under the circumstances 
earlier at a news conference in amman jordan his last shuttle 
stop shultz dismissed a reporters suggestion his mission was 
doomed to failure 
whos afraid to struggle against odds he said you have 
to be willing to do it what am i saving myself for anyway 
ive a few more months to go here and i want to try to leave 
something constructive for the region and for my successors so i 
am going to put my back into it why not

the acquittal of 13 white supremacists 
on sedition charges means that religious freedom is still alive 
in this country says one of the defendants in the sevenweek 
federal trial 
an allwhite jury thursday acquitted the men of charges 
including conspiring to kill a federal judge and fbi agent and 
plotting to overthrow the federal government and establish an 
allwhite nation in the pacific northwest 
afterward one juror said jury members didnt believe the 
governments witnesses two spokesmen for national human rights 
organizations said the acquittals marked a setback for those 
fighting bigotry and racism 
defendant robert e miles 63 a white supremacist leader from 
cohoctah mich praised the verdicts but when asked how the trial 
had affected the supremacist movement he said who knows what 
movement whats left of it after this 
this proves that the common law is still alive said 
defendant richard g butler of hayden lake idaho this means we 
still enjoy the freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom of 
association and freedom of religion 
the government presented 113 witnesses during the trial which 
began feb 16 prosecutors sought to prove that supremacists robbed 
banks and armored trucks of 41 million to finance their 
activities including about 1 million still missing the jury 
deliberated four days 
the defense which called 79 witnesses contended the conspiracy 
theory was made up by a key government witness james ellison 47 
who led a supremacist group in arkansas and is serving 20 years for 
racketeering 
to discredit ellison the defense disclosed he had two wives 
thought he received messages from god and had himself crowned king 
james of the ozarks 
one juror who asked not to be identified summed up the case by 
saying we just didnt believe the governments witnesses 
asked if the jury put much stock in ellisons testimony the 
juror asked would you the juror said ellison and other 
witnesses who backed him stood to gain with reduced sentences by 
testifying for the government 
defendants said the government was trying to suppress their call 
for white separatism and other aspects of their political and 
religious views 
religious freedom is still alive in this country said miles 
but us attorney j michael fitzhugh denied that the charges 
were politically motivated 
we werent after them because of what they believed or what 
they said he said we were after them because of what they 
did 
fitzhugh said today on cbs this morningi dont think 
that theres anything that we would have done any differently 
either with the charges that we did or the way that we presented 
the case we thought we had a good prosecutable winnable case and 
it just didnt turn out that way 
defendant louis ray beam jr 41 of houston celebrated his 
acquittal by standing in the shadow of a confederate memorial 
opposite the court building and claiming victory against what he 
calls the zionist occupation government 
i think zog has suffered a terrible defeat here today beam 
said i think everyone saw through the charade and saw that i was 
simply being punished for being a vociferous and outspoken opponent 
of zog 
burton levinson national chairman of the antidefamation 
league called the verdicts a real setback in the war against 
organized hate 
although many of the defendants are already serving prison 
terms growing out of their extremist activities the others 
including the most important leaders will now be free to once 
again promote their antidemocratic and bigoted aims levinson 
said in a statement from new york the outcome means that we must 
and will remain vigilant 
the acquittal of the white supremacists was cited by urban 
league national president john jacobs as another example of the 
resurgence of racism in the united states 
every time something like this happens it sets back the whole 
movement for fairness equality and justice jacobs said thursday 
night in grand rapids mich you can be a racist and get away 
with it and that is a very disturbing message 
besides miles butler and beam the other defendants were 
richard joseph scutari 40 of new york already serving 60 
years for racketeering 
bruce carroll pierce 32 of metalline falls wash serving 
100 years for racketeering and 150 years for violating the civil

but if they do not marry within three months he must return to 
the soviet union 
i have confidence but it depends on elizabeth he said 
as they say in russian every week has seven fridays 
he meant said ms condon that im a lot more up and down 
about this than he is 
but ups and downs have been a hallmark of their relationship 
after they met in moscow they kept in touch by mail 
during a 10week visit in the summer of 1970 when ms condon 
was studying at moscow university novikov proposed marriage but 
she refused 
on another 10week moscow visit in 1979 they decided to get 
married that october 
their wedding was canceled when soviet officials said they had 
received an anonymous letter claiming novikov was already married 
that claim was false ms condon said but other bureaucratic 
obstacles prevented the marriage 
novikov lost his job as a chemist in 1982 after announcing he 
wanted to emigrate to the united states and has since supported 
himself with menial jobs 
there were many difficult days and much was lost said 
novikov time itself was lost

shortages of 3cent stamps are being reported 
at some post offices but depleted inventories are being rapidly 
refilled the us postal service reported friday 
the stamps are out there but some offices have a lot more 
than others spokeswoman tanya perkins said 
more than 1 billion 3cent stamps were sent to local post 
offices in preparation for the rate change from 22 cents to 25 
cents last sunday perkins said 
and another 600 million of the 3cent stamps are in warehouses 
being used to replenish stocks where needed she said 
we had asked local offices to predict how many they would 
need and some had a lot more demand than expected weve been 
filling orders all week perkins said 
sales of coils of 100 of the stamps have been especially heavy 
she said rather than people buying just a few stamps to tide them 
over 
on the other hand perkins said plenty of the undenominated 
e stamps remain available some 6 billion estamps which 
represent the new 25cent rate have been shipped to post offices 
apparently perkins said people are choosing to buy 3cent 
stamps in order to use up the 22cent stamps they had on hand 
before buying the new higher rate stamps 
perkins said that the stamp shortages are scattered across the 
country rather than being confined to any particular area 
most offices also have 1cent and 2cent stanps available she 
added and stamps can also be purchased by mail and telephone

white house chief of staff howard 
baker today hinted the united states is preparing to announce new 
economic sanctions against panama to force the ouster of military 
strongman manuel antonio noriega 
administration sources requesting anonymity said the most 
likely prospect was that the administration would invoke an 
emergency law to forbid american companies subsidiaries and 
individuals from paying taxes fees or other payments to panama 
the united states has been trying to get american firms to 
withhold the payments voluntarily 
the law known as the international emergency economic powers 
authority has been used before against other countries including 
iran and libya 
baker briefing reporters at a seaside hotel during reagans 
10day vacation said sanctions already imposed by the united 
states have had a remarkable success as the united states tries 
to convince noriega that he should leave 
what happens next is a matter that the president will address 
and will address promptly perhaps even today on what other steps 
are to be taken baker said

a settlement to end the war in afghanistan and 
clear the way for the removal of soviet troops is completed and 
ready to be signed a un mediator said today 
radio moscow reported that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
confirmed that red army troops will begin leaving afghanistan on 
may 15 
in pakistan the afghan guerrilla alliance said it wont be 
bound by the agreement and vowed to continue the war until 
afghanistans sovietbacked government is overthrown 
we have discussed we have negotiated thats over mediator 
diego cordovez told reporters in geneva i want to inform you 
that the documents are now finalized and open for signature 
he said afghanistan pakistan the united states and the soviet 
union were prepared to sign a fivepoint peace package worked out 
during almost six years of onandoff negotiations between 
afghanistan and pakistan 
pakistan represented moslem guerrillas who have been fighting 
the afghan government since april 30 1978 after a communist coup 
set up a government friendly to the soviet union 
soviet troops entered the war on dec 1979 and an estimated 
115000 are in afghanistan now 
radio moscow reported that gorbachev confirmed the may 15 troop 
withdrawal during a speech to communist party officials in the 
soviet city of tashkent where he met thursday with afghan leader 
najib 
both leaders said thursday that obstacles to an agreement had 
been cleared and that the accord was ready to be signed 
the soviet unions official tass news agency filed an urgent 
report out of geneva this afternoon saying the agreement was 
completed 
cordovez said the agreement was expected to be signed by 
thursday 
it is not a perfect agreement because it was worked out by 
human beings but it reflects the reality of the situation 
cordovez said 
the test of this agreement will come in its implementation 
and therefore i hope that people will give it a chance he told 
reporters cordovez added that he was convinced all parties will 
exercise restraint in taking any actions that might violate the 
agreement 
but a statement from guerrilla alliance headquarters in 
peshawar pakistan said the agreement was made to be violated 
as far as the mujahedeen are concerned they will not be bound 
by the outcome of the geneva agreements and they will continue the 
war as long as the russians and their puppets are present in 
afghanistan the statement said 
when asked what language the united states and soviet union were 
prepared to sign to guarantee the settlement cordovez said all 
that is pending he would not elaborate 
the mutual ussoviet guarantor role had been in doubt because 
of a dispute over us demands for symmetry in the amount of 
superpower aid to the warring sides 
the united states is the guerrillas main weapons supplier the 
soviet union had argued that us aid to insurgents couldnt be 
compared to soviet aid to the government 
an official source at the geneva talks speaking on condition of 
anonymity indicated that a separate deal outside the un pact 
calls for a mutual aid cutoff as soon as the soviet troops start 
withdrawing 
cordovez refused to discuss the issue and said it was not part 
of the peace package but us government sources in washington 
have said the agreement appears to meet us conditions for ending 
aid to the warring parties 
the accord was reached after nearly six weeks of negotiations in 
the latest round of indirect talks between afghanistan and pakistan 
setting the time of signature involves a number of logistical 
questions said cordovez who mediated the talks by shuttling 
back and forth between the delegations pakistan refused to meet in 
person with the afghan delegation because it does not recognize 
afghanistans government 
the soviet union and afghanistan had objected to pakistans 
insistence that arrangements for a transitional government in 
afghanistan be worked out before the signing of an accord 
cordovez said parties to the talks agreed that the settlements 
goals can best be ensured by a broadbased afghan government the 
hope was therefore expressed that all elements of the afghan 
nation living inside and outside afghanistan would respond to 
this historic opportunity 
cordovez said a fifth document has been added to the original 
fourpoint accord a memorandum of understanding on un 
monitoring arrangements for the accord 
the other documents include afghanpakistani agreements on 
principles of mutual relations and the safe and voluntary return of 
afghan refugees a declaration of international guarantees and a 
fourth part tying the others together the texts have not been made 
public 
cordovezs announcement came less than an hour after 
afghanistans envoy to the talks abdul wakil said his country was 
ready to sign the accord 
minutes later pakistani chief envoy zain noorani reiterated 
that his country was ready to sign i would not be signing if i 
was not satisfied he told reporters

of mississippi law school want a faculty committee to reconsider 
its recommendation the school dismiss its 1988 teacher of the 
year cowinner 
students boycotted classes thursday and have signed petitions in 
support of associate professor steve thel 
thel is an outstanding professor said jack williams editor 
of the mississippi law journal on the oxford campus

recommend administrators terminate thels contract although he 
will be allowed to finish the school year 
the matter is pending before dean thomas edmonds who will make 
his recommendation before forwarding the matter to chancellor 
gerald turner 
the faculty committees review of thels teaching research and 
productivity resulted in a vote not to continue his employment at

thel 34 a threeyear university employee declined to comment 
at least 167 students about half the law school student body 
had signed a petition demanding thels contract be renewed said 
williams a thirdyear student from amarillo texas 
the petition claims tenured faculty members are playing politics 
in their recommendation to terminate thels contract 
we do not understand the logic behind ostracizing a professor 
who has expressed a genuine concern for the academic development 
and general welfare of the students the petition said 
mike leonard of oxford a firstyear law student said the 
schools old guard doesnt like thel hes a northerner and 
hes liberal leonard said turner denied that was a factor 
thel and patricia morgan were named teacher of the year in 
student balloting last month 
edmonds the law school dean was out of town and unavailable 
for comment on the student demands 
associate dean larry bush said administrators canceled classes 
for three hours thursday because of a campus awards ceremony so 
its difficult to tell how many didnt come to class 
instructors at the school set their own policies on absenteeism 
he said 
officials said thel is ineligible for tenure a guarantee of 
job protection because he hasnt been at the university the 
required six years

us trade representative clayton yeutter 
threatened retaliation friday after japan blocked a us request 
for creation of an international panel to resolve a dispute over 
beef and citrus imports 
yeutter also urged japanese industrialists to use their 
political clout to block the protectionist measures for which 
japans farmers are lobbying 
i regret the japanese today blocked our request for the 
formation of an independent panel to review japans beef and 
citrus quotas and other restrictive practices yeutter said in a 
statement 
hours earlier yeutter told national public radio if the 
intransigent attitude that prevails in japan at the moment on beef 
and citrus continues we are clearly heading toward retaliation by 
the united states and somebody will pay the price 
it may or may not be the japanese agricultural producers but 
someone will have to pay the price of retaliation he said 
the japanese move came friday in geneva at a session of gatt 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states asked gatt to form a panel of independent 
experts to determine whether the japanese citrus and beef import 
quotas were consistent with international trading laws 
but the japanese ambassador yoshio hatano rejected the panel 
saying the dispute should be resolved in bilateral discussions 
since gatt council decisions are made by consensus the us 
request was effectively rejected 
yeutter said the united states would continue to consult with 
japan but if a solution is not found in the coming weeks it will 
renew its request for an independent panel at the next gatt meeting 
on may 4 
continued resistance to the establishment of a panel at that 
time would undoubtedly lead to further escalation of this 
dispute he said 
yeutter told npr he had information that japanese industry is 
already reacting to the possibility that the united states might 
curb its imports of japanse goods as a retaliatory measure 
i just saw a cable today that indicates that a number of 
japanese industrialists are now beginning to speak up on the issue 
because they are fearful that if it is not resolved 
satisfactorily they will suffer retaliation he said 
they should be pounding the desk of japanese government 
officials saying dont let the agriculture folks have the 
controlling voice in this issue yeutter added 
the usjapanese agreement on citrus and beef imports expired 
last month and no new accord has been reached under the 1984 
agreement japan agreed to admit 141000 tons of american beef in 
1984 rising to 177000 tons this year the agreement called for a 
1100ton a year increase over the 1984 quota on us organge 
imports of 82000 tons 
the quotas are being demanded by the politically powerful 
japanese beef and citrus farmers 
us officials argue that the japanese would benefit greatly by 
imports saying that beefsteak in japan now costs four times the 
us price and citrus costs at least double the american market 
price

the afternoon before he quit the democratic 
presidential campaign illinois sen paul simon drove himself to a 
local shopping mall and bought two sport shirts for a weeklong 
vacation trip to puerto rico 
not an unusual event for a man about to spend some leisure time 
with his family 
but for simon the shopping excursion was the first time in 
three months he appeared in public without a secret service escort 
watching his every move and those by people around him 
the constant protection has a price in personal freedom as well 
as in dollars 
the secret service has protected five 1988 presidential 
candidates not including vice president george bush for the past 
few months at a cost of 15000 a day for each man 
until the number of candidates began to dwindle the federal 
agency only protects two now the cost to the taxpayers was 
75000 a day or 525000 a week 
as expensive as that might sound it pales at what was spent to 
guard pope john paul ii during his 11day visit to the united 
states last year 49 million or some 445455 per day 
secret service director john r simpson and francis a keating 
assistant treasury secretary for enforcement in recent testimony 
and documentation submitted to a senate appropriations 
subcommittee called the popes visit to the united states the 
single most demanding protective event in our history 
the secret service received a supplemental appropriation of 56 
million to cover the costs of the pontiffs visit in addition to 
its regular budget of 367 million for the fiscal year that ends 
sept 30 
keating who has since been nominated to be the justice 
departments no 3 man and simpson said the secret service has 
protected four democrats and one republican presidential candidates 
over the past four or five months vice president bush gets 
coverage by virtue of his office and democrats albert gore jr and 
jesse jackson also receive the protection 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and kansas sen bob dole 
declined protection kitty dukakis the governors wife said 
dukakis believes that it would be just one additional layer from 
the people walt riker doles press secretary said dole has a 
similar belief 
candidate dropouts rep richard gephardt of missouri and gary 
hart of colorado also received secret service escorts so did 
republican pat robertson who has all but abandoned his race 
keating said the secret service never guarded bruce babbitt 
alexander haig and pete du pont because a fivemember advisory 
committee did not recommend them to the treasury secretary who 
makes the final decision 
candidate protection is determined by a panel consisting of a

lyn nofziger president reagans former 
political director was sentenced to 90 days in prison today and 
fined 30000 for illegally lobbying administration officials after 
he left the white house 
us district judge thomas flannery said nofziger could remain 
free pending an appeal of his three felony convictions of 
contacting former colleagues on behalf of private clients within a 
year of leaving president reagans staff 
nofziger could have been sentenced to two years on each of the 
three counts the 30000 was the maximum cumulative fine the judge 
could have assessed 
flannery imposed a complicated sentence of two to eight months 
incarceration for each of the counts but then suspended all but 30 
days of each of the sentences so that nofziger will have to serve 
only 90 days if his appeal is denied 
the judge rejected the defense plea that nofziger be sentenced 
only to a short period of unsupervised probation 
outside the courthouse nofziger told reporters i thought 
things were going to go better than they went 
asked about the prospects of an appeal nofziger said in my 
heart of hearts i dont believe im going to serve time because i 
dont believe a prison sentence is justified even if i were guilty 
and i repeat that i am not guilty 
before he was sentenced nofziger stood before the judge and 
said he wanted to reiterate my belief that despite my conviction 
i have done nothing ethically morally or legally wrong 
i am an honorable man nofziger told the judge 
like other honorable people i have gone through life making 
mistakes doing stupid things i doubt that there is a person in 
this room who hasnt but i am not a criminal and i think the 
record of my life will bear out that statement 
president reagan and his wife nancy issued a statement from 
their vacation home in california that said in full 
lyn nofziger is s dear friend of many years and our prayers are 
with him 
flannery ordered nofziger to pay the 30000 fine within 30 
days like the prison term however the imposition of the fine was 
stayed pending appeal 
the judge also ordered that after his imprisonment nofziger be 
placed on two years probation the judge agreed to a defense 
request that nofziger be sent to a minimumsecurity federal prison 
before he was sentenced nofziger told the judge i know there 
are those in this ourtroom who believe that i should be sent to 
prison unless i come here today and plead guilt express remorse 
and ask forgiveness 
but he added i cannot do that if i am to be true to myself 
and to those hundreds of fine people all over the country who have 
supported me in recent months because they believe i am an 
honorable man 
still nofziger said i do have remorse i am distressed 
beyond measure i trusted in others rather than relying on myself 
i am distressed if i have embarrassed my family and my friends and 
my president 
after the hearing independent counsel james c mckay said 
were very satisfied with what judge flannery has done today 
mckay had declined in court to make an additional statement on 
the sentence he had sought the prosecutor who said in a court 
filing that nofziger had shown a total lack of contrition and 
remorse had urged imprisonment to signal the seriousness of 
nofzigers offense 
nofziger asked by reporters how he felt about the sentence 
called the question stupid and added 
how do you think i feel what do you want me to do say i feel 
great 
nofziger charged that mckay set out to get me he set out 
because i would not knuckle under because i would not cop a plea 
and because i would not say that i was remorseful and i think he 
succeeded 
nofziger said he thought mckay makes mountains out of 
molehills he has exaggerated he has misstated and i think he has 
lied 
i dont think he is an honorable man he said 
when the sentenced was pronounced nofziger shook hands with 
several people in the courtroom then kissed his wife and other 
family members one man said he was sorry nofziger shrugged 
for the defense lawyer robert plotkin told reporters were 
disappointed but i think the judge did a good job of trying to 
balance the symbol mr nofziger has become for the ethics law 
against the man mr nofziger is 
nofziger 63 was sentenced for illegally lobbying former reagan 
administration colleagues on behalf of wedtech corp the 
scandalwracked defense contractor and a marine engineers union 
he had been found guilty feb 11 of violating the ethics in 
government act which restricts lobbying by former government 
officials nofziger likened his offense to running a stop sign 
a number of current and former government officials including 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin energy secretary john herrington 
and secret service director john r simpson had signed letters 
vouching for nofzigers integrity and character 
herrington urged the judge to show compassion and 
understanding and rep jack kemp rny asked flannery to 
balance the requirements of justice with the quality of mercy 
nofziger was convicted of urging thenpresidential counselor 
edwin meese iii to intercede to help wedtech get a 32 million 
nobid army contract to build small engines wedtech got the 
contract 
nofziger was also convicted of illegally contacting meeses 
deputy james e jenkins for the marine engineers beneficial 
association which was seeking to expand civilian manning of navy 
support ships 
the third conviction dealt with a contact nofziger had with two 
national security council aides for fairchild republic corp which 
made the a10 antitank plane 
in his sentencing memo mckay also urged a large fine arguing 
that nofziger had unjustly enriched himself through violations of 
the law mckay noted that nofziger and his business partner mark 
a bragg received stock in wedtech corp as a result of the 
successful effort to lobby meese now attorney general 
nofziger and bragg sold their stock for more than 600000 
according to congressional testimony mckay said nofzigers net 
worth is more than 28 million

pope john paul ii on friday condemned 
doctrinal and liturgical abuses in the roman catholic church and 
said he still hopes for a settlement with rebel french archbishop 
marcel lefebvre 
the need to distinguish from what authentically builds up the 
church from what destroys her is becoming in the present period a 
particular demand of our service to the whole community of 
believers the pope wrote cardinal joseph ratzinger the 
vaticans powerful guardian of church orthodoxy 
ratzingers congregation for the doctrine of the faith has 
worked toward reaching a settlement with lefebvre who heads the 
traditionalist pius x fraternity based in switzerland 
lefebvre was suspended from his priestly functions by pope paul 
vi in 1976 meaning he is not allowed by the vatican to say mass or 
give the sacraments 
he continues to celebrate the forbidden 16th century latin 
tridentine mass and claims to have millions of followers worldwide 
in october the pope charged cardinal edouard gagnon with the 
task of trying to resolve the lefebvre case 
lefebvre has ordained illegally more than 200 priests in the 
past 15 years in february he was quoted in an interview with the 
french newspaper le figaro as saying he planned to consecrate three 
bishops this june a move that would lead to his automatic 
excommunication 
your eminence knows very well how many efforts have been made 
by the apostolic see since the beginning of the existence of the 
fraternity in order to ensure ecclesial unity in relation to its 
activity the pope wrote ratzinger in a letter released by the 
vatican 
i would assure your eminence once more of my desire that these 
efforts should continue we do not cease to hope that they will 
bear fruit the pope wrote 
also referring to lefebvre the pope wrote all the bishops of 
the catholic church are bound to collaborate with the apostolic 
see for the welfare of the whole mystical body which is also the 
body of the churches 
in his letter the pope said the church was striving to ensure 
that the doctrine of the 196265 second vatican council was being 
followed 
however side by side with this effort there have appeared 
tendencies which create a certain difficulty in putting the council 
into practice the letter said one of these tendencies is 
characterized by a desire for changes which are not always in 
harmony with the teaching and spirit of vatican council ii 
these changes claim to express progress the letter 
continued and so this tendency is given the name 
progressivism in this case progress consists in an aspiration 
towards the future which breaks with the past without taking into 
account the function of tradition which is fundamental to the 
churchs mission 
the pope also denounced what he described as the opposite 
tendency of conservatism or integrism this tendency 
stops at the past itself without taking into account the correct 
aspiration towards the future he wrote

president reagan and his wife 
nancy had an adjusted gross income of 345359 in 1987 with a 
federal tax liability of 86638 according to tax returns released 
today 
that income was 8990 above what the reagans reported for 1986 
while their tax bill rose 5822 taxes as a percentage of the 
reagans gross income rose from 251 percent to 275 percent 
the couple had 67392 withheld for federal income taxes last 
year and paid an additional 30000 in quarterly payments for a 
total of 97392 
that means they paid 10754 above what they owed the 
government rather than getting a refund the couple elected to 
apply that amount to their 1988 taxes 
included in the gross income was the presidents 200000 
salary 54179 in interest income 46208 in capital gains and 
29711 in income from his pension for serving as governor of 
california from 196775 
the income also included 1526 in appearance fees paid to the 
president and mrs reagan this included 1312 paid to reagan for 
his appearance on nbctvs tonight show and 214 paid to mrs 
reagan in residual talent fees for reruns of two programs in which 
she had appeared in 1986 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 1312 fee paid 
to the president was required to be paid under union 
agreements in the television industry and said that the 1312 
was donated along with other money to his alma matter eureka 
college in illionois 
charitable deductions totaled 25407 
after deductions the reagans total taxable income was 263767 
the tax returns were released a day after white house chief of 
staff howard baker said that reagan and his wife had made sure 
all of the is were dotted and the ts were crossed before 
leasing a 25 million los angeles home purchased by friends 
but questions about the arrangements the reagans made with the 
consortium that purchased the home persist these involve the 
secrecy surrounding the identities of the 18 to 20 reagan friends 
who purchased the home and the question of why the reagans decided 
to lease rather than buy the house 
the reagans consider the homeleasing arrangement a private 
matter presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater has said and on 
thursday baker said the pair may not like all the press 
scrutiny surrounding the deal 
in washington donald campbell the deputy director of the 
office of government ethics confirmed that lawyers representing 
the consortium approached the agency in july 1986 and we did 
make an analysis of the proposition at the time 
campbell said the office produced an informal opinion on the 
ethical ramifications of the deal 
the white house which has made only a limited disclosure of the 
terms of the threeyear lease the reagans signed effective march 1 
said that before buying the threebedroom sixbath house the 
prospective owners most of them friends of the reagans sought an 
opinion on the propriety of the deal 
it said the opinion concluded that the reagans would comply with 
standards of conduct regulations and conflict of interest statutes 
if they paid a fairmarket rental or purchase price 
it said the lease terms were negotiated by representatives of 
the owners and the reagans based on fairmarket value rental 
estimates from two independent appraisers 
the home on a 1acre property in the poshest section of bel 
air is near the kirkeby estate where the television series 
beverly hillbillies was filmed it has a heated swimming pool 
and a threecar garage 
real estate sources estimate the monthly rent at 12000 to 
15000 based on fairmarket value 
the reagans are known to feel strongly about their privacy and 
the first lady during the early years of the administration made it 
clear she wanted information about the presidents health handled 
carefully by the white house press office and the first couple has 
chafed over past reporting of difficulties involving reagan 
children and relatives 
on thursday baker was asked if the president and his wife were 
upset by the spate of media reports on the homeleasing deal 
oh i dont think so said baker standing outside a seaside 
resort hotel cottage not far from reagans mountaintop ranch i 
think after eight years theyve come to understand that that 
occurs and while they understand it they may not like it but 
they are not angry about it 
the white house the president and the first lady went to 
great lengths to make sure that this was an armslength 
transaction that there was a full appraisal of the rental property 
and that all of the is were dotted and the ts were crossed he 
said 
baker said that reagan and his wife have handled the leasing of 
the home in precisely the right way and really beyond legitimate 
criticism 
the property was purchased in august 1986 by the consortium 
which has incorporated itself as wall management services inc 
realtor jeff hyland of the los angeles firm of alvarez hyland amp 
young said that with rising prices since the purchase the land 
alone is worth 3 million 
they got a great buy he said they bought it for land 
value as far as i am concerned they got the house for free 
realtor john aaroe of the jon douglas co said the house built 
in 1954 still has the original kitchen and needs a great deal of 
renovation

plastic bottles soon will carry a singledigit 
number inside a triangle on the bottom to help guide recyclers and 
promote the practice a plastics industry group said friday 
the numbers a halfinch high or larger will designate the kind 
of plastic used according to council on plastics and packaging in 
the environment 
there is a perception that plastics are not recyclable but 
it is untrue said dennis sabourin of wellman industries a major 
buyer of used polyethylene terephthalate or pet soft drink 
bottles 
sabourin said his company buys 100 million pounds of used 
bottles a year about twothirds of the 20 percent of all pet 
bottles that are recycled it could use twice as many bottles and 
in a few years could need three times the current amount he said 
the industry feels its better to selfregulate than to be 
regulated said gifford stack recycling manager for the national 
soft drink association 
the council called a news conference to present its view that 
trash disposal should make room for recycling incineration 
landfilling and composting plastics it said are 72 percent of 
the national garbage stream of 133 million tons a year 
the council knows of at least 256 bills in 35 state 
legislatures probably more than on any other issue around 
dealing with garbage said jeff lane of procter amp gamble co 
there have been several bills that would simply outlaw certain 
plastic containers although none has passed above the local level 
lane said several other bills would require some form of recycling 
code 
the voluntary identification system devised by the society of 
the plastics industry calls for number codes on all plastic bottles 
of 16 ounces or larger and other containers of 8 ounces or more 
almost all recycling markets are designed to handle one kind of 
plastic at a time though various efforts are under way to develop 
techniques to separate mixed plastics 
the triangle surrounding the number will have an arrowhead 
incorporated in each side the arrows pointing clockwise 
underneath will be letter abbreviations or acronyms representing 
the plastic 
codes should start appearing within six months and appear on all 
containers within three years lane said 
currently soft drink bottles are almost made of pet and milk 
bottles are highdensity polyethylene and recyclers can recognize 
these easily these materials and other plastics are used in other 
containers that could be recycled if they could be quickly 
identified also the council said 
here are number and abbreviation codes 
1 polyethylene terephthalate pet 
2 highdensity polyethylene hdpe 
3 vinyl v 
4 lowdensity polyethylene ldpe 
5 polypropylene pp 
6 polystyrene ps 
7 other plastics including bottles of more than one kind

mikhail s gorbachev said friday that soviet 
troops will begin coming home from afghanistan on may 15 but he 
added the move shouldnt be seen as a present to president 
reagan for their upcoming summit meeting 
soviets interviewed on the streets of moscow welcomed the news 
saying many people have suffered 
radio moscow carried a brief report on gorbachevs speech to 
party activists in tashkent following the announcement in geneva 
that negotiators had agreed on a plan for settling the 10yearold 
war in afghanistan 
gorbachev and afghan leader najib met in tashkent in central 
asia on thursday and declared in a joint communique that all 
obstacles to a war settlement and withdrawal of the soviet forces 
had been removed 
the official tass news agency did not immediately report the 
57yearold soviet leaders speech and the nightly tv news program 
vremya said only that gorbachev had met with uzbek party 
leaders before returning to moscow but radio moscow led its 
evening newscasts with a few details of the address 
it said gorbachev confirmed soviet soldiers would begin pulling 
out of the conflict they entered more than eight years ago and 
that documents outlining terms of the peace accord were ready for 
signing on thursday 
at the same time the soviet leader said the withdrawal of the 
troops should not be regarded as a sort of present to president 
reagan on the eve of his visit to the ussr the official 
broadcast said we he said are carrying out the plans outlined 
in our statement in february 
it was in a feb 8 speech by gorbachev that the may 15 date was 
first proposed but at the time it was made contingent on a geneva 
agreement being signed by march 15 that speech also offered to 
frontload the withdrawal or have at least half of the 
estimated 115000 soviet soldiers leave within the first three 
months and to complete the withdrawal within 10 months 
soviet officials have observed privately however that they 
would like to have all of their troops home by the end of the year 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan on dec 27 1979 
a senior us diplomat said friday that backchannel ussoviet 
diplomacy was involved in clearing the final obstacle to a geneva 
agreement the question of continued aid to the warring sides 
us observers at the geneva talks had been pressing for 
symmetry in foreign aid to the combatants arguing that if us 
assistance to the rebels was prohibited the kremlin should 
likewise cut off military aid to najibs government 
the soviets know very well and in great detail our position 
and have indicated that it is acceptable to them said the 
diplomat who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified 
he said the reagan administration prefers a moratorium on arms 
shipments to continued deliveries to both sides but that no 
agreement had been worked out yet 
the senior envoy also suggested that the soviets steadfast 
efforts to stick to the may 15 start date for withdrawal was likely 
connected with a general attempt to clear away superpower 
disagreements in advance of the may 29june 2 summit meeting in 
moscow 
i think they are cognizant of the value in having their troops 
begin to leave afghanistan before the president comes he said 
it would probably create a better atmosphere at the summit if 
they have started 
news of the agreement in geneva which is to be signed thursday 
traveled slowly to soviet citizens who get most of their news on 
international affairs from vremya evening newspapers went to 
press before un mediator diego cordovez announced in geneva that 
a package of documents outlining the settlement was ready for 
signing 
soviets told about the breakthrough in geneva said they were 
delighted with the news 
its time to get out already said sergei butyugin of moscow 
at a news stand near taganka square many people have suffered 
butyugin 32 said the decision to enter the war was correct 
because their afghan allies asked for help but that now it has 
dragged on and on 
a 27yearold woman who did not want to give her name said she 
welcomed the news that a settlement had been reached and said the 
war had hurt the soviet people 
alls well that ends well declared larisa ivanova 41 
the main thing is that there will be peace 
she said the war had taken a heavy toll on soviets although she 
said she didnt know how many of her countrymen had been killed in 
afghanistan casualty figures have never been reported by the 
soviets 
six soldiers approached by an associated press reporter outside 
the dzerzhinsky military academy along the moscow river refused to 
discuss the war or its influence on the soviet union 
i dont have a personal opinion we only have a government 
opinion one said

the far right exulted friday in a 
victory in a seditious conspiracy trial but others said the very 
freedoms of the country they attacked allowed the white 
supremacists to exist 
the jurys verdict speaks for a growing patriotic sentiment to 
just say no to black power in america said richard barrett 
42 of jackson miss a lawyer for the forsyth county defense 
league in georgia 
the jurys verdict announces that promajority americans are 
not a cult but are a rising voice of the silent majority he 
added 
barrett briefly attended the federal court trial which began 
feb 16 and ended thursday with an allwhite jurys acquittal on 
all charges of the 13 white defendants nine of them were accused 
of plotting to overthrow the government by violence and set up an 
allwhite nation in the pacific northwest 
what i find interesting is that the system they hate so much 
has set them free said norman gissel a lawyer from coeur 
dalene idaho he is chairman of the kootenai county task force on 
human relations which was formed to resist movements advocating 
racial violence after the aryan nations was based at nearby hayden 
lake 
eva sears spokeswoman for the center for democratic renewal in 
atlanta said the verdict makes it clear that its not possible 
to rely on legal solutions what is needed she said is more 
community involvement to counteract the whitepower movement with 
all nonviolent appropriate responses 
it is ironic that the the freedoms of american citizenship 
the right to speak out the right to trial by jury protected 
those who spoke against the government ms sears said 
the voices of the far right are going to view that acquittal 
as a green light she said they are going to step up their 
activity so it is very very important that those of us who love 
democracy become more vigilant 
prosecutors sought to prove the supremacists robbed banks and 
armored trucks of 41 million to finance their activities 
including about 1 million still missing the jury deliberated four 
days 
the defense contended the conspiracy theory was made up by a key 
government witness james ellison 47 who led a supremacist group 
in arkansas and is serving 20 years for racketeering 
to discredit ellison the defense disclosed he had two wives 
thought he received messages from god and had himself crowned king 
james of the ozarks 
in grand rapids mich urban league national president john 
jacobs said the verdict was another example of the resurgence of 
racism in the united states 
we are seeing a climate that is permissive of racist 
behavior he said people have become comfortable in engaging 
in this climate every time something like this happens it sets 
back the whole movement for fairness equality and justice you can 
be a racist and get away with it and that is a very disturbing 
message 
on the cbs this morning program friday the us attorney 
who prosecuted the case j michael fitzhugh said we thought we 
had a good prosecutable case but the jury chose otherwise and 
thats the great thing about this country is our jury system 
peter lake a television producer who was the governments first 
witness said on the same program that earlier convictions of some 
of the defendants may have caused the jury to think they were being 
prosecuted a second time for the same things 
lake who testified about what he saw and heard when he went 
undercover into the aryan nations compound at hayden lake idaho 
was optimistic about the acquittal 
i think that the radical right will be forever changed by this 
decision here he said they have a dilemma they were 
protesting about the federal government and now theyve been 
treated fairly by the federal government thats going to have a 
telling effect 
he said some older leaders told me that they were going to get 
out of the business in essence theyre going to go home and write 
books pass their churches on to someone else

foreign relief workers on friday 
began complying with a government order to return from the 
droughtstricken north where civil war has stymied efforts to feed 
millions of people threatened with starvation 
about 24 expatriates returned to addis ababa the capital 
aboard a unchartered hercules c130 transport plane two of the 
aircraft had been used to carry food into the most severely 
droughtaffected regions of tigre and eritrea 
the returning workers included employees of the genevabased 
international committee for the red cross the belguim group 
medicin sans frontieres doctor without borders and action 
internationale contra la faim they had been operating out of the 
eritrean town of asmara and are among about 60 expatriates sent to 
the north where crop failure threatens more than 3 million people 
with starvation 
it was unclear when the rest of the foreign relief personnel in 
other northern towns would be pulled out 
the government relief and rehabilitation commission on wednesday 
ordered all relief agencies to bring its foreign workers from the 
north to avoid personnel security risks from rebels operating 
in the area the commission said it would assume responsibility for 
the massive relief operation which already had been crippled by 
the civil wars in eritrea and tigre 
the order came a week after president mengistu haile mariam 
admitted for the first time that his government was in a grim 
struggle with northern rebels he called for a national 
mobilization of troops 
since then government vehicles used in the relief operation and 
planes flying domestic and international routes for stateowned 
ethiopian airlines have been requisitioned to move troops and 
equipment relief officials said 
eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years against the 
central government it is africas longest civil war in 
neighboring tigre rebels have been fighting for 14 years 
none of the foreign relief workers in the north wanted to leave 
or expressed any fears for their safety said agency officials the 
officials said the doubted the commission could handle the food 
distribution operation alone 
were facing a very catastrophic situation right now said 
one senior relief official it will take months to resolve the 
war in the meantime youve got three million souls up there and

an awardwinning play about a students suicide 
has been deleted from a san jacinto college literary magazine 
because the school chancellor believes the plays language is too 
offensive 
its an excellent play good work but i had a real problem 
with the harsh language im the publisher and its sold to 
students and the community we serve chancellor tom sewell said 
as a result robert earl milstids play just a phase about a 
17yearold student whose social and domestic woes drive him to a 
beersoaked suicide has been dumped from next weeks issue of the 
prism 
im not a member of the moral majority or anything but its 
not appropriate for the public we send it to sewell said 
the oneact play drew big crowds last year during three 
performances received good reviews in the campus newspaper and in 
december earned the author an excellence in play writing honor for 
originality at the american college theater festival in denton 
sewell said he would have considered barring the campus 
production had he known about its content beforehand 
milstid 24 said he used cursing in his play for realism not 
for shock 
its sad that one person in a high position has a right to 
dictate his opinions to college students about what we can and 
cant read milstid said but i understand where hes coming 
from im used to dealing with overly conservative viewpoints

communist party leader milos jakes 
on friday launched a stern attack on the western media accusing 
them of creating unrest in czechoslovakia 
addressing a twoday meeting of the partys central committee 
jakes also announced plans to speed up some of the modest economic 
reforms the conservative prague leadership has adopted to try to 
stimulate the economy 
he also said there would be a limit of two fiveyear terms for 
the party leader and three successive terms for regional party 
officials 
in addition jakes said party officials should not accumulate 
too many functions and should be elected by secret ballot 
he stressed however that the communist party must retain its 
powerful role as the leading force of czechoslovak society saying 
that the party must strengthen its influence on what is happening 
in society 
in no case can party work be narrowed to mere educational 
activity he stressed 
in his 57page speech published by the state news agency ctk 
jakes accused unidentified hostile propaganda abroad of 
preparing a slanderous campaign connected to the 20th 
anniversary of the failed prague spring reforms of former communist 
party leader alexander dubcek 
he also accused unidentified western media of fomenting unrest 
particularly among religious believers who have recently staged 
two unusual demonstrations calling for religious freedom 
almost 500000 roman catholics have signed an unprecedented 
petition for more freedom to practice religion 
recently we have been witnessing how anticommunist forces 
try with the assistance of some western media directly to 
organize the creation of opposition groups incite them toward 
actions which are to create unrest and tension in our society and 
even hide this behind religious motivation jakes said 
we have to reject these efforts resolutely he added in 
our state all believers can enjoy religious freedoms and take 
part in religious life and rites 
do not let us overrate or underrate the endeavors of the 
enemies jakes went on we have considered this in the 
politburo we shall not permit anybody to parasite on the 
process of restructuring and democratization 
the laws of the state are valid for all and those who violate 
them must count on legal consequences 
jakes words signaled that opposition groups will not be 
included in any immediate dialogue with the communist authorities 
as has been hinted at in poland hungary and the soviet union 
turning to the economy jakes noted that performance had 
improved in the first quarter of this year but that almost one in 
five staterun enterprises is performing below target 
he said a new law on enterprises which decentralizes their 
management will come into force july 1 this year and not next 
january as originally announced and also spoke vaguely of plans to 
trim the central bureaucracy 
later this month according to informed sources parliament will 
approve the merger of four technical ministries into a super 
ministry of engineering headed by 51yearold technocrat 
ladislav gerle 
social welfare and health ministries transport and 
communications ministries and the ministries running agriculture 
water and forestry are also likely to be merged 
it is estimated that 30000 to 50000 bureaucrats will lose 
their jobs

americans took out 53 billion more in 
installment debt than they paid off in february for the third 
consecutive strong monthly gain the government said friday in a 
report that provided further evidence that consumers have not 
stopped spending 
the federal reserve said consumer debt increased at an annual 
rate of 103 percent in february down slightly from the 122 
percent rate of growth in january in that month installment debt 
had risen by 624 billion following a december increase of 43 
billion 
analysts credited the big increases to strong auto sales 
domestic automakers reported earlier this week that they had their 
best januarymarch sales period since 1985 gains that were helped 
by incentive programs 
this strong consumer demand has eased fears that the october 
collapse of the stock market would frighten americans into slowing 
spending so much that the country could be faced with a recession 
this year 
we are seeing a stronger first quarter than we had initially 
expected one of the favorable developments is the final round of 
tax cuts consumers are getting because of the 1986 tax law said 
sandra shaber an economist with the wasingtonbased futures group 
consumer spending is crucial to the countrys economic health 
because it accounts for twothirds of all economic activity 
consumer spending grew 19 percent last year after adjusting for 
inflation and ms shaber said she is looking for similar moderate 
growth this year 
she said this forecast could be jeopardized if interest rates 
start rising significantly boosting the costs of credit purchases 
rates have been rising in recent weeks as the federal reserve 
has apparently tightened up slightly on credit to keep the economy 
from overheating the federal home loan mortgage corp said 
fixedrate mortgages rose in the current week to 1019 percent from 
1005 percent last week 
in february the credit report said auto loans rose by 331 
billion a 147 percent annual rate of increase after rising by 
27 billion in january 
the category that includes credit card debt rose by 149 
billion in febuary down from a january increase of 276 billion 
the debt category that includes loans from banks and credit 
unions not secured by real estate edged up 564 million in february 
after a small gain of 807 million in january 
the various changes left total consumer debt at 6192 billion 
at the end of february an increase of 89 percent from a year 
earlier

residents of leningrad helped dry books in 
their homes after a fire at the leningrad library founded by peter 
the great according to an expert helping the soviets cope with the 
disaster 
this was the biggest disaster in modern history to a 
library sally buchanan said friday this material was valuable 
to not only soviet scholars but scholars from all over the world 
the feb 14 fire damaged or destroyed an estimated 4 million 
books at the ussr national academy of sciences founded in 
1714 said ms buchanan one of three us experts who helped the 
soviets begin restoration 
many books suffered water damage and the library called on 
residents for help handing out wet books with instructions for 
drying them ms buchanan said not one was stolen she said 
many of these books were rare books and they all came back 
beautifully dried she said they ended up drying something 
like half a million books 
the soviet unions state cultural fund chairman dmitri 
likhachev has accused communist party officials of trying to 
conceal the extent of the damage and of using bulldozers to clear 
away piles of damaged books 
library officials in leningrad have said those charges are 
false and ms buchanan said she saw no indication that the 
library had tried to cover up the fire the library was very candid 
about what the losses were 
ms buchanan assistant director of preservation at the 
university of pittsburghs hillman library said flames destroyed 
an estimated 400000 books and damaged 36 million more including 
17thcentury scientific collections ms buchanan said 
soviet librarians are still assessing the damage and exact 
losses wont be known for at least another month ms buchanan 
said but some of the burned books particularly those concerning 
science history were probably the only ones in existence 
the library in a 1920s building contained more than 12 million 
books manuscripts and periodicals 
the only way this library is going to recover from this is 
with help from the international library community to replace the 
materials that have been lost she said 
ms buchanan has led restoration efforts in several library 
disasters including a fire at a los angeles library two years ago 
she and the other two us experts have been invited to return to 
leningrad within the next year

a pheasant egg hunt for chinese children is being 
planned by biologists from michigans department of natural 
resources 
they hope to retrieve eggs from chinas szechwan province to 
bolster and perhaps supplant the states ringneck pheasant 
population which has declined drastically the past two decades 
biologists think the szechwan pheasants are better adapted to 
survival on the brushy rural terrain of southern michigan 
the children are looking for them anyway because they eat 
them or feed them to their dogs or sometimes just smash the eggs 
and nests because they dont like pheasants because they eat their 
crops said dnr biologist peter squibb head of the program to 
rebuild the pheasant flock 
the children will be paid about 25 cents for each egg dnr 
officials hope to return with 2000 eggs half of which are 
expected to hatch successfully and lead to a population of 2 
million to 3 million birds in the 1990s

at the urging of a kidnap victim a 
judge has sentenced the two men who pleaded guilty to the abduction 
to prisons where they can get help with their crack cocaine 
addictions 
annie v brown 53 was kidnapped march 3 by two men who bound 
her with electrical cord and gagged her with a sock then forced 
her into the trunk of her car while they drove around for three 
hours 
after she was let out she grabbed a gun that had been concealed 
in the car and held one of them until police arrived 
the thing that amazed me about her was that she still had 
compassion for these people youd think that somebody tied up in 
the trunk for three hours would have wanted them sentenced to as 
long as she could assistant state attorney refik eler said 
she seemed to feel it was more important that they be helped a 
lot of victims that i see will just say fry em 
he noted that her compassion is even more remarkable since her 
daughter was murdered in 1980 leaving her to raise her 
grandchildren 
i feel compassion for them because theyre young men mrs 
brown said thursday after sentencing 
samuel alexander 21 and donald g alexander 24 not related 
admitted thursday that they kidnapped mrs brown 
mrs brown asked circuit judge hudson r olliff to give them a 
second chance and urged that they be sent to a prison where they 
could rehabilitate themselves 
each could have received up to nine years but olliff imposed 
lessthanmaximum terms 
in addition to the kidnapping samuel alexander also pleaded 
guilty to a charge of grand theft for stealing mrs browns car he 
was given six years in prison donald alexander pleaded guilty to 
an additional charge of armed robbery and was sentenced to 5 years 
olliff said he will ask that samuel alexander be placed in a 
youthful offender facility where he can learn a trade officials 
will be asked to place donald alexander a former university of 
florida student and army veteran in a prison where he can get drug 
counseling 
the two men visited mrs brown on march 3 and donald alexander 
a friend of two of mrs browns children asked her to write a 
letter of reference for him to get a job 
when she turned to go into her house she was grabbed by donald 
alexander who demanded all her money at the same time samuel 
alexander tied her hands 
at this time i was sure they were going to kill me said 
mrs brown who told the men where she had 20 hidden they got the 
money then took her out to her car and put her in the trunk 
the men finally stopped and donald alexander opened the trunk 
and said he would free her if she would write him a check 
i said you have to give me the keys so i can get a pen out of 
the glove compartment mrs brown said while she opened the 
glove compartment she grabbed a 22caliber pistol she kept hidden 
under the front seat 
she held donald alexander at gunpoint until police arrived

the presidential campaign opened friday a race 
with few new faces and fewer new ideas that has evolved into a 
battle of personalities among the three major candidates 
president francois mitterrand a socialist seeking a second 
sevenyear term continues to hold a wide lead in public opinion 
polls over conservative premier jacques chirac 55 and former 
centerright premier raymond barre 63 
the other six candidates in the race stand little chance of 
accomplishing more than using the election to expound their ideas 
ranging from radical left to extreme right 
mitterrand 71 will have no trouble winning the most votes in 
the april 24 first round though he is likely to fall considerably 
short of an absolute majority the real contest is between chirac 
and barre for the no 2 spot and the right to face the incumbent in 
the may 8 runoff 
chirac is the favorite in the battle for second place and has 
been increasing his lead over barre 
the polls show mitterrand defeating either chirac or barre by as 
much as 55 percent the conservatives are pinning their hopes on 
the large number of people who are undecided 
in contrast to the 1981 presidential election which featured a 
clear ideological choice between socialism and freemarket 
liberalism the traditional cleavage has disappeared 
mitterrand who founded the modern socialist party and led it 
for a decade did not once mention the words socialist or socialism 
in his 25page letter to the french this week setting out his 
platform 
chirac the standardbearer of the gaullist tradition also has 
rounded off his corners in a tv interview thursday night he 
said he wanted to enlarge the composition of his cabinet beyond his 
own political camp and admitted agreement with mitterrand on some 
subjects such as defense and foreign policy 
the platforms of the three major candidates all focus on the 
same themes differences being largely a matter of nuance 
all three say they are for the development of a unified europe 
and that france must be prepared for 1992 when the last trade 
barriers come down in the european economic community all stress 
reforms in education as a key to reducing frances 104 percent 
unemployment and all recognize the need to spur technological 
research to improve economic competitivity 
both socialists and conservatives admit there is no quick 
solution to unemployment the overriding issue of 1981 the 
programs of all three focus more on general orientations and less 
on specific measures 
the differences between chirac and barre are even narrower a 
difficult subject for the uninitiated 
the presidential campaign effectively began in march 1986 when 
chiracs conservatives ousted the socialists from control of the 
national assembly that created what the french call 
cohabitation between a leftist president and a rightist 
government a unique situation in the history of the fifth 
republic 
the official campaign that began friday means the final list of 
nine candidates has been published it also means that from now 
until the elections radio and television time is strictly 
rationed with each candidate receiving the same amount of time 
also law prohibits the publication of any opinion polls in the 
week immediately preceding the election 
lacking clearcut ideological differences and innovative ideas 
the race has evolved into a beauty contest among the major 
candidates 
on one side is mitterrand once the most unpopular president of 
the fifth republic with poll ratings now soaring to be seen as the 
sage lovable uncle 
on the other is chirac the harddriving bulldozer workaholic 
avid campaigner and fleshpresser in his second tour as premier he 
contrasts with barre the heavyset economics professor of 
intellectual brilliance but distant somewhat cold personality 
chirac accused mitterrand of having a vague program and said he 
was asking the french to elect him now and see what he does later 
one doesnt win a battle by idly dreaming at the fireside one 
doesnt engage the future in warming his slippers chirac said 
barre says mitterrands program has three characteristics 
obvious immobilism masked socialism and constant imprecision 
and his goal is to remain in place and from that moment 
everything will be fine in the best of frances 
mitterrand says the right lacks heart and accuses it of 
unconcern for social justice 
rounding out the field of candidates are jeanmarie le pen 59 
leader of the extreme right national front andre lajoinie 58 the 
official communist party candidate pierre juquin 58 head of a 
splinter communist group antoine waechter 39 ecologist arlette 
laguiller 48 a trotskyist and pierre boussel 67 another 
extreme left trotskyist

iranians chanting war war until 
victory defied threats of iraqi missile attacks friday and voted 
for a new parliament after being urged to go to the polls by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
irans staterun television showed khomeini 87 and reported in 
poor health voting in the morning chill at an openair polling 
station near his home in the northern tehran suburb of jamaran 
khomeini was one of the first to cast ballots when the countrys 
30000 polling stations opened for 12 hours later the government 
extended polling hours until 10 pm because many people were still 
voting 
prime minister hussein musavi surrounded by iranians chanting 
were not tired of the war voted early 
the official media said the turnout among irans 2025 million 
voters was massive but it gave no figures khomeini had called 
on his followers to turn out in force to defy the iraqis 
the results may take up to 10 days to be announced 
polling stations in tehran were crowded although as many as 
half the capitals 6 million people have fled the city to escape 
iraqi missile attacks 
tehran radio reported that one missile crashed into the capital 
before dawn and that the cities of isfahan qom and tabriz were 
also hit no details were given 
iranian leaders had feared the iraqis would launch a massive 
bombardment to disupt the election 
musavi told irans official islamic republic news agency that 
the turnout was wonderful a sign of the peoples fierce 
resistance 
it was the third parliamentary election since khomeinis 1979 
islamic revolution toppled the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi the 
last was in 1984 the new parliament will be vital in determining 
the future of the revolution and in choosing a new leader when 
khomeni dies 
at stake were all 270 seats in irans majlis or parliament 
there were more than 1400 candidates including women for the 
first time parliament members are elected to fouryear terms 
one voter said he came to tehran from amol about 120 miles to 
the north to show that he was not scared 
i decided to vote here after they said tehran would be the 
target for many missiles he said he declined to give his name 
anyone over 16 years old was entitled to vote provided they 
produced photo identity cards 
analysts predicted the new parliament would be dominated by 
radicals who would give the government a broader mandate for 
reforms that have been blocked by the conservatives 
the radicals favor a planned socialiststyle economy with price 
controls and stringent enforcement of tax laws 
conservativeleaning clerics made up only 20 percent of the 
candidates 
people filled out their ballots openly voters did not seem to 
care if others saw whom they voted for 
one man had his form filled out by a neighbor 
the 7yearold iraniraq war the countrys most pressing 
problem has not figured in the campaigning khomeini irans 
undisputed patriarch has decreed that the war will not end until 
his adversary iraqs president saddam hussein has been toppled 
the campaign dealt mainly with economic issues 
in his preelection message khomeini underscored his recent 
tilt to the left by urging voters not to back candidates who 
advocated a brand of islam supported by the capitalists but those 
pledged to help the downtrodden 
house speaker hashemi rafsanjani one of khomeinis closest 
aides and considered a pragmatist on most issues was expected to 
be reelected along with most of the leading figures in the hierachy 
but the hardliners such musavi were expected to make some 
gains a development that could have farreaching effects on the 
shape of the revolution in the postkhomeini era

the battle to save big ike has failed but 
the memory of the 150yearold pecan tree is going to be preserved 
in furniture and mementos and by a party 
the tree said to be the fifth or sixthlargest of its kind in 
the world isnt likely to survive a move from the path of a 
highway expansion so its going to be cut down 
dewayne davis of richmond va who has been working to save 
the tree says he will begin negotiations with the mississippi 
highway department to have the tree removed in late fall 
big ike stands three miles south of corinth on a farm davis 
inherited from his grandfather 
the decision to cut down the tree was made this week after 
forestry and horticulture experts from mississippi state university 
completed tests that indicate the tree could not survive being 
uprooted and moved 
so the tree will be used to make a piece of furniture for the 
governors mansion and to make small wooden crosses that will be 
given to the 100 children who have become members of the big ike 
bunch davis said 
the horticulture experts also will try to make grafts of the 
pecan tree which davis plans to plant near where big ike now 
stands 
and davis is planning a party with hot dogs and lemonade in 
late november 
we have much to celebrate he said it was a unified 
effort that brought the big ike bunch together

a 98yearold woman who moved to the 
united states in 1927 on friday became the first person to gain 
citizenship under the amnesty program allowing aliens to legalize 
their status 
it seems like it is not true clara escobedo de martinez 
said in spanish after the ceremony it is so big it seems like a 
fairy tale 
the widow and greatgrandmother sat in a chair raised her hand 
and took the oath of allegiance to the united states in spanish 
from us district judge filemon vela 
what youre doing today dona clarita very much is a heroic 
event said vela 
a case of overnight nerves sapped some of her strength mrs 
escobedo said but after it was over she felt strong enough to wave 
a flag provided by the local chapter of the daughters of the 
american revolution 
a cake inscribed congratulations citizen clara and a special 
luncheon held by the immigration and naturalization service awaited 
her at the fort brown motor hotel about a quartermile from the 
mexican border 
ins district director jerry sewell said the reception was his 
agencys way of thanking mrs escobedo for being a public relations 
agent for the oneyear amnesty program ending may 4 
mrs escobedo appeared on parade floats and television 
commercials and helped motivate other aliens to apply under the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 offering legal residency 
and ultimately citizenship to those able to prove they have lived 
here illegally since before 1982 
she is the first person in the united states who applied for 
amnesty to become a citizen sewell said 
she is not the oldest person to apply for amnesty under the 
program that distinction apparently goes to carlos romerogaitan 
of los angeles a 101yearold mexican who was smuggled into the 
country in the back seat of his sons car 14 years ago 
joining mrs escobedo in becoming citizens friday were a 
74yearold daughter consuelo martinez zarate and two 
granddaughters 47yearold rakel zarate and 44yearold genoveva 
zarate de sanchez 
it has given me new dimensions of my love for this country 
said rakel zarate 
mrs escobedo who said her husband was killed by pancho villas 
men during the mexican revolution lived in the united states 
legally from 1927 until 1962 
but in a bureaucratic mixup immigration officials took away 
her green card which is now blue and shows legal residency 
status because they thought she had been living in matamoros 
mexico in violation of the cards terms 
she has lived as an undocumented alien with relatives in 
brownsville since 1979 
officials gave her a new green card in february and were able to 
waive the normal fiveyear wait for citizenship because she 
satisfied that requirement 56 years ago in 1932 said sewell 
otherwise she would have had to wait until 1994 when she would 
have been 104 
mrs escobedo said she had always planned to become a citizen 
during her first 35 years in this country but kept putting it off 
she never learned to speak english but the requirement does not 
apply to applicants over age 50 with more than 20 years of us 
residency 
she learned how to say at least one english word on friday 
citifen citipen mrs escobedo said haltingly under her 
daughters coaching 
i am american citizen she finally said with a broad smile

negotiations on an afghanistan settlement were 
completed friday allowing the soviet union to pull out of a war 
with moslem guerrillas to which it had committed a force of 115000 
soldiers 
un mediator diego cordovez said he expects the fivepoint 
peace plan to be signed by next thursday the signing will end 
nearly six years of indirect talks in which he was the gobetween 
for afghanistan and its eastern neighbor pakistan 
a un spokeswoman therese gastaut said the date of the 
signing ceremony will be announced monday 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev confirmed that soviet troops 
will begin leaving on may 15 but added the withdrawal is not a 
present to president reagan the two begin their fourth summit 
may 29 in moscow 
although cordovez has a mandate from all sides to promote 
dialogue within communistruled afghanistan there is no guarantee 
the 10yearold war will stop 
the ussupported insurgent alliance was not included in the 
negotiations and issued a statement friday saying its fighters 
will not be bound by the outcome of the geneva agreements and 
they will continue the war as long as the russians and their 
puppets are present in afghanistan 
in a statement approved by all sides cordovez stressed that 
any questions relating to the government in afghanistan are an 
internal matter 
we have discussed we have negotiated thats over he told 
reporters the documents are now finalized and open for 
signature 
he called the settlement a historic opportunity for 
afghanistan 
agreement became possible after what diplomatic sources said was 
a secret understanding that washington will phase out aid to the 
guerrillas while moscuw cuts off military support to kabul 
cordovez said all parties are ready to sign including the 
soviet union and united states as guarantors after a final round 
of negotiations that lasted more than five weeks 
the agreement covers afghan and pakistani assurances of 
noninterference in each others affairs safe and voluntary return 
of afghan refugees and superpower guarantees a fourth part ties 
the others together and cordovez said a memorandum of understanding 
was added on the un role in supervising the agreement 
texts are to be published later 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in december 
1979 
pakistan represented the guerrillas in geneva and delivers 
supplies to them including highly effective us stinger 
antiaircraft missiles about 35 million afghan refugees live in 
pakistan most in border cities and camps that serve as bases and 
supply points for the insurgents 
the united states had said it would not sign the un accord 
until the soviets agreed to symmetry a simultaneous end to 
military aid on both sides 
diplomatic sources called the informal agreement on ending 
outside aid a facesaving solution for both sides cordovez said it 
was not part of the un settlement 
a senior us diplomat in moscow said the deal was made through 
behindthescenes diplomacy 
in a clear allusion to the question of outside military aid 
cordovez said he was convinced all parties will exercise 
restraint in taking any actions that might violate the letter and 
spirit of the accord 
the agreement is designed to bring peace to afghanistan and 
the conditions for such a peace would not be obtained if actions 
are taken which would fuel hostilities he said 
intense soviet diplomatic activity this week preceded the 
agreement 
gorbachev met najib the afghan leader in the soviet central 
asian city of tashkent earlier this week and they issued a joint 
statement thursday saying all issues had been resolved 
yuli vorontsov deputy soviet foreign minister flew to geneva 
to meet the afghan foreign minister abdul wakil apparently 
because afghanistan had been holding out over a border dispute with 
pakistan 
the dispute dating to 1893 had provoked arguments over the 
un settlements reference to boundaries a source close to the 
talks said it was resolved on friday 
early last month afghanistan and pakistan agreed on completion 
of the soviet troop pullout in nine months with half leaving in 
the first three months the timetable had been a major sticking 
point

no matter how many steaks carol armstrong 
placed in her shopping cart her husband knew the grocery trip did 
not cost what their bank said she spent 80 million 
i was a little surprised i knew it was a mistake richard 
armstrong 41 said friday 
an shopping trip march 23 to a supermarket cost 12178 which 
mrs armstrong paid with an automated teller card from wells fargo 
bank but a bank error added 80 million more 
armstrong an electronics technician said he realized something 
was wrong several days later when he couldnt withdraw money from 
their account he tried unsuccessfully several times then called 
up his balance on the machine 
this huge number with a minus sign comes spilling out 
armstrong said 
since the automated teller only goes up to 1 million the 
machine showed his account overdrawn for that amount 
despite this shock armstrong wanted to buy some flags and went 
to a flag store i said i think im a million dollars short so 
can i write a check 
since the owner knew him armstrong was allowed to write a check 
he then called his bank which he said insisted the armstrongs 
had mistakenly written a check for 80 million he noted however 
that 8000012178 had been deducted from their account and 
finally deduced that the mistake stemmed from the check for 
groceries 
still armstrong was left without money over easter weekend 
i had to rob my kids piggy banks he said 
wells fargo corrected the armstrongs balance tuesday a bank 
spokeswoman said it was a clerical error

a tough stand on drugs was the main 
theme friday as michael dukakis his presidential hopes buoyed by a 
new poll campaigned in the long island suburbs of new york city 
asked at a senior citizens forum what he would do to protect the 
elderly from criminals the massachusetts governor quickly turned 
his answer to drugs id wage a real war not a phony war on 
drugs he said drawing loud applause weve got to get tough 
on the flow of drugs into this country 
an earlier speech at st johns university billed as a major 
foreign policy address also emphasized the need to deal with drug 
trafficking 
in latin america the gravest threat to our security comes not 
from the sandinistas but from drugs he said 
in the threeway democratic race for the 255 delegates at stake 
in the new york primary on april 19 dukakis held a growing lead in 
a new poll by the marist college institute for public opinion 
the survey of 404 likely democratic voters found 47 percent 
naming dukakis as their presidential choice while 31 percent 
picked jesse jackson and 6 percent sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee 
the interviews were conducted tuesday and wednesday and the poll 
had a margin of error of 5 percent meaning the figures could be 
off by 5 points up or down 
a marist poll taken less than a month ago reported dukakis was 
the choice of 37 percent of likely democratic primary voters while 
jackson had 28 percent 
at the senior citizens forum held at adelphi university dukakis 
said he was opposed to means testing for social security and said 
that twothirds of the people receiving the federal retirement 
benefits had no other income 
at st johns dukakis advocated using a portion of foreign aid 
for drug enforcement programs in producing countries 
he also criticized the reagan administrations ties to gen 
manuel antonio noriega of panama 
the american people deserve a full explanation of what and why 
we were doing business with noriega he said 
on the persian gulf dukakis said the united states should 
challenge china and the soviet union to join the agreement 
recently signed by japan and the western powers to stop the sale of 
longrange missiles to all countries in the middle east 
he said the united states also must enlist every nation we can 
in the effort to ban poison gas something that is being used right 
now right now and to impose tough sanctions against any country 
dumb enough and savage enough to use these weapons against their 
fellow human beings

clutching sack lunches 
along with their rifles and machine guns 290 marines boarded giant 
cargo jets and flew to panama on friday for jungle training 
exercises 
the marines joked among themselves listened to a dixieland jazz 
band and waved to mom as they passed in front of television cameras 
before boarding two c141 jets that took off before noon 
im just going down to get a suntan said cpl mark 
stelluto 21 a radio operator from fullerton we have been told 
to be on our best demeanor 
the marines dressed in camouflage and carrying m16 rifles 
m60 machine guns and other weapons are members of the 2nd 
battalion 9th marine regiment and the 1st battalion 5th marine 
regiment based at camp pendleton 60 miles north of san diego 
the exercise is unrelated to a us military buildup prompted by 
panamas current political turmoil said lt gene browne a camp 
pendleton spokesman five hundred more marines leave next week for 
the training he said 
the last of 1300 other us troops arrived thursday at howard 
air force base outside panama city completing a buildup meant to 
provide greater security for the panama canal american 
installations and us citizens 
this whole thing for us is purely coincidental said browne 
this particular training evolution has been scheduled since 
december 
we dont have jungles in southern california and they do down 
there at the army school so we go there to train he said 
the governmentcontrolled press in panama contends the marines 
arrival is a step toward a us invasion aimed at ousting gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
noriega head of the 15000member panamanian defense forces 
refused to step down when fired by the countrys civilian 
president who then went into hiding noriega has been indicted in 
the united states on drug charges and the reagan administration 
has been trying to oust him with economic pressure 
the arrival of the 800 marines will bring to more than 12000 
the number of us military personnel in the central american 
country 
the marines leaving friday range in age from 18 to 45 and while 
few have combat experience executive officer brad stephan said 
they were prepared to fight if necessary 
said lance cpl rodolfo gonzalez 21 im looking forward to 
it ive never been down there he said his biggest worry was 
getting sick from the food 
nicarauganborn juan chamorro dropped one of his weapons as he 
boarded the plane his penalty several pushups was imposed 
immediately he did the exercises with his feet on the boarding 
ramp and his hands on the ground 
when asked if he was nervous stelluto said no it will be 
hard enough just to deal with the insects and frogs and the things 
in the jungle like that as it is

the first phase of a huge dam 
designed to prevent north korea from flooding out the olympic games 
in seoul neared completion friday on the line separating north and 
south 
the first phase of the south korean peace dam is scheduled 
to be finished next month the olympic games open in seoul on sept 
17 
the rockfill dam sits in a valley close to the demilitarized 
zone separating the two koreas it will cut off the flow of the han 
river which originates in north korea and runs past seoul before 
flowing into the yellow sea 
construction began in late 1986 shortly after north korea began 
building a hydroelectric dam on an upper stream of the river 
despite north koreas repeated claim that its dam was designed 
only to generate power seoul officials suspect that it also is 
intended to unleash a water offensive against south korea 
if the north korean dam collapsed about 26 billion tons of 
water could submerge most of seoul and surrounding areas with a 
nuclear force south korean officials say 
we have done something which was considered difficult to be 
done in time chung inho of the governments industrial site and 
water resources development corp told reporters visiting the dam 
site near hwachun a border town 55 miles northeast of the capital 
south korea is building the dam on a phased program designed to 
match the progress of the north korean dam under construction about 
22 over the dmz 
south korea hurried the first phase of the project in fear that 
north korea would try to flood some major sports facilities in 
seoul along the han river before the olympics 
if north korea attempts to flood us the damage would be far 
beyond our imagination lee heesung chief designer of the 
staterun industrial site said 
lee said south korea poured 250 million into the first phase of 
construction the dam would eventually cost more than 600 million 
us dollars he said 
the dam will be at least 215 feet high but it could be made 
higher to match the north korean dam he said 
he said satellite and other military intelligence reports show 
that north korea is also accelerating work on its dam digging 
diversion tunnels that made the river bed dry so that ground work 
for the dam could start 
the south korean engineer said he believes that the soviet union 
is helping north korea with the construction 
lee questioned the economic feasibility of the north korean 
project saying that when it is finished in four or five years the 
dam could probably utilize only 10 percent of water it takes in

lawyers for plastic surgeon elizabeth morgan 
asked a federal judge friday to free her from jail where she has 
spent seven months for refusing to allow visits between her 
daughter and the girls father 
attorney stephen sachs said the incarceration the latest event 
in a bitter custody battle has become irrational and 
unconstitutional because dr morgan will never relent 
the plastic surgeon has been at dc jail since last aug 28 
when she refused a dc superior court judges order to allow her 
5yearold daughter to visit her exhusband who she charged had 
abused the child 
she has refused to disclose her daughters whereabouts since 
then 
sachs said that since judge herbert dixon ordered the woman 
jailed to coerce her to reveal the girls whereabouts dr 
morgans incarceration has become punitive 
she will never comply with the order of the superior court 
sachs told us district judge norma holloway johnson it is not 
likely any woman any parent could relent when she has seen what 
has happened to her daughter 
the woman has charged through a longrunning battle over the 
girls custody that eric foretich also a prominent doctor in the 
washington area abused the child foretich has denied the charges 
johnson said the issue of whether the length of incarceration 
was unconstitutional had not been dealt with by the lower court or 
by the local appeals court and so a federal court may not be the 
proper forum for the case 
the judge said she expected to rule next week on whether to 
release the woman

turf wars mismanagement and lack of 
leadership plague a government task force created to stop the flow 
of drugs across the usmexico border a congressman who 
investigated the operation said friday 
once again a lack of leadership is undermining the war on 
drugs said rep glenn english dokla chairman of the house 
government operations justice subcommittee which spent a year 
scrutinizing operation alliance and issued a critical report this 
week no one is in charge no one is responsible 
operation alliance set up in august 1986 to coordinate 
drugfighting efforts in the southwest by a variety of federal 
agencies is headed by frank keating assistant treasury secretary 
for enforcement 
attorney general edwin meeses chose keating this week to fill 
the no 3 spot in the justice department that of associate 
attorney general 
the treasury department said it had no comment friday on the 
report and a spokesman for the justice department which has 
several agencies involved in the alliance referred questions to 
treasury 
english dokla said he doesnt fault keating for operation 
alliances failure to quell drug smuggling but blames the 
administration for not giving someone the authority to marshal 
staff and resources from the various agencies 
operation alliance is a good idea that isnt working because 
of turf battles and a lack of strong leadership from the top the 
agencies including the customs service drug enforcement 
administration and the border patrol have been mired in the same 
interagency feuding which has frustrated nearly all of our federal 
antidrug abuse programs english said 
in good conscience i cant say operation alliance has made 
much of a contribution english said from oklahoma 
english blamed part of the problem on mexicos refusal to 
participate and also on customs for not lending its air wing in 
the fight on drugs along the 2000mile border 
operation alliance is limited to ground action but 60 percent 
of cocaine comes in by air english said 
the report said that although administration officials had 
promised to put an additional 300 border patrol agents along the 
usmexican border where onethird of marijuana cocaine and 
heroin are believed to be smuggled into the country there has been 
a net loss of agents 
participating agencies failed to coordinate efforts and did not 
use the el paso intelligence center or epic where us narcotics 
information is stored and disseminated the report said 
the subcommittee compared the number and size of seizures in the 
year before operation alliance with the first year after it went to 
work and found the size of the seizures had increased dramatically 
but it said it was concerned the number of seizures has not 
increased as dramatically as the administration has implied 
according to the report epic figures indicate there were 246 
cocaine seizures along the southwest border totaling 2256 
kilograms between july 1985 and june 1986 but during the following 
year there were 120 cocaine seizures totaling 7685 kilograms

the soviet decision to withdraw from 
afghanistan will remove one contentious issue from next months 
moscow summit agenda but probably wont speed negotiations on a 
superpower arms accord the white house chief of staff said friday 
i think it will have a salutary effect on attitudes but i do 
not think it is likely to have a major impact on the other issues 
on the agenda howard baker told reporters covering president 
reagan who was vacationing in california 
meanwhile the state department awaited notification that the 
kremlin had accepted an american proposal under which each side 
would continue aiding its allies in the afghan war as the estimated 
120000 red army troops leave afghanistan 
the kremlin had rejected an earlier us proposal that both 
sides stop arming the warring parties during the nine months over 
which the soviets agreed to withdraw their troops plus three 
months thereafter said state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
the united nations mediator diego garcia told reporters in 
geneva that an agreement could be signed by the end of the week 
and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said the red army could 
start leaving may 15 
we have discussed we have negotiated thats over mediator 
cordovez said i want to inform you that the documents are now 
finalized and open for signature 
even though the afghanistan accord is likely to improve the 
atmosphere at the may 29june 2 summit reagan and other 
administration officials say they do not expect to reach agreement 
before the summit on the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
the treaty would cut us and soviet longrange nuclear arsenals by 
30 to 50 percent 
soviet officials say publicly that a start treaty could be 
signed at the summit but privately acknowledge it is unlikely they 
can reach agreement 
baker denied published reports attributed to anonymous united 
nations officials that the superpowers had agreed to stop aiding 
the warring afghan parties and he stressed that the administration 
was withholding formal endorsement of the un agreement until 
reading the final terms 
we have made it known that we will continue to aid the 
mujahadeen if the soviets continue their aid to the kabul 
government he said the mujahadeen are not being abandoned 
theyre not being put at a disadvantage they will be supplied as 
long as there is a need for that and as the soviets continue to 
supply the kabul government 
after weve had a chance to examine the text of the agreement 
and heard formally from the soviet union we will decide if all of 
the conditions have been met for us to continue and to participate 
as a guarantor of this agreement baker said 
neither the united states nor the soviet union nor the afghan 
guerrillas are direct parties to the un talks which involve the 
government of pakistan and the kremlinbacked regime in kabul 
us officials say agreement on aiding the afghan parties hinges 
on a clause in the un accord guaranteeing that foreign powers 
will not intervene or interfere in afghan affairs 
pakistan which has been channeling an estimated 600 million a 
year in covert us aid to the guerrillas has agreed to continue 
that program as long as moscow aids kabul said administration 
officials who spoke on condition they not be further identified

a man who was killed by police after pretending 
to hold a teenage girl hostage for three hours had a history of 
erratic behavior and family problems said a woman who had been one 
of his many foster mothers 
israel ramos 19 died wednesday at york hospital from a single 
gunshot wound to the stomach to end a threehour standoff in which 
he held police at bay from his apartment with what turned out to be 
plastic water pistols 
police originally thought ramos had taken a 15yearold girl 
hostage but after the shooting she told authorities the drama was 
a charade and she was a willing participant 
debbie ocasio who took in ramos when he was 15 and had a 
history of family problems said i knew he was erratic so i 
wanted to help him i knew that if i could just talk with him that 
would help 
ramos was born in puerto rico and spent most of his life on the 
streets in new york city said mrs ocasio he came to pennsylvania 
with his mother about four years ago 
ramos mother suffered from mental disorders and frequently 
spent long periods in state hospitals forcing her son to live with 
foster families mrs ocasio said his father remained in puerto 
rico 
while living with the ocasios ramos attended high school 
maintained a b average and saw a counselor she said but his life 
always took a turn for the worse whenever he saw his mother 
something about her just set him off mrs ocasio said 
hoping to stabilize him mrs ocasio said she arranged for ramos 
to live with a foster family in philadelphia he stayed there for 
some time before moving back to york to live with his mother but 
she was admitted to harrisburg state mental hospital about a year 
later and ramos went downhill from there mrs ocasio said 
district attorney h stanley rebert said friday the 
investigation of the incident is continuing he would not identify 
the girl involved nor say if she was being held for questioning 
police originally said the marksman whom they have refused to 
identify fired when ramos threatened to kill the girl but 
videotape recorded by wgaltv in lancaster showed ramos was shot 
seconds after yelling im coming out and placing both hands 
on a window frame no gun was in sight 
carl robertson director of the york spanishamerican center 
the mayor and police chief william hose did not return phone calls 
for comment friday afternoon 
the officer who fired the fatal shot has been placed on 
administrative leave without pay pending an investigation that 
could last four weeks rebert said 
the district attorney said ramos had a longstanding history 
of mental health problems involving bizarre and unpredictable 
behavior 
police records indicate ramos sometimes went into public 
buildings impersonating health and police officials he once went 
into city hall carrying a briefcase and asked to see mayor william 
althaus police said ramos was apprehended after threatening the 
mayor and a pellet gun was confiscated 
john gentzler ramos boss at york snacks said he worried about 
ramos but not that he might hurt someone 
he tells me he had no friends gentzler said i knew he 
needed some help so i reached out to him as a father figure 
gentzler said ramos who worked the overnight shift got along 
well with employees he did have a little verbal battle with a 
few workers early wednesday but gentzler said he didnt think it 
was anything to worry about

iraq fired four longrange missiles into 
tehran and other iranian cities friday before iranians began voting 
in parliamentary elections iran said it fired rockets into baghdad 
and other cities in retaliation 
each side said the others missiles hit residential areas 
killing civilians 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia also 
reported that iraqi warplanes hit a large maritime target 
which usually means a tanker off irans persian gulf coast before 
dawn 
there was no immediate independent confirmation 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
cyprus said iranian artillery shelled the strategic dukan 
hyrdoelectric dam in northeast iraq where revolutionary guards 
have captured a large chunk of mountainous kurdistan in the last 
three weeks 
it was not known whether the dam 60 miles north of iraqs 
kirkuk oil fields was damaged 
the iranians occupy heights overlooking another important dam 
and power station on lake darbandikhan south of dukan crippling 
or capturing the two facilities could leave the strategic region 
around kirkuk without power 
both iran and iraq have fired nearly 300 longrange missiles 
into each others population centers in the latest chapter of the 
socalled war of the cities hundreds of civilians have been 
killed on both sides since the battle broke out feb 29 
the iran news agency said that iraqi missiles were fired friday 
into residential neighborhoods in tehran the holy city of qom the 
central city of isfahan and tabriz in the northwest 
it said iraqi warplanes raided several iranian cities but gave 
no details 
the iraqi missiles smashed into iran hours before polling 
stations opened killing or wounding civilians the agency said it 
gave no figures 
however the attacks appeared to fall far short of the missile 
blitz iranian leaders had been expecting during the elections for 
the 270seat majlis or parliament 
the agency said the iranians retaliated by firing two missiles 
into baghdad two into the northern city of mosul two in the 
border town of khanaqin and one into alamarah an iraqi military 
area in the south causing considerable damage and casualties 
the iraqi news agency confirmed one of the strikes on baghdad 
and said civilians were killed without citing a number it 
reported other fatalities from longrange iranian artillery fire on 
iraqi border cities 
iran said its warplanes bombed military targets in northern 
iraq but the iraqi news agency said the jets hit residential 
neighborhoods in the northern city of amadiya and in border towns 
killing civilians

independent counsel lawrence e walsh denied 
friday that the he illegally relied on the congressional testimony 
of defendants in the irancontra case who received limited immunity 
from congress 
a brief filed by walshs office said the overwhelming 
majority of his case against former national security adviser 
john m poindexter lt col oliver l north and businessman albert 
hakim is based on evidence collected before the three defendants 
gave congressional testimony last year 
defendants involvement in the activities underlying the 
indictment had been fully identified prior to any of their 
immunized testimony said the prosecution brief filed in us 
district court 
the government in short had no need for any imunized 
testimony to focus or aid its investigation said the pleading 
filed by herbert j stern a former federal judge who was hired to 
represent the independent counsel on the immunity issue 
the prosecution opposed the motion by the three defendants to 
dismiss the indictment on the the ground that the criminal charges 
violated their fifth amendment protection against 
selfincrimination 
the three along with retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord are accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from 
the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
secord the lead witness at last years congressional hearings 
gave his testimony on capitol hill without limited immunity 
under the socalled use immunity granted by congress walsh 
is prohibited from using the congressional testimony of north 
poindexter and hakim as evidence against them 
but stern argued that the immunity restriction does not apply to 
statements any of the defendants made voluntarily to the house and 
senate irancontra committees such statements are distinguished 
from compelled testimony given in response to questions stern said 
but the prosecution offered to forgo introduction of such 
statements by the three defendants as evidence if us district 
judge gerhard a gesell agrees not to hold an extensive pretrial 
hearing on the immunity issue 
stern called the defense request for a massive multimonth 
hearing an attempt to use pretrial proceedings to delay their 
trial by jury and obtain unparalleled discovery in a criminal 
case 
the prosecution proposed to submit for gesells review 
sufficient evidence documents and witness interviews all 
collected or requested before the immunized testimony to 
demonstate that it is not unfair to place the defendants on trial 
before walsh began his investigation early last year he 
received information from the presidential commission that 
investigated the usiran arms sales the house and senate 
intelligence committees and the justice department which had 
conducted a preliminary inquiry that led to his appointment as 
independent counsel stern said 
attached as an exhibit was a december 1986 memo to swiss 
authorities by thenassistant attorney general william weld seeking 
switzerlands cooperation in obtaining records of the arms deals 
from bank accounts kept by hakim and secord 
the memo states that the justice department had already 
determined that an undetermined amount of the proceeds from the 
arms sales were not accounted for 
weld also identifed conspiracy to defraud the government and 
wire fraud as possible offenses committed by hakim north and 
secord the indictment accuses all four defendants with committing 
those offenses 
gesell is scheduled to hold a hearing next tuesday on the 
immunity issue he indicated in a brief opinion earlier this week 
that he was prepared to discuss a realistic trial date

a man whose shooting of a pregnant woman 
resulted in the death of her baby was sentenced friday to 15 to 30 
years in prison 
leonard hall 21 of new york claimed he accidentally shot 
brigitte garrett 29 while firing into a crowd at a bully who had 
beaten him up 
ms garrett who underwent seven hours of surgery and was 
hospitalized 11 days after she was shot wept quietly in her 
secondrow seat as state supreme court justice william davis 
pronounced sentence i thank the lord and i thank assistant 
district attorney joel seidemann she said 
hall was convicted march 9 of seconddegree manslaughter 
seconddegree criminal possession of a weapon and firstdegree 
assault the jury cleared him of murder after finding he had not 
intended to harm ms garrett 
ms garrett who now lives in los angeles gave birth to a 
2pound5ounce baby who had a heartbeat but no other vital 
functions named atallah she died of respiratory failure 36 hours 
later 
hospital officials said the baby had hyaline membrane disease 
common to premature babies and never breathed without life support 
equipent 
the homicide case centered on whether the baby was born alive 
since she never breathed independently citing a 1949 new york 
decision known as the born alive ruling defense lawyers argued 
unsuccessfully that since the baby never survived without 
mechanical life support she could not be considered a person and 
hall could not be charged with her death 
the born alive ruling defines a person as one who has 
been fully expelled from the mothers body and had independent 
circulation

despite a conflict of interest responsibility 
for investigating and prosecuting alleged offenses by high 
administration officials must remain with the president the 
justice department said friday 
solicitor general charles fried presented that argument in a 
supreme court brief which challenges the constitutionality of the 
law under which independent counsels are appointed by a federal 
court to investigate wrongdoing by top executive branch officers 
the system of courtappointed independent counsels grew out of 
the watergate scandal and the counsels are insulated from removal 
except for misconduct or incapacity 
the possibility of personal and political conflicts of 
interest does not justify this sort of patchwork improvement on the 
constitution fried said 
his brief details objections first made last year by justice 
department officials to the independent counsel provisions of the 
1978 ethics in government act 
the constitution does not contemplate that the president may 
be disqualified because of an impermissible conflict between 
his chief political interest and his responsibility as chief 
executive fried said 
any such conflict is intrinsic to the vesting of all 
executive power in an elected president the 50page brief added 
it concluded that the tools supplied by the constitution to deal 
with the conflict problem criminal prosecution by regular or 
special prosecutors within the executive branch congressional 
investigation and impeachment have been used with success 
throughout our history 
the solicitor generals brief says that the independent counsel 
statute unconstitutionally takes executive power from the president 
and violates the appointments clause of the constitution 
the limitations on removing independent counsels are 
inconsistent with supreme court decisions and there is no precedent 
for vesting purely executive power in courtappointed officers 
fried concluded 
the solicitor generals brief was filed in a case involving 
independent counsel alexia morrison whose constitutional authority 
is being challenged by the target of her criminal investigation 
former justice department official theodore olson 
olson won a favorable ruling at the federal appeals court level 
morrison is appealing the governments brief was filed in support 
of olson 
now a washington lawyer olson is under investigation for 
allegedly lying to congress in the 1983 environmental protection 
agency controversy in which the executive branch of government 
initially withheld documents from congressional investigating 
committees 
if the supreme court rules against independent counsels it 
would be unlikely to affect criminal investigations of the 
irancontra scandal and of attorney general edwin meese iii 
independent counsels in both those probes have accepted parallel 
appointments within the justice department as a safeguard against 
constitutional challenges to their authority

michael gardner said at a news conference

in bellevue hospital after giving birth wednesday to her fifth 
child 
the girl was pronounced dead thursday evening 20 minutes after

street corner with benito sanches 29 who had been panhandling 
police said maya was in a stroller and her 18monthold brother 
was in sanches arms rosenthal said 
maya appeared to be in serious condition with trauma at least 
around the face rosenthal said 
he said sanches had a habit of using the children to panhandle 
hell take two of the children of his girlfriend put them in 
a stroller and go out and solicit funds in their presence 
rosenthal said 
the passerby who had not been identified stopped a cab gave 
the driver 5 and told him to take sanches and the children to a 
hospital the cab driver told police what had happened

sen albert gore jr donned an olivegreen field 
jacket for his opening salvo in the new york presidential primarys 
battle of the airwaves 
im a vietnam veteran one of the lucky ones gore says in 
a new ad for television because of his experience he says he has 
worked for arms control for peace for a strong bargaining 
position with the russians 
gores experience is the focus of two new ads that began airing 
in new york this week a third unveiled friday touts a commitment 
to education and suggests using the military against drug smugglers 
on the stump friday gore underscored the drug theme by telling 
a long island audience this administration declared a war 
against drugs and drugs won theyve got to say yes to funding for 
drug programs 
gores new ads with one mild exception do not take direct aim 
at his opponents as did earlier commercials we just do issues 
said a senior adviser bill haddad thats what weve been doing 
thats going to continue 
gore who has not won a contest since super tuesday hopes to 
revive his struggling candidacy in new york and television ads are 
a key segment of his strategy those out this week are the first of 
six that are planned 
but the effort may be hamstrung by the skyhigh price of 
advertising in new york gore media manager david garth has 
indicated discontent with the size of the campaigns tv buy 
garth said ideally he would want to spend 2 million on tv time 
but would settle for 1 million gore aides said they had committed 
500000 and hoped for more the gore campaign is 15 million in 
debt 
the first two gore ads are biographical spots aimed at 
introducing him to voters the field jacket ad shows him standing 
in front of manhattans vietnam war memorial as he recounts his 
experience and his efforts for peace in his only reference to his 
opponents he says i believe no other democrat running for 
president has the experience to make that fight 
the second advertisement presents a sequence of still photos and 
footage gore at harvard in the army in the senate and talking 
to voters an announcer says vote for al gore hes got a solid 
record he can win 
in the third gore his tie loosened declares were losing 
too many kids to drugs and an inadequate education education is 
important to the nations security he says and if that means 
using the military to help stop drugs at our borders then lets do 
it 
gore has been more aggressive in campaign appearances directly 
criticizing his opponents gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
and jesse jackson 
dukakis has been on the air this week with biographical ads 
jackson who has bought very little ad time over the course of the 
campaign was filmed campaigning in brooklyn on tuesday for 
possible advertising footage but aides said his ad strategy for 
the primary was uncertain 
its not until april 19 said jackson ad man dan mowbray 
and in the jackson campaign thats a world away

a special grand jury that charged 15 
mingo county politicians with buying slots on election ballots 
struck a blow against the corrupt practices that dominated 
elections in southern west virginia for years a prosecutor says 
the practice of slating candidates and encouraging citizens 
to vote straight tickets has contributed to the conditions alleged 
in an indictment that was handed up thursday said special 
prosecutor james colburn 
i dont see how after this anyone could run as part of a 
slate colburn said 
those indicted included a state senator the county prosecutor 
the mayor of williamson two county commissioners two county 
school board members three former delegates to the state assembly 
one magistrate and one former magistrate a former court clerk a 
former county clerk and a former school board member who was also 
director of the county antipoverty agency 
the state grand jury charged the 15 with paying to be listed on 
democratic slates controlled by former sheriff johnie owens and 
with using bribes and illegal campaign contributions to subvert 
the free election system the indictment focused primarily on the 
1984 election 
a 16th defendant state sen truman chafin was indicted on a 
felony bribery charge he is accused of accepting a bribe when he 
was a county commissioner to help current mingo county sheriff 
charles eddie hilbert buy the office from owens for 
100000 
ive tried all my life to live a decent life and something 
like this is quite a shock said one indicted man robert 
simpkins a member of the county school board 
i cant remember if i gave them any money but it couldnt 
have been any more than 500 said another of the accused former 
county clerk hugh wellman i didnt think there was anything 
illegal about it you go through life and you forget these things 
thats been four years ago 
colburn said the indictment should be a warning to other 
politicians who might use slates to further their positions the 
grand jurors however blamed residents of mingo county for the 
dominance of slate politics 
this grand jury would urge that every citizen of mingo county 
not sell or give up their franchise or right to vote but to 
exercise it without fear or purchase the jurys report said 
former magistrate bill webb said the indictments were 
blatantly political and were returned without any evidence 
whatsoever he said he will continue his reelection campaign 
also indicted thursday was goodwill motors inc a used car 
dealership at delbarton owned by former county commissioner and 
former county democratic chairman stewart justice justice was not 
named as a defendant

count of bribery and three counts of tax evasion and is scheduled 
to be sentenced on those charges april 18 he faces sentencing on a 
state income tax evasion count april 19 
hilbert has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 13 felony 
counts of buying his office helping protect a drug ring in return

to jews not for them when he said they would be crazy to vote 
for presidential candidate jesse jackson

billion spending program for pie in the sky social programs and 
would disarm the united states

a federal judge rejected an attempt friday 
to put political extremist lyndon larouche on the ballot for 
indianas may 3 democratic primary for president 
us district judge s hugh dillin ruled against a larouche 
argument that the candidates rights were violated by a requirement 
that his campaign submit 500 signatures from each of the states 10 
congressional districts on his ballot petitions 
because larouches campaign turned in fewer than the required 
500 signatures for the 10th district the indiana secretary of 
states office refused to certify him for the ballot 
dillin also told lawyers from the state attorney generals 
office that they could ask larouche to pay the states costs 
because his attorneys had failed to do proper research and had 
brought what amounted to a frivolous action

commerce secretary c william verity said 
friday that he expected no breakthroughs in trade talks next week 
with soviet officials in moscow 
but verity who is leading a delegation of american officials 
for the tenth session of the joint commercial commission said he 
was hopeful the negotiations could lay the groundwork for expanded 
trade 
the joint commission was formed in 1973 to bring trade agencies 
of the two governments together the meetings will take place at 
the same time a trade delegation of 400 american businessmen will 
be in moscow for talks on trade opportunities 
verity who will be meeting with soviet officials including 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev said the united states would 
seek expanded opportunities for american companies to sell their 
products in the soviet union 
last year trade between the united states and the soviet union 
totaled 15 billion twothirds of that in grain sales this 
represented just 05 percent of american export sales and was a 
decline from 45 billion in ussoviet trade in 1979 before 
president carter imposed the trade embargo after soviet troops 
invaded afghanistan 
we are not going to moscow for any breakthroughs verity 
said we do not expect any dramatic increase in trade to result 
what we hope to do is to create a new climate and a foundation for 
future trade 
verity said he would stress that expanded trade can only take 
place if the soviets make further improvements elsewhere in our 
bilateral relationship particularly on human rights and 
immigration 
asked whether the thursday announcement that soviet troops would 
begin pulling out of afghanistan on may 15 would help the trade 
talks verity said he believed that president reagan was very 
happy with the development 
there isnt any question in my mind that if the soviets would 
continue to indicate that they would like to lessen tensions that 
would certainly have an effect on the american people and the 
american congress verity said 
verity who will leave for moscow on sunday won cabinet 
approval earlier this week for a plan to set up highlevel working 
groups with the soviets to spur exchanges in five areas food 
processing energy construction equipment medical products and 
the services sector including insurance 
verity said it was hoped that these working groups will provide 
channels to develop specific markets for us products 
the meetings next week are expected to produce some agreements 
on the establishment of joint ventures between american companies 
and the soviet union 
the trade meetings will come six weeks before reagan travels to 
moscow for his fourth summit conference with gorbachev

city officials are trying to shut 
down an advertising agency that has found a legal loophole allowing 
it sell babies to adoptive parents 
for you too a child from the third world for 12000 marks 
7270 reads an advertising flier from the frankfurtbased 
hamel and keller agency strict laws bar private adoption agencies 
we are completely legal uwe hamel 32 told the associated 
press all we are doing is breaking through the monopoly of 
staterun offices that put couples wanting to adopt through the 
torture of long waits and tests before they get a child 
to circumvent the adoption law hamel says a prospective 
adoptive father declares himself the father of an illegitimate 
child and signs a contract with the babys mother who is paid to 
verify his claim 
the adoptive father then applies to a west german court for the 
child to be declared his legitimate offspring hamel said 
hamel said he makes about 3000 as the gobetween with the 
rest of the fee going to the mother 
there is nothing in our law that forbids this he said 
the agency sends its advertising fliers to prospective adoptive 
parents and gynecologists 
i can arrange immediately for a child the prices 30000 
marks 18000 for a child from the middle east 15000 marks 
9000 for a child from the far east 45000 marks 27000 for 
a german child one flier said 
frankfurt city officials are working to shut down hamels office 
because it is morally and ethically wrong to profit by selling 
human beings city spokesman stefan lauer told the ap 
last year frankfurt won a court order to shut down united 
families international an information office for the infertility 
center of michigan inc 
the michigan office is operated by american lawyer noel p 
keane who gained fame in the baby m surrogate motherhood case 
we closed down the keane office last year and in this case we 
also think it is morally and ethically wrong to make a profit by 
trading in children lauer said 
the case has been getting heavy publicity 
the frankfurter rundschau published an article about hamels 
operation under the headline businessman deals in babies from 
the third world 
the frankfurt abendpost newspaper wrote frankfurt office 
takes advantage of laws loopholes for scandalous baby trade 
different prices does not mean the agency considers one baby 
more valuable than another because of race hamel said 
in west germany a mother is entitled to as much as 2000 marks 
1480 per month to support herself and a child 
a third world mother can often support herself and a baby for 
about 200 marks 120 per month depending on which country shes 
from he added 
hamel said he has so far arranged the adoption of nine babies 
his office has been operating for two months

the reagan administration has rejected a 
soviet proposal to conduct tests to determine whether cruise 
missiles aboard ships are armed with nuclear or conventional 
warheads a us official said friday 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev raised the issue at the 
washington summit last december saying the soviets had a new 
scientific technique and the soviets want to include limits on 
sealaunched cruise missiles in a strategic arms reduction treaty 
now under negotiation 
us officials argue that it is impossible to verify whether 
shipboard cruise missiles are armed with nuclear or conventional 
warheads and therefore reject making them part of the start pact 
the soviets responded by proposing a joint experiment to be 
conducted in the mediterranean sea to test the new technology 
gorbachev mentioned last december 
soviet officials have not released details of the new method 
but a senior administration official said march 17 that it seemed 
to be just a geiger counter hanging from a helicopter such a 
device would be easy to fool said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
however said the official the administration was considering 
going along with the experiment just to see what they have 
on friday a state department official said that the proposed 
experiment had been rejected 
the united states stands by the commitment it made at the 
washington summit to find a mutually acceptable solution to the 
questions of limiting the deployment of longrange nuclear armed 
cruise missiles and to seek mutually acceptable and effective 
methods of verification of such limitations said the official 
reading a state department policy statement 
designing a regime to verify the effective limitation of 
sealaunched cruise missile slcm deployment is an extremely tough 
problem the soviet proposals forwarded thus far for verifying as 
slcm limit simply wont work the official said 
that means we rejected the idea of a joint experiment said 
the official 
the administration maintains that the soviet demand to include 
the sealaunched cruise missiles stands in the way of a start 
treaty 
soviet officials have said that a start pact could be ready for 
the moscow summit at the end of may but president reagan has said 
that the treaty is too complicated to conclude by then 
a soviet diplomat in washington said that question of monitoring 
sealaunched cruise missiles was discussed during the visit to 
washington last month of foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
but that these negotiations were supposed to be confidential 
through diplomatic channels the us side was supposed to let 
us know said the soviet official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he declined to give an official reaction to the state 
department statement

a lawyer for john zaccaro jr admitted 
friday that his client sold cocaine but said the son of former 
vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro was tricked into 
making the sale by an attractive female officer 
zaccaro is on trial in vermont district court on allegations he 
illegally sold a quartergram of cocaine to the undercover officer 
two years ago the charge carries a maximum penalty of five years 
in prison and a 5000 fine 
the defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a 
regulated drug said charles tetzlaff in his opening statement 
friday this is a case of improper and overzealous police 
conduct 
tetzlaff said an attractive female police officer who had 
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped zaccaro 
into making the sale he said it was the woman not zaccaro who 
brought up the subject of buying drugs 
when she took the stand friday the officer laura manning was 
asked what she said to zaccaro when she came to his offcampus 
apartment in february 1986 i said a couple of people told me 
that you could sell me some coke 
and what did he say asked addison county prosecutor john 
quinn 
sure manning quoted zaccaro as responding she added he 
pulled a tray from under the couch 
manning testified that the tray had on it about 15 packets of 
cocaine in a plastic bag with the packets marked by weight 
when questioned by tetzlaff on her apparel that day manning 
said she was told to dress like a college student and was wearing 
an open jean jacket a yellow vneck sweater and jeans 
she said she was hesitant to take the assignment because she had 
never done an undercover job she said she was given instructions 
on what to wear and what to say 
did they tell you to ask for cocaine tetzlaff asked her 
yes replied manning 
after mannings testimony the trial was adjourned until 
saturday 
quinn conceded in his opening argument that manning was 
inexperienced but asked jurors to keep in mind that the middlebury 
police department is a lowbudget smalltown operation 
we dont have huge resources in the state he said adding 
it was even difficult for police to come up with 30 for the 
purchase 
the prosecutor painted a picture of zaccaro as a wellorganized 
drug dealer 
he said that when manning asked to buy cocaine zaccaro pulled a 
tray from under his couch with 15 packets of the drug when he 
takes a packet off the tray he opens it up being the good 
merchant that he is looks at it wraps it up and gives it to 
manning quinn said 
quinn also said a detective began investigating zaccaro after a 
note was left on his desk with zaccaros name address car 
registration and the words the pharmacist 
prosecutors and police have said zaccaro was known at middlebury 
college as the pharmacist because of his reputation as a drug 
dealer 
the detective david wemette was the first witness he 
testified he had first heard rumors of zaccaros drug dealing in 
1984 but that he did not pursue them because zaccaro left to help 
his mothers campaign 
mannings drug buy came feb 20 1986 at zaccaros offcampus 
apartment zaccaro was arrested a few days later after police 
searched his car and apartment 
opening arguments followed four days of jury selection a task 
slowed by wide publicity ferraro and her husband john zaccaro 
sr have been sitting side by side behind their son in court 
the jury is being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press 
accounts of the trial

an expedition leader said friday that 
archaeologists in egypt have dug up what may prove to be the 
earliest complete versions of three classical greek texts at least 
one of them by aristotle 
professor anthony j mills said his canadian team found two 
books dating from the late third century ad one literary and one 
containing farm accounts while excavating the remains of the 
posthellenic town of isment in the dakhla oasis in central egypt 
the literary manuscript contains a treatise on politics 
apparently by the philosopher aristotle an essay on kingship by 
isocrates his 4thcentury bc contemporary and an unidentified 
text that could be one of aristotles lost works mills said 
the earliest complete texts of writings by aristotle and 
isocrates that survive in museums today date from the 10th century 
a british expert said 
the original works of classical greek scholars have vanished 
what survives are usually separated from the authors lifetimes by 
hundreds of years of copying and recopying by scribes 
the new discoveries could bring scholars more than six centuries 
closer to the lost originals and eliminate what the times of london 
described friday as generations of slips of the pen 
the books measuring 4by10 inches each has eight or nine 
wooden pages oneeighth of an inch thick said mills 51 an 
egyptologist affiliated with the royal ontario museum in toronto 
mills leader of a 25member museum expedition that travels to 
the dakhla oasis every winter said the books were found in 
midjanuary 
they are written in ancient greek with a splitreed pen bound 
on one side and held together with the original strings he said in 
a telephone interview from his home in bodmin southwest england 
the books are in excellent condition the wood is good and 
hard and the writing is very clear he said 
the one with literary text is written in a very clear very 
small and very precise hand i would guess there would be 60 lines 
on each page and writing on both sides of the page 
the farm manuscript lists local tenant farmers and their 
commodities over a fouryear period he said 
the expedition of zoologists botanists ceramics experts and 
others examining the links between human activity and the 
environment in isment were short of a classicist at the time of the 
discovery he said they sent for guy wagner a french specialist in 
ancient greek texts who was working in an expedition at the nearby 
kharga oasis 
wagner and a danish colleague who accompanied him said the 
writing seemed like aristotles but could not be sure if it was a 
manuscript that was already known mills said he said research was 
being conducted 
they were very excited he said its a marvelous find a 
very rare find theres so much thats new and incontrovertible in 
this work the information is so clearly stated 
the books were found about six feet below the surface and three 
feet above the floor of a house and may have been accidentally 
dropped mills said 
we wondered that perhaps they fell out of somebodys 
saddlebags as they were going by in the 4th or 5th century mills 
said the town had been abandoned and was eventually buried by sand 
dunes around the sixth century he said 
the unidentified text could be one of aristotles lost works 
mills said of abvout 150 named works that aristotle left fewer 
than 30 survive in more than fragmentary form 
thomas pattie a papyrologist at the british library said few 
texts by aristotle have been found in egypt and most are written on 
papyrus a water plant used by the ancient greeks egyptians and 
romans to make writing materials 
this is written on wood not so many have been found and 
was possibly for school use pattie said in an interview 
the earliest surviving fragmentary manuscript containing an 
aristotle work the constitution of athens dates from the 
first century ad and is written on papyrus 
there are several fragments from the second century and this 
is apparently from the third century but it may be more 
substantial he said 
it might turn out to be very important indeed these complete 
texts could be about 600 years older that the next oldest full 
texts

eighteen british hostages freed from a hijacked 
kuwaiti airliner got an emotional greeting from their families and 
an official government welcome when they landed at heathrow airport 
on friday 
they were brought home by a british airways jet diverted from 
dubai to kuwait to pick them up 
lynda chalker a foreign office minister met them at the 
aircraft door and led them to a vip lounge where about 40 relatives 
waited 
everyone was charging around the lounge trying to find their 
family said mark appleby 23 he was returning from a vacation 
in thailand with his sister nicola and family friend sue silcock 
21 when the plane was hijacked early tuesday and landed in iran 
there was a lot of hugging he said there was laughing 
and crying it was a great welcome back 
miss silcock said she would celebrate her return with champagne 
and a cheddar cheese sandwich the thought of which had kept me 
going throughout the last few days 
simon pollock 26 hugged his mother and said its fantastic 
to be back the only thing i thought about when i was there was my 
family and now that i am with them again it is wonderful 
mrs chalker said we learned the lesson that firmness does 
pay we have to resist further hijacks 
some passengers looking pale and drawn left the airport 
quickly after the reunion escorted by police government officials 
and airport security to their cars some leaned on the arms of 
relatives 
fred grant was in such a hurry to leave the airport that he 
nearly missed his waiting family and friends 
passengers said the hijacking was a frightening experience but 
the gunmen were considerate of the passengers giving them 
blankets pillows food and water 
scott stillwell a 23yearold photographer said we werent 
harmed they seemed very well trained i dont think they are 
afraid to die 
david carewjones 32 said they didnt actually physically 
maltreat anybody on the contrary they were very attentive but 
you always had to remember that they had a hand grenade in one hand 
and a gun in another and they were wearing hoods i mean there 
was always menace 
it could get quite relaxed and they would allow you to talk 
go to the toilet converse with people then suddenly about once 
every two or three hours they would put the lights out saying no 
talking and they would stand at the front and scan you with 
torches flashlights 
you kept thinking that every time the torch fell on your face 
it was somehow significant that i found frightening 
the hijackers who demand that kuwait release 17 shiite moslems 
convicted and imprisoned for bombing the us and french embassies 
there in 1983 have released 33 men and 24 women a total of 55

a federal jury spent hours poring over hundreds of 
documents friday as it began deliberating the fate of a scholar 
accused of trying to sell historic letters and papers taken from 
the national archives and the library of congress 
the jurors quit for the weekend after they spent four hours 
considering the case of charles merrill mount charged with 
interstate transportation of stolen documents including some 
signed by president abraham lincoln and british prime minister 
winston churchill 
mount who was born sherman suchow in brooklyn but speaks with 
the accent of a british gentleman faces a maximum penalty of up to 
10 years in prison and a 500000 fine 
in closing arguments friday assistant us attorney martin 
murphy said mount stole the papers and removed their identifying 
marks mount a respected biographer and guggenheim foundation 
fellow claims the documents were his 
mounts public defender charles mcginty said the government 
tried to paint mount as a thief because the transportation charge 
was hard to support 
mcginty also said bookkeeping at the national archives and 
library of congress was too spotty to prove those institutions ever 
owned the documents 
he said it was only after mount was arrested that the government 
began to gather a case against him although mount has not been 
charged with theft the government contends that mount took the 
papers 
what problem do they have alleging theft mcginty asked the 
jurors in us district judge rya zobels court plenty 
mount who is 59 and favors a gray bowler hat a british accent 
he attributes to irish neighbors in brooklyn and dapper suits from 
the salvation army says he was impoverished after the government

here is the text of a statement read 
friday by television evangelist jimmy swaggart who was defrocked 
by the assemblies of god 
i wish to express to all the state and national officials of the 
assemblies of god my sincere appreciation for the kindness and 
consideration they have shown me in the midst of a very trying 
situation 
they have conducted themselves as christian gentlemen we 
appreciate that i would like to believe that i understand the 
difficulties and problems the assemblies of god officials face 
respecting the guidelines for rehabilitation i have tried to put 
myself in their shoes and i can find no fault with the decision 
admittedly i had hoped the decision would have gone in another 
direction but i do understand their reasoning 
we are seeking god almost continuously and of course our 
immediate concern is to salvage the ministry we believe that to 
stay out of the pulpit for a year would totally destroy the 
television ministry and greatly adversely impact the college 
because of the nature of this situation we are forced to take a 
position that does not answer all the questions nor solve all the 
problems but we feel we have no alternative or choice therefore 
i must regretfully withdraw from the assemblies of god 
understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss me 
from the fellowship since i am presently not in good standing with 
the fellowship even though it is a moot point at this time i 
continue to abide by the original directives of the louisiana 
district 
this in no way is meant to imply rebellion against the decision 
of the general presbytery i greatly appreciate the kindness and 
consideration shown to me by the brethern of the louisiana 
district i ask that the supporters of this ministry and the 
ministers of the assembly of god remember us in prayer our 
position will not be easy and it will take a miracle of god for the 
situation to improve 
i want all concerned to know that i in no way mean to place 
myself in a position of defying the assemblies of god or its 
officers that is not my intention in any way i will never say a 
derogatory thing about the assemblies of god we would never want 
to do anything that would prove harmful to this great fellowship i 
love this assemblies of god fellowship that i have been associated 
with for so long i still feel it is among the greatest fellowships 
on the face of the earth it is our every intention to be of 
service as much as possible i would pray that my ministry can 
continue to channel many of the souls god would help us to win into 
assemblies of god churches they could have no better home i will 
always be assemblies of god in spirit and in doctrine and even 
though what help we can give will be from a distance we will 
continue to do what we can 
i sincerely apologize to the officials of the assemblies of god 
and all its ministers of the gospel for any and all concerns and 
burdens that have come about because of my personal failure mere 
words do not help much and i wish it were possible to erase the 
ledger and start over again but of course it is not 
perhaps in gods gracious wisdom and his loving kindness he will 
help us to solve problems regarding the continuation of the 
ministry god has given us these problems are unsolvable without 
gods help

us attorney general edwin meese iii 
called anew on friday for a multinational force to combat global 
drug trafficking 
he addressed a news conference in quito following his arrival in 
ecuador on thursday night 
the us embassy said meese canceled a visit friday to an 
antidrug operations site in the ecuadorean amazon jungle and 
instead toured a police academy 
he is scheduled to fly to guayaquil ecuador on saturday for a 
meeting with president leon febres cordero before traveling on to 
peru and bolivia 
meese is accompanied by john lawn head of the us drug 
enforcement administration on a factfinding mission to measure 
the success of latin american nations efforts to halt cocaine 
trafficking 
he told reporters friday the proposal for a multinational 
antidrug force was favorably received in his meetings with 
government officials in the dominican republic and colombia before 
coming here 
this is an idea that has a lot of merit and should be explored 
in the future meese said 
dea officials say ecuadors role in cocaine trafficking is less 
significant than that of its andean neighbors 
production of coca leaf the raw ingredient of cocaine is on a 
minor scale in ecuador but in recent years international drug 
smugglers have begun using this small nation wedged between 
colombia and peru as an important transshipment point 
peru is the worlds largest grower of coca leaf most of its 
production is partially refined and smuggled into colombia where 
the drug is refined into pure cocaine for export to us and 
european markets bolivia is the second biggest grower and a major 
refiner as well 
reagan administration officials have praised febres cordero for 
his commitment to the battle against drugs and congress has 
increased funding for the fight

the first americanmade honda cars imported to 
japan arrived friday and were welcomed with a party on the ship 
that brought them 
makoto tanaka spokesman for honda motor co said about 350 
people attended a onehour reception aboard the auto carrier green 
bay including us embassy personnel and japanese government 
officials 
the ships cargo was 540 honda accord coupes and 100 motorcycles 
from hondas plant in marysville ohio he said 
tanaka quoted koichiro yoshizawa vice president of honda as 
saying the arrival of honda cars produced in the united states was 
the first concrete step by japans thirdlargest automaker to 
meet flexibly an increasing worldwide demand for vehicles 
honda has said it plans to bring 4000 americanmade hondas to 
japan in 1988 and hopes for annual sales of 50000 by 1991 
atsushi kawashima of the ministry of international trade and 
industry said hondas importation plan was a very good action 
as a result of the yens appreciation it is natural that 
japans imports be increased and that things like that are 
happening during a major trend of imports flowing into japan more 
rapidly he said 
the yen has doubled in value against the dollar in three years 
making dollardenominated imports cheaper 
last year vehicle sales in japan rose 99 percent to a record

an opposition leader who led a huge 
rally against gen manuel antonio noriega last month has been 
released from prison and ordered out of the country his lawyer 
said friday 
carlos ernesto gonzalez de la lastra 49 was freed thursday 
night after being held for 10 days in el modelo prison following 
his arrest march 28 when police stopped the protest march he was 
leading 
alvin weeden his attorney said gonzalez would stay at the 
vatican embassy until leaving sunday with his wife vilma for exile 
in venezuela 
there was no other remedy said weeden he said gonzalez 
faced a long prison term on a sedition charge filed by the 
government last summer if he did not accept exile 
noriega commands panamas 15000member defense forces and 
controls the civilian government he has been indicted on narcotics 
trafficking charges in the united states which has supported a 
10monthold opposition campaign to oust him 
the reagan administration invoked more economic sanctions friday 
on panama including a tighter freeze on panamanian assets in the 
united states although assets already were frozen by court order 
sought by the administraton the new action has the effect of law 
and prevents noriega from overturning the freeze by appealing the 
court order 
the new sanctions also include prohibiting payments to the 
regime by all people and organizations in the united states and by 
us citizens and organizations in panama 
the previous sanctions which included the withholding of us 
payments to the panama canal commission created a severe cash 
shortage in panama which uses the us dollar as its currency 
gonzalez was free on bond on the sedition charge when he was 
arrested during the demonstration that preceded a police raid on an 
opposition headquarters at panama city hotel in all more than 40 
people were picked up in the sweep including eight foreign 
journalists 
the reporters were freed within hours and most of the others 
were released the next day but the government kept gonzalez in 
custody and refused to let anyone except his wife visit him she 
said he had been beaten 
they never filed new charges against carlos ernesto said 
weeden but state security adduced his guilt from a photo of 
carlos ernesto carrying a flag in the march 28 demonstration that 
was published in a north american newspaper 
a former director of the nowclosed opposition newspaper la 
prensa gonzalez was ordered into exile in 1976 by gen omar 
torrijos who preceded noriega as panamas military strongman 
gonzalez spent two years in venezuela before being allowed to 
return 
gonzalez is one of 35 directors of the national civic crusade a 
coalition of some 200 business labor professional and political 
groups that has been seeking noriegas ouster since last june 
carrying a large panamanian flag he led the march last month 
that police and soldiers broke up with tear gas shotguns and 
rubber truncheons about 10000 people took part in the protest 
since last months demonstration noriegas regime has harassed 
and briefly detained a number of other opposition leaders 
surrounding the homes of at least three of them with state security 
agents for periods of up to 12 hours 
most leaders of the civic crusade have kept a low profile news 
conferences which used to be held almost daily have been replaced 
by telephone calls and communiques slipped into the hotel message 
boxes of reporters 
noriegas governments new gettough policy appeared in part to 
be a defiant answer to us economic sanctions and diplomatic moves 
aimed at fortifying the internal oppositions efforts to remove the 
general 
the reagan administration completed a 1300man military 
buildup in panama on thursday the new troops brought to 11800 
the number of us military personnel guarding the panama canal 
which has operated normally throughout the crisis and protecting 
american citizens living in the country 
about 800 marines arrived friday from camp pendleton calif 
for three weeks of jungle warfare training that the white house 
said had nothing to do with the buildup of the us southern 
command which is based in panama the command is responsible for 
all american military operations in central and latin america

allay concerns that he harbors antisemitic feelings and he moved 
to counter criticism that he lacks the government experience to be 
president 
our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism of 
antisemitism or sexism he said and in one appearance he 
described the link between blacks and jews during the civil rights 
movement growing up in the south jackson said it was 
commonplace to see signs that said blacks and jews and dogs are 
not welcome 
jackson will not however meet with a jewish umbrella group to 
address their concerns said gerald austin jacksons campaign 
manager 
the national jewish community relations council had sought such 
a meeting but austin said jackson could not take the time from his 
campaign for new yorks april 19 primary 
weve already answered all these questions i dont see why we 
have to go to a meeting to answer all the questions again austin 
said outside of a fundraiser in wading river on long island 
were talking to the people in new york city a lot of them 
happen to be jewish we are talking about issues that are important 
to us as opposed to the issues that are important to one group of 
people he added 
concerning his lack of experience in office jackson told a 
senior citizens forum in garden grove long island that he would 
recruit government officials to his administration and put 
together a competent and credible management team and cabinet 
some office holders are not leaders and some leaders are not 
office holders he said i am a leader 
one of jacksons two democratic rivals sen albert gore jr 
told the same forum that he does not intend to stop making 
experience an issue in the campaign he cited his own credentials 
as a member of congress and leader on various legislative matters 
of concern to the seniors 
jackson listed various economic proposals to freeze the 
military budget create a merger review board for corporate mergers 
and invest public pension funds in housing construction projects 
in earlier remarks jackson discussed blackjewish bonds during 
the civil rights struggle of the 1960s 
in a breakfast speech to union officials at sardis restaurant 
in manhattans theater district jackson said that during his youth 
in the south it was commonplace to see signs that said blacks 
and jews and dogs are not welcome 
he also spoke of people who were killed during the civil rights 
years he cited the shooting deaths of three white civil rights 
workers in mississippi in the early 1960s pointedly noting that 
two of them were jewish 
many jewish voters a large and active voting bloc in new yorks 
critical april 19 primary oppose jacksons support for a 
palestinian homeland and were alienated by his 1984 use of the 
offensive term hymietown to describe new york city moreover 
they are wary of his previous association with nation of islam 
leader louis farrakhan who called judaism a dirty religion 
asked how he would respond to that resistance jackson told 
reporters we continue to build relationships we continue to 
heal relationships ours is an inclusive outreach campaign 
additionally he said jews are among many minority and ethnic 
groups he has involved in his campaign 
at the senior citizens forum at adelphi university in garden 
grove a woman asked jackson to comment on the lack of us 
intervention when hitler was killing jewish people during world war 
ii 
we did not act quickly at that time jackson replied we 
did abandon many jewish people to hitlers hell it was a tragic 
mistake 
jackson went on to mention two issues of key importance to 
jewish voters he said americans must fight for the right of soviet 
jews to emigrate and for the right of israel to exist and be 
assured of security 
jackson whose once poor campaign has seen a dramatic boost in 
fundraising took a veiled swipe at the fat checkbook of rival 
michael dukakis telling the labor breakfast you can have the 
greatest fund raisers going and no message and no vision and 
then what 
jackson also spoke to an enthusiastic crowd at a high school in 
wyandanch ny about 1000 youth including band members in bright

frayed during his 1984 presidential campaign republican george 
bush his own nomination secure surveyed the democratic race and 
said i wouldnt trade places 
the democrats focused on new york and its april 19 turningpoint

jr both waging war on drugs 
jackson campaigning in manhattan was asked by reporters about 
his relationship with the jewish community severely strained since 
he referred to new york as hymietown during his 1984 
presidential bid 
our own commitment is to end any vestiges of racism of 
antisemitism or sexism jackson said weve sent a message 
no one can miss 
a poll released friday by the marist college institute for 
public opinion showed jackson was supported by just 9 percent of 
jewish voters michael dukakis was the choice of 68 percent of jews 
surveyed while sen albert gore jr of tennessee was favored by 10 
percent 
jews make up onefourth of the voters expected to cast ballots 
in the states contest 
jackson would not say whether he has agreed to meet with jewish 
groups but he said we continue to build relationships we 
continue to heal relationships 
however his campaign manager said late friday that jackson will 
not meet with a jewish umbrella group to address their concerns 
the national jewish community relations council had sought such a 
meeting but campaign manager gerald austin said jackson could not 
take the time for the meeting 
weve already answered all these questions i dont see why we 
have to go to a meeting to answer all the questions again austin 
said 
jackson has alienated jews by endorsing a homeland for 
palestinians and because of his close relationship with louis 
farrakhan the black muslim leader who has called judaism a 
gutter religion 
asked what his relationship with farrakhan is today jackson 
said we do not have one it is precisely that 
one of jacksons antagonists new york mayor edward koch 
defended his comment that jews would be crazy to vote for 
jackson supporters of jesse jackson are saying koch cant say 
these things the mayor said what do you think a political 
campaign is a political campaign is divisive somebodys got to 
win and somebodys got to lose 
overall the marist poll showed dukakis leading jackson among 
likely democratic voters by 47 percent to 31 percent with gore 
receiving support from 6 percent 
gov mario cuomo who has not endorsed any of the democratic 
hopefuls said the poll indicated to him that it might be a tight 
race because he expected both jackson and gore to continue to pick 
up support as for dukakis he said i dont know how much room 
there is to go 
cuomo also revealed that he has already voted by absentee ballot 
for one of the candidates but refused to say which one 
dukakis and gore waged war on the reagan administrations drug 
war during their campaign stops 
this administation declared a war against drugs and drugs 
won gore said in brentwood theyve got to say yes to funding 
for drug programs 
id wage a real war not a phony war on drugs dukakis told 
senior citizens weve got to get tough on the flow of drugs into 
this country 
bush was out on the road again touring an aircraft assembly 
plant in fort worth and attending several fundraisers during a 
twoday swing through texas and florida bush is virtually assured 
his partys nomination after bob dole dropped out and pat robertson 
severely scaled back his campaign 
bush said he didnt think the democratic infighting would last 
into the fall campaign 
i wish i thought the democrats would have a unity problem but 
i dont think they will im not counting on the blood on the floor 
that exists on this moment to carry over and cause the democrats to 
hemorrhage to death he said 
asked if he minded not having the discipline of a primary 
contest bush said im delighted its worked out the way it has 
you offset staying in the news through combat by the luxury that 
comes with having the time to deal with issues i wouldnt trade 
lets put it that way 
in albany ny the state democratic committees executive 
director john marino said some party leaders are beginning to 
throw their support to dukakis cuomo and state democratic chairman 
laurence kirwan had urged the 300 members of the state party 
committee on thursday to choose one of the three presidential 
contenders 
after yesterday i got a clear sense of some movement to 
dukakis said marino by next monday or tuesday well have a 
much better feeling for that maybe therell be a bandwagon effect 
for dukakis but you may have a backlash reaction 
later friday however cuomo at a news conference said he did 
not care whether democratic leaders endorsed candidates or not i 
did not offer instruction to people that they must endorse or 
should endorse why should i i havent endorsed myself im not 
instructing or suggesting 
cuomo said he was in discussions with the three candidates about 
making campaign appearances with them all time permitting ill 
go anywhere with them he said 
some democrats in new york are backing an uncommitted slate of 
delegates to the partys national convention in atlanta in july in 
hopes of generating a draft of cuomo to be the presidential nominee 
cuomo has said he does not want to be the candidate but he has 
refused to endorse any of the three contending democrats and has 
not ruled out accepting a draft for the nomination if the 
convention is deadlocked 
another prominent democrat who has counted himself out of the 
presidential race sen sam nunn of georgia indicated friday that 
he has had no second thoughts about his decision 
nunn who announced last year that he would not be a candidate 
conceded that it would be difficult to turn down a presidential 
draft at the convention 
but at a town meeting in thomaston ga he said i havent 
even thought about that i guarantee you i havent spent 10 seconds 
thinking about somebody drafting me

the group mirrored the international physicians for the 
prevention of nuclear war which linked soviet and us doctors in 
a campaign that earned them the 1985 nobel peace prize 
the jurists ending a twoday conference said anyone 
contributing to the nuclear arms race could be held accountable in 
the same way that nazi officers were convicted of crimes against 
humanity by the nuremberg war crimes tribunal 
alexander sucharev head of the association of soviet lawyers 
and a former justice minister of the russian republic said the 
ultimate goal is to outlaw nuclear arms possibly through 
changes in the constitutions of our countries 
sucharev a cochairman said the organization also could offer 
to help monitor the verification of arms control agreements 
speaking through a translator he said his participation in the 
founding conference reflected new thinking in moscow 
us cochairman peter weiss said the organization may help 
defend arrested antinuclear activists and could sponsor cases at 
the world court in the hague 
it also could launch multinational research projects into the 
legal aspects of the us space defense program called star 
wars and the possible interpretations of arms control treaties 
he said 
the group believes that nuclear weapons violate international 
laws banning the threat of indiscriminate force and the use of 
weapons against nonmilitary targets said weiss a new york 
attorney who also heads the lawyers committee on nuclear policy 
it is ironic that the two most powerful countries in the world 
rely for their security on an illegal institution namely nuclear 
weapons said weiss 
asked if he agreed that nuclear weapons in the soviet arsenal 
also were illegal sucharev said the reality is that nuclear 
weapons exist and said that they should be outlawed 
cochairman stig gustafsson a member of the swedish parliament 
said the association will be financed by donations from its member 
organizations and by contributions

television evangelist jimmy swaggart on 
friday announced his resignation from the assemblies of god shortly 
after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting 
punishment it had ordered for moral failure 
swaggart said at a news conference that he knew dismissal was 
inevitable but insisted he had no choice but separating from the 
church to save his bible college and 140 millionayear worldwide 
ministry 
shortly before swaggart made his announcement the executive 
presbytery of the assemblies of god headquartered in springfield 
mo said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to stop 
preaching for a year 
it had ordered the punishment after swaggart voluntarily stepped 
down from his pulpit feb 21 after a tearful public confession of 
moral failure before his wife son and congregation gathered in 
his family worship center 
church officials and swaggart have refused to elaborate on his 
misstep but a baton rouge prostitute has said swaggart paid her to 
pose nude for him 
we believe that to stay out of the public for a year would 
totally destroy the television ministry and greatly adversely 
impact the college swaggart said in a statement 
because of the nature of this situation we are forced to take 
a position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve all 
of the problems but we feel we have no alternative or choice he 
said 
therefore i must regretfully withdraw from the assemblies of 
god understanding that they will have no choice except to dismiss 
me from the fellowship since i am presently not in good standing 
with the fellowship 
he read from a prepared statement and refused to answer 
questions 
in springfield the rev everett stenhouse assistant 
superintendent of the assemblies of god said general presbytors 
had read swaggarts statement before he made it public so there 
was nothing surprising in it 
stenhouse said the church and swaggart parted on amicable terms 
but swaggarts chances of returning to the church were slim 
it would be a long trail back if at all he said 
swaggart said in the statement that he hoped his college and 
preaching would continue to send people into the assemblies of god 
he said he would stick to the punishment decided by the 
louisiana church officials although it was moot under that 
punishment he would not preach sermons until may 22 although he 
has been witnessing at church services 
swaggarts lawyer bill treeby was asked if the statement meant 
swaggart would form his own church 
this ministry is an independent church and always has been 
treeby said 
asked if any of the christian television networks had contacted 
them about taking swaggart off the air he said we have people 
who handle that were not going to deal with that if some of them 
dont use us they wont 
the churchs decision to dismiss swaggart as a minister was 
announced in springfield by the rev g raymond carlson general 
superintendent of the church after he and other members of the 
executive presbytery met by telephone conference call 
earlier friday the church had received what carlson described 
as a gracious letter from swaggart in which the evangelist 
refused to accept terms of a churchordered twoyear 
rehabilitation program 
carlson said he called swaggart on friday after the 13member 
executive presbytery which serves as the board of directors of the 
church met and made its decision 
he received it graciously carlson said we had prayer 
together at the conclusion of our conversation 
in the statement he read carlson referred to remarks swaggart 
made in a column in his magazine the evangelist in august 1987 
in it carlson said swaggart endorsed a oneyear ban from 
preaching as part of the rehabilitation of any fallen churchman 
carlson declined to release details of swaggarts letter he 
said that when he talked to him the evangelist did not explain why 
he was refusing the rehabilitation program 
the leaders of the countrys largest pentecostal denomination 
and their most prominent minister had been locked in an impasse 
since an attorney announced last week that swaggart would defy a 
churchdirected oneyear preaching ban and return to his televised 
ministry may 22 
church elders in louisiana originally recommended that swaggart 
be barred from his pulpit for three months as part of a twoyear 
rehabilitation plan despite protests from national leaders that 
every other assemblies minister who had confessed to moral failure 
was banned from preaching for at least a year 
the executive presbytery recommended the oneyear ban and stood 
firm through a challenge to its authority by louisiana officials 
on march 29 the executive presbyterys authority to discipline 
swaggart and the specifics of its rehabilitation plan were 
endorsed by an oversight body and louisiana officials later 
reconciled themselves to the national plan 
swaggarts church television and school complex in baton rouge 
has been shaken by the scandal donations are reported down about 
100 workers were fired shortly after swaggarts confession and 
students at the jimmy swaggart bible college are said to be 
clamoring to transfer to other religious institutions 
swaggarts ministry brought in an estimated 142 million last 
year and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries the 
assemblies of god received about 12 million a year in monthly 
increments of 1 million or so from swaggart for its foreign 
missions program it has not received anything since his february 
confession 
swaggart has been known for his harsh denunciations of the sins 
of others including ptl founder jim bakker who lost his 
assemblies credentials after a sexandmoney scandal last year the 
rev marvin gorman of suburban new orleans reportedly hired the 
men who photographed swaggart with the woman 
gorman also defrocked by the assemblies said the action friday 
involving swaggart further proves the truth of the allegations i 
made in a 17 million lawsuit he filed against swaggart in march 
1987 in the lawsuit gorman blamed swaggart for destroying 
gormans ministry

president jose azcona hoyo declared 
a state of emergency friday in the countrys two major cities after 
students smashed shop windows and overturned cars in new 
antiamerican riots 
the presidential press office said the emergency gives police 
and security agencies wide powers to search premises make arrests 
and hold people without trials in tegucigalpa the capital and san 
pedro sula 120 miles to the north 
it also bars street demonstrations and empowers police to 
restrict travel 
the violence broke out after thousands of students filled the 
streets friday shouting slogans protesting the forced deportation 
to the united states of a honduran suspected of drug trafficking 
so many students had left their classrooms by early afternoon 
that 100 schools and both universities in tegucigalpa shut their 
doors 
shopowners boarded their windows in fear of more violence like 
the attack on the us embassy in the capital the night before in 
which five people were killed 
but looters smashed shop windows and angry demonstrators 
flipped over cars police patrols backed by military helicopters 
sped through the downtown area friday picking up young people 
the government the principal us ally in central america said 
would will take all necessary actions to maintain order and 
tranquility 
earlier officials forced countrys 140 radio stations into a 
nationwide hookup friday controlled by the presidential press 
office 
in a communique repeatedly being read over the new network the 
government urged people to repudiate violence and remain 
calm claiming the violence was being secretly instigated by drug 
barons who were not named 
troops and antiriot police armed with pistols and submachine 
guns stopped pedestrians throughout the capital friday afternoon 
and arrested those without their national identification cards 
the heavy police presence prevented protesters from staging 
prolonged demonstrations about 1000 students who planned a 
protest near the presidents office at about 4 pm 6 pm edt 
scattered as a large contingent of riot police arrived no one was 
arrested 
one government official speaking on condition he was not 
identified said that numerous persons have been detained and 
remain in public security jails he did not give a number 
a tense calm prevailed in the capital friday night army tanks 
rumbled through the deserted streets 
about 2000 university students attacked two us embassy annex 
buildings thursday night and set both ablaze 
they were dispersed with bullets beatings and tear gas police 
said five people were killed four men and a young girl and at 
least 10 wounded no americans were injured 
about 25 automobiles belonging to embassy personnel were doused 
with gasoline and set afire thursday 
the students were protesting the arrest and delivery to the 
united states this week of a honduran accused of drug trafficking 
and involvement in the killing of us narcotics agent they also 
expressed anger at president reagans dispatch of additional 
american troops to honduras last month 
beginning at dawn friday azcona met almost continuously with 
his cabinet and gen humberto regalado hernandez the armed forces 
chief 
on tuesday soldiers and police took juan ramon matta 
ballasteros from his luxurious tegucigalpa home before dawn and 
hustled him onto a plane to the dominican republic without a 
passport 
dominican republic officials put matta on a new yorkbound 
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by us marshals 
according to us law enforcement officials 
matta held at the maximumsecurity federal prison in marion 
ill was wanted by us officials for questioning in the 1985 
slaying in mexico of a us drug enforcement adminstration agent 
enrique camarena salazar 
honduran legislators called the incident a kidnapping and 
the foreign ministry launched an investigation honduras has no 
extradition treaty with the united states and the constitution 
forbids the extratition of honduran citizens 
student protesters also were demonstrating against the presence 
of 3200 us troops in honduras last month 
president reagan dispatched them at azconas request after a 
reported incursion into honduras by nicaraguan troops pursuing 
contra rebels 
mattas capture followed the departure of the american military 
contingent by less than a week 
honduras is a cornerstone of us policy in central america 
thousands of american troops have held joint exercises with the 
honduran military on a regular basis for five years 
in washington state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said friday the reagan administration was puzzled by amount 
of time it took police to arrive on the scene thursday evening 
we do not understand the slow response we are highly 
concerned over the threat this posed to american and honduran lives 
and the destruction of american property she said and the 
matter had been taken up with honduran authorities 
about 20 honduran guards on duty at the embassy compound opened 
fire with sawedoff shotguns thursday night according to police 
but the students got into the parking lot riot squads totaling 
about 50 men did not arrive until about two hours later

windhoek southwest africa ap president pw botha of south 
africa came to windhoek with senior members of his cabinet on 
thursday for talks with leaders of the territorial government many 
of whom are demanding abolition of all apartheidstyle legislation 
archbishop desmond tutu a prominent foe of apartheid and other 
southern african anglican bishops also are here for a weeklong 
visit that includes church services in the densely populated far 
north of the territory commonly known as namibia 
it is bothas first official visit to windhoek since june 1985 
when the unelected multiriacial government was installed to 
provide limited selfrule over the territory 
in the ensuing three years the socalled transitional 
government failed to win international recognition and the 
united nations continued to call for independence elections that 
would include the southwest african peoples organization 
guerrilla movement 
the united nations has designated swapo the sole and authentic 
representative of the namibian people and most observers feel it 
would win a unsupervised election 
during the past three years four of the six parties in the 
territorial government have grown increasingly adamant in demanding 
a total break from apartheid south africas system of separate 
political social and educational structures for different racial 
groups 
moses katjiuonga chairman of the eightman transitional 
cabinet said in an interview thursday he and possibly other 
members would quit the government if botha rejected their proposal 
for a constitution stripped of all references to race and ethnic 
groups 
he said that even if the independence question remained 
unsettled for years namibians could promote reconciliation and 
unity if they were allowed to implement the proposals for a bill of 
rights and nonracial elections for regional and local governments 
botha must decide whether to bow at least partially to these 
demands or side with those who want to retain group rights 
the phrase used in south africa to justify racially segregated 
structures 
group rights in namibia are backed by the rehoboth basters a 
conservative mixedrace party and by the allwhite national party 
of southwest africa an offshoot of south africas governing 
national party 
namibian politicians say botha is mindful of how developments 
here would be viewed in south africa where his government is 
trying to convince rightwing whites of its steadfast commitment to 
group rights 
about 88 percent of namibias 13 million people are black 6 
percent white and 6 percent mixedrace a major source of friction 
is that whites are by far the wealthiest group and are allowed to 
administer their own tax system to fund allwhite schools and 
hospitals 
bothas chief representative in namibia administratorgeneral 
louis pienaar said thursday that the pretoria government would be 
willing to negotiate major changes in the tax disbursement system 
and would accept for the first time the concept of regional 
nonethnic elections but he indicated botha would insist on 
maintaining special protections for racial minorities 
katjiuonga of the transitional cabinet said thursday that 
swapo would lose some of its appeal if apartheid were eliminated 
and might be induced to join negotiations on a postindependence 
government 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i defying un 
calls for independence botha says his government will not consider 
the un proposals as long as cuban troops remain in neighboring 
angola aiding the marxist government against south africanbacked 
rebels

president virgilio barco agreed on 
thursday to try to resume extraditing colombian drug traffickers to 
the united states said us attorney general edwin meese 
extraditions were suspended last year after colombias supreme 
court ruling on a technicality said a 1979 extradition treaty was 
unconstitutional 
meese and the director of the us drug enforcement 
administration john lawn met with barco and colombias minister 
of justice enrique mutra low 
meese spoke at a news conference at the military terminal at 
bogotas el dorado international airport thursday before he and 
lawn left for ecuador 
meese and lawn have also visited the dominican republic and will 
travel to peru and bolivia as part of a review of what latin 
american countries are doing to stop drug smuggling into the united 
states 
extraditions are a key element of the fight against drug 
smuggling meese said 
the colombian president agreed that both countries must work to 
overcome the legal problems blocking further extraditions meese 
said at the news conference 
in response to questions meese rejected the idea of an 
international police force to fight drugs the suggestion that 
drugs should be legalized and the possibility of us troops being 
sent to colombia to fight drug traffickers 
the united states contributes 14 million a year to colombia for 
fighting drugs 
colombians often criticized in the united states for not doing 
enough to fight cocaine trafficking have pointed out that it is 
colombians who are suffering the most deaths in the war on drugs 
drug traffickers have killed a justice minister an attorney 
general several judges two newspaper editors and scores of 
policemen and soldiers in the last four years 
drug traffickers have threatened to kill members of colombias 
council of state the bogota daily el tiempo said thursday 
last month the council of state decreed provisionally that 
arrest orders be lifted for pablo escobar gaviria a colombian that 
us narcotics agents call the worlds biggest cocaine trafficker 
the council of state has not made its final decision on whether 
or not to seek escobars arrest escobar is not charged with any 
crimes in colombia 
the united states has asked colombia to extradite escobar 
colombia has not extradited any alleged drug traffickers to the 
united states since february 1987 because the colombian supreme 
court last year ruled a 1979 extradition treaty invalid on a 
technicality 
later thursday meese flew to ecuador his plane was prevented 
from landing in quito due to heavy rain but he detoured to 
guayaquil where he was to spend the night before traveling to 
quito the capital us embassy officials said

the skull of a prehistoric animal has been 
identified as part of a previously unknown species of compact 
meateating dinosaur scientists announced thursday 
the skull was misidentified after its discovery in 1942 in 
eastern montana by an expedition from the cleveland museum of 
natural history officials said it was in storage in the museums 
basement when it was noticed by a visiting paleontologist last year 
the museum said the skull is from a previously unknown member of 
the tyrannosaurus rex family of dinosaurs a ferocious meateating 
animal that roamed the earth some 60 million years ago 
because of its relatively small size the new dinosaur has been 
named nanotyrannus or pygmy tyrant by the scientists who 
identified it the cleveland skull is believed to be the only such 
specimen of the nanotyrannus although teeth have been found in 
montana and south dakota 
this animal is so different from any other meateater that it 
merits its own branch of the tyrannosaur family tree said robert 
t bakker adjunct curator of paleontology at the university of 
colorado in boulder 
bakker grew suspicious of the skulls initial identification as 
a gorgosaurus a primitive and very common meateater during a 
visit to the cleveland museum last spring he worked with two other 
scientists in determining its identity and their discovery was 
disclosed in a paleontology publication this month 
the nanotyrannus resembled the giant tyrannosaurus rex but was 
only about onethird as large and onetenth as heavy the 
scientists said bakker said the nanotyrannus probably weighed less 
than 1000 pounds stood about 10 feet tall walked on its hind 
legs and measured about 17 feet from nose to tail 
bakker compared the skull which is about 22 inches long and 10 
inches high to the size of a brown bears head 
he said the nanotyrannus had the same level of advancement in 
anatomical features as the tyrannosaurus rex including eye sockets 
that faced forward instead of sideways a wider skull base and a 
neck joint that bent downwards 
the nanotyrannus head was discovered during a museum field trip 
to a farm in carter county montana the expedition yielded other 
dinosaur skeletons in the museums collection but no other parts of 
the nanotyrannus 
its very rare to find just the head very rare and i hope 
the rest of it is out there bakker said after a news conference 
to announce the discovery 
michael e williams curator of vertebrate paleontology at the 
museum said there are no plans to excavate the site again 
bakker blamed the 40year misidentification on a lack of 
scientists 
there are never enough scientists to study dinosaurs or 
crocodiles or beetles or whatever kind of critter youre talking 
about he said 
the third scientist involved in the discovery with bakker and 
williams was philip currie assistant direector of the tyrrell 
museum of paleontology in alberta canada

alan rosenberg isnt dead and he obviously 
isnt famous but that didnt stop the maine author from putting 
his unpublished manuscripts up for sale thursday entering a market 
that usually belongs to the prominent or the deceased 
rosenberg was not expecting to pull in the 605000 that franz 
kafkas love letters brought at auction in fact bidding on his 
works began at 275 instead he was hopeful of attracting a 
publisher for his latest novel run red riding hood run 
so after 10 models in hooded sweatshirts simultaneously read 
excerpts from his book to about 50 people in the penthouse of the 
new york hilton rosenberg watched as his literary properties 
including two other unpublished novels were sold for a total of 
965 
rosenberg even auctioned off his collection of 30 rejection 
notices from publishers for 65 also on the block were his 
dogeared dictionary which went for 40 various photos and 
letters and cassette tapes of his dictated notes 
im thrilled rosenberg said after the sale we did good 
i read pr releases before i read comic books said 
rosenberg 34 who freely admits the auction was nothing more than 
a barnumesque stunt aimed at getting him attention 
run red riding hood run has a little bit of everything 
theres murder theres suspense theres black comedy 
rosenberg said but as was the case with his books on the second 
claus von bulow trial and on his experiences at the boston herald 
theres no publisher 
rosenberg says his publicity efforts have cost him about 15000 
and it could get worse

the pulitzer prize board will look into a 
complaint that an award was granted for reporting that broke no new 
ground but there is no such requirement for winners the board 
secretary said thursday 
a washington magazine the national journal asserted that 
philadelphia inquirer reporter tom weiners reporting on a secret 
pentagon budget was built on an earlier story in the journal by 
david c morrison and broke no new ground weiner won the pulitzer 
prize for national reporting last week 
the description of the prize does not require that the winner 
break new ground board secretary robert christopher said the 
reporter must only represent a distinguished example of reporting 
on national affairs christopher said 
meanwhile harpers magazine publisher john r macarthur on 
thursday also criticized the award noting that one of weiners 
stories was accompanied by an annotated document similar to a 
feature morrison did for the january 1987 issue of harpers 
certainly david morrison did a lot of work and a lot of very 
brilliant work on this story said macarthur who called the 
associated press to make his complaint 
it doesnt seem quite right that the inquirer gets a pulitzer 
prize unless originality has nothing to do with prize giving these 
days he said 
he said he did not plan to write the pulitzer board although he 
endorsed the journals complaint 
christopher said that only he and the board chairman david 
laventhol had seen the complaint 
laventhol president of times mirror co which owns the 
national journal a 5000circulation weekly did not respond 
immediately to a telephoned request for comment 
christopher said board members would discuss the complaint once 
they had read it probably next week 
the inquirers deputy managing editor jim naughton maintained 
that the series and tims work generally has broken new ground 
whatever that means 
i know it had a reaction naughton said i know it caused 
congress to reexamine the situation and to ask for more 
information from the pentagon i guess i would call that breaking 
ground 
weiner said he interviewed more than 100 people around the 
country and was kneedeep in this before i saw davids work

nine soviet scientists head into the nevada 
desert this weekend to set up their first ussanctioned equipment 
outside the nevada test site to monitor us nuclear explosions 
the soviet team will monitor two nonnuclear explosions that 
will be detonated within 100 miles of reno at the end of the month 
while theyve been to nevada before this is the first time 
they have had virtually unrestricted visas university of 
nevadareno seismologist keith priestly said on thursday its 
quite significant 
the natural resources defense council an american environmental 
group and the institute of physics of the earth under the soviet 
academy of sciences are sponsoring the exchange of soviet and us 
scientists in a cooperative effort they hope will spur a nuclear 
test ban treaty between the two powers 
verification of treaty compliance has been a sticking point 
during negotiations 
scientists know verification is possible but for politicians 
and the average person this seems quite complex nikolai f 
yukhnin the head of the soviet team said at a news conference on 
thursday less than an hour after the united states conducted its 
second announced nuclear test of the year at the nevada test site 
the first explosion the soviets will monitor will take place in 
the black rock desert 90 miles northeast of reno on april 29 and 
will consist of 10 tons of chemical explosive the following day 
15 tons of explosives will be detonated at broken hills about 100 
miles east of reno 
the explosions will be monitored at seismic stations set up 
around the test site 110 miles north of las vegas and at a 
temporary one that will be established next week near deep springs 
calif about midway between reno and las vegas the equipment will 
test the stations capability of monitoring even the smallest us 
nuclear tests 
while the soviet government plays a role in the academy of 
sciences the natural resources defense council is a private 
nonprofit effort this is the first time the us government has 
approved visas for soviet scientists working with the unofficial 
council experiments 
us scientists including priestly were allowed to join their 
soviet counterparts in monitoring three explosions starting in 
september 1986 near the soviet test site

three agreements eliminating tariffs on cars automotive parts and 
more than 130 food products 
the two neighbors began work in 1985 on a wideranging plan to 
unify their economies and create a south american common market 
their project has been slowed by their struggling economies and 
huge foreign debts but progress has been evident 
with the signing of nearly 25 agreements in all trade between 
argentina and brazil jumped from 900 million in 1985 to 15 
billion in 1987 
in addition hundreds of students and professionals from both 
countries now exchange information and work together at longterm 
joint projects in aviation transportation scientific technology 
and agriculture 
for years spanishspeaking argentina with a population 
exceeding 31 million and portuguesespeaking brazil with more 
than 143 million people were archrivals they put aside 
differences to become stronger economically 
sarney in 1985 became brazils first civilian leader after 21 
years of military rule 
alfonsin became president of argentina in december 1983 the 
nations first elected civilian leader following nearly eight years 
of military juntas 
sarney said thursday we are taking new steps in the fruitful 
and promising path of integration we are widening our capability 
to compete in the world we have never had such an excellent 
relationship 
alfonsin arrived in the capital city of brasilia on wednesday 
it is the seventh time in three years the two presidents have met 
during this trip uruguay was also officially incorporated in 
the economic integration after a quick trip by president julio 
maria sanguinetti he met with the other two presidents wednesday 
uruguay has taken part in most of the talks between brazil and 
argentina and it was expected to join the economic group 
especially since the three countries share a border 
the nuclear issue has been a touchy subject in the integration 
effort both brazil and argentina in the past two years were 
reported to have developed the technology to enrich uranium a key 
step in building a bomb but both countries say their nuclear 
programs are for peaceful ends 
on friday sarney will take alfonsin to brazils nuclear 
experiment center of aramar outside of sao paulo in the southeast 
last year sarney visited argentinas nuclear installations 
we are ending any suspicions that nuclear development in 
brazil and argentina is not linked to peaceful purposes said 
alfonsin 
added sarney a year ago it was hard to imagine that a 
brazilian president would visit a nuclear plant in argentina 
foreign ministry officials said details were worked out during 
this visit for a future nuclear accord

a veteran police officer was dismissed 
thursday after a city board found he broke department rules by 
waiting nearly 30 minutes for a key while a 12yearold girl was 
being raped inside an apartment 
james horka was charged with breaking 10 department rules 
stemming from the dec 21 incident 
the police and fire commission found him in violation of five 
rules but dismissed the most serious charge failing to request 
assistance at the scene 
horka said he expected to be cleared of wrongdoing and 
reinstated after an appeal 
i still think i did the right thing he said no one got 
killed 
the disciplinary hearings were begun shortly after the dec 20 
incident in which horka and two other officers responded to a call 
of home invasion 
they waited outside almost 30 minutes with the girls frantic 
mother for the landlord to bring a key rather than breaking in to 
rescue the girl 
a supervisor told him to push the apartment door in if 
necessary horka testified but he did not interpret that as an 
order he maintained that he did not break into the apartment upon 
arriving because he feared the assailant might harm the girl and 
her 10yearold brother 
four officers later broke down the door and arrested the 
assailant police said 
the two officers who accompanied horka also have been scheduled 
for disciplinary hearings 
horkas attorney thomas tyrrell said immediately after the 
decision was announced that he would seek an administrative review 
of the decision from the cook county circuit courts 
a twothirds majority was required on each violation board 
member guy eveland found horka in violation of eight of the 10 
rules cited chairman edward fitzgerald five board member leroy 
mcginnis one 
the five violations were conduct unbecoming to an officer 
unsatisfactory performance improper filing of a report abuse of 
command and violating departmental rules 
horka a decorated vietnam veteran and 14year veteran of the 
force remained on active duty during the weekslong hearing 
tyrrell said he would ask the courts for reinstatement to the force 
and any pay lost due to any suspension or dismissal

a 30yearold woman who was seized and raped by 
three young men in romes historic center has become a rallying 
point for italian women seeking to be able to walk the streets 
alone at night in safety 
mc as the italian press identifies her has unwittingly 
galvanized a campaign for tougher laws against sexual assault and 
challenged the ageold taboo in italy that women shouldnt be out 
alone after dark 
rome is splendid by day but by night for any woman who 
ventures into the street its only dark and dangerous said tina 
lagostena bassi a leading attorney for womens causes who helped 
represent mc 
in 1986 1149 rapes were reported to police in italy according 
to the latest government statistics but womens groups say many 
more cases go unreported 
none has attracted more public attention than the ordeal of 
mc whose rape march 6 in the heart of the capital and the trial 
of her three attackers has been frontpage news in italian 
newspapers and subject of an editorial in the vaticans daily 
newspaper 
on march 26 two days after her attackers were convicted and 
each sentenced to prison for four years and eight months more than 
100000 people marched through central rome in a demonstration for 
womens rights 
mc appeared on the podium at the end of the rally the biggest 
womens demonstration in the capital since the proabortion marches 
at the end of the 1970s 
we want a society without violence carla passalacqua one 
of the rally organizers said as women of all ages from all parts 
of italy ranging from olive pickers from calabria to computer 
programmers in milan marched past 
were in a very grave situation now she added no woman 
can walk the streets alone at night without fear of being raped 
but today we are saying she should be able to 
according to police and court testimony mc was assaulted by 
three men near piazza navona one of central romes most popular 
squares as she walked home at about 1 am after dinner with 
friends 
the three all in their early 20s were arrested by a policeman 
who happened on the scene the policeman testified that he found 
the three men lined up with their pants down in front of the woman 
who he said was halfnaked on the ground her face bloodied in a 
dark corner 
aw cmon you dont want to arrest us for something like 
this one of the men was quoted by italian media as telling the 
policeman 
mc was taken to a hospital where she was reported as telling 
authorities yes they were raping me two boys were holding me 
by the arms and another was trying to do something with me 
the woman with short dark hair and eyes covered by dark 
sunglasses testified in the trial that she could not remember 
exactly what happened after the men approached her 
the defendants who were described by their families as good 
lawabiding boys gave conflicting testimony one admitted to 
having sex with the woman but all claimed that she had initiated 
the encounter 
the packed courtroom burst into chaos when a defense lawyer 
augusto addamiano said in closing arguments that mc decided to 
accuse the three of rape rather than admit that she was willingly 
performing obscene acts in a public place 
the judge antonino stipo ordered police to clear the courtroom 
as feminists and the defendants relatives screamed at each other 
and at the lawyers 
hours later the judge announced the three were guilty of rape 
performing obscene acts in public and causing injury their lawyers 
have appealed 
this trial was emblematic mrs bassi one of mcs 
lawyers said in an interview its one of so many cases but im 
happy with the attention the trial received in a way its women 
reclaiming their rights to go out alone and do what they want 
the notion that women shouldnt be out on the street alone at 
night was raised by the defendants parents 
what was that woman doing at 130 in the morning walking 
around alone giacomo putti father of one of the three men told 
italian newspapers a respectable person is at home at that hour 
what was she looking for 
when a reporter asked why his son was out so late the father 
responded theyre boys a pizza with friends then they go 
around to have fun 
an editorial in the losservatore romano the vatican newspaper 
criticized the parents for expressing wonder that a woman should 
walk around alone at that hour rather than being upset and 
expressing pain for the crime committed by their sons 
a decade ago the country was shocked by a television documentary 
of a rape trial in latina near rome defense lawyers suggested the 
victim who was brutally raped by four men had asked for it 
the defendants were convicted but given sentences of less than a 
year and granted conditional releases 
the program helped spur a campaign for tougher antirape laws 
but rape is still considered a crime against morals punishable 
by up to 10 years in prison 
a senate panel recently began debate on proposed bills to make 
rape a crime against the person stiffen sentences allow for 
summary trials and permit womens groups to be plaintiffs in rape 
cases

india sent its soldiers to this small 
island nation with a declaration of noble intentions to end a 
murderous ethnic war supervise a peace accord then get out 
that was eight months ago 
the killings have not stopped the biggest tamil rebel group 
quickly reneged on the indianarranged peace accord and the indian 
peacekeeping force of 3000 soldiers has swelled to more than 
50000 
tamil rebels seeking autonomy or independence for their ethnic 
minority on the island once known as ceylon are still massacring 
civilians from the sinhalese majority and recently started turning 
their guns axes and arson torches on the previously unthreatened 
moslem minority 
in addition as direct or indirect results of the accord tamils 
are killing fellow tamils sinhalese are killing fellow sinhalese 
and some young moslems are taking up arms against tamils 
there appears to be a strange paradox here the intensity of 
the violence being directly proportional to the increase in the 
number of indian troops the independent newspaper the island 
said in a recent editorial 
it is time that every citizen of this country told the indians 
that if they cannot do their jobs fast enough they got to get out 
and leave our problems to us 
but defenders of the peace accord say it still offers the best 
if not the only hope for ending ethnic mayhem on a beautiful 
island that was building a booming tourist industry until 1983 
that was the year militant tamils chafing under economic and 
political domination by the sinhalese exploded their cause into a 
guerrilla war that has now claimed more than 8000 lives 
we couldnt have done anything different said gamini 
dissanayake sri lankas minister of land development and a key 
negotiator of the accord 
for the first time he said the accord specifically and 
publicly provided a solid understanding that the 
sinhalesedominated government would share power with the tamils a 
concept that he said was just an abstraction in the past 
the accord guarantees some autonomy to the tamils provided the 
rebels surrender their arms 
however the sinhalese who make up 75 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people fear the accord makes too many concessions to the 
tamils who account for 18 percent of the population 
an underground organization of ultranationalist sinhalese has 
assassinated at least 150 people who supported the accord or were 
prominent members of president junius r jayewardenes united 
national party 
the largest tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam are engaged in internecine warfare with smaller tamil 
guerrilla groups that support the peace accord 
moslems who comprise about 7 percent of sri lankas population 
became targets of tamil rebels trying to dominate the eastern 
province where the population is about equally divided among 
tamils sinhalese and moslems 
both the tamils and the sinhalese are descendents of people who 
migrated from india centuries ago but most tamils are hindus most 
sinhalese are buddhists and they speak different languages the 
moslems trace their religion and ancestry to arab seafarers 
apart from the continuing violence there is also a feeling that 
time is running out to enforce the peace accord 
under sri lankas constitution the 82yearold jayewardene has 
just 10 months left in office and cannot run again unless he 
pushes through an amendment or a new interpretation of his tenure 
he president jayewardene is about the only man who can put 
an end to the situation said national security minister lalith 
athulathmudali 
jayewardenes own cabinet is divided over the implementation of 
the accord and the indian military presence although the 
ministers public remarks tend to be fairly circumspect their 
views are wellknown and can be measured by the bodyguards around 
them 
a dozen men guard the corridor leading to the office used by 
dissanayake point man in the efforts at reconciliation and 
therefore a top target for assassination by extremists in his own 
sinhalese community the more hawkish athulathmudali has only a 
single guard in sight at his official residence 
jn dixit the indian high commissioner or ambassador who 
once moved freely around colombo with a single bodyguard now has 
what he calls my rather embarrassing contingent of five gunmen 
dixit a career diplomat maintained that india did not take on 
more than it could handle in sri lanka 
he said prime minister rajiv gandhis government in new delhi 
considered various things that might go wrong with the accord 
including the tamil rebels refusal to surrender arms 
apart from its regional role as south asias geographic and 
military giant india was drawn into sri lanka by pressure from its 
own politically powerful tamil minority of 60 million 
by the indian governments account about 400 indian soldiers 
have died in sri lanka since the stillunfinished oct 10 offensive 
to disarm the tamil tigers

after quarrels with the tax collector 
swedens favorite theatrical sons have come home 
max von sydow is back on the swedish stage after a 14year 
absence director ingmar bergman who lived in selfimposed exile 
for several years also is rehearsing a new play 
both bergman whose brooding introspective films in the 1950s 
and 60s gave swedish film an international reputation and von 
sydow swedens most durable actor left the country because of tax 
problems 
von sydow who lives in paris but comes back every year for 
summer vacation never thought of himself as an expatriate and has 
returned twice to make films 
im still totally swedish he said i still have my roots 
here 
swedish taxes among the highest in the world are driving young 
artists away he said in an interview the average swede pays half 
his salary in taxes and marginal tax on top incomes can run as 
high as 78 percent 
a lot of talent is not used in this country because of this 
if you dont get anything financially out of it why work here 
said von sydow 58 
among his 40 foreign film roles are the jesuit priest in the 
exorcist the assassin in three days of the condor and the 
artisthusband in woody allens hannah and her sisters he 
launched his career abroad in 1965 as jesus in the greatest story 
ever told 
von sydow left sweden in a huff in 1973 after paying what he 
said was an unfairly large tax bill he was assessed 20050 for 
allegedly underpaying his taxes his lawyers took the case to the 
european human rights commission in 1985 claiming that the lack of 
an appeal mechanism against the tax authorities was an infringement 
of his rights last year the swedish government settled out of 
court repaying him 33333 compensation and 20000 for costs 
von sydow said he is trying to put the tax affair behind him 
without bitterness 
im trying not to be poisoned by paranoia he said today 
i feel freer than when i left because this problem is solved and 
because i know that if i want to i could work abroad all the time 
his ties to his country are stronger than others have shown 
once hollywood made stars of greta garbo and ingrid bergman they 
were gone from sweden for good 
von sydow is playing at the royal dramatic theater where he 
began his acting career 40 years ago and where he met bergman with 
whom he did 11 films 
he said one reason for returning to the stage was fascination 
with the character he was offered in master olof an 1871 drama 
by august strindberg swedens greatest literary figure 
he plays a roguish revolutionary during the 16thcentury swedish 
reformation its a supporting role but von sydow said he doesnt 
care its the best part in the play he said 
he said he also was drawn by the double anniversary of the royal 
theaters 200th year and the 80th year since it moved to its gilded 
waterfront building now a city landmark 
working in the swedish language again is wonderful its 
exciting he said its still very difficult for me to act in 
english and it always will be it takes a longer time to 
really make the lines your own 
last year von sydow who does three projects a year finished 
pelle the conqueror his first swedishlanguage film in five

one of europes most talked about 
new art museums is a pastoral island that boasts rembrandts roman 
ruins and a resident sculptor who fires cannon salutes to mother 
nature 
hombroich island is a quiet cultural oasis in the heart of west 
germanys most heavily industrialized area 
art and nature come together at hombroich says karlheinz 
mueller a wealthy businessman who owns the erft river island 
about nine miles west of duesseldorf 
hombroich is timeless it doesnt really have a purpose 
because it is not static nature constantly changes as will the 
collection says mueller a 51yearold university dropout and 
admirer of eastern philosophy 
hombroich is the home of muellers private collection of 
rembrandt etchings paul cezanne watercolors sculptures by 
constantin brancusi and alberto giacometti lovis corinth 
portraits african masks ancient cambodian idols and prehistoric 
pottery 
the island has also been the site of openair concerts by such 
worldfamous classical musicians as violinist pinchas zukerman and 
pianist svyatoslav richter 
muellers property is also an archaelogical treasure 
experts say the ruins of two roman villas lie beneath the soil 
and there is also evidence of one of the earliest stone age 
settlements in nnorthern europe 
the exhibition buildings are reached by labyrinthine paths that 
lead visitors past shrubs and trees transplanted from such faraway 
places as japan and iran hombroichs resident waterfowl float near 
a foot bridge spanning the river 
ruminating on the links between art and nature is a favored 
preoccupation of mueller and has led him to adopt some 
unconventional art principles 
he rejects the conventional practice of installing 
climatecontrol systems as a means of preserving his valuable 
collection 
the pictures must have a chance to have their own lives just 
like us humans mueller said in a telephone interview 
what would be better for a human being to live in an 
airconditioned room for 1000 years or to live normally besides 
paintings can live hundreds of years without climate control 
mueller also shuns the normal museum practice of hanging plaques 
near artworks to identify their creator and titles he says signs 
would be a distraction 
like hombroichs lush vegetation works of art also sprout grow 
and bloom on muellers 42 acres of erft river property 
sculptor anatol herzfeld works nearly every day inside a shed on 
the banks of the erft producing wooden and metal objects that are 
scattered about the island and blend with the landscape 
he periodically fires grass and flower seeds from his 
handbuilt scrapmetal cannon in what he calls a symbolic salute 
to nature 
since the island first opened in may 1987 tens of thousands of 
people have visited including artists musicians and intellectuals 
who mueller says are enchanted as much by the serene setting as by 
the art collection 
visitors pay about 9 to visit the island but mueller says 
profit is not his primary motive 
a speculator in industrial real estate he purchased the erft 
river property in 1982 as a home for his expanding art collection 
he chose hombroich island after a long search 
you look for years for the right property to do something 
special and suddenly you find it it was the law of chance says 
mueller who refuses to say how much the property cost 
mueller hired noted german sculptor irwin heerich to design 
hombroichs cubist art pavilions 
gotthard graubner a prominent west german painter whose work is 
also among the hombroich collection advises mueller on his art 
purchases 
another important partner for mueller is bernhard korte a 
landscape gardener who helped transform hombroich from a jungle of 
wild undergrowth 
mueller went into business for himself in 1958 after quitting 
university because formal studying makes me nervous 
i started out with zero money he says it took 10 years 
until i was able to buy my first art piece i bought what i liked 
you buy and buy and buy and suddenly you have a lot of paintings 
mueller says his purchase of hombroich island means that his art 
collection will be evolving in new directions which he himself 
cant yet imagine 
at first i had a collection it grew now i have an island 
where everything has its own importance the collection nature 
and the buildings he says 
you do your work and it changes with what you feel is right

director mark lamos returned from moscow 
with an intelligence report for other americans who plan to stage 
plays in the soviet union dont underestimate the audience 
the audience is much maligned by many of the theater artists 
because they feel the audience is uncritical is too pleased by too 
many things said lamos artistic director of the hartford stage 
co 
theyre pleased by bad theater by mediocre theater by good 
theater by brilliant theater theyll go to all of it he said 
last month lamos became the first american to direct an 
american play in the land of glasnost in staging his production of 
eugene oneills desire under the elms at the 1000seat 
pushkin theater in moscow he also learned other lessons about the 
soviet unions actors theater technicians designers directors 
and playwrights 
they may help three other american theater artists planning 
trips to moscow through the theatre international exchange service 
of new york nagel jackson of the mccarter theatre in princeton 
nj des mcanuff of the lajolla playhouse in california and 
adrian hall of trinity repretory in providence ri 
i cant tell you what it was like to have a 24hour difference 
between watching my play in moscow the night before i left and 
being here for the second preview of richard nelsons play said 
lamos who recently opened nelsons principia scriptoriae at 
the hartford stage co 
the difference was that there you felt a sort of unified 
leaning forward and hunger for this lamos said here you look 
around the comfortable theater setting people are listening 
yes but there are some empty seats at the preview legs are 
crossed arms are folded people are waiting to be grabbed 
but why lamos wondered shouldnt american audiences wait to be 
grabbed in what he referred to as the grabbiest place in the 
world with thousands of stimulants from the 32cable channels 
to the video thing they can rent to just life in america 
those stimulants are hard to find in the soviet union where 
audiences come eager to hear whats going on in the world eager 
to be moved or eager to be preached to frankly politically 
the one play he saw in the soviet union that wasnt overtly 
political was his production of desire under the elms lamos 
said everything on their stage is political now in a very open 
and very critical way but it still seems like its 20 years old 
lamos described himself as a collaborative director who 
wants to hear the views of actors designers lighting directors 
and sound engineers 
i rely on the people i work with he said 
lamos had good working relations with soviet designers 
costumers and other behind the scenes people they i thought 
were real artists he said 
however it was impossible to have the same collaborative effort 
with soviet actors he said because they have not yet developed a 
sense of mutual trust 
lamos said the pushkin company needs massive restructuring and 
its artistic director yuri yeremin is working toward that goal 
however the socialist idea of tenure for the artists has 
crippled the soviet theater for the most part he said it is 
carrying a lot of baggage they would like to lose 
lamos said he was asked by many in soviet theater how the 
american theater is structured how we structure work how we 
treat the actors how we pay the playwrights how we pay directors 
they are intrigued by the idea that americans can pull 
together an ensemble company in five weeks of rehearsal and not 
two years of rehearsal for a company of 15 while the other 75 
members of the company are stil getting a weekly salary while 
youre rehearsing and theyre sitting home he said 
i think my way of working was as much a mystery to them as 
their way of working was as interesting to me

miep gies the woman who helped hide the frank 
family from the nazis says it was a long time before she could 
bring herself to read the diary of anne frank even though it 
was she who saved it 
mr frank always said to me miep read it read it and i 
said no i cant because i was in fear of what id read said 
mrs gies in halting english but after the second edition i 
finally read it but only when im alone 
then there grow up something it was as if anna come into 
me i heard her cry she was with me she was here in here she 
said touching her heart her eyes welling up with tears for im 
so very very happy 
mrs gies is the author of her own book anne frank 
remembered written with alison leslie gold it is the basis of 
the tv movie the attic the hiding of anne frank airing next 
sunday on cbs 
in a tender scene in the movie young jan gies suggests to miep 
that marriage will keep her from being deported to her native 
austria from germanoccupied holland 
all we need do is find a handsome intelligent charming 
gentleman of dutch birth sound of mind and body financially 
solvent with a fairly promising future in his chosen profession 
offering you comfort and security in your twilight years says 
jan played by huub stapel 
mrs gies 79 was joined by her 82yearold husband at a recent 
news conference they agreed that the scene as well as the rest of 
the movie was quite accurate 
they were joined by mary steenburgen who portrays mrs gies 
the movie also stars paul scofield in a rare television appearance 
playing otto frank mrs gies an employee of frank helped hide 
his family and four other people in the attic above their offices 
for more than two years until the group was discovered by the 
nazis 
anne died in a concentration camp but her father survived and 
later published the diary anne kept while in hiding it became one 
of the most powerful antiwar statements ever written it was mrs 
gies who preserved annes diary and gave it to otto frank after the 
war 
mrs gies said she never had any desire to write a book because 
she felt nothing could be more eloquent than the diary but she was 
convinced by gold that a history should be written of what it was 
like in amsterdam outside the attic during that time 
you must understand mrs gies said it was very painful 
for us but after many difficult we gave her the information for 
that reason 
lisa jacobs plays the bright mischievous anne for whom 
imprisonment in the attic was especially difficult mrs gies 
fondly recalled anne as a very charming child lively but very 
curious 
she always ask us and ask us what happen outside after a 
while my husband tell me you must not tell her all the terrible 
things because it is terrible enough to be in hiding but she 
always ask in a different way until she get the answer she want 
and i lost 
mrs gies praised jacobs portrayal she did it very good 
steenburgen she said played her the way i looked to myself no 
panic in a difficult situation she was right she was me 
the movie is from director john erman and screenwriter william 
hanley who teamed on one of the best tv movies of last season 
when the time comes erman also directed who will love my 
children and an early frost hanleys credits include the 
screenplay something about amelia 
rather than focusing on life in the attic the movie portrays 
the courage of dutch citizens who defied the nazis mrs gies 
insisted there was nothing especially heroic about what she did 
we only did our human duty help people who need help but 
there were heroes she said the eight people in hiding 
i can say out of my heart i am so happy that i could give the 
diary to mr frank and mr frank could give the diary to the 
world that was good

one of the worlds most enchanting cities 
was founded 15 centuries ago by frightened citizens who sought 
refuge among its 118 islets in the gulf of venice from the 
southward invasion of lombards 
now their 20thcentury descendents are fleeing in the other 
direction heading back north to the italian mainland and 
abandoning their lagoon city in the northern adriatic sea to hordes 
of tourists and real estate speculators 
venice has become too expensive for its natives and those still 
left say it is losing its soul 
as venetians flee the city is trying desperately to save itself 
from high tides floods polluted canals erosion and decay 
after spending hundreds of millions of dollars provided by 
special national legislation planners have come up with plans 
after 20 years of striving for movable dikes and sophisticated 
sewers to stop the lagoons greenblack waters from doing further 
damage 
the initiative to do something took root after a disastrous 
flood in 1966 and the cry of save venice went up art lovers 
from around the world pitched in to rescue palaces churches and 
paintings from the annual high tides 
but no one came up with a save the venetians campaign and 
most descendents of one of the worlds most glorious republics 
dont live in palaces on the grand canal 
they can put up with stench from garbage and refuse in the 
canals which also serve as sewers and the winter floods even 
the summer floods of tourists 
it is the lack of affordable housing thats forcing venices 
proud sealoving natives to the italian mainland 
alarmed by the loss of regular customers the citys bakers 
organized a conference this winter to discuss the exodus 
a report prepared by a provincial agency informed the bakers 
that in 1951 venice had 175000 people the most ever in modern 
times last year the number was down to 83000 and about onefifth 
of those are older than 60 
the report predicted by the year 2015 venice could have only 
20000 permanent residents 
if we go ahead at this rate theyll be zero said giuliano 
zanon a venetian who wrote the report 
butcher shops grocery stores carpenters and plumbers have been 
closing along the citys narrow zigzagging streets popping up 
everywhere sometimes four five or six to a street are shops 
selling nothing but carnival masks in gold ceramic wood 
facesized and pocketsized as souvenirs of the mardi gras 
festivities that pack the city with outsiders every winter 
the mask shops have become a symbol for venetians who say the 
loss of the citys natives is robbing venice of something just as 
precious as its classic paintings and its mosaicstudded byzantine 
basilica ceilings 
venices soul is emptying out its becoming a disneyland a 
spiritually poor one said gianluigi casini an architect who has 
helped restore canalside palaces dating back to the 7thcentury 
beginning of rule by the doges 
when i was a boy all the kids would be playing in the 
piazzas now there are few kids said casini who at 34 is one of 
a dwindling number of young venetians 
only old people stay those who cant go away there are so 
many empty houses yet most of my friends have gone for 
lack of houses 
he lives with his parents in santa croce one of venices six 
historic districts 
some of casinis friends married or pursuing professions moved 
to mestre on the other side of the 25mile causeway going out of 
venice 
mestre which had about 50000 people when casini was born now 
serves as a bedroom for a few thousand people who commute to venice 
to work as hotel maids souvenir sellers and waiters its 
population now is about 250000 triple that of venices historic 
center 
casini is thinking about moving 
id like to stay but its just not possible 
casini who supplements his architects earning by teaching art 
history in a mestre high school explained that he cant afford 
venices rents which are the lire equivalent of 675 to 975 a 
month for a tworoom apartment 
by law apartments should rent for far less under the citys 
rentcontrol program but as elsewhere in italy landlords prefer 
to keep apartments vacant hoping for a foreigner or an italian rich 
enough to pay illegal high rents 
a nighttime ride down the grand canal turns up many darkened 
apartments some belong to foreigners or the rich who come from 
milan 165 miles away for vacations or weekends 
many other houses are in no shape to live in waters lapping at 
the front door and sea breezes drifting by the balcony may inspire 
poetry but flooding and salty air constantly erode foundations and 
beams 
restoration especially of historic buildings is more costly in 
venice chiefly because supplies must come by barge or by porters 
who handle small loads on carts in carless venice

in the last few years however some young venetians have taken 
advantage of governmentsubsidized mortgages to buy properties and 
the city has bought many buildings to rent out 
but the city cant buy all the houses mayor casellati said 
not all venetians are planning to leave 
gianfranco tagliapietra who runs a camera shop said his 
teenage daughter is looking forward to making money in the tourist 
business when shes old enough 
because of the exodus of venetians skilled laborers must be 
brought in from the mainland 
to restore a house you have to sell a house is a venetian 
byword 
at the same time the easy spending of tourists drives up prices 
for goods in stores 
for example natives complain that a pair of shoes that sell for 
50000 lire 42 in mestre are twice that in venice fruit and 
vegetables generally cost about 30 percent more in venice than in 
the pricier neighborhoods of rome 
its the middle class thats going away said mayor antonio 
casellati 
if someone comes back its the rich 
disappearing with the exodus is the venice of old when 
everybody knew everybody else casellati added 
in the old days a doge would live next to a poor person 
venices classes were all mixed together all this is being lost 
even some of venices gondoliers live in mestre 
zanon who wrote the report on the declining population said 
exodus that is siphoning off people has an ironic twist it began 
because the city was too crowded 
if the city had a plan they could have done something he 
said but they didnt do anything 
after the 1966 flood tourism took off perhaps inspired by the 
worry that venice some day might be swamped for good by the tides 
by the 1970s real estate speculators started to move in 
betting that the tourism boom would last it became fashionable for 
big name companies like fiat to restore palaces for headquarters 
banquets or exhibitions 
we venetians are at our limits to transmit culture we are 
outnumbered by tourists zanon said my daughter doesnt even 
speak venetian a dialect more lilting than a gondoliers song 
the sadness about venice he added is not the pollution 
or decay its the politicians who dont do anything 
the mayor said hed like to see a law that would force 
realestate buyers to live in what they bought or rent their 
properties for several years only to venetians but he acknowledges 
that might be impossible in a freemarket society 
in the last few years however some young venetians have taken 
advantage of governmentsubsidized mortgages to buy properties and 
the city has bought many buildings to rent out 
but the city cant buy all the houses mayor casellati said 
not all venetians are planning to leave

many of the nations major retailers have notched healthy sales 
gains in march while the stock market wavered amid a midweek 
advance 
the early easter holiday helped the march retail sales reported 
by major retailers experts said thursday 
but although sales were strong for many including fw 
woolworth co with a 29 percent jump over march 1987 there were 
some exceptions the nations largest retailer sears roebuck and 
co reported its sales rose just 15 percent during the month 
analysts said the stores with lackluster sales suffered from 
general consumer caution 
the shift in the easter calendar should have helped in many 
cases to lift sales but were still in a very sluggish 
environment said thomas tashjian an analyst with the investment 
firm seidler amdec securities inc in los angeles 
consumers have spent cautiously since early last year and 
analysts predict they will remain tightfisted for at least the 
first part of 1988

oil futures prices have edged back above the 
17abarrel level in moderate trading recouping losses recorded 
earlier in the week 
analysts and traders said the market appeared calm thursday 
ahead of an opec committee meeting scheduled to begin this weekend 
in vienna austria even though there have been reports of trader 
nervousness 
contracts for may delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude rose 25 cents per barrel to 1706 
among refined products wholesale heating oil for may delivery 
rose 039 cent a gallon to 4573 cents and wholesale unleaded 
gasoline for may rose 040 cent a gallon to 4882 cents 
longerterm contracts also rose 
we had a very steady and constructive market that continued up 
all day said bob baker senior energy analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the fundamentals look good demand keeps edging up and opec 
is not overproducing he said 
traders and analysts said the sessions buyers included refiners 
who stepped up their purchases as prices inched above the 
17abarrel level 
they saw that the market was getting too high too quickly so 
they speeded up their purchases noted madison galbraith a 
trader at merrill lynch energy futures 
in addition a large money management firm in chicago reportedly 
purchased 3000 may contracts for crude a move that was believed 
to have absorbed much of the selling in the market 
the upcoming opec meeting has not stirred much nervousness among 
traders most believe the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries pricing committee will not take much constructive action 
at the april 9 meeting 
some market participants had hoped the 13nation cartel would

a minnesota entrepreneur hopes a computerized 
sonar device is the answer for illuminating the rearward blind 
spots that plague drivers of bulky trucks and recreational vehicles 
the blindspot scanner which will which cost 400 to 550 
depending on the size of the vehicle using it signals the driver 
when a vehicle slips into the black hole by the back wheels of 
a tractortrailer or other big truck out of sight of the rearview 
mirror 
marketing the vehicle blind spot alert is bill bartodziej of 
edina an insurance salesman whose work made him aware of a need 
for such a device 
many of his clients are truckers who repeatedly have told him of 
problems stemming from cars that move into their blind spot one of 
the most common causes of accidents said bartodziej 47 
when a truck attempts to turn or change lanes with a car in the 
blind spot the results can be fatal for those in the unseen 
vehicle and expensive for the truckers insurer 
the blindspot detector employs sensors are attached to both 
sides of the vehicle and wired to a small computer on a metal box 
fitted below the dash two small red lights placed on top of the 
windshield indicate whether another vehicle is in the blind spot 
the left light blinks on when a car slips into the left blind spot 
and viceversa 
the device also beeps when the turning signal is turned on and a 
vehicle is in the blind spot 
its made me a better driver bartodziej said of the 
demonstration model hes used in his van for several months its 
made me more alert that there are people around me 
motor carriers will be the first big target market for the newly 
formed freeway technology inc based in edina and headed by 
bartodziejs wife he also hopes to sell the device to owners of 
cumbersome campers and to companies that rent moving trucks 
with the patent application still pending bartodziej made his 
first sales at the end of march and put field representatives to 
work in minnesota wisconsin and illinois he plans to embark on a 
national sales effort by august he says 
the detector was developed by david ziembicki of indian valley 
manufacturing of telfore pa bartodziej who knew ziembicki from a 
business contact urged him to tackle the blind spot with some 
technology he was developing in work on an unrelated product 
bartodziej says all test drivers who have tried it would rather 
drive with the detector than without it and one insurance company 
he deals with has indicated an interest in offering lower rates for 
trucks equipped with the detector he says 
we dont endorse any product but we certainly endorse the 
concept said carol bufton president of the minnesota safety 
council 
bufton said her organization still recommends that drivers 
attempt to turn and look for cars that may be in their blind spot

an early easter helped lure consumers into stores in march 
giving many of the nations largest general retailers a respite 
from their sluggish sales of the past year 
but experts dont believe shoppers are on a longterm spending 
spree 
retailers and analysts attributed the strong march sales 
increases at some stores to a quirk in the calendar with easter 
falling earlier in april than usual consumers did their spring 
shopping in march that made comparisons with march 1987 look 
better 
theyre not as good as they appear jeffrey b edelman a 
retailing analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc said of the 
march figures 
among the retailers reporting strong sales was fw woolworth 
co which registered a 29 percent increase over march 1987 sales 
at the other end of the spectrum the nations largest retailer 
sears roebuck and co reported its sales rose just 15 percent 
the lackluster sales resulted from consumers general caution 
said thomas tashjian an analyst with the investment firm seidler 
amdec securities inc in los angeles 
the shift in the easter calendar should have helped in many 
cases to lift sales but were still in a very sluggish 
environment tashjian said 
consumers have spent cautiously since early last year and 
analysts predict they will remain tightfisted for at least the 
first part of 1988 
the rate of spending is crucial to a retailers bottom line but 
economists watch it for signals of the nations economic health 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of the gross national 
product 
apparel retailers continued to have problems because of 
consumers continuing disenchantment with the stores latest lines 
said karen sack an analyst with standard amp poors corp 
sears was among the stores having problems with their fashion 
lines drexels edelman said the retailer said its sales for the 
first nine weeks of the fiscal year rose 19 percent over the same 
period a year earlier 
k mart corp said its sales rose 86 percent last month and 55 
percent so far this year its comparable store sales those from 
stores open at least a year rose 55 percent last month and 26 
percent for the year to date 
rapidlyexpanding walmart stores inc said its sales rose 36 
percent in march and 34 percent so far this year walmarts 
comparable store sales rose 15 percent last month and 14 percent 
for the first two months of fiscal 1988 
jc penney co inc posted a 102 percent sales increase last 
month and a 57 percent yeartodate gain its comparable store 
sales were up 93 percent last month and 49 percent so far this 
year

month and 234 percent so far this year comparable store sales 
rose 105 percent in march and 54 percent for the first nine weeks

march and 65 percent so far this year mays comparable store 
sales rose 79 percent last month and 26 percent yeartodate

after years of thriving on a booming export trade 
it might seem odd for honda motor co ltd to celebrate the first 
arrival here of usbuilt honda automobiles 
but for the company and the domestic economy todays 
celebration over the shipload of 540 hondas built in marysville 
ohio marked more than a simple welcoming party 
for honda the shipment signaled maturity for a company that in 
two decades has transformed itself from a respected motorcycle 
maker into a worldwide maker of attractive cars 
in a broader sense the imported hondas reflected ongoing 
changes in the surprisingly robust japanese economy which is being 
fuled more by domestic demand than because of exports its 
longstanding source of growth 
the tokyo stock exchange has surged back from last octobers 
worldwide crash on thursday the nikkei stock average surpassed its 
previous high which was set on oct 14 the new york and london 
exchange indexes are still about 10 percent below precrash levels 
japans gross national product grew at a vibrant rate estimated 
at 7 percent to 8 percent in the last quarter of fiscal 198788 
which ended march 31 official figures arent yet published most 
analysts expect it to expand at over 4 percent in the new fiscal 
year 
the japanese consumer the same japanese whose propensity to 
save is legendary is changing the car that honda is importing is 
the accord coupe a type of car that hasnt been much favored by 
japanese buyers who traditionally have gone for fourdoor family 
sedans 
but in recent years as the strong yen has greatly increased the 
wealth of some japanese sportier cars have been selling better 
and the honda accord coupe is aimed at that increasing market 
still why not make it in japan 
honda spokesman bret anderson explained this particular car 
the coupe is completely designed and set up by american honda 
with american rampd research and development and engineering so we 
dont have facilities in japan to build it it was built for the 
us market we see the car as an american car 
the company saw the growing demand in japan and thought that 
it probably would sell he said the company predicts sales in 
1988 of the americanmade coupe at 4000 and hopes sales will grow 
to 50000 in 1991 
the japanese domestic car market is the second biggest in the 
world after the united states where japan has an export quota of 
23 million cars a year 
oddly honda sells more cars in the united states about 740000 
last year than in japan about 365000 importing the accord coupe 
is part of the companys drive to increase its domestic market 
share 
the us price for the accord coupe is about 15000 its price 
in japan hasnt been announced 
the japanese economy has spurted ahead on a combination of the 
high yen and some pumppriming undertaken by the japanese 
government last spring when it looked as if 1987 might be a 
recession year 
on thursday the japanese parliament enacted another mildly 
expansionary budget of 567 trillion yen 4536 billion up 48 
percent from the earlier year 
the new budget includes a big increase in public works spending 
up 197 percent at 73 trillion yen 584 billion to keep 
domestic demand high 
a strong factor fueling growth last year was privatesector 
housing investment which leaped 217 percent according to fuji 
bank economists they predicted in early april that the economy 
would expand at a 41 percent rate in fiscal 198889 inflation 
would be only 09 percent and the dollar would average 122 yen 
close to its recent level of 123125 yen 
a projection by the respected okasan research institute 
predicted 45 percent growth the okasan and fuji projections 
agreed that private housing would stall after its hot performance 
in the previous year but that personal spending and corporate 
capital investment would continue to fuel growth 
the okasan think tank said domestic demand would push the 
economy up 56 percent while external demand exports would 
shrink and reduce the economys growth by 11 percent 
okasan expected the trade surplus to drop from 933 billion in 
the past fiscal year to 877 billion and the dollar to average 
124 yen

lucky stores inc has spurned american 
stores cos offer for a 174 billion buyout and says it may 
undergo a major restructuring or sell the company elsewhere 
lucky said thursday its directors unanimously had rejected 
american stores unsolicited 45 a share tender offer as 
inadequate and not in the best interests of the company or its 
stockholders 
the board also rebuffed the offer by american stores a salt 
lake citybased grocery and drugstore chain to increase its bid to 
50 a share in a negotiated acquisition 
in addition dublinbased lucky adopted a stock purchase rights 
defense plan aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively 
expensive 
the rejection of american stores surprise tender offer for 
luckys 386 million outstanding shares came 17 months after lucky 
blocked a hostile takeover attempt by new york investor asher 
edelman 
a combination of the two companies would create the nations 
biggest supermarket chain 
mike holt american stores vice president for investor public 
relations said his company had no comment on the announcement 
luckys stock closed at 5250 per share on the new york stock 
exchange thursday up 375 from wednesdays close 
in addition to rejecting american stores bid luckys board 
also authorized company management and advisers to consider 
alternatives to an american stores buyout to boost its stock price 
alternatives could include a possible reorganization to focus on 
luckys california operations a leveraged recapitalization with 
possible distributions to stockholders by a dividend or share 
repurchase and a negotiated sale of the company to a third party 
we are confident that pursuit of one of these alternatives 
will provide our best opportunity to achieve greater value for our 
stockholders stated john m lillie luckys chairman and chief 
executive officer 
the board also adopted a warrant dividend plan and has declared 
a dividend under the plan of one common stock purchase right for 
each share of outstanding common stock payable to stockholders of 
record on april 8 the plan would act to dilute luckys common 
stock in the event of a hostile takeover making such a move 
prohibitively expensive 
the company stated the plan was aimed at preventing unsolicited 
attempts to acquire a controlling stake in lucky stores through a 
tender offer or on the open market at prices determined by the 
board to be inadequate 
a merger of american stores with 1700 outlets in 40 states 
and lucky would have make lucky the nations largest supermarket 
chain surpassing no 1 kroger co lucky has 480 outlets 340 
within the state 
american stores had indicated it would convert its struggling 
240 alpha beta outlets in california to lucky stores 
american stores last year posted 143 billion in annual sales 
while lucky had 69 billion in sales

safeway stores inc says it suffered a 
4877 million loss last year largely due to interest expenses 
from its 1986 leveraged buyout and to income tax law changes 
the privatelyheld supermarket chain the nations 
secondlargest after cincinnatibased kroger co had posted a 
143 million loss in 1986 safeway also said its revenue fell to 
183 billion last year from 203 billion the previous year 
however safeways operating profit rose to 4483 million from 
4229 million the previous year safeway said 
last years loss was blamed on 5764 million in interest 
expense largely stemming from the leveraged buyout and a 4094 
million bookkeeping charge resulting from the new tax law the 
company said 
safeway believes its interest expenses have peaked and will 
decline over the next few years said the companys controller 
david domeier 
domeier said the company trimmed its longterm debt by 32 
percent to 31 billion in 1987 and is one to two years ahead of 
schedule in paying off its debt 
the drop in revenue was attributed to the sale of several 
divisions including the 105store liquor barn chain and markets in 
britain and four states to raise capital and help pay off the debt 
during the same period sales for us stores grew 5 percent 
domeier said

china in recent years has been losing its 
rural people despite an overall growth in the countrys 
population according to a new statistical report by the 
agriculture department 
in 1982 when china reported a population of more than 101 
billion a record 8039 million or 79 percent lived in rural 
areas by 1985 the total population was more than 104 billion but 
rural residents were down to 6629 million people or 63 percent 
population figures and many others are included in a new edition 
of agricultural statistics of the peoples republic of china 
194986 by frederick w crook and others of the departments 
economic research service 
the new version which was distributed thursday expands greatly 
an earlier statistical report on chinas agriculture issued in 
1984 which was the usdas first since the communists took charge 
in 1949 
although not likely to make this springs bestseller lists the 
158page report is expected to be in great demand from china 
watchers and us agricultural traders interested in that 
potentially huge asian market the first edition in 1984 was 71 
pages long 
the report relies on the important although still incomplete 
agricultural data that chinas state statistical bureau reported 
during 194985 with some updates through 1986 the authors said 
some 126 national and provincial tables of figures are included 
along with an introduction explanatory notes references and 
suggested readings 
various sections include agricultural production inputs 
such as farm machinery fertilizer and labor exports and imports 
and consumption and procurement 
the provincial tables include chinas population by region and 
province agricultural areas by crops hog slaughter horse and 
camel yearend inventory milk production for cows and goats and 
consumption by peasants 
officials said the report may be ordered from superintendent of 
documents us government printing office washington dc 20402

a fierce competition for the worlds soybean 
market has sprung up as demand increases for the highprotein 
oilrich crop that once was dominated almost entirely by the united 
states 
soybeans have the potential to supplement diets of lowincome 
people in the third world where it will be important to gain 
consumer acceptance for soybeans and soyfortified foods gary 
vocke an agriculture department analyst said thursday in a new 
report 
a historical view shows that us dominance of world soybean 
trade founded on us research and development in the 1940s and 
1950s declined in the 1980s as south american countries spurred 
by high prices developed largescale production and processing 
facilities he said 
brazil and argentina have been the main us competitors in the 
international soybean market 
vocke an agriculture and trade analyst in the departments 
economic research service added their success mainly in 
temperate areas has not been duplicated in tropical areas 
elsewhere in the third world 
the major factors behind the increased demand for soybeans in 
the third world he said are rising incomes and population growth 
as families have more to spend their demand increases for meat and 
other food products such as margarine and cooking oil 
fierce export competition with the south americans for these 
markets as well as the developed country market will likely 
continue vocke said the expansion of largescale soybean 
production in south america will continue as long as soybean prices 
are high enough for brazilian farmers to profitably open new lands 
for soybeans 
further encouragement would be in the brazilian governments 
willingness to develop the rural transportation system connecting 
the new lands to ocean ports he said 
if the price of soybeans is high relative to other crops 
farmers in brazil argentina and elsewhere will find it profitable 
to switch even more of their existing cropland to soybeans vocke 
said

foreigners continue to own just under 1 
percent of us agricultural land slightly more than the level of 
a year ago according to an agriculture department report 
the departments economic research service said thursday its 
1987 yearend review of reports under the agricultural foreign 
investment disclosure act found 125 million acres of agricultural 
land in foreign hands 202000 acres more than reported in 1986 
of the land owned by foreign interests 50 percent was forest 
land 17 percent cropland 28 percent pasture and other 
agricultural land and 5 percent used for nonagricultural purposes 
or unreported 
corporations held 80 percent of the foreignowned land with the 
balance held by individuals partnerships institutions and other 
entities 
as in the past much of the ownership is concentrated in the 
united kingdom canada west germany the netherlands antilles and 
switzerland those countries combined to account for 69 percent of 
the foreignheld acreage the agency said 
maine continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign

share prices rose friday when british commercial 
banks heeded a bank of england signal to cut their base lending 
rate 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index rose 126 
points or 07 percent to 17736 at midday

2619 million shares at the same time thursday 
the commercial banks announced a cut in their base lending rate 
by half a percentage point to 8 percent the lowest level in more 
than a decade 
the banks cut the benchmark rate effective monday after the 
central bank reduced its own money market rate by 0375 percnet to 
8 percent apparently to stem the british pounds advance 
thats what we want some more good news like that said one 
dealer referring to the reduced interest rates it should be 
just the tonic the market needs to take it higher 
the dealer said the market had been sluggish all morning held 
back in part by major new share issues by tate and lyle plc to help 
finance a tender offer for staley continental inc of the united 
states and a huge issue announced by barclays bank plc on thursday 
other dealers were more wary of the benefits to equities from 
the interest rate cuts saying the lower rates revive fears of 
inflationary pressures on britains economy 
one dealer also noted that the pound failed to show marked 
reaction shortly after the rate cut was announced dampening the 
positive sentiment in the equity market

britains major commercial banks heeding a signal 
from the bank of england announced friday a cut in their base 
lending rate by half a percentage point to 8 percent the lowest 
level in more than a decade 
midland bank plc national westminster bank plc barclays bank 
plc and lloyds bank plc cut the benchmark rate effective monday 
after the central bank reduced its own money market rate by 0375 
percent to 8 percent apparently to stem the british pounds 
advance 
the base rate cut brought the rate to its lowest level since it 
stood at 75 percent in april 1978 the banks said 
the banks last cut the rate by half a point on march 17 
prime minister margaret thatchers government has been concerned 
about the strength of the pound against the west german mark since 
early march the pound has been buoyed by britains relatively high 
interest rates which make pounddenominated investments more 
attractive stimulating demand for the currency 
a stronger pound could hurt britains exports and corporate 
profits 
however there have been concerns that rate cuts would spur 
inflation which is running at a modest 33 percent 
mrs thatcher repeatedly has said that reining in inflation is 
her top economic priority 
better commercial borrowers generally obtain loans at 1 
percentage point above the base rate

united auto workers bargainers have 
received their marching orders win for chrysler corp employees 
the same pay benefits and job protections enjoyed by their 
counterparts at the top two automakers 
the uaws chrysler council wrapped up a twoday strategy session 
here thursday and voted to seek a return to labor parity between 
the no 3 automaker and its larger rivals general motors corp and 
ford motor co 
since 1979 the unions chrysler contract has expired at 
different times than the ford and gm pacts because the chrysler 
contract was reopened several times for companysaving concessions 
but the uaw will insist on a twoyear contract with chrysler so 
all three pacts will expire together in 1990 adding to workers 
bargaining power at a time when they will need it most because of 
the growing number of japaneseowned factories building cars in the 
united states 
there might be a wiggle here or there that will be different 
but the principles will be the same uaw vice president marc 
stepp said we are ready to do battle for justice economically 
and socially with the chrysler corporation 
chryslers uaw contract expires sept 14 talks normally would 
begin in midjuly but the uaw and chrysler agreed to start early 
after chryslers attempt to sell its acustar inc parts subsidiary 
ignited angry uaw opposition and left behind a bitter residue 
the bargaining is set to begin april 18 in detroit 
we will take the pattern agreement and as closely as possible 
fits those provisions to the chrysler agreement stepp said 
the chrysler council represents 59500 active and 8000 laidoff 
workers members of 49 uaw locals 
the council also voted nearly unanimously to accept some former 
american motors corp workers into their fold under a compromise 
that ended days of potentially divisive debate 
chrysler bought amc last august and announced last fall it will 
close a 5500worker assembly plant in kenosha wis leaving 1000 
workers at a kenosha engine plant and a milwaukee parts 
distribution center to either bargain with chrysler on their own or 
come under the national contract 
the soontobelaidoff assembly plant workers will be covered 
under a separate plant closing agreement and will not join the 
unions chrysler council 
local leaders who did not want to admit the 1000 kenosha 
workers said they feared the former amc workers whose seniority 
averages 1820 years would take jobs that otherwise might go to 
laidoff chrysler workers 
under the compromise the kenosha workers unlike other chrysler 
workers will not be able to take their seniority with them if 
their plant closes or use their seniority to take openings in other 
plants ahead of workers already on layoff 
we werent looking for that anyway we were looking to be 
covered under the same wages hours and working conditions that all 
other chrysler workers get said rudy kuzel chairman of local 72 
at kenosha 
we know that chrysler wants to close four plants in the 
detroit area and it would be presumptuous of us to expect to move 
into other plants with our seniority kuzel said 
local 72 president ed steagall called the approval a miracle 
because of heated behindthescenes wrangling over the issue since 
before delegates began arriving tuesday 
the unions elected 10member rankandfile bargaining committee 
will have to negotiate both the demands package and the inclusion 
of the kenosha workers with chrysler in the talks 
last fall the uaw won contracts with ford and gm that forbade 
layoffs for any reason except slow sales banned plant closings not 
announced before negotiations and limited the top two automakers 
ability to shift work to outside suppliers or to their own plants 
in other countries including canada and mexico

king fahd has called for 
solidarity among members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries to bolster the target price of 18 a barrel 
the official saudi press agency reported 
if this is achieved then there will be immense benefits and 
the prices of oil will always be on the increase he told college 
students thursday night while on inspection tour of the alqasseem 
region some 200 miles north of here 
the saudi monarch attributed the instability of oil prices to 
attempts by some to sell at discount prices and expressed hope 
that adherence will be strict to production and price rulings laid 
down by the 13nation opec 
he affirmed that the kingdom has never at any time violated 
any agreement related to oil thus adding yet another official 
denial to ongoing reports that saudi arabia was also violating opec 
prices and selling at a discount because of the weak market 
fahd did not name any of the member states of the opec cartel 
that he accused of cheating on the rulings laid by opec for more 
than a year and designed to strengthen oil prices around an 18 
dollars for benchmark crude 
at saudi arabias request the fivemember opec pricing 
committee is meeting in vienna on saturday to consider ways and 
means of firming up the world markets flagging prices 
fahds call for solidarity among opec member states was 
apparently aimed at preempting outbursts of interopec criticism 
to help the vienna gathering formulate the proper recommendations 
on thursday iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh accused 
saudi arabia of trying to destabilize the oil market by not 
agreeing to have the vienna meeting held at an earlier date 
he said that saudi arabia blocked a call three months ago by 
iran to have the pricing committee convene committee members are 
oil ministers of saudi arabia mexico venezuela nigeria and 
algeria 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer will be in vienna after calling 
on two major nonopec oil producers mexico and britain seeking 
their cooperation in helping stabilize the market by restraining 
their output 
saudi arabia is the leading member of the cartel and alone 
possesses at least onefifth of the worlds proven oil reserves 
fahd stressed this point in his address saying that the kingdom 
now is one of the major countries with reserves in the ground 
that can suffice it for 200 years according to the estimates of 
world experts

general motors corp which helped persuade the 
government to reduce its car fuel economy regulations for each of 
the last three model years has again called for the repeal or 
reduction of the rules 
the no 1 automaker said in a statement thursday the corporate 
average fuel economy standards are a disadvantage for fullline 
manufacturers that should be repealed or amended 
without some action gm said it could be subject to civil 
penalties in the hundreds of millions of dollars and may be 
forced to close plants or severely restrict product offerings to 
remain in compliance 
gm and other automakers were successful in efforts to win 
reduced cafe standars in 1986 1987 and 1988 the government had 
set a fleetwide goal of 275 miles per gallon for 1988 models but 
agreed to lower it to 26 mpg 
gm anticipates compliance with the reduced level in 1988 but 
the standard is scheduled to return to 275 mpg in 1989 model year 
the company has said it might fail to meet cafe regulations in 
1989 if gasoline prices remain stable or continue falling stable 
gas prices have made the less fuelefficient six and 
eightcylinder cars more attractive to consumers 
companies are allowed to borrow credits from past and future 
years in which they have exceeded or expect to exceed the standard 
as a way to reduce current noncompliance 
gm is asking the government to reduce retroactively the 1985 
model year standard to 26 mpg from 275 mpg which would give the 
company credit to offset any 1989 shortfalls other auto companies 
are doing the same

specialist firms that control the rights to 
trade specific issues on the new york stock exchange will have to 
meet tough new capital requirements under the big boards latest 
postcrash proposal 
the capital plan approved thursday by the nyse board is the 
latest in a series of steps taken to strengthen the market in the 
wake of wall streets october crash 
the securities and exchange commission now must consider the 
plan 
perrin long who follows the securities industry industry for 
lipper analytical securities corp said the new proposal appears 
mainly designed to bolster confidence in the marketplace he said 
it may help keep trading orderly but would not prevent another 
severe decline 
richard torrenzano a spokesman for the nyse confirmed that 
the vast majority of the specialists can meet the proposed new 
requirements today 
long said the new requirements could lead to more consolidation 
among specialists 
the exchange currently has 54 specialist firms which control 
the rights to market the stocks of the 1650plus companies listed 
on the exchange specialists are required to keep order in the 
market by setting opening prices and covering trades when there are 
not enough buyers or sellers 
the specialist system came under scrutiny in the days following 
the oct 19 crash because of reports that some specialists failed 
to fulfill their roles during the market turmoil some specialist 
firms merged with bigger firms or had to give up their roles 
because of shattering financial damage suffered in the crash 
since the crash five stock specialists have agreed voluntarily 
to give up their roles as market makers on the exchange 
under the proposed changes a specialist firm must show it can 
meet with its own liquid assets a minimum capital requirement of 
1 million or be able to buy 15000 shares of each common stock in 
which it makes a market whichever is greater 
the rules currently require minimum capital of 100000 or the 
ability to buy 5000 shares in each stock in which the specialist 
makes a market 
john j phelan jr chairman and chief executive of the 
exchange said one question asked repeatedly since the crash has 
been would the condition of the market during the week of oct 
19 have been better than it was if specialists had more capital 
the simple answer was no and the brady commission agreed 
with that conclusion phelan said referring to the presidential 
commission that investigated the causes of the crash 
but phelan said the crash and subsequent volatility of the stock 
market served to underscore the need for strengthening the 
specialist system and he said the proposed changes were an 
appropriate interim step to be taken now to bolster confidence in 
it 
he said other measures concerning the adequacy of the 
specialists capital requirements are under review 
among other postcrash steps the exchange has announced 
previously was a curb on computerized program trading which takes 
effect when the dow jones industrial average moves 50 points in 
either direction from the previous days close in one session 
that curb was activated for the first time on wednesday when the 
dows rise surpassed 50 points in the last hour of trading the dow 
finished with a gain of 6416 points for the day 
the exchange has also announced it has begun taking steps to 
improve its ability to handle heavy trading volumes

midday its yield which moves inversely to its price fell to 873

stabilization thereby strengthening the dollar and pushing bond

leads with 3 grafs to update with arraignment picks up in 4th 
graf george cook 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a fired merrill lynch broker accused of fatally 
shooting his former boss who was chased from his office and 
pistolwhipped in front of about 60 company workers was ordered 
held on 500000 bail today 
lonnie gilchrist 41 of boston did not offer a plea at his 
arraignment in boston municipal court judge peter donovan ordered 
his case continued until april 19 said court clerk russell long 
gilchrist had complained of racial discrimination but was fired 
because of poor performance a newspaper quoted sources as 
saying 
george cook 56 a senior vice president and 31year merrill 
lynch employee was meeting with gilchrist when he was shot 
thursday said patrick murphy national director of security for 
merrill lynch 
cook then fled into the main office and gilchrist chased him for 
about 30 feet beating him on the head with the 22 caliber pistol 
until cook collapsed witnesses said at that point murphy said 
mr gilchrist pumped more shots into him while he was on the 
floor 
cook was hit in the chest back arm and side with four of a 
total of nine bullets fired murphy said 
after cook collapsed in the 36thfloor downtown office three 
workers wrestled gilchrist to the floor 
i dont know what went on between them said merrill lynch 
vice president paul knouse of the meeting between cook and 
gilchrist george wasnt able to say much i think he was already 
in shock 
gilchrist a graduate of the university of massachusetts in 
boston and the wharton school of business at the university of 
pennsylvania had worked for the company for less than two years 
and was fired wednesday for inefficient performance 
merrill lynch spokesman fred yager declined to be more specific 
about the reasons behind the firing he said he did not know 
whether gilchrists meeting with cook had been scheduled 
an unnamed associate was quoted by the boston globe as saying 
gilchrist went through eight jobs in 11 years before joining 
merrill lynch in june 1986 he was told repeatedly that he would 
have to start performing there or lose his job the associate 
said 
lonnie was doing very poorly said an unidentified friend 
who told the globe he talked to gilchrist by telephone wednesday 
night and that gilchrist gave no indication that he had been 
fired he was bright but he couldnt communicate or sell he 
couldnt bring in the revenue but george cook was trying to help 
him along 
the newspaper said gilchrist made only 17051 in commissions in 
his first year less than 20 percent of the average 100000 in 
commissions a firstyear broker makes according to a merrill lynch 
official in new york since october gilchrist had received 6491 
in commissions the newspaper said 
the globe quoted unnamed sources as saying gilchrist was heard 
to complain that his bosses growing criticism of his weak sales 
volume at merrill lynch was racially motivated lonnie was taking 
this as racial but it was just poor performance one source said 
gilchrist who lived with his mother filed a racial 
discrimination complaint with the massachusetts commission against 
discrimination three years ago claiming northrop corp of norwood 
refused to give him a job because he was black northrop said it 
didnt hire gilchrist because he asked for too much money the 
commission dismissed the complaint on grounds of insufficient 
evidence 
a merrill lynch office manager in florida was killed and another 
broker wounded after last octobers stock market plunge by a 
customer who had been told he owed 138000 the investor who then 
killed himself had seen his stock holdings drop 25 million in 
value after the oct 19 market collapse

the european economic community 
commission friday asked japan to clarify the terms of an accord 
with the united states opening japanese public works projects to 
us firms 
if it turned out that this agreement would be yet another 
bilateral deal between these two countries to the exclusion of 
others that would be very damaging eec external relations 
commissioner willy de clercq said friday 
the eec has criticized past efforts by the united states to open 
japanese markets through preferential bilateral accords 
last month the general agreement on tariffs and trade said parts 
of a usjapanese accord on trade in semiconductors violated its 
international rules of commerce 
the public works deal was signed tuesday in washington 
we take this affair very seriously not only because of the 
amount of potential trade involved but also because we feel that 
bilateral deals are hurting the spirit of free trade de clercq 
said in a statement 
he said he would raise the issue at a meeting in vancouver next 
week of trade officials from the united states japan canada and 
the eec 
the public works accord signed by us trade representative 
clayton yeutter and japans deputy chief cabinet secretary ichiro 
ozawa was termed a declaration of intent rather than a formal 
bilateral agreement 
us officials said it was intended to provide market access to 
japan for us engineering and construction firms and for us 
suppliers of a wide range of equipment for projects financed 
directly or indirectly with japanese government funds 
de clercq said he has not yet seen the text of the accord but 
sought an immediate official declaration by the japanese 
government clarifying the situation 
there is a need for a binding commitment sufficiently specific 
to reassure the eec and its industry that the latter will be able 
to bid for work under these major projects on an equal and 
nondiscriminatory basis with regard to both japanese and third 
country competitors he said

less than six months after the global market 
collapse japanese stock prices have surged above precrash levels 
thanks to market resilience and renewed confidence in the countrys 
healthy economy 
people have realized the tokyo market has certain strengths 
said simon smithson at the kleinwort benson investment firm 
the main index of the tokyo stock exchange the worlds largest 
in terms of money invested fell 15 percent last october in the 
session after the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell a 
record 508 points or 23 percent 
on thursday the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues 
finished making up all its lost ground as it surpassed its 
precrash level and reached its highest level in history 2676922 
on friday the nikkei index slipped less than 01 percent 
losing 2033 points to close at 2674889 
the dow jones index meanwhile still languishes more than 8 
percent below its level of the day before the crash and 24 percent 
below its peak of last august other world stock exchanges are also 
below precrash levels 
julian jones of the vickers da costa investment firm said the 
tokyo market had been pushed by factors intrinsic and unique to 
japan which had more to do with underlying domestic economic 
factors that could not be applied internationally 
they were japanese reasons he said 
some of them are low interest rates high corporate profits 
strong economic growth estimated at a 7 percent annual rate in the 
last quarter of 1987 and inflation so low that consumer prices in 
february were 07 percent below a year earlier 
also investors are reassured by controls on price movements of 
stocks which they believe protect the market against a crash 
smithson said 
still some japanese officials worry that the tokyo stock 
exchange is bouncing back too fast satoshi sumita governor of the 
bank of japan said thursday that stock prices have risen too 
rapidly in relation to economic growth 
many investment strategists remain optimistic hisamichi sawa 
chief strategist at the prudential bache investment firm said the 
tokyo stock market is sensitive to corporate earnings and the 
nikkeis rise was powered by substantial improvements in company 
profits 
the domestic sector is now growing by more than 6 percent 
sawa said other analysts agree and say the economys overall 
growth compensating for a decline in exports will be 4 to 45 
percent this year 
sawa attributed the markets resilience to a substantial level 
of liquidity and low interest rates the prime lending rate in 
japan is 55 percent 
investor sentiment is very optimistic sawa said money is 
flowing into the market from bond investments and savings 
accounts 
traders also agreed that a stable foreign exchange rate is 
contributing strongly to the nikkeis continuing bullish 
performance the us dollar fluctuated mainly in a narrow range of 
125 to 128 yen last month 
people realized the dollar was not headed for 120 yen as 
quickly as they originally thought said clap ham director of 
research at jardine fleming 
removal of this fear has pushed the market up he added 
many analysts said the countrys system of government control 
over daily market movements also played a substantial role in 
fueling the rise 
there is no doubt about it said ham investors are bound to 
feel comfortable with a market secured in government 
intervention 
the tokyo stock exchange determines daily pricechange limits 
for stocks from their previous days closing level at the bottom 
end shares closing at less than 100 yen 79 cents are allowed to 
move a maximum of 30 yen 24 cents up or down while at the top 
those closing above 10000 yen 79 are given a maximum 
fluctuation of 2000 yen 16 
trading offers outside the stocks allowed range are not 
accepted meaning shares with quick price changes sometimes are not 
traded for much of a session 
traders say the restrictions greatly inhibited the flow of money 
out of the market at the time of the crash thereby limiting the 
overall decline 
the limits had a positive calming influence on the stock 
market said smithson of kleinwort benson the close 
relationship between the administration and institutions had an 
important role and slowed the rate of fall 
jardine flemings ham described the government as a guardian 
angel who will do whatever is needed to keep the market from 
falling 
he added that numerous american investors have recently come 
into the tokyo market lured by the perceived benefits of the 
japanese system 
but while some analysts are predicting the nikkei index will 
continue up possibly nearing the 30000 mark by the end of summer 
they stopped short of saying tokyo already the worlds largest 
market in terms of total value of shares will replace new york and 
london in dictating future market trends 
sawa said the us stock market will continue to wield a strong 
influence over tokyo activity assuming new york does not drop 
significantly or remains at its present level the tokyo market 
will move up he said 
he predicted prices will be bolstered by a new buying mood among 
the many financial institutions including insurance firms and 
trust banks who missed the bus because the market went up 
quicker than they expected

a baltimorebased electrical testing company 
has won a 14year battle with the us occupational safety and 
health administration and broken two other companies hold on the 
us market for product testing 
met laboratories inc tried for more than a decade to get the 
federal agency to set standards for the national accreditation of 
product testing firms and change a regulation that specifically 
listed two laboratories and thus kept others out 
after settling two lawsuits brought in federal district court by 
met osha on tuesday will publish standards for accreditation in 
the federal register 
its been a long time coming said leonard frier mets 
founder and president 
the existing and soon to be defunct regulation says that 
testing shall be done by a nationallyrecognized company such as 
underwriters laboratories inc and factory mutual engineering corp 
frier said that for many years underwriters laboratories inc 
has had a virtual monopoly on the sort of electrical testing his 
company does that firm established by the insurance industry in 
1890 was not a party to any of the legal actions 
the only thing theyre guilty of frier said is running a 
great public relations effort 
friers objections in correspondence and the lawsuits has been 
to the specific reference to ul which tests more than 12500 
products including consumer electrical appliances and bostonarea 
fm which primarily tests fire safety products 
he said oshas regulation kept companies like his from 
certifying the safety of products that osha itself will recognize 
as proper for the workplace said frier 
ul which has headquarters in north brook ill and additional 
laboratories in new york california and north carolina had no 
comment thursday on oshas setting a time for the publication of 
new standards 
founded by insurance companies ul now is an independent 
notforprofit corporation 
norwood massbased fm also had no comment friday 
the baltimore businessman first requested that osha set 
standards for accrediting testing firms in march 1974 his firm 
which depends on field testing rather than newproduct testing for 
its revenues was growing and for several years he did not press 
the matter with osha 
then in may 1982 frier brought suit against the secretary of 
labor who has ultimate responsibility for osha before the suit 
came to trial osha settled the legal action by agreeing to 
rewrite an existing reference to accreditation by march 1984 
although osha agreed that it would change its regulation it did 
not and last june met went back to federal court charging that 
osha had breached the settlement in december a federal judge 
directed osha to comply with the settlement and set a time limit 
for publication of standards 
joseph e pipkin the towson resident who heads oshas office of 
electrical and electronics safety standards said thursday that 
part of the long delay was due to the number of reviews that are 
necessary for something like this 
he said there was agreement at osha several years ago that 
its regulation kept other companies out but for various reasons 
the changes just never moved forward 
met also has a branch in burlington nj in suburban 
philadelphia it has 125 employees and annual revenues of about 
35 million

no matter how many prime ribs or steaks 
carol armstrong placed in her shopping cart her husband knew the 
grocery trip did not cost what his bank account indicated 80 
million 
i was a little surprised i knew it was a mistake said 
richard armstrong 41 on friday 
an innocent shopping trip march 23 to a local supermarket cost 
12178 but a bank error added another 80 million to the 
purchase making it perhaps the most expensive grocery trip in 
history 
mrs armstrong had paid for the groceries with an automated 
teller card from wells fargo bank 
armstrong an electronics technician for the bay area rapid 
transit district said he realized something was wrong several days 
later when he couldnt withdraw money from their account 
he tried unsuccessfully several times to withdraw money then 
somewhat perplexed he called up his balance 
this huge number with a minus sign comes spilling out 
armstrong said since the automated teller only goes up to 1 
million the machine showed his account overdrawn for that amount 
despite this shock armstrong wanted to purchase some flags and 
went to a flag store i said i think im a million dollars 
short so can i write a check since the owner knew him 
armstrong was allowed to write a check 
he then called his banks 24hour hotline to notify them of the 
mistake the bank he said insisted the armstrongs had mistakenly 
written a check for 80 million he noted however that 
8000012178 had been deducted from their account 
armstrong finally deduced that the banks mistake stemmed from 
the 12178 check for the grocery trip still armstrong was left 
without money last weekend 
i was penniless i had to rob my kids piggy banks he said 
wells fargo corrected the armstrongs bank balance on tuesday a 
bank spokeswoman said it was a clerical error 
armstrong said that even though he realized it was a mistake it 
was hard to be without money on easter weekend for his family 
including his two children 
its pretty tough to convice people hey im 80 million 
dollars short can you lend me a hundred dollars he said

eastern airlines announced that the number of 
paying passenger miles it flew in march and its passenger volume 
dropped 20 percent from the same month a year earlier 
eastern said friday that it flew 282 billion revenue passenger 
miles in march down from 353 billion in march 1987 
a revenue passenger mile or rpm represents one paying 
passenger flown one mile and is used to determine an airlines 
capacity 
passenger volume for march also fell 20 percent to 351 million 
passengers from 439 million a year earlier eastern reported 
the figures are very misleading said eastern spokeswoman 
paula musto last year our passenger volume was artificially high 
because we were in the midst of our maxsaver deep disount fares 
we had fares as low as 79 to new york city from miami that 
really increased our discretionary travelers 
she also said eastern had more seats available a year ago 
the airlines capacity declined 131 percent in march to 450 
billion available seat miles from 518 billion a year earlier 
last month us district judge john pratt in washington 
declared eastern in contempt of court for trying to sell its 
profitable northeast shuttle to giant texas air corp easterns 
parent 
easterns management remains embroiled in negotiations with its 
machinists union which is fighting 490 million in proposed job 
cuts at the airline 
ms musto said these problems had nothing to do with the 
declining traffic figures

many developers nibbled but few 
bit at beachfront hotels for sale at an auction designed to breathe 
new life into a stretch of sand and surf battered by slumping 
tourism and broken spring breaks 
only two of 11 properties sold at the private auction thursday 
night that was marked by bids thousands of dollars below what hotel 
owners were seeking 
these bidders dont realize theyre buying fort lauderdale 
beach not the backwoods of maine said ed wrobleski a 
massachusetts factory worker who had sold his home and invested his 
life savings last year to buy a hotel for 650000 
his property fetched a top bid of just 350000 
im not going to give my property away wrobleski said 
well just hang in there and do the best we can 
tourism officials and real estate analysts had viewed the 
auction as a test of private interest in redeveloping the citys 
beachfront strip 
the city of fort lauderdale is planning a 138 million beach 
revitalization as it tries to turn the beach from a spring break 
haven into an area of luxury resorts that plan hinges on private 
development 
if it busts the negative connotation will be that the 
potential to upgrade the property just isnt there said thomas 
powers executive vice president of goodkin research corp in fort 
lauderdale 
the auction at the bahia mar resort and yachting center drew 
about 30 registered bidders and some 600 spectators 
an 81unit beachfront property sold for 21 million and an 
18unit motel sold for 542000 
owners of the 11 properties agreed to the auction because the 
decline of spring break has brought declining profits they say 
city officials in the past few years have restricted the students 
activities so much they have chosen to travel to other vacation 
spots 
ive worked hard but after a while you get burned out on 
beating your head against the wall said roger handevidt one 
motel owner ive tried to attract people down here and to 
increase tourism in the area only to be shot down by the city

the federal cartel office dealt a 
serious blow to three shareholders joint attempt to gain majority 
control of axel springer verlag west germanys largest publishing 
company 
franz and frieder burda who have their own printing operations 
and media entrepreneur leo kirch pooled their springer shares last 
month in an effort to forge a majority 
but the cartel office said friday that their combined shares had 
fallen short of that goal 
at the moment the pool has not had much of an effect leo 
kirch is still a long way even from 25 percent of the shares 
said hartwig wangemann a spokesman for the cartel office 
meanwhile a spokesman for springer employees said workers would 
fight attempts by kirch and the burdas to gain control of the 
company 
the spokesman rolf juergensen said employees are worried that 
kirch would lead the company into extensive involvement with 
electronic media which could mean a loss of jobs for springers 
print workers 
the highly successful springer empire includes the bild tabloid 
with a daily circulation of about 5 million and dozens of other 
masscirculation publications 
springer chairman peter tamm urged that for the benefit of the 
company all participants in the power struggle reach a rational 
solution as soon as possible 
addressing a meeting of springer employee representatives tamm 
also said any solution should give top consideration to security 
for workers and to a stable leadership 
executives of the publishing house have been squabbling ever 
since the death of company founder axel springer in 1985 
under a complicated formula springers heirs and executors were 
given control of 271 percent of the company shares the burda 
brothers 259 percent and kirch 10 percent the rest were sold to 
the public 
kirch had maintained that he gained support from the owners of 
another 16 percent of springer stock which would give him and the 
burdas a combined majority 
friede springer the widow of the founder has been fighting the 
attempts by the burdas and kirch to gain majority control 
kirch is involved in film distribution and production and other 
media areas the burda brothers own printing plants in west germany

soybeans set new contracts high early in the session then in a 
wild finish slumped to the days lows before reaching new highs

large speculative buying led by campd commodities inc accounted

dean witter reynolds inc 
it was a day of wild gyrations he said there were some 
big sellers too but i think this market does not want to go 
down

the international monetary fund should create 
about 295 billion worth of its own new money to help keep the 
dollar and other world currencies stable and to help solve the 
third world debt problem a leading group of the worlds commercial 
banks proposed friday 
the idea came from horst schulmann the west german managing 
director of the institute of international finance which 
represents 165 banks in 38 countries 
not every one of the banks would endorse every line but 
theres a consensus schulman told a news conference 
his ninepage outline was made public on the eve of next weeks 
semiannual meeting in washington of the fund and its sister 
organization the world bank leading bankers and government 
financial leaders are due to attend including treasury secretary 
james a baker iii 
the new money would be given to member governments in proportion 
to their status in the fund that means the wealthiest countries 
would get the biggest shares including about 59 billion worth to 
the united states alone britain would get more than 2 billion 
west germany about 18 billion france 15 billion and japan 14 
billion 
schulman says the united states could use this money for dealing 
on currency exchange markets to keep the dollar stable while other 
governments could hold more of this currency instead of dollars at 
the news conference he suggested that many believe they already 
hold too many dollars 
the fund owned by 151 governments makes few public statements 
and had no official comment on the proposal schulman said that he 
has had favorable comment privately 
representatives of third world countries and some wealthier 
industrial governments have urged similar issues of new money by 
the fund in past years they have come up against stiff refusal 
from us officials who said it would promote inflation 
the united states has the biggest single block of votes in fund 
matters 
schulman wants the fund to create 214 billion more of its 
special drawing rights known as sdrs these are now worth 
about 138 each based on the price of four other major currencies 
as well as the dollar the west german mark the british pound the 
french franc and the japanese yen 
sdrs are handled only by governments and a few special 
governmental bodies they exist not as coins or paper money but 
only as entries in ledgers and computers 
the 15 heavilyindebted third world countries singled out by 
baker for special help two years ago would get about 3 billion 
worth among them most of these countries are in latin america 
third world governments have in the past asked that the rules be 
changed so that their share would be larger but schulman gave no 
support to that 
it would be wrong to change the quotas in the fund he said 
these issues are for the needs of general international 
liquidity 
he added that he did not rule out the possibility of the 
wealthier countries turning over their shares to the bank and fund 
which could then make more loans to the third world 
schulman acknowledged that critics of his plan might call it a 
bailout for commercial banks 
commercial banks and other creditors would benefit from the 
improved creditworthiness of debtor countries the proposal says 
it suggests that debtor countries could use their shares to buy 
us dollars as collateral for new borrowing from banks or to 
swing deals that would convert their old debts to banks into 
something else that banks would prefer to have 
one possibility is the debtequity swap in which debt owed by 
third world countries are exchanged at less than their face value 
for shares in businesses

alaska airlines has tentatively scheduled a may 
31 flight between nome alaska and the siberian city of 
provideniya 
soviet officials have yet to approve the flight but 
unofficially they appear to favor the idea according to an alaska 
chamber of commerce official helping to organize the flight 
theres a lot of interest from the soviet embassy in 
washington its aware of this project and theyre excited about 
possibly getting involved said shane johnson public relations 
director for the chamber 
commercial flights between the united states and the soviet 
union were banned for several years following the soviet invasion 
of afghanistan in 1979 but the prohibition was lifted about two 
years ago 
pan american world airways is the only us airline that flies 
between the two countries operating flights between new york 
leningrad and moscow with a stopover in frankfurt west germany 
pan am plans to introduce nonstop flights in a joint venture with 
aeroflot the soviet national airline starting may 15 
for most of the postwar era almost all contact between siberia 
and alaska has been cut off and in recent years the north pacific 
has been the scene of major military buildups by both nations 
but last year relations began to warm the soviets allowed 
american lynn cox to swim between two islands that straddle the 
border in the bering sea permitted an exchange of medical 
researchers from siberia and alaska and met with us fishing 
groups to discuss joint seafood ventures 
lou cancelmi an alaska airlines spokesman said the airline 
would donate the use of a plane for the halfhour flight between 
nome and the siberian city the carrier has applied for authority 
to begin regularly scheduled service between the two cities next 
year 
but cancelmi stressed that alaska airlines still needs more 
technical information about provideniyas airport as well as a 
formal nod from the soviets before the may flight can take place 
in addition to dignitaries the flight would also carry a group 
of western alaska eskimos who hope to be reunited with longlost 
relatives in siberia 
the flight is part of a broader initiative that state 
university and chamber officials have launched to improve alaskas 
relations with the soviet union 
known as the siberian gateway project the goals include 
expanded trade and tourism between alaska and siberia 
on april 23 the project will sponsor a symposium in anchorage 
on siberiaalaska relations that will feature gennadi gerasimov 
chief spokesman for soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev

the dallas hunt brothers and the 23 foreign and 
domestic banks they are battling are nearing settlement in their 
dispute over 15 billion in loans attorneys said 
both sides have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to suspend 
reorganization hearings on the hunts placid oil co until the 
negotiations are complete attorneys said 
negotiations are at the stage where the major parties have 
come to what i call a handshake deal placid attorney henry w 
simon said thursday that deal is not in writing and the 
handshake is not now binding but it does represent at least a 
conclusion of an intensive series of all the placidrelated 
issues 
neither simon nor first republicbank corp attorney paul wickes 
key negotiators for the case would discuss the substance of the 
negotiations but the settlement would have to include what to do 
about 200 million in penalty interest attorney fees and costs the 
banks claim against placid 
nelson bunker hunt william herbert hunt and lamar hunt filed 
suit in federal court nearly two years ago against the 23 banks 
alleging they were fraudulently squeezing the hunts into accepting 
increasingly difficult loan terms for a 15 billion debt 
a countersuit was filed by the banks demanding immediate 
payment on what the banks contended were legitimate loans in 
default 
six weeks later the banks posted for foreclosure key hunt 
assets securing the defaulted loans the hunts protected themselves 
by placing placid and william herberts personal trust under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code they later did the same 
with the other brothers trusts 
both sides have since been warring in federal and bankruptcy 
courts maneuvering for a possible death blow or at least some kind 
of legal advantage 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson in january allowed the 
banks a 78 million first lien against revenues from the hunts 
green canyon drilling project in the gulf of mexico 
the lien represented money placid had spent on green canyon in 
violation of a court order when the hunts experienced cost 
overruns including the loss of nine miles of pipe being towed to 
the site the projects outside investors declined to cover the 
loss 
the outside investors dallas mavericks owner don carter and 
oklahoma media giant ed gaylord said they would commit more money 
only if the bankruptcy judge put those funds ahead of the banks 
prior lien 
the banks desire to close green canyon and abramsons balking 
at considering the need for additional money an emergency 
brought placid to the table one bank attorney said 
without green canyon placids reorganization plan would be 
untenable and by default abramson would have accepted the bank 
plan calling for the outright sale of placid

bids for the plant in monessen westmoreland county came from 
australia britain south africa california and pennsylvania 
the plant is on the block as part of wheelingpittsburghs 
reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws 
the bids were considered by bentz on thursday which was the 
deadline the judge postponed his decision over the objection of 
wheelingpittsburghs creditors 
the sale is a crucial issue in monessen whose economy has

blast furnaces if it cannot get coke from monessen and a sharon 
steel attorney threatened to withdraw the bid because bentz would 
not rule immediately 
bmac until recently was the only bidder for the plant the 
company signed a letter of intent in december to buy the coke 
ovens which convert coal to blast furnace fuel 
australian businessman colin good offered 60 million for the 
entire plant but bentz said the offer had conditions in it that

women in sales forces tend to represent a 
strong portion of housewares publishing and food products 
industries but few sell tools hardware and general machinery a 
study found 
over the past decade the most significant advances for women 
in sales have been in banking financial services utilities and 
publishing said william oconnell head of sales management 
practice for the company that conducted the study personnel 
corporation of america 
in these industries where there is no apparent genderrelated 
consumer bias sheer numbers women have equalled or surpassed their 
male counterparts on the sales force oconnell said friday 
the data for the study conducted earlier this year came from 
12000 salespeople employed by nearly 350 companies representing 40 
industries 
according to the study the industries with the greatest 
percentage of women in their sales forces are textile and apparel 
utilities banks and financial services housewares publishing and 
food products 
the industries with the smallest percentage of women in their 
sales forces are general machinery aerospace transportation 
equipment tools and hardware automotive parts and fabricated 
metal products the study found 
our hypothesis is that selling such technical items as tools 
and hardware requires some engineering and technical background 
which statistics have shown women have not gotten into 
oconnell said 
but he said the sales managers he surveyed indicated that 
women tend to be better performers in the industries where they are 
selling

tate amp lyle plc a major british sugar refiner and 
distributor announced friday a 133 billion cash tender offer for 
staley continental inc the second largest refiner of corn 
sweeteners in the united states 
tate amp lyle which already owns nearly 5 percent of staleys 
stock said it was offering 32 a share for all the remaining 
common stock 
staley continental which is based in rolling meadows ill 
will have no comment on any aspect of the offer until its lawyers 
examine the proposal said spokesman david satterfield 
but there was speculation the bidding may go higher staley 
climbed 587 a share to 3737 in active trading on the new york 
stock exchange 
lynton wilson north american managing director for tate amp lyle 
said at a springfield ill news conference that the 32 price was 
fair 
we prepared to launch our bid at a time when the price for 
staley shares was in the low 20s wilson said i dont know 
what may happen to the price on the market but we believe the 32 
is a full and fair offer for the shares of the company 
wilson said tate amp lyles interest in the company is a 
fundamental interest in the business not a passing financial 
interest 
were not financial entrepreneurs or corporate raiders he 
said were manufacturing people involved in the processing 
businesses not only here in north america but in other countries as 
well 
tate amp lyle said staley had previously proposed that tate 
increase its stake acquired in november and become a more 
substantial minority shareholder 
but tate amp lyle said it decided to launch the tender offer 
instead 
the acquisition would give tate amp lyle its first interest in the 
us corn sweetener market tate amp lyle said it would become the 
only supplier of all three types of sugar corn beet and cane 
in the united states 
we are confident that as part of tate amp lyles north american 
division the performance and competitive position of staleys corn 
activities will be significantly enhanced said tate amp lyle 
chairman neil shaw 
the tender offer represents a 78 percent premium to staleys 
share price of 18 a share before the tate amp lyle stake was 
announced 
staleys stock price was boosted in march by speculation that a 
foreign concern would launch a bid for the company 
staley continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 for 
the ae staley manufacturing co a leading corn processor and 
cfs continental inc a food service supplier acquired in late 1984 
tate amp lyle said staley is the second largest refiner of corn 
sweeteners in the united states behind archerdanielsmidland co 
based in decatur ill 
staleys principal corn product is high fructose corn syrup 
known as hfcs the company has around 25 percent of the 1 billion 
a year us market for hfcs sales tate amp lyle said 
in a letter to staley released in new york tates shaw said 
staley had moved away from its core business of corn processing in 
recent years scaled back corn sweetener operations and expanded 
into foodservice distribution 
in our view it is time to return staley to basics shaw 
wrote 
tate amp lyle said it intends to sell staleys food distribution 
business which staley acquired in 1984 for 396 million and that 
it was prepared to consider any offers immediately 
the proceeds of that sale would be used to reduce tate amp lyles 
debt incurred by the acquisition it said 
tate amp lyle also said it planned after the merger to move the 
companys headquarters to decatur where its corn wet milling 
operations have been based for years 
tate amp lyle said it began legal action in the united states to 
overturn takeover defenses established by staley including a 
benefit package for its senior management 
tate amp lyle said the offer will be partly funded by the sale of 
new shares to its existing shareholders cash resources and a bank 
loan 
the acquisition and stock issue must be approved by tate amp 
lyles shareholders who are to meet on may 3 the tender offer is 
scheduled to expire may 5 unless extended 
staley earned 573 million on revenue of 34 billion in the 
year ended in september 
tate and lyle had a pretax profit of 92 million pounds or 
about 173 million on revenue of 17 billion pounds or 32 
billion in the same time period

five opec leaders gathered here friday 
for talks that analysts said would test the cartels resolve to 
combat a global oil price slump 
prices on world markets slipped slightly in quiet trading brent 
blend crude from the north sea traded in london for may delivery at 
1560 a barrel down 10 cents from thursdays close at the new 
york mercantile exchange may contracts for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude stood at 1688 per barrel 
down 18 cents 
indonesias oil minister said on his arrival that the meeting 
set to start saturday was unlikely to produce any changes in the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries current oil policy 
i dont think well decide anything that will change the past 
decision of opec the minister ginandjar kartasasmita told 
reporters as he prepared for his first opec session since taking 
over his countrys top oil post in march 
in the saudi arabian capital of riyadh the official saudi press 
agency quoted king fahd as calling on opec to display greater 
solidarity it said he accused some unidentified cartel members of 
cheating on opec rules by offering price discounts 
last december opec agreed to retain existing oil production 
quotas for the individual member countries in hope of holding 
prices at 18 a barrel a barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons 
since then however openmarket prices for opec oil have 
slipped to levels between 15 and 18 a barrel despite 
strongerthanusual efforts by the key producers to abide by their 
production quotas 
paul mcdonald a londonbased oil consultant said opec oil 
production in march probably was not much above its official 
ceiling for 12 members of 1506 million barrels a day iraq the 
13th member is not included in the december agreement and is 
believed to be pumping about 25 million barrels daily 
thus total opec output is thought to be about 176 million 
barrels daily 
it beats me what they can do now to drive prices back up to 
18 a barrel mcdonald said in a telephone interview 
the five opec ministers representing saudi arabia nigeria 
venezuela algeria and indonesia are expected to assess oil market 
conditions and recommend action for the next full meeting of the 
cartel which is set for june 8 here 
ginandjar told reporters he saw little chance that a special 
conference of all 13 members would be called before june 
rilwanu lukman the nigerian oil minister and chairman of the 
weekend meeting said opec was not satisfied with the current level 
of oil prices 
we wanted a price of 18 we havent got it he told 
reporters thursday he declined to discuss possible actions to 
raise the price 
the five opec ministers constituting the cartels recently 
created pricemonitoring committee also are to review a dutch 
auditing firms report on january and february production levels by 
individual opec members 
one of opecs biggest problems in seeking to influence oil 
prices through production controls is a lack of timely and reliable 
information about the production of its own members some 
including persian gulf war rivals iran and iraq consider such data 
to be state secrets 
some analysts said opec had to cut its production further in 
order to reverse the decline in prices 
the market is signaling that this is what is needed but i 
dont see it happening said graham andrews an analyst at the 
investment firm of wood mackenzie and co in london 
andrews said there was not much saturdays meeting could do 
given the continuing worldwide oversupply of oil and opecs 
inability to agree on new output cuts 
i suspect its going to be brave words but not anything more 
than that he said 
andrews said he believed oil prices in the open market were 
likely to decline by as much as 150 a barrel over the next two 
month before stabilizing 
although this weekends talks may not influence the shortterm 
direction of prices they may provide clues about shifts in opecs 
longterm strategy 
a key question for opec now is whether to resort to its 
traditional tactic of cutting production in an effort to bolster 
prices 
some analysts think a consensus among key opec members may be 
emerging that the cartel should draw a line on sacrificing 
production since nonopec producers such as mexico and the soviet 
union are only taking up the production slack that opec has 
created as a result opec has been losing on both volume and price

international business machines corp moving to 
earn more money on its intellectual property said friday it will 
raise the ceiling on its patent license fees to 5 percent from the 
current 1 percent 
the decision is likely to put pressure on the profit margins of 
companies that require licenses to make products compatible with 
those of ibm the worlds largest computer company 
ibm holds 9000 us patents and more than 23000 counterpart 
patents around the world the decision does not affect existing 
license agreements 
ibms announcement came just weeks before the expected 
announcement of computers compatible with ibms yearold personal 
system2 personal computer 
they certainly intend to cash in on their development effort 
on the personal system2 said jack w wilson an analyst for 
dataquest inc in san jose calif 
ibm also said it was reaffirming its longstanding practice of 
making its patents generally available for licensing to others 
under reasonable terms and conditions 
some companies refuse to license some of their patents or 
license them selectively to particular companies ibm spokesman 
john mihalec noted he said ibm makes its patents generally 
available because its good for the industry 
under the new rates licensees will pay a maximum of 1 percent 
of sales revenue on a product using a single ibm patent they will 
pay up to 5 percent of sales revenue on products using multiple 
patents depending on the number of patents used and the extent of 
their use 
under the old rates which were last changed 10 years ago the 
maximum royalty was 1 percent regardless of the number of patents 
used 
license fees of 3 to 5 percent are fairly common in industry 
said david carnevale director of the microcomputer service of 
infocorp a consulting and research company based in cupertino 
calif 
i would say thats in the ballpark agreed richard l 
bernacchi an intellectualproperty attorney in los angeles he 
said patents have become more valuable since the federal court 
system has become more consistent in enforcing them 
many companies have crosslicensing agreements with ibm that 
allow the companies to use each others patents without fees for 
specified periods in other cases the agreements provide for free 
use of certain patents and require payment for use of others 
any licensee can look at the license they have from ibm and 
figure out what theyre covered for mihalec said 
tandy corp one of the companies rumored to be preparing to 
announce a personal system2 computer has a longstanding 
crosslicensing agreement with ibm according to ed juge director 
of market planning 
amdahl corp which makes big mainframe computers that run the 
same software as ibms mainframes also has a crosslicensing 
agreement with ibm which expires at the end of 1991 spokesman 
bill stewart said 
it will have no current effect on us stewart said 
ibm noted that a patent license is not a license to copy 
products that use the covered patent it is not a transfer of the 
technology or trade secrets that went into developing a product and 
it does not allow a licensee to infringe other forms of 
intellectual property rights such as copyrights 
ibm has said it has applied for both patents and copyrights on 
micro channel architecture the internal data pathway that is a 
critical part of its new personal system2

a real estate company that tried to be a 
maverick by selling homes for fees well below the prevailing rate 
is going out of business eight months after opening 
barclay amp stubbs is being forced to close its doors mainly 
because it could not attract top agents elizabeth f kinzly the 
companys president said thursday 
the real estate agency was offering to sell houses for a 3 
percent commission sharply below the going rate of 6 percent 
buyers were also being offered a 1 percent bonus for purchasing a 
home listed by barclay amp stubbs 
agents for the company were offered a salary instead of the 
standard commission a factor that others in the real estate 
business had predicted would hinder barclay amp stubbs recruitment 
efforts 
kinzly said she believed agents were reluctant to join the 
company because of fear of something new and concern about how they 
would be viewed by others in the business 
if barclay represented both the buyer and the seller the agency 
would net only a 2 percent commission other brokerages were 
offered a 2 percent shared commission so barclays net commission 
could be as little as half a percent 
although real estate commissions are negotiable most are 6 
percent shared equally between the listing and selling brokers 
the company had sold four or five houses and had deposits on 
another six kinzly said adding that many of the sales had been on 
a sharedcommission basis 
a few dozen homeowners had listed their houses with the agency 
and things were picking up a lot said kinzly 
she said she disagreed with chairman benjamin morris decision 
to quit now kinzly said she would have liked to see the company 
remain in business at least through the spring houseselling season 
that could have made it go she said 
the company had been at the center of a controversy in the real 
estate community after it sued four area brokers in february 
charging unfair trade practices and conspiracy to restrain trade 
the other brokers had offered barclay a lower shared commission 
than that offered to other agencies 
last month a judge granted a motion by two of the defendants to 
have the case referred to the greater new haven board of realtors 
for arbitration one of the other companies reached a settlement 
with barclay

cattle futures advanced sharply friday on the chicago mercantile 
exchange reflecting expectations of improved beef demand 
on other markets grain and soybean futures moved higher energy 
futures declined and precious metals were slightly higher 
livestock traders got clipped earlier in the week with limit 
declines in some cattle deliveries 
now weve gone a long way to return a little optimism to the 
market said philip stanley an analyst in chicago with thomson 
mckinnon securities inc 
there seemed to be a general belief that cash cattle prices will 
improve next week along with wholesale beef he said 
the expectations are for improved demand throughout the beef 
trade said stanley there should be a return of retail 
interest in beef and the packers will have to buy live animals 
because theyve done little of it in recent days 
hog and pork belly futures also did well in part because of 
spillover support from the cattle pit stanley said 
also a lot of traders are expecting a seasonal bottom in hog 
prices he said 
live cattle settled 05 cent to 147 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7477 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 10 cent lower to 58 cent higher with april at 8010 
cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent lower to 70 cent higher 
with april at 4537 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 70 
cent to 115 cents higher with may at 5447 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the chicago board 
of trade 
soybeans set contracts high early in the session then in a wild 
finish slumped to the days lows before reaching new highs again 
large speculative buying led by campd commodities inc accounted 
for much of the activity said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
it was a day of wild gyrations he said there were some 
big sellers too but i think this market does not want to go 
down 
the market is expecting a government report coming out monday to 
show a further drawdown in soybean stocks said lespinasse 
this would give a very low stockstousage ratio he said 
so if any problems develop with the weather later this spring or 
summer this market could explode to the upside 
wheat and corn futures also were higher partly in response to 
the performance in the bean pit wheat also got help from export 
activity 
wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the may contract 
at 316 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with may at 
209 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 
166 a bushel and soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents higher with 
may at 678 a bushel 
energy futures took a dip heading into the weekend meeting of 
the opec pricing committee 
up to this morning there was some speculation that there might 
be a surprise coming out of the meeting that would send prices 
higher said michael rothman senior oil analyst in new york with 
merrill lynch capital markets 
a change of feeling came on remarks by opec president rilwanu 
lukman who indicated the pricing committee would meet only one 
day said rothman 
the implication is that the session would be a perfunctory one 
with no recommendation for a special opec meeting or for production 
cuts 
those anticipations were put to rest today by lukmans 
remarks said rothman 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude oil settled 18 cents to 20 cents lower with the may contract 
at 1688 a barrel heating oil was 27 cent to 57 cent lower with 
may at 4546 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 05 cent to 
45 cent lower with may at 4877 cents a gallon 
stock index futures at the chicago mercantile exchange advanced 
with the june contract for the standard amp poors 500 index settling 
at 26990 up 230 points the underlying spot index was up 327 at 
26943 
precious metals futures advanced slightly on the commodity 
exchange in new york 
gold was 70 cents to 1 higher with the june contract at 45370 
a troy ounce and silver was 3 cent to 4 cent higher with may at 
6438 a troy ounce

simulators in the untied kingdom and 35 percent of the simulators 
for training pilots of us and other foreign airlines

for the f14a jet 
rediffusion with a work force of 2500 and annual sales of 
about 260 million will be operated as a subsidiary of hughes 
hughes expects that simulators will be used increasingly by 
military customers to train pilots and operators as defense budgets 
flatten out said albert wheelon chairman and chief executive of

the first flight of boeing cos new 747400 
jumbo jet has been delayed by electrical problems the company said 
dean thornton president of boeing commercial airplanes said 
wednesday that the first deliveries of the plane which was 
formally introduced by boeing in january are still expected in 
december but arent a certainty 
northwest airlines and singapore airlines both said they are 
scheduled to receive two of the planes in december 
analysts said that if the four planes planned for december 
delivery are delayed into january boeings 1988 sales could be 
reduced by about 500 million and pretax operating profits could 
be cut by as much as 100 million 
phil brannon an aerospace analyst with merrill lynch in new 
york said he estimates boeing would receive close to 25 million 
in operating profit on each 747400 paul nisbet analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york estimated each plane 
could generate 35 million in profit 
thornton said it is possible the airplanes problems could delay 
certification of the jetliner by the federal aviation 
administration 
the first flight had been scheduled for march 21 but thornton 
said he now expects it to be the latter part of this month 
thornton said the electrical problems involve the main power 
generation system 
he said the new 747 the worlds largest commercial jetliner 
has proven to be more complex to build than originally expected 
the sophisticated electronics of the plane include a 
computerized cockpit that allows for a crew of two rather than the 
three required on the earlier 747s also the fourengine plane has 
improved aerodynamics with a bigger wingspan and added vertical 
winglets at their tips it is powered by new engines 
thornton said the job also has been complicated by customer 
pressure to change things to tailormake it to suit their 
requirements 
the 747400 is designed to carry as many as 479 passengers and 
has a range of 8000 miles 
northwest the initial customer for the plane has ordered 10 of 
the jets with spare parts worth 15 billion singapore airlines 
has ordered 14 and taken options for six others for a total value 
of 33 billion 
boeing has received 13 billion to 14 billion in firm orders 
for 118 of the jets plus options for 66 others each plane sells 
for about 125 million 
boeing had profit of 480 million or 310 a share on sales of 
1535 billion in 1987 the company expects sales of 17 billion 
this year

cheaplymanufactured textiles from china 
and other nations fueled a 17 percent increase in the textile trade 
deficit in 1987 while taking away jobs from americans industry 
representatives said thursday 
members of the american textile manufacturers institute meeting 
here through saturday said that unless federal legislation is 
passed setting a 1 percent annual ceiling on import growth textile 
production in the united states could cease by the mid1990s 
imported clothing now accounts for 54 percent of all garments 
sold in the united states according to institute figures 
about 22 million people make their living in the nations 
textile industry according to institute figures this represents a 
loss of about 350000 jobs since 1980 including 10000 jobs lost 
in march alone said robert g laidlaw president of the group he 
blamed the situation in part of the reagan administrations failure 
to enforce import quotas 
laidlaw urged passage of the textile and apparel trade act 
which faces a vote in the senate next month 
the us imposed an embargo against the soviet union last year 
after the soviet union exported 12 million yards of fabric to the 
us instead of the 4 million yards provided under us quotas he 
said but laidlaw added the embargo was lifted when soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev visited the us he said a 1988 limit was set at 
235 million yards 
the government is happily giving away our industry and people 
are not going to reinvest if they dont have confidence said 
laidlaw 
the primary competition comes from governmentsubsidized 
manufacturers in china taiwan korea hong kong and other nations 
producing textiles for as little as 20 cents an hour in wages 
on an even field the us industry can compete with anyone 
said christopher bonner institute spokesman but it cant 
compete when governments subsidize exports made by lowwage earners 
in deplorable conditions that would be illegal in the us its 
crazy 
us department of commerce figures show imports of textiles and 
apparel in 1987 reached a record 29 billion while exports totaled 
4 billion the industrys 248 billion trade deficit for textiles 
and apparel now equals 145 percent of the nations overall trade 
deficit according to laidlaw 
if we look at the growth of the nations overall trade deficit 
from 1986 to 1987 one fourth of that diastrous growth has been at 
the expense of the us textile and apparel industry and its 2 
million employees he said

a group led by new york communications investor 
robert fx sillerman said friday it had agreed to buy metropolitan 
broadcasting holding co which owns seven radio stations and the 
texas state radio network 
sillerman said his group will pay about 40 million to the 
owners of the privatelyheld broadcasting concern and will assume 
about 260 million in debt metropolitan broadcasting is a 
premier radio group sillerman said we believe our financial 
resources and strong broadcast operating expertise will provide 
metropolitan with a solid foundation for renewed growth 
the sale is subject to approval by the federal communications 
commission 
metropolitan broadcasting was created in november 1986 when a 
group that included the investment firm morgan stanley amp co inc 
and managers of metromedia cos radio division bought the division 
for 285 million in a leveraged buyout 
in a leveraged buyout the buyers often borrow heavily against 
the assets or cash flow of the company being acquired to make the 
purchase 
metropolitan originally included nine radio stations and the 
texas radio network but sold two stations in washington and 
philadelphia last fall 
dennis mcalpine a media industry analyst for the investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co said the stations were sold to help meet 
the heavy interest costs associated with the debt incurred in the 
buyout 
metropolitan currently owns wnewam and wnewfm in new york 
wmmrfm in philadelphia ktwvfm in los angeles wwbafm in the 
tampast petersburg area in florida womcfm in detroit krldam 
in dallas and the texas state radio network which provides 
programming to radio stations in that state 
sillerman said his company would cancel metropolitans announced 
plan to sell wnewam and would review metropolitans proposed sale 
of wwbafm 
but he said the previouslyannounced sale of womcfm in detroit 
would go forward pending fcc approval 
metropolitan broadcasting is being acquired by sillerman 
acquisition corp which was formed for the purpose of buying the 
radio properties 
sillerman is chairman and chief executive of that company as 
well as of sillermanmagee communications management corp a new 
yorkbased communications investment concern 
in addition sillerman and his associates are the largest 
shareholders in legacy broadcasting which owns and operates 10 
radio stations in los angeles houston minneapolisst paul 
detroit denver and washington dc 
sillerman said the metropolitan stations had been profitable and 
were not for sale when he began conversations about the acquisition 
only nine days ago 
he said the stations should be able to generate more profit and 
revenue through additional investment in more aggressive promotion 
he said his groups purchase should also end speculation about 
whether more of the groups stations would be sold 
he said metropolitans corporate and station management would 
remain substantially intact 
carl c brazell jr president of metropolitan broadcasting 
said we look forward to building on strong expected results and 
to an era of expansion and enhanced profitability for metropolitan 
broadcasting

eastern airlines on friday filed an opening brief 
in its appeal of a us district court decision that blocked the 
sale of the profitable eastern air shuttle to a subsidiary of texas 
air corp 
the appeal will be heard may 5 
in its brief the airline said the court ruling was wrong 
because the air shuttle sale was a managerial move that didnt 
violate collective bargaining agreements 
eastern said the courts decision denied the company 225 
million the sale would have brought and permitted the court to 
assume potentially unlimited oversight authority over the airlines 
affairs threatening its ability to manage its finances 
the company also said the ruling gave the machinists union 
reason to delay negotiating a contract 
eastern said the shuttle sale involved no involuntary employee 
transfers and would not cause any eastern workers to lose 
employment rights 
us district judge john pratt in washington declared march 10 
that eastern was in contempt of court for trying to sell the 
shuttle 
pratt said texas air easterns parent company broke federal 
labor law when it arranged to sell the shuttle he also said the 
sale violated an order he issued last july barring eastern from 
transferring 6000 ground workers into a new subsidiary called 
airport ground services

in an unexpected move the walt disney 
co scrapped plans friday for 300 million entertainment complex in 
burbank and city officials indicated they were looking at other 
alternatives including a proposal by disney rival mca inc 
in a twopage letter to the head of burbanks redevelopment 
agency robert ovrom disney said the project wasnt justifiable 
economically 
based on projected costs and attendance at the planned complex 
the projected return on disneys investment simply did not meet 
corporate thresholds for an investment of this magnitude and 
anticipated business risk the company said 
disney spokesman erwin okun declined to elaborate on what that 
profit threshold is 
last may disney entered into an agreement with burbank to 
negotiate exclusively to develop 40 acresof cityowned land 
alongside the golden state freeway about 15 miles northwest of 
downtown los angeles 
since then disney said the company has invested 22000 
manhours and spent 25 million on planning studies market 
research and related economic analyses 
the complex was envisioned as including movie backlot tours 
theaters shopping areas a hotel a planetarium rides and 
nightclubs a different format that the companys disneyland theme 
park in anaheim about 30 miles away in neighboring orange county 
the complex was to be about two miles from disneys crowded 
studio and headquarters in burbank 
the exclusivity of the negotiating agreement was attacked by 
rival entertainment conglomerate mca inc the parent of universal 
studios and operator of a successful studio backlot tour in nearby 
universal city 
mca claimed it had been unfairly barred from making a competing 
proposal to develop the burbank site and has filed suit to block 
the disneyburbank agreement 
ovrom burbanks redevelopment chief said in a threepage 
memorandum to the mayor and city council that he felt a 
tremendous amount of disappointment over disneys decision 
but he added we are all big boys and big girls and we know 
going into this agreement that it was just a feasibility study 
we too shall immediately shift gears 
ovrom noted that mca in its lawsuit had indicated it was 
interested in making a proposal for developing the burbank site 
i am sure we all anxiously await to see what they will submit 
now that disney is no longer in the picture ovrom said in the 
memorandum 
mca spokesman harold haas said the company had no comment on its 
plans 
ovrom said he had no regrets about granting disney the exclusive 
agreement 
the concept that disney chairman and chief executive michael 
eisner originally envisioned was very exciting and could have been 
very special for burbank ovrom said in the memo 
had we turned down disneys offer to study these 
possibilities we would have gone to our graves always wondering 
what might have been
