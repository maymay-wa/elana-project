republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle winding through midwestern farm land on a bus tour said 
tuesday that democrat michael dukakis had never owned up to his 
irresponsible conduct in the massachusetts prison furlough 
program 
at every stop through the flat fertile countryside near his 
home state of indiana speakers portrayed quayle as a son of the 
heartland and he told flagwaving crowds that their 
oldfashioned values would be preserved in a george bush presidency 
a crowd of several hundred supporters gave quayle a thunderous 
ovation at a homestate rally in indianapolis on tuesday night 
but reporters traveling with the senator got no welcome at all 
the crowd chanted just say no as they entered the hall 
reporters were also booed after the republican convention at a 
bushquayle rally in huntington ind quayles hometown as they 
attempted to question him about his military record 
quayle had a fighters message for the indianapolis group we 
plan on taking some heat but staying in the kitchen but in the 
end well get the job done we have just begun to fight 
earlier in ohio the senator spoke of the importance of that 
state which has 23 electoral votes and is viewed as an important 
swing state in the november elections 
the eyes of america in this election nov 8 will be on ohio 
and the midwest quayle told a rally in van wert 
in napoleon quayle responded to dukakis complaints about how 
the gop ticket was portraying the prison furlough program in 
massachusetts and the case of willie horton jr a convicted 
murderer who escaped from a 1986 urlough and attacked a maryland 
couple the following year 
dukakis said he resented being portrayed as insensitive to the 
plight of crime victims and noted that members of his own family 
had been victimized in the past 
the massachusetts governor said people such as horton who had 
ben sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole 
could not be furloughed under current state law 
interviewed tuesday on nbcs today show dukakis criticized 
bush for making a campaign issue of prison furloughs to use 
these human tragedies for your own political purposes i think is 
really a very crass and cynical thing dukakis said 
the democratic nominee said crimes similar to the horton case 
had been committed under the federal furlough program and in 
california where furloughs were initiated in the 1970s when 
president reagan was governor of that state 
but quayle decried on tuesday what he called dukakis sorry 
record of dealing with violent crime 
even after the horton case the governor strenuously defended 
the furlough program he did not act to change it quayle said 
adding correctly that the massachusetts law was changed only under 
pressure from the state legislature 
quayle said 62 criminals are listed as missing or escapees from 
massachusetts furlough and early release programs 
he said dukakis had failed to heed the advice of a special state 
commission which said in 1975 it could find no justification for 
prison furloughs 
state officials say there actually are 11 people classified as 
escaped from a furlough program 10 of them from before 1979 and 
20 more considered escaped from work release programs 
as for the special state commission andrew dreyfus spokesman 
for state human services secretary philip johnston said there was a 
commission that looked at a range of furlough issues and drafted a 
bill that was pocket vetoed by the governor in 1976 
dreyfus said the bill changed the eligibility rules for 
furloughs for firstdegreemurder lifers but did not ban them 
under the new policy adopted earlier this year theres no furlough 
for firstdegree lifers whatsoever 
he has not truly and sincerely owned up to his irresponsible 
conduct quayle said 
behind the scenes a quayle aide who insisted on anonymity said 
the candidate met with bush campaign james a baker iii over the 
weekend and complained about anonymous quotes from within the bush 
camp that he was a liability to the ticket quayle had said openly 
last friday after the vice presidential debate that he would like 
to find out who made those remarks adding i think i might have 
some influence on their job security 
at rallies throughout the daylong bus tour quayle sounded 
themes aimed at what he called heartland citizens he accused 
dukakis of being soft on crime and belonging to a radical leftwing 
organization which is how quayle characterized the american civil 
liberties union 
right and wrong is at the very core of life in this beloved 
midwest region that i grew up in and where you live he told the 
napoleon crowd the values of this region have not left me 
the trip wound through cornfields from napoleon to ottawa van 
wert celina and greenville along ohios western border

a dissident faction within the 
governing christian democrats has formally split with the party 
further weakening the party as it faces a challenge from the right 
the group led by former cabinet minister julio adolfo rey 
prendes filed with the central elections council on monday to 
establish the authentic christian movement or mac it also 
incorporated a tiny rightist party 
the petition is expected to be approved in a matter of days 
we control 80 percent of the structure and organization of the 
christian democratic party nationwide rey prendes told 
journalists at the elections council 
rey prendes lost the christian democratic nomination for the 
march 1989 presidential election to fidel chavez mena also a 
former cabinet minister president jose napoleon duarte and old 
friend and mentor of rey prendes was unable to mend the rift 
the division weakens the christian democrats who have governed 
since 1984 but face an uphill battle in the election against the 
rightist republican nationalist alliance known by its spanish 
acronym arena 
arena won 32 seats in the 60seat legislature in elections last 
march it also won control of two thirds of el salvadors 
municipalities 
rey prendes said his group hoped to finish second in the first 
round of the presidential election which will probably be decided 
in a runoff 
arena is considered likely to get the biggest share of the vote 
but not a majority in the first round 
the christian democratic split produces a confusing situation in 
the legislature seventeen of the partys 22 legislators are loyal 
to rey prendes how the new faction will vote remains to be seen 
duarte who is suffering from terminal cancer told journalists 
saturday the split was a shame but now its a fact and we 
just have to press ahead

panama will boycott a panama canal 
commission meeting because the united states invited an ambassador 
loyal to ousted president eric arturo delvalle and denied entry 
visas for two delegates an official said 
oyden ortega one of four panamanian delegates to the 
commission told a news conference monday the united states had 
invited juan b sosa whom it recognizes as panamas ambassador to 
washington to attend the oct 1213 meeting in new orleans 
he said sosas presence introduces an element of politics into 
the canal commission meetings and an institutional meeting would 
have been preferable 
ortega said panama would send a document to us commission 
members stating that its decision to boycott the meeting did not 
affect panamas compliance with the 1977 panama canal treaties 
the commission oversees administration of the canal until dec 
31 1999 when panama is to assume full responsibility for the 
waterway that connects the atlantic and pacific oceans 
sosa served as panamas envoy under delvalle who was deposed in 
february after he tried to fire gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega panamas de facto ruler as head of the defense forces is 
under us indictment on drug trafficking charges noriega denies 
any wrongdoing 
the reagan administration continues to recognize delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president 
ortega said the united states denied a visa to maj daniel 
delgado panamas executive director for treaty affairs for what 
he called political declarations against the united states 
delegate arnulfo suarez also was denied a us visa but ortega 
declined to say why 
in july panama ordered its commission representatives not to 
attend a scheduled meeting in savannah ga because of us 
sanctions against noriega 
in the panamanians absence the five american members voted to 
suspend commission regulations calling for at least two of its four 
annual meetings to be held in panama

the primary plutonium processing facility at the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant outside denver has been shut down 
because of a minor safety incident that happened last month 
the department of energy said 
the doe and rockwell international corp which operates the 
plant under contract for the doe said there was no leak of 
radioactive material 
there was no release of any radioactive material in the 
building nor any threat to the public or the environment 
rockwell said in a news release 
but the doe said three people were tested for potential health 
effects neither the doe nor rockwell on saturday said why the 
employees underwent health tests 
the rocky flats plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons and the affected building processes manufacturing wastes 
back to pure plutonium 
rockwell spokesman ed heintz said monday the shutdown would not 
affect production elsewhere at the plant he said the buildings 
575 employees would not be laid off during the shutdown the plant 
employs 5000 people 
however richard w starostecki the does top safety expert 
said in an interview published in tuesdays editions of the new 
york times that the shutdown was in a building where classified 
work vital to the entire plants operation is performed the 
shutdown essentially halts all production at the plant the 
official said in washington 
the incident occurred sept 29 in building 771 at the plant 16 
miles northwest of denver and the doe said activities in the 
building were halted saturday 
heintz would not elaborate on the incident he said it would be 
up to the doe to decide when the building reopens and a restart 
team was formed saturday 
starostecki said the order came about after a doe inspector and 
two rockwell employees were contaminated by plutonium when they 
unwittingly walked into an unmarked room where maintenance and 
cleanup work was being performed on plutonium contaminated 
equipment 
rockwell will conduct a semiannual inventory of nuclear 
materials in the building during the shutdown the doe said 
the doe said rockwell curtailed maintenance and construction 
activities in the building last tuesday to review the situation 
the review determined among other things that airborne 
radioactive contamination levels were within doeenvironmental 
protection agency guidelines but higher than doe goals 
early this year a doe team reported serious concerns with 
radiation monitoring practices at the weapons plant the team spent 
a week auditing the plant and plutonium processing paying what it 
termed close attention to the calibration of plant radiation 
measurement equipment 
at another nuclear weapons plant the savannah river plant near 
aiken sc it was disclosed last week that up to 30 significant 
mishaps occurred at the plant over the past three decades and that 
many had not been reported to washington or disclosed to the public 
all three reactors at the savannah river plant have been shut 
down since august when a mishap idled one of the reactors the 
plant makes two materials used in nuclear weapons plutonium and 
tritium

the agriculture department has a new cookbook 
this fall for school cafeterias which includes some new recipes 
laborsaving tips and a little pizazz for the pinto beans 
in all there are 161 recipes in the revised publication 
quantity recipes for type a school lunches the first new model 
since 1971 
school meals are served to 24 million children in 90000 schools 
across the country 
assistant secretary john w bode says food service has changed 
dramatically since the previous recipes were issued 17 years ago 
the new ones he says feature more optional ingredients and 
seasonings to reflect regional food preferences 
the recipes were developed over two years under a 320000 
contract plus another year and 2 million to print and distribute 
90000 copies free to state agencies and regional offices 
development included surveys of state agencies a taste panel and 
test schools 
under the lunch program usda provides about 37 billion in 
cash grants and commodity donations to participating school 
districts 
the perpupil costs of meals can vary greatly usda provides 
subsidies according to the family income of school children those 
subsidies range from about 160 per meal for meals provided free 
of charge to povertylevel homes to less than 27 cents per meal for 
children from affluent families 
according to the departments food and nutrition service the 
new recipe file includes variations of recipes where 
appropriate and makes good use of usdadonated commodities to 
help keep down the cost of lunches 
some nutrition experts have criticized school menus for allowing 
too much fat sugar and salt in the meals one group public voice 
for food and health policy recently said that while school meals 
have improved they still fall short of usdas own dietary 
guidelines 
the agencys report said that to the extent practical and 
acceptable moderation of added sugar fat and salt was taken 
into consideration when the revised recipes were drafted 
however no arbitrary levels of any one ingredient was 
specified in the contract the report said the recipes were 
never intended to be therapeutic in nature 
the report added certainly added sugar fat and salt was a 
major consideration but they were also balanced with the many 
other constraints inherent in quantity food production systems and 
in particular to the uniqueness of school feeding programs and 
their regulated meal patterns 
about half of the 161 recipes in the new file are popular 
revisions of ones in the old set 
schools continue to serve spaghetti lasagna and oatmeal 
cookies the report said all recipes were restandardized 
improved preparation methods and ingredient choices were 
incorporated into the recipes keeping in mind the need to work 
efficiently and still please student appetites 
the contract specified that recipes not only be acceptable but 
accommodate regional and local needs and preferences where 
possible alternative ingredients are allowed such as the use of 
pinto or kidney beans in the chili con carne recipe 
for example cheddar cheese is a suggested garnish for the 
chili and canned green chili peppers may be used or not used in 
cornbread and nacho cheese sauce the report said and because 
mexican and italian flavors rank so high in childrens food 
preferences master seasoning mix recipes have been included which 
can be adjusted to accommodate local food preferences 
a nutrients per serving table gives the values for 15 
different nutrients on all recipes 
the agency said the recipes also eliminate as many preparation 
steps and pieces of cooking equipment as possible and lists 
laborsaving alternative ingredients such as dehydrated onions

sanctions imposed by congress in 1986 against 
south africa have begun to bite into us buying and investment 
there congressional investigators say 
congress imposed the sanctions because of south africas policy 
of racial discrimination against its nonwhite majority overriding 
a veto by president reagan in the process 
the congressional general accounting office analyzed data for 
the first nine months of 1987 and found that south africas major 
exports to the united states declined by 417 million compared with 
the same period the year before the biggest losses were in iron 
and steel and uranium 
twentythree industrialized and newly industrializing countries 
are major south african trading partners but the others have not 
taken up the slack the gao found 
south africa has not been able to replace its former exports 
to the united states of these commodities by redirecting trade to 
the other 22 nations and has suffered further losses in exports to 
these countries as well said the report to sens edward kennedy 
dmass and lowell weicker rconn both of whom supported the 
sanctions 
the total loss in south african sales was put at 469 million 
the report listed west germany japan canada italy and hong kong 
as making the deepest cuts after the united states their 
reductions were considerably less than those of the united states 
however the biggest drop just under 70 million was in west 
german purchases 
south african sales would have fallen even more had taiwan not 
gone against the trend and increased its purchases by 164 million 
the report said 
us investments in south africa also fell in 1987 the report 
found although total us investment is still up from the level of 
1984 
us investments in south africa increased nearly 10 percent 
from 1984 to 1986 from 204 billion to 223 billion before 
declining in 1987 after sanctions were imposed by about 5 percent 
to 212 billion 
despite more than half of us companies withdrawing since 
1984 the value of us direct investments in south africa has 
increased 4 percent the report said this increase is largely 
the result of significant reinvested earnings 
in 1987 american companies reinvested 94 million of their 
profits in south africa the sanctions law banned new investment

the failure of congress to agree on revisions 
to the clean air act leaves more than a hundred polluted cities and 
rural areas and their state governments in a nevernever land 
says one of their washington representatives 
these are the areas all urban except for five rural counties 
in maine that didnt meet the deadline last dec 31 for complying 
with federal clean air standards for ozone and carbon monoxide 
the environmental protection agency says it will now go ahead 
with requirements for steady progress toward the standards with 
punishments for those who thumb their noses don clay acting 
assistant administrator for air pollution programs said last week 
that the agency hopes to adopt its longdiscussed policy by the end 
of the year 
bill becker executive director of the association of state and 
territorial air pollution control administrators said in an 
interview he doubts that epa can act that quickly 
were not asking epa to sit idly by and do nothing but it 
should be congress and not epa that decides for how long the 
deadline should be extended he said 
the real danger is that congress will not act next year 
either clay said the agency would be derelict in its duty if 
it did not go ahead 
becker said he believes a presidential victory for michael 
dukakis would be more likely than a george bush victory to produce 
an epa leadership that would insist on its own look at the policy 
all the major proposals congress considered would have extended 
compliance deadlines by varying periods according to the 
seriousness of the local air pollution problem some areas might 
have won 15 more years 
some members of congress backed up by the general accounting 
office argue that epa is required to act against cities that 
failed to meet the standards 
epa however maintains that the law does not mean sanctions for 
simple failure to meet the numbers but for failure to submit a 
plan showing how the numbers would be met 
the agency plans to ban construction of major new sources of 
ozoneforming pollution in 12 areas and has already done so in 
three greater los angeles greater chicago and ventura county 
calif the sacramento area is next with action expected about dec 
1 
the other areas are cleveland east st louis ill the indiana 
suburbs of louisville ky atlanta denver reno nev and in 
california kern and fresno counties 
its not clear how much of a punishment this is it covers only 
plants emitting more than 100 tons a year of chemicals that form 
ozone the agency also may withhold federal highway aid and certain 
other money in some circumstances 
mayors and city officials should not be fearful that epa will 
impose sanctions for failure to attain the standards but there 
is the possibility some group may sue the agency over its 
interpretation becker said 
epas arsenal of plans according to becker contains many 
useful weapons but we had reservations about epa saying youre 
responsible independently of political considerations 
independently of resource constraints 
last november epa unveiled a draft of its plans in case congress 
failed to act starting with a call for new control plans from the 
states 
to win epas approval those plans were supposed to show an 
annual average reduction in the major pollutants or their 
precursors of 3 percent per year 
thats tough because the 3 percent reduction would have to come 
in addition to any reductions that resulted from measures that epa 
requires for the whole country 
clay declined to say last week whether the 3 percent figure 
would survive in the final regulation but he did say the concept 
of steady progress would be incorporated 
beckers group argued that a uniform 3 percent requirement is 
too tough and that it should be tailored to the locality it may 
be that federal measures will do 80 percent of the job in some 
areas and only 20 percent in others he said 
examples of the federal measures are tighter gasoline volatility 
limits and refueling vapor recovery systems for cars that epa says 
it plans to require by the end of this year 
gasoline vapor is a major smogforming raw material and epa now 
believes these two measures could reduce smog formation by 20 
percent or 30 percent in some dirty areas 
new york new jersey and the six new england states are adopting 
strict volatility limits on their own effective next summer and 
are planning to adopt the california auto exhaust standards 
stricter than the federal requirements

broadcasters and freespeech defenders say a 
new law that will ban indecent material from radio and 
television is unconstitutional and they are preparing to challenge 
the measure in court 
congress passed the blanket prohibition because of complaints by 
some lawmakers that the federal communications commission was 
allowing the airwaves to be sullied with smut 
the fact that this is an election year however did not go 
unnoticed others in congress say 
its an electionyear fear said rep neal smith diowa 
who argued on the house floor that a ban would be found 
unconstitutional it was just a fear that someone might think 
they were for pornography or obscenity 
obscenity is banned on radio and tv at all times but the fcc 
allows a category of less offensive material termed indecent 
to be broadcast when children are unlikely to be listening or 
watching 
were not talking about obscenity but material that has a lot 
of societal value artistic literary even political merit and 
because the definition is so broad it could be considered 
indecent said timothy b dyk a lawyer representing 
freedomofspeech advocates 
the fcc had set midnight to 6 am as a safe harbor for the 
socalled indecent material but a federal appeals court in 
washington last summer said the commission failed to make a case 
for those hours and ordered a review 
the new law appears to make that review moot now the fcc must 
come up with a new set of rules to ban indecency by jan 31 1989 
overtheair broadcasts but not cable programming would be 
covered 
representatives of broadcasting companies first amendment 
advocates and civil liberties defenders that earlier challenged the 
fccs indecency rules met recently to discuss the impending ban 
said dyk lead attorney in the appeals court case 
its safe to predict that some or all of the original group 
will challenge the new law he said 
in the earlier case decided july 29 by the us court of 
appeals for the district of columbia the court makes plain that 
banning indecent material during the entire 24hour period is 
plainly unconstitutional dyk said 
the senate passed the ban in july after its sponsor sen jesse 
helms rnc alleged that the fcc was permitting broadcasters to 
air programs that included disgusting bestiality sodomy and 
child sex 
garbage is garbage no matter what the time of day or night may 
be helms said on the senate floor he offered no specifics 
the fcc last year lowered its window for the socalled indecent 
broadcasts moving the cutoff time from 10 pm to midnight the 
commission had refrained from an aroundtheclock ban because it 
said court rulings have held that the first amendment protects 
indecent speech allowing restrictions only to keep such material 
away from children 
peggy charren president of the cambridge massbased action 
for childrens television agreed that electionyear politics 
clearly is behind the new prohibition on indecency 
pornography is one thing nobodys for that but thats not 
what is being talked about here indecency is not child 
pornography she said 
people who worry about keeping speech away from children are 
the kind of people who burn books who reedit textbooks who want 
to torch television programs and that is never the way to deal with 
a speech problem for anybody including children she said 
charrens group was one of the many involved in the appeals 
court case decided in july two days after the senate passed its 
ban it cited a 1978 supreme court ruling in reaffirming that 
indecent speech is protected by the first amendment 
it also upheld the fccs definition of indecency as material 
that depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as 
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast 
medium sexual or excretory activities or organs 
even some at the fcc are concerned about the constitutionality 
of the new ban but fcc commissioner james h quello said its 
law and we have to enforce it 
im for everything we can do to curb obscenity but this might 
be going farther than the constitution intended he said

inmate willie horton jr into a symbol of what he calls opponent 
michael dukakis liberal views 
it was horton who while on furlough from the massachusetts 
prison where he was serving time for murder brutally slashed a 
maryland man and twice raped his fiancee last year he is now 
behind bars in maryland 
because dukakis as massachusetts governor was in charge of the 
prison system at the time bush sees the horton incident as a 
political mother lode while polls place crime somewhere in the 
middle of voters concerns it is closely linked to the drug issue 
which rides atop the worry list 
national crime statistics released this weekend show crime up 
18 percent last year ending a fiveyear decline and 347 million 
people were victimized by criminals nearly one in three american 
households 
it has tremendous saliency said gop political consultant 
eddie mahe it ties into the drug issue so closely everybody 
knows the drug problem is driving the crime problem through the 
roof 
bush had made crime and horton in particular the basis for 
antidukakis campaign speeches and a television spot highlighting 
the crime issue and he has recruited hortons victim cliff 
barnes who was cut 22 times in the stomach as a campaign 
surrogate deputy bush press secretary mark goodin even keeps a 
photo of horton on the wall in his office 
i didnt ask to be brought into this barnes said monday at 
a news conference in texas i didnt invite willie horton to my 
house and i didnt let him out of prison 
the attack has been going on for weeks and dukakis was at first 
slow to respond but now the democratic campaign is fighting back 
and hoping the emotionalism of bushs message will backfire by 
election day 
over the weekend dukakis called bush shameless for using 
crime victims to win votes 
unlike mr bush ive been a chief executive on the front 
lines of fighting crime unlike mr bush who will not take 
responsibility for anything i as chief executive took full 
responsibility for that tragic horton case and acted to change that 
policy dukakis said referring to his signing of a state law in 
april revoking furloughs for firstdegree murderers 
dukakis also has put together a television spot that seeks to 
shove the issue back at bush the ad cites a 1981 rape and murder 
carried out by an inmate staying at a houston halfway house that 
bush helped start while he was a congressman 
dukakis says two similar murders occurred under the california 
furlough system in the early 1970s at a time when ronald reagan 
then state governor supported furloughs 
dukakis also points to a 13 percent drop in violent crime in 
massachusetts since 1982 the largest decline among major 
industrial states he says that as the states chief executive he 
had to face real problems of running the massachusetts prison 
system while bush has never been tested on the issue 
far from being out of the mainstream the massachusetts law 
allowing prison furloughs is in line with the rest of the nation a 
1987 national survey found that all 50 states the district of 
columbia and the federal prison system have some provision for 
granting shortterm furloughs for prisoners and twothirds of them 
permit furloughs for prisoners serving life terms 
bushs use of the issue is an oversimplification of a real 
complex thing said emily herrick an editor with contact inc 
the nonprofit criminal justice information organization that 
conducted the survey 
more than 200000 furloughs were granted last year for 53000 
inmates the survey found no murders were reported all but three 
states hawaii oregon and north carolina had success rates in 
excess of 90 percent meaning the inmates returned at the appointed 
time and place without violating terms of the furlough 
bush hit the crime issue again monday renewing his proposals to 
create an antigang unit in the justice department spend more 
money to build prisons and bolster programs to compensate crime 
victims 
i think there is something very wrong when there is so much 
sympathy for criminals and very little left over for victims 
bush told a campaign crowd in trenton nj frankly lawabiding 
americans are fed up with the cruel and unusual punishment 
inflicted on them by those who are soft on crime 
despite his rhetoric bush has been short on specifics asked 
what he would do about the furlough issue the vice president has 
said only that as president he would have his attorney general 
review the federal prison systems policies 
i dont have any specific feelings at all he said although 
he said he wants to make sure the federal system doesnt slip 
into the massachusetts model

an 8000pound pressurized lid 
shot through the roof of an aerospace manufacturing plant monday in 
an explosion that killed two people and injured four others 
authorities said 
the explosion at reinhold industries occurred about 230 pm 
when contractors were testing a hydroclave steampressure unit used 
in the production of aerospace components said los angeles county 
sheriffs deputy chris wahla 
it was like being in a war said city fire capt phil pepin 
this building just blew up and there were fragments of sheet 
metal going everywhere 
as pressure was being increased during installation of the 
machine the lid blasted loose and shot 25 feet through the sheet 
metal roof pepin said 
there were wires arcing all the machinery inside was torn 
apart and all the windows were blown out the captain said 
adding that pieces of metal and piping were hurled as far as 100 
feet 
pepin said firefighters were at the plant for a routine 
inspection when the blast occurred investigators were still at the 
scene five hours later five other hydroclave units were undamaged 
and operating wahla said 
one critically injured burn victim was flown to the burn center 
at torrance memorial hospital and the three others were taken to 
local hospitals wahla said names of the dead and injured were not 
immediately released 
the blast caused telephone and electrical outages in the area 15 
miles southeast of downtown los angeles 
one portion of the building was totally demolished where the 
equipment went through part of the roof said fire marshall stan 
boettcher he added that unseasonable temperatures in the high 90s 
didnt appear to have contributed to the explosion 
heat is developed in their manufacturing process so i dont 
think climatic heat had anything to do with it 
boettcher said the company made airplane propellers and nose 
caps and nose cones for rockets and aircraft 
about 580 customers were briefly without electricity after the 
blast said pat messigian a southern california edison 
spokeswoman power was restored in 25 minutes she said

texas democrats watched in dismay the past 
several weeks as republican presidential nominee george bush 
pounded rival michael dukakis on gun control crime and the pledge 
of allegiance 
but in the wake of vice presidential nominee and texas sen 
lloyd bentsens debate success democrats say the lone star state 
and its third largest election day prize of 29 electoral votes 
once again is up for grabs 
i was kind of down in the dumps a couple of weeks ago we were 
pinned down on the beach for a while but now were getting air 
support and were going to drive those folks back said ed 
martin executive director of the texas democratic party 
hours after last weeks vice presidential debate dukakis and 
bentsen campaigned in east texas while the democratic ticket 
unleashed new ads rebutting bushs claim that dukakis is soft on 
crime 
the commercials recount the story of a prison inmate who in 1981 
raped and murdered a woman while he was staying at a houston 
halfway house that bush then a houston congressman helped start 
the ads are in response to the case of willie horton a 
convicted felon who brutalized a maryland couple while he was on a 
weekend pass from a massachusetts prison 
republicans however suggest that the democratic ticket has run 
aground in texas and is weighing a retreat 
the numbers that we are seeing is that he dukakis is 
continuing to slide said mark sanders bushs campaign spokesman 
in texas 
a poll conducted last week by the atlanta journalconstitution 
in 15 southern and border states found bush leading dukakis by 14 
percentage points in texas 
rumors that the dukakisbentsen campaign is considering 
withdrawing its forces are just that according to the democratic 
party 
thats the kind of rumor that comes from republican campaign 
managers who must have been snorting something panama strongman 
manuel antonio noriega sent them martin said 
campaign 88 which is the ticketwide democratic party campaign 
has 110 paid staffers most of them working in the field said 
matthew dowd director of operations 
the dukakisbentsen campaign has 13 paid staffers in the state 
the party plans to spend about 3 million in advertising in the 
final weeks of the campaign but that money is separate from the 
public funds the dukakisbentsen ticket will receive dowd said 
this race is going to be close its going right down to the 
wire if we can put texas in that democratic column and im 
convinced we will then were going to win this election bentsen 
said last week while campaigning in dallas 
the texas senator also is running for reelection this year 
under a state law passed in 1959 that allowed lyndon b johnson to 
run for the senate while campaigning for national office 
dukakis state campaign manager tom cosgrove said dukakis has 
been picking up momentum in texas since before the first 
presidential debate sept 25 
democrats say the vice presidential debate was a knockout win 
for bentsen especially his senator you are no jack kennedy 
putdown of gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle that was the 
kind of tough jab that plays well in texas they said 
democratic party pollster al quinlan said the ticket has 
improved since the debates 
its a combination of doubts about quayle and partially the 
fact that dukakis has put the campaign on track the bush onslaught 
seems to have worn thin about eight to 10 days ago there are a lot 
of reagan democrats that are coming home quinlan said 
no democrat has ever won the white house without winning texas 
republicans though boast that bush will face little difficulty 
in the lone star state 
i dont think it is particularly competitive if we continue 
to do what weve been doing theres no way we can lose it bush 
campaign manager lee atwater said last week 
the texas bush campaign and the fundraising victory 88 
organization has 44 paid staffers 18 of whom are with the bush 
campaign sanders said the campaign will hit major media markets 
and surrogate teams will crisscross the state to speak on behalf of 
bush 
sanders declined to say how much they would spend in texas 
while confident state republicans are still cautious 
were taking nothing for granted said deputy campaign 
director reggie bashur weve got to run hard each and every day 
weve got to continue to beat the drum what they do thats their 
business

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle still trying to put his stumbling response at last weeks 
debate behind him is giving what he says is his final word on 
what steps he would take if thrust unexpectedly into the presidency 
even as he insisted to reporters monday as he arrived in ohio 
that his campaign was on a roll quayle continued to face 
questions on the issue as well as questions about whether he is a 
drag on the gop ticket 
quayle tries a new wrinkle in his campaign today with a 
grassroots approach a daylong bus trip through small towns of 
western ohio 
he gave his most detailed response to date when asked after a 
detroit speech how he now would answer the question put to him at 
last weeks debate with lloyd bentsen his democratic counterpart 
during the debate quayle said he would say a prayer and summon 
his advisers the next day quayle revised the answer in speeches 
by saying he would continue george bushs policies 
during a questionandanswer session monday after an economics 
speech in detroit quayle called the debate question totally 
inappropriate because it was completely hypothetical 
he said he would as a new president make a request to talk to 
the nation and he would consult with allies but he said his 
other responses would depend on the situation 
obviously you do different things under an assassination the 
first thing you do in an assassination i would still say a prayer 
for myself and the nation but the first thing you do is you get 
on the phone and call the head of the cia and see what he thinks it 
was you dont convene a cabinet meeting right away quayle said 
you get your secretary of defense your national security 
adviser your secretary of state and meet with them immediately in 
the situation of an illness it would be a different type of 
situation he said 
quayle said he would have contingency plans under different 
situations 
and ill tell you what im not going to go out and hold a 
news conference about it im going to put it in a safe and keep it 
there he said heatedly 
speaking to reporters later aboard his campaign plane quayle 
said of his latest response to the question thats the final 
word 
quayle was also asked about polls indicating he continues to 
bring negatives to the bushquayle ticket 
a los angeles times poll released monday showed the two tickets 
were in a virtual dead heat 44 percent for the republicans to 41 
percent for the democrats but bush leads dukakis 4839 if the two 
candidates are presented as running alone the poll had a margin of 
error of five percentage points in either direction 
quayle said he was absolutely not a drag on the ticket 
crowds had responded positively to him after the debate he said 
we will continue to do what were charged with doing and that 
is going to the key states like ohio going to states where its on 
the margin and the reason im being sent to those places is 
because im an asset to the ticket he said 
quayle also defended his assertions made during the detroit 
speech that the reaganbush administration kept our commitment 
to the truly needy 
he had not mentioned in the speech that the reagan 
administration has consistently proposed cuts in programs for 
education health and the needy congress refused to go along with 
some of the proposed cuts resulting in the increases quayle 
praised 
the fact of the matter is that what the president signed into 
law and what were spending today was up significantly in all of 
those categories quayle told reporters on the plane 
but the figures quayle cited in his speech left room for debate 
he said for example that federal education spending has grown by 
38 percent during the reagan years however the reagan 
administration has asked for significant reductions in federal 
education assistance in every year except for the current one 
quayle cited pell grants for lower and moderate income students 
an area he said had grown 64 percent during the reagan years but 
the reagan administration proposed a 38 percent cut in pell grants 
for fiscal 1983 30 percent for 1986 and 30 percent for 1988 cuts 
that congress refused to go along with 
quayle noted that the aid to families with dependent children 
program grew about 32 percent during the reagan years however 
fewer families are eligible for such assistance because of tighten 
eligibility requirements proposed by the administration 
the figures also do not take into account inflation which for 
the 198188 period was a cumulative 299 percent

the veterans administrations chief medical 
officer ordered changes in a study of mortality rates at va 
hospitals to avoid inevitable criticism of the agency based on 
the initial findings according to a published report today 
the washington post reported that the initial study had found 
that as many as 12 percent of the va facilities had excessively 
high death rates by using a more rigorous statistical level in the 
revised study that rate was dropped to just 35 percent the 
newspaper said 
dr john a gronvall acknowledged in an interview with the post 
that he ordered va officials to come up with a lower percentage out 
of fear that the va could not withstand criticism that 
inevitably would result from comparison with mortality rates at 
private hospitals 
the federal health care financing agency had found in a separate 
study that 25 percent of the nations private hospitals had 
higherthanexpected mortality rates 
gronvalls action caused a strong protest from the late dr 
francis e conrad the vas director of quality assurance who said 
the action might seem selfserving and could make the va 
vulnerable to charges of a coverup 
the post said conrad in a memo prepared for a jan 29 meeting 
wrote that the pr public relations potential for negative 
reaction is certainly a factor to be considered from a high 
mortality rate finding but it can be countered and is short 
lived in any event 
gronvall the vas senior medical executive told the post there 
was no truth to conrads belief that he was trying to cover up 
problems at the va which long has been plagued by questions about 
the quality of medical care at its 172 hospitals 
that is wholly outrageous and inappropriate comment 
gronvall said of the coverup allegation 
before the meeting between conrad and gronvall conrad had 
prepared a statistical model patterned after one used by hcfa in 
its private hospital study like the hcfa study the post said 
conrad initially planned to test his results at what statisticians 
call a 95 percent confidence level that means the mathematical 
probability is that the results can be duplicated 95 times out of 
100 
the va however selected a higher confidence level of 99 
percent thus assuring that fewer hospitals would be suspect the 
post said 
the decision to use the 99 percent result was made after 
gronvalls intervention according to what the post described as a 
source close to the situation the newspaper did not name the 
source 
terry l thomas the va epidemiologist who handled the 
statistical work on the study told the post she could not recall 
if she made the decision to run the mortality survey at the 99 
percent rate before or after gronvall voiced concern about the 
preliminary findings 
thomas said she wasnt too happy with the study 
conrad told gronvall the 99 percent level would allow some va 
hospitals with potentially serious mortality rates to escape 
scrutiny 
gronvall said he feared the comparisons with the hcfa study 
would be inappropriate and invidious upsetting the vas 
critics in congress and elsewhere and leading to a widespread 
impression that vas medical care is much worse than that in 
private hospitals 
using the 99 percent confidence level the study came up with 
six problem hospitals or 35 percent of the 172 according to 
donna st john a va spokeswoman she and thomas said they were 
unfamiliar with the 128 percent figures mentioned by conrad in his 
briefing papers 
gronvall declined to name the six hospitals citing a decision 
by va administrator thomas k turnage to withhold the data until 
after followup studies are completed probably in late december

the shutdown of rocky flats main plutonium 
processing plant virtually halts production at the nuclear weapons 
plant and is the nations second major suspension of such 
production in two months an official said 
the building was shut down saturday because of a minor safety 
incident according to the us energy department three people 
were tested for potential health effects stemming from last 
months incident officials said 
rockwell international corp which runs the plant said no 
radioactive material was released nor was there any threat to the 
public or the environment 
rockwell spokesman ed heintz said monday that the shutdown would 
not affect other areas of the plant and the buildings 575 
employees would not be laid off during the shutdown the plant 
employs about 5000 
but richard w starostecki the energy departments top safety 
expert told the new york times that the shutdown was in a building 
where classified work vital to the entire plants operation is 
performed 
the shutdown essentially halts all production at the plant he 
said according to todays editions of the newspaper 
all three reactors at another nuclear weapons plant the 
savannah river plant near aiken sc have been shut down since 
august when a mishap idled one of the reactors the plant makes 
plutonium and tritium which are used in nuclear weapons 
there are 13 other major production waste and research plants 
in 12 states involved in nuclear weapons production 
the rocky flats incident occurred sept 29 in building 771 at 
the plant 15 miles northwest of denver heintz who didnt 
elaborate on the incident said it would be up to the energy 
department to decide to reopen the building and a restart team 
already had been set up 
speaking in washington starostecki said the order came about 
after an energy department inspector and two rockwell employees 
were contaminated by plutonium when they walked into an unmarked 
room where maintenance and cleanup work was being performed on 
plutoniumcontaminated equipment 
rockwell will conduct a semiannual inventory of nuclear 
materials in the building during the shutdown the energy 
department said 
it said rockwell curtailed maintenance and construction in the 
building oct 4 to review the situation the review determined 
among other things that airborne radioactive contamination levels 
were within government guidelines but higher than department of 
energy goals 
early this year an energy department team reported serious 
concerns with radiation monitoring practices at the plant the 
team spent a week auditing the plant and plutonium processing 
paying what it termed close attention to the calibration of plant 
radiation measurement equipment 
at the savannah river plant it was disclosed last week that up 
to 30 significant mishaps occurred during the past three decades 
and that many had not been reported to washington or disclosed to 
the public

a nova scotia gourd grower pounded the 
competition with a superheavyweight pumpkin that tipped the scales 
at a nearrecord 633 pounds an international victory he says 
came without steroids 
keith chapel 56 gleefully denied a mischievous suggestion that 
he may have used anabolic steroids on his entry to win mondays 
international pumpkin association world weighoff 
oh no said chapel responding to the allegation 
the question came in light of drug scandals that plagued the 
summer olympics at seoul including the case of canadian sprinter 
ben johnson who was stripped of his gold medal when officials 
found hed used the banned drug that bolsters muscle building but 
has many harmful side effects 
chapel a schoolteacher when hes not growing pumpkins spoke 
over a loudspeaker during an international conference call from 
canada heard on the steps of san francisco city hall 
his entry which competed with plump pumpkins from the united 
states england and japan won him 2000 and a trip to san 
francisco 
englands 317pound entry grown by ron butcher was weighed in 
a pub where cries of encouragement echoed across the city hall 
steps some 5000 miles away 
but japans shoji sjirai wasnt so lucky his 513pound pumpkin 
broke into pieces on its way to the scale the international 
contest accepted the 313pound entry from hiroshi sawa instead 
chapels wife ruth also entered the contest but chapel said 
he didnt think she was cruelly disappointed at placing behind 
her husband 
hers was a squash chapel diplomatically noted saying that 
pumpkins are in their own class fruits with trailing vines 
contest spokeswoman terry pimsleur said the other winners would 
receive prizes including ribbons and will be invited to the great 
halloween amp pumpkin festival here later this month 
a canadian also won last years international pumpkin 
association world weighoff arthur bessey of york prince edward 
island weighed in with a winning 408pound pumpkin 
the largest pumpkin ever grown according to the 1988 guinness 
book of world records was a 671pound gourd raised by robert 
gancarz of jacobstown nj in october 1986 it measured 11 feet 
11 inches in circumference

hobbled by an independent challenge that 
has siphoned off some of his conservative support republican gov 
norm bangerter is a distinct underdog in his bid for a second term 
democrat ted wilson holds a doubledigit lead in the polls and 
independent merrill cook commands the loyality of republicans who 
blame the governor for the biggest tax increase in utah history 
however bangerter and his supporters contend there is time 
before novembers election to reclaim the support that swept him 
into office four years ago as utahs first republican governor in 
two decades 
the polls are tightening and i think norm could pull this 
out charles akerlow former state gop chairman said recently 
hes running hard and running scared and consequently running 
very well 
we think we can win it with a good turnout and a good showing 
by vice president george bush and republican sen orrin 
hatch said campaign manager dave buhler 
bangerters biggest problem has not been wilson former mayor of 
salt lake city but his own record 
elected in 1984 with 56 percent of the vote bangerter saw his 
popularity plummet two years later after he cajoled a bipartisan 
majority in the legislature into passing a record 166 million tax 
increase 
he also has been sharply criticized for a 60 million pumping 
project launched just as the state entered a long dry spell to 
control flooding on the great salt lake and for the slow recovery 
of utahs lackluster economy 
the higher taxes spawned a movement that drafted cook owner of 
a mining explosives company to carry its taxlimitation message to 
voters 
despite an 80 million refund and tax cut approved by the 
legislature in august support for cook has grown from around 9 
percent last spring to 16 percent in a sept 25 survey published by 
the salt lake tribune 
the survey of 600 voters gave wilson a 4929 lead over bangerter 
with 5 percent undecided the margin of error was plus or minus 4 
percentage points 
bangerter said cooks support among republicans and conservative 
independents has made it difficult for him to highlight his 
differences with wilson 
cooks supporters are conservative voters and conservative 
voters generally vote for republicans i think its been proven im 
much more conservative fiscally and in every other way than ted 
wilson and so it skews that bangerter said 
bangerter also has been hurt by three taxlimitation 
initiatives endorsed by cook that will be on the ballot 
bangerter and wilson oppose the measures which would reduce state 
and local government revenue by about 300 million or more 
they sort of remind everybody that it was norm who raised 
taxes in the first place said akerlow 
akerlow said that bangerter also might actually benefit from 
cooks candidacy if cook continues to pull support from wilson and 
splits the vote enough for bangerter to win without a majority

striking workers at international paper co 
mills in three states concede they lost their sometimes violent 
16month battle with the company but vow to continue pressing for 
better working conditions 
the united paperworkers international union abruptly announced 
an end to strikes at international paper mills in maine wisconsin 
and pennsylvania saying the move would give the 2300 strikers the 
first shot at any jobs vacated by the nonunion workers running the 
mills 
this stage of the war is over said felix jacques executive 
vice president of local 14 we have lost this battle but the war 
for justice in the workplace is not over 
the workers including 1200 at the jay plant went on strike 
june 16 1987 when the union rejected a concessionary contract 
the company imposed the contract and kept the plants open with 
replacement workers 
the key unresolved issues included the companys demand to end 
double time for employees who worked sundays and holidays and to 
eliminate more than 175 jobs by changing work rules 
william meserve the locals president said the strikes were 
halted because the company was willing to spend hundreds of 
millions of dollars to try to break the unions or make them 
ineffective 
jacques said the national union could not provide the support 
needed to continue the strike much longer the 55 weekly payments 
to the strikers were scheduled to be suspended in six weeks he 
said 
its not that we dont want to fight its just that we 
cant said striker roland samson we have nothing to fight 
with 
jacques notified his grimfaced members at a news conference 
monday one day after presidents of upiu locals at the three mills 
had reached their decision at union headquarters in nashville 
tenn the 1200 union members in jay comprised the largest group of 
strikers 
a mill spokesman here acknowledged that by calling off the 
strike the union members gained the right to be given preference 
for any openings but he said the mill was at full complement 
and hires new employees at an average of only three per week 
as openings occur we will welcome workers who have been on 
strike who qualify for those openings said the spokesman 
richard white he emphasized that no replacements would be asked to 
leave 
international paper one of the worlds largest paper companies 
has said the strike had little effect on production shareholders 
net earnings during the first half of 1988 were 347 million 
compared with 180 million for the period last year white said 
net sales rose from 37 billion for the period last year to 47 
billion this year 
strikes also were halted at international paper mills in de 
pere wis and lock haven pa the action had no direct impact on 
the mobile ala mill where the company has locked out more than 
1000 union members 
the union had sought to consolidate the disputes at the four 
mills but with little success 
during the strike this mill in this central maine town of 4000 
had been the scene of boisterous rallies marches and occasional 
violence and vandalism that led to court orders limiting activities 
on the picket line 
a series of chemical leaks and accidents at the mill heightened 
tensions in recent months with the union blaming the problems on 
the new workers inexperience

three bombs exploded in the capital 
and injured at least six people today a day after five people died 
during a nationwide strike to protest the governments peace 
overtures to tamil rebels 
authorities believe the bombs were planted by the peoples 
liberation front a radical sinhalese group that called mondays 
strike said as seneviratne deputy inspectorgeneral of police 
troops and police cordoned off the area of the blasts and 
conducted search operations seneviratne said a number of 
suspects have been taken in for questioning 
two bombs exploded in the business center of colombo while a 
third went off near a supermarket in a suburb of the city he said 
the peoples liberation front says a peace accord aimed at 
ending the 5yearold civil war grants too many concessions to the 
tamils who are fighting for an independent homeland in the 
northeastern province 
the group has vowed to kill all supporters of the accord and is 
blamed for at least 500 deaths since the agreement was signed on 
july 29 1987 
tamil insurgents have been fighting for a separate state since 
1983 claiming they are discriminated against by the majority 
sinhalese at least 8500 people have been killed in the fighting 
two bombs had exploded in colombo on monday during the strike 
injuring four people including two soldiers 
five people died and four others were injured monday when police 
opened fire on a group of sinhalese demonstrators who attacked a 
police station in the town of matara about 85 miles south of 
colombo 
meanwhile the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest and 
most militant rebel group said it was not responsible for the 
killing sunday of 47 sinhalese villagers in a northern village 
the aim of this malicious report is to discredit our 
organization said a statement from the tigers office in london 
the victims including 13 women and 18 children were killed 
while they slept in the village of ulukulama 150 miles northeast 
of colombo one military official who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules had said the massacre was clearly the work of the 
tigers 
the killings were the worst burst of violence in the 
ethnicallydivided island for the past year and came a day before 
nominations to a local administrative council in the 
tamildominated northeastern province closed 
the council is a key part of the indiabrokered peace accord 
under which the tamils agreed to give up arms in exchange for 
limited autonomy the tigers accepted but later rejected the 
agreement saying it did not meet enough demands 
india sponsored the accord because 60 million tamils living in 
southern india are sympathetic to the rebel cause it sent an 
estimated 47000 peacekeeping troops to sri lanka on oct 10 1987 
to implement the plan after the tigers reneged 
other rebel groups which accepted the accord have filed 
nominations to the administrative council despite a call by the 
tigers for a boycott 
election commissioner chandrananda de silva said today that 
members of the moderate tamil groups already had been elected to 36 
of the 71 seats because they were uncontested polls are scheduled 
to be held on nov 19 for the other 35 seats which are being 
contested by tamil groups the governing united national party and 
the opposition sri lanka moslem congress he said 
tamils who are mainly hindus form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people the mostly buddhist sinhalese make up 75 percent of 
the population and control the countrys government and military

the brazilian redeyed fly which has a 
fatal attraction to the pesky and destructive mole cricket is 
successfully breeding in florida scientists say 
redeyed flies introduced in april to help control the 
crickets have been found in traps set for them around bradenton 
south of tampa an entomologist at the university of florida said 
monday 
we were a little worried until we finally found several 
pregnant flies in our traps in late august said tom walker 
but now it looks like weve established a new enemy of the mole 
cricket 
mole crickets do at least 46 million worth of damage every year 
to florida vegetable fields commercial turf operations pastures 
and golf courses according to university scientists 
were working toward reducing the mole cricket population to a 
point where it is no longer damaging said howard frank project 
coordinator at universitys institute of food and agriculture 
sciences 
we cant tell any difference yet in mole cricket populations 
well have to measure changes over several years to quantify the 
effects frank said 
the redeyed brazilian fly is about the size of a house fly 
females respond to the male mole crickets mating call and lay 
larvae on or near the male mole cricket 
the larvae burrow into the male mole cricket they come out 
about 10 days later after killing it 
now that the flies are breeding the control projects next 
obstacle is winter mole crickets are less active then and 
scientists are unsure whether the flies will survive the winter 
walker is optimistic 
were 90 percent sure well have flies next spring he said

when richard wagner put him on the operatic stage 
in 1845 tannhauser was a noble knight with one girlfriend too many 
the pagan goddess of love now hes a television evangelist with 
the same problem 
the goddess in peter sellars production of tannhauser 
which premiered monday evening at the lyric opera of chicago lives 
in a sleazy las vegas motel and is attended by nymphs wearing only 
their bikini tops for the first 90 seconds of act 1 
tannhauser himself sung by tenor richard cassilly bears a 
certain resemblance to the rev jimmy swaggart 
tannhauser confesses to his sins of the flesh during a ceremony 
at a crystal cathedral clearly modeled on the rev robert 
schullers headquarters in california in february swaggart 
confessed to committing unspecified sins against his family and 
god while a prostitute maintained he had paid her to pose nude in 
a motel room 
in the play tannhauser achieves salvation by a miracle 
performed at los angeles international airport 
there will be a bunch of things on stage that people will 
react to involuntarily sellars 33 predicted in an interview 
printed in the program i love making something just familiar 
enough and at the same time just strange enough that you feel at 
home enough to be caught off guard and to react without any 
preconceived ideas 
despite angry letters to newspapers in weeks preceding the 
premiere denouncing sellars modernization as antiwagnerian 
and antichristian no protesters picketed outside the opera 
house 
audience members noted that the histrionic gestures and language 
often used by television evangelists fit well with the highflown 
wagnerian emotionalism of the libretto 
sellars translation of the libretto into modern american 
evoked laughs during tannhausers act 1 love scene with the goddess 
venus 
titles projected above the stage had venus sung by marilyn 
zschau describing bodacious wonder and singing the blues 
and expressing such thoughts as sing it baby grab that harp 
act 2 however was played seriously as in wagners original 
tannhauser and other claimants compete in a contest of holy song 
for the hand of the virtuous heroine elisabeth portrayed by 
nadine secunde 
tannhauser unfortunately begins singing of the carnal love he 
enjoyed with venus and is condemned as a sinner 
some audience members said they found the televangelism analogy 
a good one 
theres nothing in the modern age that fits an overblown 
character like tannhauser said matthew vender venn its got 
to be a televangelist or maybe ollie north if you really wanted 
to be silly 
others were a bit mixed in their reaction to the work by 
sellars an avant garde impressario whose operatic triumphs 
included last years nixon in china 
peter sellars is always an experience said dwight casimere 
you know a given opera and you know where sellars is coming from 
he tries to get a visceral reaction and you try to figure out 
how its going to fit together to me there are always 
discrepancies there are discrepancies tonight but the music is 
great and the singing is great 
jimmy swaggart ministries in baton rouge la had no comment 
on the performance 
i have absolutely no idea what youre talking about 
ministries spokeswoman linda westbrook said monday

the us election has stalled progress 
on the central american peace plan and parties to the agreement are 
running out of time to fulfill the pact costa rican president 
oscar arias sanchez said 
arias here to announce the creation of a private peace 
foundation financed with the 1987 nobel peace prize he won for 
sponsoring the peace plan was careful to avoid blaming either us 
presidential candidate he said monday he believes either would 
bring more understanding to the region 
he urged the next us president to support the plan and warned 
against seeking military solutions in central america 
whoever is elected to the white house if they support the 
peace plan this plan is incompatible with warlike action arias 
said 
the five central american presidents who signed the original 
peace agreement are tentatively scheduled to meet again after the 
us elections possibly nov 1215 in el salvador to give the 
plan a push arias said 
almost 14 months have gone by and we cannot feel satisfied 
there has not been the will to fulfill the agreement arias said 
we are running out of time 
he did emphasize that the plan has accomplished a truce in 
nicaragua and started a dialogue among the participants though 
arias blamed nicaraguas leftist sandinistas for being 
inflexible on choosing a site for future negotiations with contra 
rebels and for hiding behind judicial technicalities in failing to 
release 38 opposition leaders arrested in violation of the plan 
during an antigovernment demonstration 
the costa rican president again rejected calls by the 
sandinistas and the contras to put an international peacekeeping 
force on the border between honduras and nicaragua and perhaps 
elsewhere to separate the feuding sides 
i do not believe it is necessary to introduce third 
countries arias said the greatness of the agreement is that 
it is a central american plan 
arias also said he would welcome efforts by fidel castro to 
achieve peace in central america noting the cuban president has a 
very strong moral commitment to leftist guerrillas in el 
salvador and guatemala and the sandinista government in nicaragua 
the costa rican president stopped in coral gables on his way to 
spain to receive the prince de asturias award that nations 
highest honor from king juan carlos he was expected to stay at 
least one day in the miami area before flying to spain 
with his wife margarita penon de arias at his side he also 
announced the creation of the arias foundation for peace and human 
progress arias said the 400000 he received for the nobel prize 
will be the seed money for the organization 
mrs arias who will head the foundation said it was aimed 
particularly at saving families victimized by war and poverty in 
central america 
the foundation will support research design projects to benefit 
children and families provide scholarships and organize 
international conferences

authorities said they would ease a curfew today in 
a southern enclave to help workers return to their jobs but they 
acknowledged that nearly yearlong strikes over armenian demands 
have ruined the regions economy 
production of goods and services in the enclave 
nagornokarabakh and the surrounding republic of azerbaijan has 
dropped below 1970 levels the communist party daily pravda said 
monday 
the armenian christian majority in nagornokarabakh wants the 
area transferred from the jurisdiction of the republic of 
azerbaijan which is predominantly moslem to neighboring armenia 
the news agency tass said monday that party and state 
representatives using personal persuasion succeeded in drawing 
workers back to 80 percent of the construction collectives in 
stepanakert the main city of nagornokarabakh 
tass also said authorities would ease a curfew imposed sept 21 
on stepanakert where troops and tanks were sent to quell ethnic 
violence to allow late shift workers to travel the curfew in 
stepanakert will run from midnight to 5 am rather than 9 pm6 
am starting today 
soviet television on monday night offered an upbeat report on 
conditions in armenia showing smiling grape pickers and saying 
that all 227 businesses in the capital yerevan were operating 
the pravda article blamed the unrest on years of corruption and 
economic problems 
in a startling aside however it quoted the former communist 
party chief in sumgait azerbaijan as blaming ethnic rioting that 
killed 32 people in that industrial city in february on exconvicts 
and local wrath over air pollution the official d muslimzadye 
said the former convicts were sent to the area after their release 
from prison 
speaking honestly i expected an explosion he said it 
had been ripening for a long time and just needed a spark it found 
one in the events in nagornokarabakh

federal officials have proposed 80 steps to 
improve operations at the nations busiest airport including 
incentives to attract experienced airtraffic controllers 
according to a report published today 
the recommendations for chicagos ohare international airport 
came in a federal aviation administration study that has not yet 
been officially released the new york times said 
the study preceded last weeks faa move to restrict ohare 
flights during peak traffic hours in response to recent controller 
errors the times said 
the study proposed higher pay and other incentives for 
controllers and recommended lightening controllers workloads by 
alleviating radio congestion and easing restrictions on the use of 
intersecting runways when they are wet from rain said the times 
todays turbojet aircraft are capable of operating safely on 
such runways in the right conditions the report said 
it further suggested locating deicing stations near where 
planes take off to ease congestion caused when aircraft must return 
to boarding gates for a second deicing after waiting too long in 
the snow 
the proposals would need approval at higher levels of the reagan 
administration before they could be enacted and some would require 
congressional legislation 
there have been 30 controller flighthandling errors so far this 
year in the chicago area which includes ohare and numerous 
satellite airfields compared to 12 during all of last year 
officials said 
the faa study was ordered aug 8 the day the national 
transportation safety board sent the agency 11 recommendations for 
safer handling of flights in the chicago area 
that list also included incentives to attract top controllers 
and suggested using simulators in their training the boards 
recommendations were prompted by earlier controller errors

rightwing extremists during a series of raids ending early today

into his home in suburban caloocan city early today oxales said 
heavily armed troops in full battle gear also surrounded a hotel 
near military headquarters before dawn tuesday but oxales denied 
published reports that the troops were looking for former lt col 
gregorio gringo honasan renegade leader of the bloody aug 28 
1987 bid to topple president corazon aquino 
oxales said the four face charges of conspiracy to commit 
rebellion robbery and sedition in connection with the june 11 raid 
on the armory at camp crame headquarters of the philippine 
constabulary

rifles the military said 
the four were presented to reporters at a press conference

elements included honasan oxales replied actually we were 
not looking for him there

premier ciriaco de mita has staked the future of his 
6monthold government on the outcome of a proposal to abolish most 
secret voting in the legislature 
but a vote on that proposal scheduled for today is itself 
secret opening the way for socalled secret snipers to go into 
action 
snipers are lawmakers who vote against their own party the 
practice erodes party solidarity and has weakened many of italys 
48 postwar governments 
however supporters of closed voting contend that because of the 
tight discipline demanded by most parties a lawmaker can only 
maintain independence in secret 
closed voting can allow the communists italys second largest 
party after de mitas christian democrats to muster a majority 
indeed communists initially backed a proposal to make voting 
public only on financial questions 
on friday in the chamber of deputies parliaments lower house 
snipers were in fine form as the government won narrowly won votes 
to include certain elements in its proposal their vote on the 
overall package is scheduled for today and the italian senate will 
consider its own version of the proposal separately 
de mita a christian democrat formed his coalition government 
in april establishing the curtailment of secret voting as a key 
platform plank the other coalition members are the socialists 
republicans liberals and social democrats 
the socialists who rank as the coalitions no 2 member have 
pushed hard for the reform 
on saturday de mita referred to the snipers when addressing a 
gathering of young christian democrats in the southern province of 
lecce 
if the majority is no longer there ill have to take note of 
it he said journalists and other politicians took the remark to 
mean he would resign if the reform measure fails 
snipers could be critical in the vote of the 630 deputies in 
the chamber 377 belong to coalition parties normally giving the 
government a comfortable margin since 316 votes would be needed 
for passage 
however on friday defecting deputies from coalition parties 
joined with opposition communists to water down the proposal by 
adding exceptions which allow secret voting 
after fridays voting the proposed exceptions included voting 
on chamber rules substantive constitutional changes and special 
investigative bodies such as a national antimafia commission 
the government originally wanted the only exceptions to be 
voting on fundamental liberties and issues of conscience such as 
abortion and genetic experimentation

a uscanadian agreement has cleared the 
way for the coast guard icebreaker polar star to head east through 
the northwest passage since ice blocked the vessels usual westward 
route 
a state department official confirmed the agreement monday but 
refused to be identified because the deal had not been formally 
announced 
we requested consent to transit the northwest passage and the 
canadians gave it the diplomat said 
canada claims the northwest passage as territorial waters while 
the united states asserts an international right of passage through 
waterways between the polar icecap and canadas yukon and northwest 
territories 
with offices of both government closed monday because of 
columbus day in the united states and thanksgiving in canada john 
fieldhouse of the canadian embassy in washington dc said from 
his home that the polar star would be allowed to pass through the 
disputed waters 
theyre on their way fieldhouse said 
the 399foot ship was unsuccessful last weekend in attempts to 
break through the iceclogged beaufort sea west of prudhoe bay in 
northern alaska said coast guard lt geoff merrell in juneau 
it is what they call multiyear ice the icing conditions 
were quite heavy merrell said 
the polar star which had been on a support mission for arctic 
scientists returned to prudhoe bay for restocking while officials 
decided the next course of action 
last week the canadian government granted a us request to let 
the polar star enter arctic waters claimed by canada to refuel and 
repair a turbine said canadian external affairs minister joe clark 
the request marked the first test of the canadaus arctic 
cooperation agreement that was signed in january under the pact 
the united states agreed to seek canadian permission before surface 
ships enter canadian waters 
canada protested when the polar stars twin icebreaker polar 
sea traveled through the northwest passage in 1985 
had canada denied permission for the polar star the ship would 
have spent the winter at prudhoe bay with a skeleton crew said 
coast guard lt pete marsh in seattle

a national beach cleanup has removed about 15 
million pounds of garbage so far from shorelines but the cleanups 
coordinator says the allvolunteer effort found that the countrys 
coasts arent awash with medical waste 
instead kathy ohara a marine biologist with the center for 
environmental education said monday that volunteers mostly picked 
up hundreds of tons of plastic garbage from foreign countries and 
traceable debris from cruise ships 
data from more than 1800 miles of beaches in 16 states and 
puerto rico has been collected she said information from eight 
other states and from costa rica remains to be compiled 
we found medical wastes in most states but we are not going 
to see an overwhelming amount of it ohara said adding that 
such wastes amount to a minuscule percentage of beach debris 
this summer hundreds of thousands of people stayed away from 
east coast beaches after reports of syringes and aidstainted blood 
in vials washed ashore in new york alone 7000 items of medical 
waste have been collected this year 
but ohara said plastics are the no 1 beach debris problem as 
some types are not expected to disintegrate for up to 400 years it 
also can kill marine life when ingested or when fish and mammals 
become entangled in it 
about 40000 volunteers have participated in the cleanup effort 
and ohara said in most cases they were very specific in 
documenting what was found 
her organizations purpose in the cleanup is not only to clean 
the beaches but to compile a data base of how much and what kinds 
of wastes wash ashore she said many volunteers picked up items 
that had on them the names of cruise ships thousands of deflated 
balloons were found on the coastlines evidence that promotional 
helium balloon launches are not harmless events she said 
next year an international treaty that bans dumping plastics in 
oceans takes effect us violators face up to a 25000 fine she 
said the 1989 national cleanup when compared to this years data 
will help document whether the treaty is working 
last weekend thousands of volunteers in new york new jersey 
and oregon helped pick up garbage on beaches the final two states 
to participate in the cleanup hawaii and new hampshire will 
hold their efforts later this month

gasoline prices in the capital surged to 
the equivalent of 33 a gallon today as government efforts to 
restart burmas two major oil refineries appear stalled 
a gallon cost about 25 last week while the official price 
before rationing was stopped aug 25 had been 58 cents 
official sources indicated that the refinery in nearby syriam 
had been damaged during a nationwide antigovernment strike and 
would take some time to restore the refinery at mann in central 
burma also appeared not to be functioning 
military officers seized power sept 18 crushing a popular 
uprising against 26 years of authoritarian rule and have since 
attempted to revive the shattered economy and administrative 
apparatus 
the stateowned working peoples daily said today that five 
suburban banks would reopen oct 17 for partial business banks in 
downtown rangoon closed for nearly two months resumed operations 
last week 
the newspaper said each customer would only be allowed to 
withdraw a maximum of 1666 a week they will be allowed to 
deposit any amount 
most vehicles seen on the road belong to the military or 
government which has been drawing on reserve fuel stocks 
in mandalay 440 miles north of rangoon gasoline sold for 21 a 
gallon although fuel prices in that central burma city are normally 
higher than those in the capital residents said the lower price 
was accounted for by supplies of gasoline coming across the border 
with china 
burmas economy already in a downward spiral before the 
political upheaval began last july has come to a virtual 
standstill protesting the military suppression japan west 
germany the united states and others have frozen aid to a country 
where the per capita income is estimated at below 200 a year 
you can argue that the annual half billion dollars in foreign 
assistance was playing a major role in propping up the official 
economy a western diplomat based in rangoon said this week 
experts say burma has exhausted its foreign exchange reserves 
and owes more than 4 billion to foreign creditors

the murder trial of the leader of what has been 
called one of the nations deadliest street gangs and four 
associates has begun amid tight security and fears of disruptions 
by gang members 
in opening arguments monday the prosecution said it would prove 
its case against gang leader jeff fort and the others from the 
testimony of three former el rukns members involved in the shooting 
of a rival gang member 
but defense lawyers said the governments key witnesses were not 
credible 
security at the cook county circuit court was unusually tight 
besides the standard metal detector in the front lobby spectators 
were asked to empty their pockets and were checked with handheld 
metal detectors at two other checkpoints 
inside the courtroom the gallery was separated by a bulletproof 
glass wall constructed for the trial from the judge jury 
attorneys and defendants with their horde of guards 
let me introduce you to five members of an evil enterprise 
prosecutor randy rueckert told the jurors 
theres one issue in this case and thats credibility said 
mike mcinerney attorney for defendant ray ferguson the defense 
contends that these people cant be believed 
forts attorney tom peters said his client is a highprofile 
scapegoat 
this case is not about anything fort did or said or 
thought hes here because of who he is peters said 
he said his client is a scapegoat for prosecution witnesses who 
are cooperating in hopes of getting lighter sentences for their own 
crimes 
fort 41 is serving an 80year federal term for conspiring to 
commit acts of terrorism on the united states on libyas behalf he 
is charged with his four codefendants in the 1981 death of rival 
gang member willie dollar bill bibbs of the gang called the 
titanic stones 
last year fort and four el rukns received terms ranging from 
nine to 80 years for conspiring to get 25 million from libya in 
exchange for acts of terrorism in the united states the government 
said the group had offered to blow up planes and us buildings for 
libya but committed no terrorist acts 
the el rukns named after the cornerstone of islams sacred 
shrine in mecca claimed their organization is a religious one that 
planned no violence and met with libyans to raise money for a 
mosque 
about 50 of the 250 to 300 hardcore members of the south 
sidebased gang have been charged or convicted of state and federal 
crimes authorities said

a brazilian engineer fighting the 
destruction of the amazon jungles a malaysian environmental group 
and a british specialist in housing for the poor today won the 
100000 right livelihood award sometimes called the alternative 
nobel prize 
an honorary award which carries no cash prize went to 
denmarks inge kemp genefke founder and director of the 
international rehabilitation and research center for torture 
victims for her work to help those whose lives have been 
shattered by torture 
the award was established in 1980 by swedishgerman 
philanthropist baron jakob von uexkull to encourage practical 
solutions to everyday problems 
von uexkull sold a stamp collection to finance an initial 
500000 endowment for the annual prizes they will be awarded in 
the swedish parliament on dec 9 the eve of the nobel prize 
ceremonies in stockholm and oslo norway 
the 10member jury includes von uexkull norwegian explorer thor 
heyerdahl former costa rican president rodrigo carazo and robert 
muller a former un assistant secretary general 
the 1988 winners were brazils jose lutzenberger the friends of 
the earth group fighting the logging industry in the malaysian 
province of sarawak and john turner a london architect and author 
of selfhelp programs for third world housing development 
von uexkull told a news conference that the award had gained 
recognition since it was introduced and had helped draw attention 
to environmental issues 
the cash stipend which the winners will share is for specific 
projects and not for personal use according to the right 
livelihood foundation 
the timing of the prize is linked to the announcement of the six 
nobel prizes to ensure maximum publicity the nobel peace prize 
given to the un peacekeeping forces was announced last week and 
the laureates in literature chemistry phyisics economics and 
medicine will be made public over the next eight days 
von uexkull created the prize because he believed the nobel 
prizes had become too specialized and removed from issues 
concerning everyone 
he said this year the winners were chosen from among 92 
nominations which can be submitted by anyone 
the foundation cited lutzenberger as the father of the 
environmental movement in brazil who has launched soil 
regeneration projects and encourged posionfree agriculture 
lutzenberger 61 quit his job with a brazilian chemical company 
in 1972 to campaign against the overuse of chemicals in farming 
his criticism of projects funded by the world bank raised an 
environmental awareness into the banks activities in brazil and 
elsewhere the foundation said 
lutzenberger also helped raise the alarm over the clearing of 
the amazon rain forests for agriculture an area the size of 
france and scotland is burning at this rate the forests of brazil 
will be destroyed in 20 years von uexkull said 
in malaysia sahabat alam or the friends of the earth was 
recognized for its conflict with the authorities over the 
deforestation in sarawak 
the foundation cited harrison ngau 28 director of the sarawak 
office who led a blockade against the a lumber company which it 
said was owned by environment and tourism minister james wong 
ngau was arrested for 60 days and was still under orders 
restricting his travel the foundation said 
john turner born in 1927 was honored for encouraging the 
freedom of communities to plan build and manage their hown 
housing 
turner founder of the associated housing advisory services 
argued in a series of publications that western urban development 
should not be imposed on third world home dwellers 
the honorary award recognized genefkes work with torture 
victims in the copenhagenbased research center 
von uexkull said the has documented cases of torture and has 
charged that as many as 25000 people in the medical professions 
have been involved in acts of torture

samuel a adams a onetime cia analyst who 
accused his superiors of manipulating intelligence estimates during 
the vietnam war has died he was 55 
adams whose accusations helped form the basis of the 
cbswestmoreland libel case died monday at his home in strafford 
apparently of a heart attack 
adams was a cia expert on the viet cong the guerrilla force 
that north vietnam organized in south vietnam he contended that 
army gen william westmorelands military intelligence officers 
were ordered to deliberately underestimate the strength of the 
guerrilla force to make it appear the americanbacked war was being 
won 
the dispute over the viet cong strength was a major controversy 
at the cia where adams worked for 10 years it became the basis 
for the 1982 cbs documentary the uncounted enemy a vietnam 
deception which resulted in a libel suit against the network by 
westmoreland 
westmoreland settled the case out of court after hearing 
testimony at his 1985 trial by his former chief of military 
intelligence that backed charges made by adams 
adams served as a consultant to the cbs documentary and 
testified at the trial saying i do not believe general 
westmoreland communicated fully to washington 
concerning the intelligence gathering and reporting of enemy 
strength the excia analyst said i believe there was a 
conspiracy there was an attempt to do wrong with the numbers 
i have always felt that what went on in the 19671968 period was a 
conspiracy 
it was a tragic event he said 
adams who graduated from harvard university in 1955 served as 
an officer in the us navy before joining the cia in 1963 
adams is survived by his wife anne cocroft adams and two sons

three lost hikers survived snow 
fog and subzero wind chills on mount washington by burning dollar 
bills to keep their fire going they said after making it off the 
treacherous peak 
the three fraternity brothers at northeastern university in 
boston spent about 25 hours sunday and monday on the mountain 
where a storm created fourfoot snowdrifts and strong winds dropped 
the windchill factor to 17 below zero 
we burned dollar bills to stay dry andy stewart 23 of 
syosset ny said monday after he and his companions reached 
safety by following a dry riverbed down the mountain none of the 
three was harmed by the ordeal 
forty rescuers searched mountain trails most of monday looking 
for stewart matt dube 21 of bethany conn and steve sardella 
20 of marlboro mass a fourth member of the group noel bouvier 
of boston left the others late sunday afternoon 
the four came to new hampshire to spend the columbus day weekend 
at a friends cottage and decided to climb the mountain for fun 
bouvier said 
they left the base camp at pinkhams notch on the east side of 
the mountain at 1 pm sunday planning to make the fourmile climb 
to the summit and return the same night bouvier said the climb 
normally takes about four hours 
they were wearing three layers of clothing and carried extra 
sweaters bouvier said the others had hiking boots on but bouvier 
turned back because his boots had little traction 
before reaching the summit a storm blew in and the three hikers 
lost their way i couldnt see my hand in front of my face 
stewart said 
they turned back hiking until dark trying to make their way 
below the tree line in the hope trees would shelter them from the 
wind 
after dark they started a fire and ate sandwiches apples nuts 
and crackers they had carried on the hike 
we burned whatever we could bank cards money phone 
numbers sardella said without specifying how much cash went up 
in smoke they kept moving around the fire throughout the night to 
keep hypothermia from setting in 
there was a point where we really didnt think we were going 
to make it said stewart but they never verbalized the fear that 
they might die dube added we all thought it but never said 
it 
in the morning they found a small stream and began following it 
down the mountain jumping from stone to stone the stream led into 
a trail along a dry riverbed on the west side of the mountain and 
that led to route 302 
the snow was up to my chin all the way down stewart said 
asked if they felt lucky to be alive stewart said oh my god 
yes incredibly lucky none of the three even needed medical 
treatment 
its a miracle said maj henry mock of the state fish and 
game department which handles searches 
washington is notorious for severe and quickly changing weather 
snow has fallen on the summit in every month and the highest 
surface wind speed ever recorded 231 mph was registered at the 
observatory in 1934 
records compiled by the us forest service and others indicate 
that 103 people have died on washington since 1849

george bush and michael dukakis were running 
neckandneck in a pair of national polls that also found indiana 
sen dan quayle to be a drag on the republican ticket 
a survey of registered voters for the los angeles times showed 
the bushquayle ticket leading dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen 
4441 when asked to treat bush and dukakis as if they were running 
alone the respondents picked bush over dukakis 48 percent to 39 
percent 
a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points in 
either direction could close the difference in both cases 
the times questioned 893 registered voters on saturday and 
sunday polls of registered voters are less reliable predictors of 
the outcome of an election since not everyone votes 
in an abc newswashington post poll bush had 50 percent to 47 
percent for dukakis that survey also had a fourpoint margin of 
error 
the times poll also found that texas sen lloyd bentsen far 
outperformed quayle in last weeks vice presidential debate but it 
also found that dukakis had a 45 percent unfavorable rating 
compared with 40 percent unfavorable rating for quayle 
the abcpost poll in an effort to assess the quayle drag 
among the electorate found that the effect of quayles performance 
in the vice presidential debate was to shift about 2 percent of the 
electorate to dukakis the poll said 16 percent said quayle was a 
major reason for supporting dukakis 
the abcpost survey of 600 likely voters was conducted 
nationwide by telephone from wednesday through sunday

a teacher who followed a distraught 
gunman through an elementary school and tried to persuade him not 
to shoot says protecting the schools pupils was uppermost in her 
mind 
i was trying to be real calm physical education teacher kat 
finkbeiner told reporters monday two weeks after a youth went on a 
rampage at oakland elementary school i knew i had to be those 
were kids in there they were helpless 
two 8yearold girls were fatally shot and seven children and 
two teachers were wounded including mrs finkbeiner who was hit 
in the mouth and whose jaw remained wired shut 
despite her injury mrs finkbeiner ran in an 8kilometer about 
5mile race this weekend and already has visited the school and 
talked with the children she said she cannot wait until her doctor 
lets her return to work which she hopes will be in the next couple 
of weeks 
the thought of childrens questions about what happened doesnt 
bother the 17year teaching veteran she said she wants to discuss 
it openly with the children and help them heal 
kids will learn to get over this kids will talk about it 
she said 
mrs finkbeiner said she was just sitting down for lunch shortly 
before noon when a gunman walked into the cafeteria and opened fire 
on a crowd of about 100 students and teachers teacher eleanor 
hodge was one of the first hit by gunfire as she stood up and held 
her hand up at the man 
mrs finkbeiner said she noticed one little girl left alone in 
the cafeteria after the other children ran out the buildings back 
door she said shielded the little girl with her body and pushed 
her out the door while the gunman held the pistol on them 
the gunman then left the lunchroom and mrs finkbeiner said she 
followed him down the hall to a restroom where he stopped to 
reload she tried to hold him in the restroom but he forced his 
way out and trained the gun on her 
he told her they are trying to kill me she said 
they are just little people they are not going to hurt you 
she replied 
but the man walked away from her and entered a thirdgrade 
classroom at the 600student school 
when mrs finkbeiner arrived the man had the revolver held to 
the neck of an 8yearold boy she began talking to him and he 
pulled the gun away from the youngster 
details are fuzzy after that she said 
apparently the man fired at her striking her in the mouth and 
shattering her jaw he then began shooting at the pupils 
apparently aiming at children who screamed 
one girl shequila bradley died soon after the shooting 
tequila thomas died several days later 
mrs finkbeiner said she carried shequila to the schools office 
and tried to stop the flow of blood from a wound to the girls neck 
james w wilson 19 of greenwood has been charged with murder 
and assault and battery with intent to kill he is undergoing 
psychiatric evaluation in the state mental hospital in columbia 
mrs finkbeiner said she was thankful to have survived and now 
cherishes time with her husband and 2yearold daughter

prime minister margaret thatcher traded 
defiant words with the ira as her conservative party gathered to 
open its convention today in the same hotel where the ira tried to 
blow her up four years ago 
the convention opened this morning amid tight security 
overflights by civil air traffic were banned a royal navy 
destroyer patrolled off shore and delegates were forced to line up 
early outside the conference hall and endure rigorous security 
checks 
without prior announcement and ringed by security men mrs 
thatcher arrived late monday with her husband denis at brightons 
seafront grand hotel it was badly damaged in the oct 12 1984 
bomb blast that killed five people mrs thatcher narrowly escaped 
injury the ira claimed responsibility 
the fourday convention was the tories first there since the 
bombing 
mrs thatcher said upon arrival that her strongest memory was 
that the day after the bombing the convention started on time and 
people flooded in 
they werent going to be defeated she said 
this morning mrs thatcher attended a private memorial service 
at the church of st paul for the victims of the 1984 bombing she 
unveiled a memorial plaque to the five who died which reads 
they paid the price of freedom 
the irish republican army in a statement circulated to irish 
news media monday said it takes great delight from the hysteria 
and the expense surrounding the security of mrs thatcher and the 
tories at their brighton conference 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province 
with the 95 percent catholic irish republic 
more than 1500 police officers were deployed in the normally 
staid resort on the south england coast 45 miles from london 
the outlawed ira which declared we only have to be lucky 
once after its failed 1984 assassination attempt against mrs 
thatcher has vowed to kill her she has said she will not bow to 
terrorists 
on monday police ringed the hotel and the adjacent conference 
center 
inside a huge slogan leading britain into the 1990s 
dominated the conference hall bedecked in blue the tory party 
color 
mrs thatcher and her conservatives returned to brighton with 
her dominance of british politics looking even more overwhelming 
than four years ago 
she won a third successive fiveyear term 16 months ago 
despite rising inflation and interest rates and a record trade 
deficit the conservatives arrived in brighton with a healthy 
fivepoint lead in polls over the opposition labor party 
a recent poll also showed that mrs thatcher who will turn 63 
in brighton on thursday is the choice of 61 percent of britons as 
the most effective leader when compared to alternatives 
mrs thatcher planned to focus this years conference on what 
her aides call active citizenship the idea involves urging 
selfresponsibility on britons giving more to charity helping 
police in curbing rising crime and making more personal initiatives 
and depending less on the welfare state

today in the face of heightened security measures but other 
protesters pressed demands for economic and political changes and 
forced out a regional leader

dismissal of officials from the autonomous province of kosovo at 
the center of ethnic unrest party leaders from serbia met in 
belgrade to discuss protests fueled by the ethnic problems and by 
yugoslavias economic crisis 
ratomir vico a member of serbias ruling politburo opened the 
meeting of the policymaking central committee with a denunciation 
of all those who have formed a real hunters posse against the 
serbian bosses 
the leaders of serbia have been viewed by many as backing 
rallies by minority serbs who want greater control over the 
provinces of kosovo and vojvodina serbias communist party chief 
slobodan milosevic supports the movement 
milenko petrovic a central committee member won applause when 
he demanded dismissal of three senior men in leadership of kosovo 
where ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of the population the 
meeting was broadcast on national television and radio 
the leaders of vojvodina resigned last week after protesters 
besieged government buildings 
in montenegro another of yugoslavias six republics 
authorities monday imposed unspecified emergency measures the 
official tanjug news agency said several yugoslavs speaking on 
condition of anonymity reported that civil defense units in 
belgrade were put on a higher level of alert 
about 15000 people in niksic a town 30 miles from the 
montenegrin capital of titograd joined 3000 steel workers in a 
strike and protests monday tanjug said however the workers ended 
their threeday strike today 
workers are angry about national economic problems including 
217 percent inflation 15 percent unemployment and a 21 billion 
foreign debt 
protesters in niksic demanded that montenegros police chief be 
fired for allowing authorities to use tear gas and clubs to put 
down weekend protests they dramatized their point by hoisting onto 
their shoulders a man wearing a gas mask tanjug said 
we are not demanding the gallows for those who ordered the 
beating up of our comrades we are only demanding their sacking 
the agency quoted worker miloslav michunovich as saying

party leadership held an emergency meeting later monday 1000 
construction workers in titograd ended their strike in that city

statements supporting the national governments denunciation of 
nationalist protests

socialism and democracy as tailored by the serbian leadership 
communists from slovenia said monday 
but the leadership of serbia defended its drive for more control 
of its two provinces the presidium of the party and the presidency 
of serbia denounced unidentified politicians and journalists in 
slovenia who it said are spreading fear of serbia 
ethnic tensions never far from the surface in this country with 
numerous rival nationalities have increasingly come forward in the 
growing number of protests this year 
many have centered on kosovo which borders albania ethnic 
albanians who are mostly moslems outnumber mainly christian serbs 
there and the serbs claims they are being harassed and forced to 
leave 
however many yugoslavs elsewhere worry about the growing 
nationalism of serbs the largest minority in this nation of about 
23 million 
serbian protesters some of whom have compared milosevic with 
the late president josip broz tito have made him their champion in 
the hope that he will bolster their status 
reacting to the unrest national leaders have promised economic 
reform and changes in leaders when the partys policymaking

mayseptember cooling season but the expense ranged widely from 
area to area according to monthly climate impact assessments 
issued by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
very high summer temperatures in the midwest and northeast 
were tempered by nearnormal readings in the southern states where 
the cooling customers are concentrated the report noted 
thus the national summer electricity costs which are largely 
affected by air conditioning demand were only 4 percent above 
normal for the season 
even so that spending totaled 174 billion some 712 million 
more than would have been expected had average summer weather 
prevailed across the nation 
the 422 average summer electricity bill for this year was 17 
more than normal the report said 
here is a regionbyregion rundown of seasonal electricity 
costs per household and the difference from what would have been 
expected in normal weather 
west north central 434 46 more than normal includes north

thousands of people returned to work and 
some shops reopened in algiers today after the president promised 
to address economic complaints that caused a week of blood riots 
president chadli bendjedid speaking to the nation monday night 
also hinted he may not run for another term 
his address came hours after troops fired machine guns into a 
crowd of more than 10000 in the algiers district of babeloued 
witnesses estimated that 25 to 30 people were killed dozens of 
others were wounded some seriously 
one witness said he saw many bodies the soldiers were piling 
them into trucks one body on top of another he said on 
condition of anonymity 
the government has provided no casualty figures but reliable 
reports from police hospitals and other sources indicate that as 
many as 300 have died in the week of unrest the government 
declared a state of emergency thursday and authorized troops to 
fire on demonstrators if necessary to disperse them 
mondays demonstration was to be a peaceful protest march 
organized by the islamic fundamentalist movement for algerian 
renewal which has demanded the government resign today it was not 
immediately clear how the violence began 
the army remained in control of sensitive points in the capital 
of algiers today including the national assembly the main 
newspaper el moudjahid and critical road junctions 
but they remained quiet and helicopters stopped lowlevel 
overflights some shops reopened as many workers went back to their 
jobs 
under the governments austerity program prices of many 
formerly subsidized food staples have risen 40 percent since 
january a combination of rapidly rising prices and shortages have 
led to widespread disgruntlement 
the unrest began about two weeks ago with a series of strikes 
demanding higher wages to keep up with inflation 
the national news agency and statecontrolled newspapers printed 
the presidents speech and praised his realism and political 
courage 
the speech which in fact contained little new carried the 
suggestion he might not seek a third fiveyear term at the congress 
of the governing national liberation front party in december 
bendjedid promised farreaching political reforms to go 
handinhand with previously announced economic reform measures 
but he gave no details 
the islamic fundamentalists who struggled to take control of the 
revolt issued no statements today however they are likely to 
reappear particularly during funerals for demonstrators shot down 
by the army monday in babeloued 
the president said on national radioo and television monday 
night he was bitterly sorry for the material and human losses 
in the street violence 
my duty as the person with supreme responsibility for this 
country was to make the decisions necessary to protect the nation 
whatever the circumstances and whatever the difficulties he 
said we have the courage to recognize our mistakes and to 
restore the situation i would like you to help me 
it had been widely expected that the congress of the governing 
national liberation front would amend the constitution to permit 
him to be nominated for a third term as the sole candidate his 
election would be a certainty 
in his speech he said he swore to respect the popular will 
and to facilitate the rise of young people to the leadership but 
these changes must take place calmly he said

sunday evening and issued a list of demands on monday they were 
still there this morning said college president jack lindquist 
adding that he was considering calling in the police if the sitin 
continued 
a police presence on the campus tends to excite some students 
and so i would prefer not to do that if i dont have to he said 
he said he and most staff members were sympathetic to the 
students though the college could do little about demands related 
to national and world problems so far he said late monday the 
protesters had not agreed to meet with him 
the students demands range from school issues such as 
increasing student participation in the administration of the 
college and full disclosure of the schools financial records to 
freeing south african activist nelson mandela ending homelessness 
in america and stopping nuclear testing 
goddard with an enrollment of 370 is regarded as a haven for 
the counterculture praised by friends for innovation and damned 
for what critics term academic laxity 
we feel the time time has come to take serious and definitive 
action to arrest apathy at our school to arrest mediocrity to 
address why our school has become dysfunctional a student 
protester who gave his name as zenzile said monday he spoke from 
behind a secondfloor doorway blocked with chairs and bedsprings 
lindquist said the demonstration was in many many ways very 
healthy and said most college faculty and staff members were 
sympathetic with the students goals 
thats one of the reasons i have hope this thing will work 
itself out he said 
he added of course some of the staff are very irate about 
being denied access to their place of work a continuing protest 
could delay staff paychecks he said 
while the students were inside the administration building 
another student group met throughout the day monday to identify its 
goals and see whether it could help resolve the grievances of the 
protesters

east german authorities have succeeded in 
separating an east berlin man from his west berlin lover but that 
hasnt stopped the woman from sending airborne love messages over 
the berlin wall 
to dramatize her plight this past weekend kerstin vockert 
launched balloons on the breeze to east berlin carrying scraps of 
paper with a message of love drawn from shakespeares romeo and 
juliet to her fiance peter rozinat 
the romantic message is from a german translation of 
shakespeare the original english version of the passage reads 
with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls for 
stony limits cannot hold love out 
the couples troubles began when they met a year ago in east 
berlin 
ms vockert 29 said it was love at first sight 
they soon decided to marry but bureaucracy and east germanys 
tough emigration policies proved insurmountable ms vockert said 
i am no longer allowed to go over and see him and peter cant 
get out ms vockert said 
she said his requests to marry and leave the country have been 
refused and that he was warned by authorities not to press the 
issue 
ms vockert said officials denied the request because rozinat 
recently left the military and wasnt allowed to leave the country 
but she added that authorities gave no indication how long 
rozinat will have to wait before he can join her in the west 
the east german officials are treating us like criminals we 
are being lied to everywhere ms vockert said

michael dukakis today proposed a plan 
aimed at restoring us dominance in science and technology to 
allow development of new american products that would compete 
successfully in foreign markets 
weve got to win the battle to be no 1 in the technologies of 
the future the democratic nominee told students at tufts 
university weve got to build new industries weve got to 
modernize our old ones so we can make topoftheline products and 
earn topoftheline paychecks 
dukakis expanded on his theme of economic nationalism at tufts 
after he went on nationwide television to accuse republican rival 
george bush of very crass and cynical tactics in making a 
campaign issue of the massachusetts prison furlough system 
dukakis spoke a few hours before flying to los angeles for his 
second and final debate with the vice president on thursday which 
he said would give millions of american voters a good sense of 
who i am and the kind of leadership i can provide 
the massachusetts governor said that only improvements in 
science education and technology development would lead to 
restoration of us dominance in manufacturing and marketing of 
hightech consumer goods 
i want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact 
discs to the germans and the japanese and the koreans not arms to 
the ayatollah he said 
dukakis delighted the friendly crowd with this and other 
partisan salvos including a jibe at bush running mate dan quayle 
dan quayle asks us to believe that if he ever had to fill in 
for george bush america could get by on a wing and a prayer he 
said 
dukakis science proposal included asking the national science 
foundation to draft annual statebystate report cards on the 
quality of science education and programs to improve science 
teaching 
he also proposed recruiting active and retired scientists and 
engineers to teach on at least a parttime basis creating 
workplace centers to retrain employees for new technologies and 
establishing a network of national centers of excellence modeled 
after state programs that encourage research and technology 
development 
the vice president has repeatedly cited the case of willie 
horton jr a convicted murderer who escaped while on a weekend 
furlough granted by the massachusetts prison system last year and 
later slashed a man and twice raped his fiancee 
i think when you use human tragedy for political purposes 
thats kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics dukakis 
said adding that similar tragedies had occurred under the federal 
furlough program and another instituted in california when 
president reagan was governor of that state in the early 1970s 
to use these human tragedies for your own political purposes 
i think is really a very crass and cynical thing the 
massachusetts governor said on nbcs today show and i think 
its frankly because mr bush has never done anything on law 
enforcement and crime whenever hes been given an assignment in 
the reagan administration hes failed 
dukakis vowed that during his nationally televised debate with 
bush in los angeles and in the remaining four weeks of the 
campaign i think the american people are going to come to know 
mike dukakis and who he is and how strongly he believes in their 
concerns 
dukakis spent several hours monday night preparing for his 
showdown with bush which he and his aides view as crucial to his 
chances of overcoming bushs apparent lead in most polls 
this one is out there to be won you know it and i know it 
an upbeat dukakis told a columbus day gathering in levittown ny 
the democratic nominee then marched in new york citys parade 
where he was enthusiastically received by thousands lining the 
streets many toting dukakis placards 
the massachusetts governor was flanked by new york gov mario 
cuomo mayor edward koch and john f kennedy jr as he strolled 
through manhattan 
levittown a model community of post world war ii housing 
programs served as a symbolic backdrop for dukakis announcement 
of his housing plan which would allow firsttime home buyers to 
use up to 10000 of their iras or pension plans for a down payment 
it also would amend federal housing programs to put home 
ownership which dukakis called the cornerstone of the american 
dream within the reach of five million families who now rent 
because they cannot afford to buy a home dukakis aides said it 
would complement a previously announced program to promote 
construction of new affordable housing through partnerships with 
building and trade unions and developers they said 
dukakis recalled bipartisan postwar efforts in levittown and 
across the nation to promise to provide affordable housing for 
all americans but said the reagan administration broke that 
promise in the early 1980s 
the dukakis home start program would allow up to 10000 to 
be removed from ira accounts or 401k pension systems for a housing 
down payment without a tax penalty that they would currently face 
by making such a withdrawal 
it also would change federal housing administration regulations 
to raise the maximum loan amount to bring it more in line with 
current market prices and allow firsttime buyers to get an 
fhainsured mortgage with only a 3 percent down payment 
campaign advisers said the principal cost of the home ownership 
plan would be an estimated 400 million loss in tax revenue 
resulting from the increased incentive for people to contribute to 
individual retirement accounts

states chief medical examiner has reopened an investigation into 
an earlier death of a cadet at an academy in eastern massachusetts 
a lawyer for the family of cadet james whitehouse of braintree 
who died in 1985 said monday he would call for an inquest if he 
was not satisfied with investigations by the medical examiners 
office the attorney generals office and the criminal justice 
training council which runs the states six police academies 
cadet joseph metcalfe of ludlow was in serious condition today 
at the intensive care unit at baystate medical center and may have

punishment at the police academies but it was unclear if physical 
training had resumed spokesmen for the department could not be 
reached this morning for comment 
the nursing supervisor said he didnt know if the cadets latest 
health problems were related to his police training but said he 
had been healthy before beginning his training

relationship the supervisor said

spokesman monday for his suggestion that the state would not help 
cover the medical bills of cadets who fell ill at the staterun 
academy one of the cadets from his town spent a week in the

were selfinsured but were looking for somebody to pick up the 
tab for these guys if it doesnt cover 100 percent

lax security at energy department nuclear 
weapons laboratories has allowed agents from iran the soviet bloc 
and other countries to gain access to sensitive research 
facilities congressional investigators reported today 
the visits took place at the national laboratories at los alamos 
and sandia in new mexico and at livermore in california where 
scientists conduct advanced research on nuclear weapons and the 
strategic defense initiative known as star wars according to the 
report by the general accounting office 
the foreign visitors included specialists from the soviet bloc 
china and nations believed either to have nuclear weapons or are 
seeking to develop them including india pakistan israel brazil 
and argentina 
also allowed into the plants were visitors from both iran and 
iraq the report said 
officials at the fbi and cia declined to discuss possible 
espionage investigations stemming from the incidents and it was not 
clear whether any secrets had been lost according to the report by 
the agency the investigative arm of congress 
formally delivering the report to the senate governmental 
operations committee the gaos senior associate directgor keith 
fultz said that his inspectors could not determine if sensitive 
or classified information has been lost but added that because 
of weaknesses in does foreign visitor controls we have little 
confidence that adeaquate protection of weaponsrelated information 
and technology is achieved 
one member of the committee sen john glenn dohio said that 
there may be a strong possibility that we will today only be 
looking at the tip of a monstrous iceberg 
the energy department generally does not follow its own 
requirements and obtain background information on foreign visitors 
and assignees from communist and other sensitive countries the 
gao report said 
as a result it said suspected foreign agents and individuals 
from facilities suspected of conducting nuclear weapons activities 
have obtained access to the laboratories without prior doe 
knowledge the report said 
it found the department allows foreign nationals from 
communist and proliferation risk countries into the laboratories to 
discuss subjects that could assist nuclear weapons programs 
i can tell you from my point of view i personally know of no 
prolonged visit from any foreign national said nigel hey 
spokesman for sandia 
hey said foreign visitors must make formal application through 
the department of energy so actually you can see that the 
actual procedure thats followed to clear access to sandia is in 
the hands of the department of energy 
he said further comment would be impossible without first seeing 
the gao report 
congressional investigators found that of the 6700 foreigners 
allowed to visit the weapons laboratories between january 1986 and 
september 1987 222 were from communist countries and 675 were from 
other countries deemed to be espionage or proliferation risks 
including 25 from iran and two from iraq 
congressional researchers reviewed the visits of 181 individuals 
from communist countries and found that 176 should have required 
checks with lists maintained by the fbi and cia 
only six of the checks were completed before the visits took 
place and no checks whatsoever were conducted on 119 of the 
individuals the report said 
in some cases the request for a check was made as long as six 
months before the visit took place but was not completed in time 
it said 
the report said that at least three of the foreigners visiting 
the facilities were later found to be suspected intelligence 
agents but it did not identify them by nationality 
additionally three individuals that a federal agency told us 
were obtaining us nuclear weapons development and other sensitive 
information were allowed into laboratories on several occasions 
the report said 
such visits can last more than a week and involve discussions 
that could be useful to a nation constructing nuclear weapons the 
report said 
the report said energy department officials questioned during 
preparation of the report acknowledge that these problems exist 
however they stated that they are improving their procedures for 
obtaining background data 
an energy department spokesman will callicott said monday that 
he was unfamiliar with the report but would attempt to obtain 
comment 
of the countries cited in the report india has exploded what it 
calls a peaceful nuclear device israel is thought to have 
produced and stockpiled nuclear weapons pakistan is thought to be 
very close to being able to build a bomb and there have been 
reports that brazil and argentina have conducted nuclear weapons 
research according to us government officials and leonard 
spector an expert on nuclear issues at the carnegie endowment for 
peace and author of several books on proliferation 
the energy department has come under renewed scrutiny on capitol 
hill over a series of internal memoranda released over the past two 
weeks indicating that as many as 30 mishaps at the departments 
savannah river plant have not been reported to headquarters or 
disclosed to the public over the last three decades 
department officials say they are trying to improve procedures 
at the plant which produces plutonium and tritium for the 
production of nuclear weapons 
the three reactors at savannah river have been shut down while 
engineers determine how to make them operate more safely in 
addition the energy department said this week that the primary 
plutonium processing facility at the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant outside denver has been shut down because of a minor safety 
incident that happened last month

teachers in arkansas secondlargest 
school district walked off the job today after the board of 
education rejected a mediation committees recommendation that they 
be given a 3 percent raise 
classes for 21000 students in the pulaski county special school 
district were canceled the district covers all the schools in the 
county where little rock is located except the little rock and 
north little rock schools 
elsewhere teachers strikes in pennsylvania illinois and 
michigan disrupted classes for an additional 14000 students 
the arkansas strike was only the second in the state in recent 
history 
we are very disappointed with the decisions that have brought 
us to this point pulaski association of classroom teachers 
spokesman dan mcelderry said as teachers gathered at a park before 
sunrise for a rally 
wed much rather be in the classroom doing what weve been 
trained to do said mcelderry chairman of pacts crisis 
committee but we have taken all that we can take and its time 
that the public knew that we intend to support what weve been 
saying for the last several months 
on monday night the school board voted to deny the districts 
1300 teachers the recommended 3 percent raise saying the system 
couldnt afford it because it already faces a 19 million deficit 
the raise would have cost an estimated 103 million 
teachers had warned that they would strike if the recommendation 
was rejected and pact president joyce elliott said that they would 
picket every school in the district except an elementary school at 
little rock air force base the union had said teachers would not 
attempt to picket on federal property 
school board president sheryl dunn said she was absolutely 
devastated by the teachers decision to strike we tried so 
hard to come to a point that we could agree on something to find 
the money for the teachers they just wont wait and all i can say 
is how desperately sorry i am 
school superintendent bobby lester said the board would be 
willing to reopen negotiations when more money is available for 
teacher salaries that could come if a 25 million lawsuit against 
the state is settled 
district voters rejected a property tax increase in may 
the state with the most teachers on strike today was 
pennsylvania where 600 teachers and 10000 students were affected 
in five districts in the springford district the strike resumed 
today after a 30day coolingoff period expired that strike

us and filipino officials reached 
tentative agreement for washington to provide compensation of more 
than 550 million a year to use its six military bases in the 
philippines sources said today 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters 
the two sides had nearly finished reviewing an agreement governing 
the bases which are the largest us garrison in southeast asia 
an accord on new compensation terms through 1991 is expected within 
a week they said 
in washington a us official who has kept a close eye on the 
negotiations denied there was an agreement the official refused to 
be identified 
the united states now pays about 180 million a year for the 
bases 
the sources in manila who are close to the talks said 
negotiators agreed on a basic annual compensation package of 550 
million to 580 million in economic support military assistance 
and commodities mostly wheat 
filipino negotiators in washington were bargaining for an 
additional loan of 100 million to purchase us treasury bonds 
said the sources the bonds would be used to pay off 200 million 
of the philippines 28 billion debt 
three manila newspaper said such a loan would be made but they 
did not say for how much 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno told reporters the size 
of the compensation package had not been decided on he said 
officials were still discussing creative portions meaning the 
debt relief part 
economic planning secretary solita monsod told reporters that 
the proposed loan figure was too insignificant to even negotiate at 
all 
it will be able to buy back at most 200 million which is not 
worth talking about she told reporters we should be talking 
about a 700 million buyback scheme 
on monday a filipino source told the associated press that the 
two sides had finished reviewing an agreement governing us bases 
and an agreement on their status through 1991 is possible within a 
week 
its over an agreement is possible within a few days maybe 
within a weeks time said the source who demanded anonymity 
there was compromise on both sides said the source who is 
involved in the talks he said both panels were working on the 
wording of the agreement 
in april us and philippine panels began talks on the status 
of clark air base the subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations in the philippines but the talks have stalled over 
compensation and other issues 
philippine foreign secretary raul manglapus has been meeting 
with us officials in new york and washington since last month on 
the bases talks he is expected to return to manila this week 
the united states maintains the bases under a 1947 agreement 
which expires in 1991 the current talks are to determine 
compensation base security and other issues through the final 
years of the agreement 
after that any extension must be approved by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate where opposition to the bases is 
strong president corazon aquino refuses to say whether she will 
support an extension 
the filipino panel reportedly demanded up to 12 billion 
annually for the final two years of the agreement 
businessworld one of the manila newspapers quoted an 
unidentified source as saying the americans were highly 
resistant to the 12 billion figure because us secretary of 
state george shultz had publicly branded filipino demands as out 
of bounds 
the source also reportedly said us officials had made clear 
they would not support a proposed international aid plan for the 
philippines unless agreement was reached on the bases 
the journal also said the united states had tentatively agreed 
to waive legislation which adds a 50 percent penalty payment to 
us purchases of nonamerican products 
this would enable the bases to increase their purchases of 
philippine products the newspaper said 
last week mrs aquino met in manila with undersecretary of 
state michael armacost later they told reporters the two 
countries have narrowed differences over the bases issue and are 
nearing an agreement

the supreme court today agreed to review the 
award of more than 4 million in fees to lawyers who won a kansas 
city school desegregation lawsuit 
the court said it will hear an appeal by missouri officials who 
want to reduce the amount 
state and city officials were held responsible for segregation 
in the city school system and were ordered in 1985 to spend 877 
million to improve and integrate the schools 
a federal judge then ordered the state to pay more than 17 
million to arthur a benson ii of kansas city the leading attorney 
for the suing students and 23 million to the naacp legal defense 
fund for its work 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the attorneys fees 
in january under a federal civil rights law which awards them to 
lawyers who win such cases 
the appeals court rejected claims by the civil rights lawyers 
and by state officials who said respectively the fees were too 
low or too high 
benson said he and his staff were not compensated adequately for 
what was described as an extraordinary commitment of time and 
energy 
for three years benson worked fulltime on the case and devoted 
substantial portions of five additional years to the suit he said 
he borrowed more than 730000 to help pay the cost of the 
litigation 
also benson argued that his fees should be higher because he 
took the case on a contingency basis meaning he would get paid 
only if he won the suit 
but the appeals court noted that the judge who declined to order 
higher fees said there was a high likelihood of success for the 
segregation suit minimizing the risk to benson 
one of the reasons for enhancing fees in contingency cases 
is to assure there will be lawyers available to take difficult 
civil rights suits 
but the 8th circuit court said there was insufficient proof the 
kansas city students would have had trouble finding another lawyer 
if benson had refused the case 
missouri officials argued that the legal fees were inflated 
improperly because benson and the legal defense fund were paid 
extra to compenate them for waiting years for their fees 
the state appeal also said that the civil rights lawyers were 
compensated improperly for the time they spent on segregation 
claims not upheld by the courts the fees should be less because 
the lawyers achieved only partial success they said 
the state appeal said kansas city should share in reimbursement 
of the attorneys fees 
the appeals court rejected all of the states claims 
the legal defense fund did not appeal to the supreme court 
the supreme court today refused to hear bensons appeal for 
additional compensation 
the case is missouri vs jenkins 8864

republican george bush accused democratic rival 
michael dukakis today of being willing to scare people for 
political gain by engaging in protectionist demagoguery about 
foreign investments in the united states 
in a prepared speech for seattle university business school 
students the vice president said dukakis is stoking fears about 
foreign influence in the united states 
my opponent needs an issue and hes willing to scare people to 
find it so like the know nothing party a century before him 
hes turned to fear of foreigners bush said 
hes not a know nothing he knows better but perhaps hes a 
feel nothing candidate or maybe with this later flipflop hes 
become a believe nothing candidate he said 
frankly ive been surprised at my opponents recent turn to 
protectionist demagoguery i dont think he really believes it he 
ran against this socalled economic nationalism in the primaries 
bush who is heading for los angeles for his second and final 
debate with the democratic nominee thursday night also promised to 
throw the book at insider traders and other whitecollar 
criminals 
we must not let wall street steal from main street he said 
bush added that most of those who work on wall street are 
honest hardworking people and that much of the money made 
there is recycled to foundations to help the poor universities and 
other worthy causes 
on monday in trenton nj bush portrayed dukakis as soft on 
crime and promised as president to show more sympathy for victims 
of crimes than for criminals 
i think there is something very wrong when there is so much 
sympathy for criminals and very little left over for victims 
bush said who has made a major campaign issue of the massachusetts 
prison furlough system under dukakis as governor 
the campaign trip to the west coast begins an eightday swing 
concentrating on california the nations biggest election day 
prize with 47 electoral votes 
campaigning before thursdays debate will be light to give bush 
time to prepare for his last facetoface confrontation with his 
rival however the gop nominee is planning another toughoncrime 
event in los angeles on wednesday 
targeting democratic swing voters in new jersey which is 
seen as a state winnable by either candidate bush proposed on 
monday to increase criminal penalties and give victims an expanded 
role in criminal proceedings 
bush said victims of crime should have the statutory right to 
be informed of be present and be heard at every critical stage of 
the criminal justice process 
he also called for expanding a federal fund created to 
compensate victims of crimes 
im going to bring an attitude to the white house that has 
more sympathy for the victims of crime than for the criminals 
the vice president said in his columbus day address 
bush had been speaking at length about the gang and drug 
problems although none of his campaign stops have been in inner 
cities and heavily minority communities where those problems are 
most rampant 
as to why bush has visited almost allwhite suburban 
communities while hitting the anticrime theme press secretary 
sheila tate said the strategy is determined by the political 
numbers crunchers that know where the vice president has to go to 
have the greatest impact on that state 
the speech today was dealing with whitecollar crime and thus 
the businessstudent audience was appropriate ms tate said 
on monday bush walked for a few blocks in an italianamerican 
neighborhood in trenton stumping for ethnic votes 
bushs political director rich bond said the new jersey swing 
was aimed at democrats who crossed party lines to vote for 
president reagan in 1980 and 1984 a group being ardently courted 
by both bush and dukakis 
were going after reagan democrats youre not going to see 
many republicans here said bond 
bush aides were heartened by a poll in mondays bergen record 
showing him leading dukakis by eight percentage points in new 
jersey 
earlier bush told reporters traveling with him aboard air force 
two that he favors review of the federal prison furlough program 
although he has no specific revisions in mind i just want to 
be sure it never slips into the massachusetts model he said 
bushs criticism of the program which until modified allowed 
convicted murderers to be released on weekend passes has prompted 
dukakis to criticize the federal furlough system 
and democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen in a 
statement released monday criticized bushs comments 
after 2818 days of sitting on the sidelines george bush has 
finally admitted that there is something wrong with a federal 
furlough program that gives 45day vacations to drug traffickers 
bentsen said 
we dont need another review we need the vice president to 
take responsibility for his failure in the fight against drugs and 
crime

thirtyeight academics and 
clergymen violated emergency regulations today by urging people to 
boycott nationwide municipal elections 
the first votes were cast monday and the state radio said 
voters showed great interest 
the elections for racially segregated municipal councils are 
scheduled by law for oct 26 but the government passed an 
emergency bill allowing people to begin voting on oct 10 in a 
system called prior voting 
the government has said the early voting which lasts until oct 
22 is designed to make it easier for people to vote in rural areas 
and to cut down on the possibility of harassment 
in several black townships no candidates are running for 
office and in others only one candidate has sought each post 
candidates homes have been firebombed and in soweto the largest 
black township in the country a candidate was killed 
the government has billed the municipal elections as a major 
move toward extending democracy because for the first time all 
races will vote at the same time the bureau for information has 
conducted an extensive television billboard and newspaper 
advertising campaign urging people to participate in the elections 
the government issued an emergency regulation making it illegal 
to call for a boycott of elections print advertisements or quote 
statements carrying that view but anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
of cape town and the rev allan boesak president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches have joined other church leaders in 
repeatedly defying the regulation calling publicly for a boycott 
of elections they say will entrench apartheid 
tutu boesak and other church leaders black and white were 
among the 38 people signing todays statement urging a boycott 
others included the leader of an antievictions group and eight 
faculty members from the university of south africa one of the 
worlds largest correspondence universities 
information minister stoffel van der merwe said friday that 
tutu boesak and other prominent church leaders who violated the 
law by calling for boycotts would not be arrested because such an 
action would give south africa bad publicity but lesser known 
clergymen and election opponents have been detained 
the black majority of 26 million has no vote in parliament less 
than 10 percent of blacks voted in the last municipal elections in 
1984 which preceded two years of unrest and more than 2000 deaths 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said today 
voters throughout the country showed great interest in prior 
votes it gave no voting figures 
the election in fact began monday said sam basch an 
elections spokesman for the governments bureau for information he 
said that until oct 22 voters can go to any municipal office 
show their identification fill out an application for an early 
ballot mark the ballot there and place it in a ballot box then 
the voting will stop for four days and resume on oct 26 the 
official election day 
government opponents say the new system is open to abuse since 
there is no secret voting booth no monitoring of the voting by 
delegates from various parties and no immediate counting of the 
ballots

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
challenge to the way laurence a tisch became president of cbs inc 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that tischs 
assumption of power did not amount to a transfer of control 
requiring prior approval by the federal communications commission 
tisch chairman of loews corp purchased 249 percent of cbs 
voting stock in 1986 
a group called fairness in media long a critic of cbs news 
coverage asked the commission to investigate the results of 
tischs stock purchase 
the commission sent a letter of inquiry to cbs in late 1986 and 
after receiving a reply ruled that the events to date do not 
constitute a transfer of control as defined in the federal 
communications act of 1934 
fairness in media appealed and a federal appeals court here 
upheld the commissions dismissal of the complaint 
in the appeal acted on today fairness in media argued that the 
commissions investigation was a sham that demands judicial 
denunciation as arbitrary 
the appeal said the purchase of stock in cbs should have 
required commission approval as had abcs acquisition by cap cities 
and nbcs sale to general electric 
the case is fairness in media vs fcc 88388

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
lawsuit charging the boeing company with illegal age bias because 
it bars pilots from active flight status when they reach 60 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that reinstated 
the suit 
the equal employment opportunity commission sued boeing in 1984 
in federal court in seattle charging that boeings policy of 
removing its pilots from active flight status at age 60 violates 
federal law 
boeing one of the worlds leading jet manufacturers defended 
the policy as a bona fide occupational qualification exception 
to the law 
the company rested its case on a regulation of the federal 
aviation administration that requires commercial pilots to be under 
60 
a federal judge threw out the suit before trial ruling there is 
almost perfect congruity between the faa rule and boeings 
policy 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the suit in 
april ordering a jury trial 
boeing said its pilots perform a variety of flight duties they 
conduct extensive flight operations to test the design and 
performance of jets and also fly passenger flights for commercial 
airlines and on corporate jets the company said 
boeing said test flying involves numerous risky procedures such 
as purposely depressurizing aircraft and shutting down engines or 
other systems to determine if they will restart in midair 
the faa in 1959 said pilots must be under 60 on commercial 
flights the policy is based on the belief that after 60 skills 
deteriorate and that exceptions cannot be allowed due to the 
difficulty in predicting individual performance or likely 
disabilities 
the 9th circuit court said the critical issue of fact in this 
case was the detectability on an individual basis of deterioration 
in a boeing pilot aged 60 or over that might diminish that pilots 
capacity to discharge safely his or her duties 
the appeals court added this was an issue for the jury to 
decide if the facts were disputed or for the trial court if they 
were not 
the 9th circuit court said the judge should not dismiss the suit 
unless the dismissal were based on the evidence no reasonable 
jury could have decided that it was practical to test pilots age 60 
and over for disabling conditions 
the appeals court also noted that before boeing adopted its age 
policy in 1980 pilots over 60 had flown for the company without 
incident 
it also cited a 1985 supreme court ruling that said the faas 
age60 rule does not automatically cover flight engineers for 
commercial airlines 
the appeals court added that the faas rule has never been 
tested specifically in court as to whether being under 60 is a bona 
fide occupational requirement even for commercial pilots 
boeing said the appeals court ruling places the company and 
possibly commercial airlines between two conflicting federal 
agency interpretations of federal law its appeal said the faa 
believes accurate individual testing of pilots over 60 cannot be 
done and the eeoc says it must be done 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to reject 
boeings appeal 
justice department lawyers noted for example that the faa 
itself and the navy do not force their own pilots to stop flying at 
age 60 
the faa rule for commercial pilots is evidence in boeings favor 
but is not the only evidence a jury could weigh the government 
lawyers said 
the case is boeing vs eeoc 8853

later in medford mass dukakis pushed for improved science 
and technology education and training as the way to restore us 
dominance in manufacturing and marketing of hightech consumer 
goods 
i want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact 
discs to the germans and the japanese and the koreans not arms to 
the ayatollah dukakis said 
bush however in remarks prepared for delivery to seattle 
university business school students said dukakis is stoking 
fears about foreign influence an apparent reference to dukakis 
recent comments on foreign investment in the united states 
my opponent needs an issue and hes willing to scare people to 
find it so like the know nothing party a century before him hes 
turned to fear of foreigners hes not a know nothing he knows 
better but perhaps hes a feel nothing candidate or maybe with 
this later flipflop hes become a believe nothing candidate

socalled economic nationalism in the primaries bush said in 
remarks released before he left washington dc

criminals than their victims and vowed a different approach if

pope john paul ii today urged a common 
political structure for europe during a speech that was interrupted 
when the rev ian paisley a militant protestant leader shouted 
i renounce you 
the address to the european parliament an advisory body to the 
12member european economic community was the pontiffs main 
speech during his fourday trip to northeastern france 
after a welcome by lord plumb president of the 518member 
parliament the pope began speaking but was immediately interrupted 
by paisley standing about 11 rows from the popes lecturn at the 
back of the woodpaneled room 
i renounce you i renounce you as the antichrist shouted 
paisley a parliamentarian and the leader of the irish protestant 
democratic unionist party the more militant of the two main 
protestant parties in northern ireland 
other parliamentarians surrounded paisley threw papers at him 
and tore from his hands a crude orange banner reading john paul 
ii antichrist 
plumb called twice for order over paisleys shouts then had him 
ejected the room filled to capacity with parliamentarians press 
and visitors erupted in applause when deputies and security guards 
dragged paisley away 
paisley later told journalists i was hammered i was beaten 
about the ears and the body 
it was the second incident in parliament this week in which 
paisley denounced the pope 
paisley has spearheaded opposition to the 1985 angloirish 
agreement which granted the government of catholicdominated 
ireland a say in the running of northern ireland a british 
province where 60 percent of the population is protestant 
the pope has called for peace and reconciliation between 
catholics and protestants in northern ireland without taking a 
stand on whether the province should be united with the irish 
republic 
the pope smiled slightly at the beginning of the interruption 
but otherwise was impassive john paul resumed his speech and was 
again interrupted this time by applause 
as he has throughout the trip the pontiff endorsed a common 
political structure for europe and called on europe to resume her 
role as a beacon in the civilization of the world by fighting 
pollution prejudice and secularization 
a common political structure emanation of the free will of 
the european citizens far from endangering the identity of the 
peoples of the european economic community will be better suited 
to guarantee more fairly the rights particularly cultural of all 
its regions the pope told the 518member body 
the eec countries have agreed to integrate their economies by 
1992 and some common market officials have called for development 
of a common political organization perhaps even a united states 
of europe 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher raised protests 
last month from other european governments when she declared that 
such an idea was utopian and would detract from the diversity 
of european cultures 
besides britain and france the eec members are west germany 
italy luxembourg belgium the netherlands denmark greece 
ireland portugal and spain 
the pope attacked secular humanism and indirectly criticized 
communist and religious fundamentalist governments in his address 
to the parliamentarians 
as he has in the past the pope called for eastern and western 
europe to unite and build on their common christian heritage 
it is my duty to stress vigorously that if the religious and 
christian substratum of this continent should someday be 
marginalized in its role of inspiring ethics and in its social 
efficacy it is not only all of the heritage of the european past 
that would be denied but a future worthy of european man said 
john paul who began the speech in english then turned to french 
the pontiff was greeted with applause and cries of vive le 
pape as he arrived in a drizzle at the palace of europe 
he began his day by meeting with nuns and priests at the 
mountaintop mont saint odile monastery and paying homge do the 
patron saint of alsacelorraine he was then to fly back to the 
vatican from the alsatian city of muhouse 
soon after his arrival in france on saturday the pope pursued 
the theme of unity in speeches at the council of europe and the 
european court of human rights 
in the opening session of parliament on monday a shouting match 
broke out between niall andrews an irish catholic conservative 
and paisley 
andrews called paisley an institutional terrorist paisley 
yelled back that he opposed both the pontiff and the roman catholic 
church 
i do not believe he is infallible i do not believe he is the 
sole representative of christ on earth paisley shouted

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may bar publication or broadcast of a rape victims 
name that reporters get from law enforcement officials 
the court said it will hear an appeal by a weekly florida 
newspaper ordered to pay 97500 to a rape victim for what the 
paper said was inadvertent publication of her name 
lawyers for the florida star a newspaper primarily serving the 
black community in jacksonville said it will be put out of 
business if forced to pay the award 
the star obtained the rape victims name from a report posted by 
the jacksonville sheriffs department in its press room in october 
1983 
the newspaper said a reporter trainee copied the sheriffs 
report including the victims name it was published even though 
the newspaper has a policy against identifying rape victims 
there was no factual dispute that the name was published in 
error and in violation of the stars own policy the newspaper 
said 
publication of the name violated a florida law that makes it a 
misdemeanor to publish or broadcast names or other identifying 
information of the victim of any sexual offense 
the victim of the 1983 assault sued sheriff dale carson and the 
star she was awarded 2500 from the sheriff and 97500 from the 
newspaper 
lawyers for the star said a 1986 state appeals court ruling that 
upheld the award ignored a series of supreme court decisions 
including a 1975 ruling that states may not outlaw the broadcast of 
rape victims names 
in that case the victims name was used in an open court 
hearing in which five men pleaded guilty to the attack 
in that 1975 ruling the supreme court said the constitutions 
first amendment does not allow states to impose sanctions for the 
publication of truthful information contained in official court 
records open to public inspection 
lawyers for the florida rape victim a nurses assistant with 
four children said there is a distinction between court records 
and the report provided by the jacksonville sheriff 
the lawyers said the sheriff mistakenly made the victims name 
available and therefore the report was not a public record in the 
sense that it was available for inspection by the public 
the reporters committee for freedom of the press and the times 
herald printing co publisher of the dallas times herald urged 
the supreme court to overturn the florida court ruling 
the justices seeking assurances that they have authority to 
rule in the case sent it back to the florida supreme court last 
december the state court then removed any procedural obstacle 
in other action the court 
refused to kill a lawsuit charging the boeing company with 
illegal age bias because it bars pilots from active flight status 
when they reach 60 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that reinstated 
the suit 
refused to revive a challenge to the way laurence a tisch 
became president of cbs inc 
the justices without comment let stand ruling that tischs 
assumption of power did not amount to a transfer of control 
requiring prior approval by the federal communications commission 
agreed to review the award of more than 4 million in fees to 
lawyers who won a kansas city school desegregation lawsuit 
the court said it will hear an appeal by missouri officials who 
want to reduce the amount 
allowed california officials to block a private clubs 
beachfront development unless the club vows not to discriminate 
against minorities and women 
the court citing a lack of a substantial federal issue 
rejected arguments that the antibias requirement violates club 
members right to associate with whom they please 
turned down an appeal by former new york yankees pitcher art 
ditmar who was mistakenly identified in a beer commercial as having 
surrendered a famous world series homerun 
the court citing a lack of jurisdiction let stand a ruling 
that wrongly being branded a gopher ball pitcher generally is 
not a serious enough matter to sustain a libel lawsuit 
the rapevictim case is the florida star vs bjf 87329

gave birth to her son robert on june 23 1983 
robert was born with downs syndrome a genetic disorder that 
causes mental retardation and other defects 
the wilsons cited medical evidence that the risk of a child 
having the disorder is about one in 1000 when the mother is in her 
20s and about one in 300 when she is 36 
the wilsons said kuenzi failed to inform them the disorder can 
be detected by a test known as amniocentesis in which fluid is 
removed from the womb with a needle inserted through the stomach 
the wilsons sued the doctor for negligence on their own behalf 
a wrongful birth claim and on their sons behalf a wrongful life 
claim 
missouri enacted a law in 1986 which bars such suits 
the missouri supreme court ruled last april that the law could 
not be applied retroactively to block the wilsons suit 
but the state court dismissed the suit anyway ruling that 
permitting such suits conflicts with the states policy on personal 
injury claims or torts 
a finding that we will not create and will not recognize 
either a new tort for wrongful life or for wrongful birth is in our 
opinion totally compatible with the policy considerations expressed 
by our legislature in attempting to limit the statute of 
limitations for malpractice actions the state court said 
in the wrongfulbirth action the right to recovery is based 
solely on the woman testifying long after the fact and when it is 
in her financial interest to do so that she would have chosen to 
abort if the physician had but told her of the amniocentesis 
test the state court said it would seem that testimony either 
more verifiable based upon experience or more verifiable by some 
objective standard should be required as the basis for any action 
for substantial damages 
in the appeal acted on today the wilsons said that barring the 
suit violated their constitutional rights the state court did not 
address that question specifically 
the state court did note that wrongfulbirth suits have been 
permitted in some states but the missouri court said those states 
have had trouble explaining how a genetic disorder is the result of 
any injury negligently inflicted by the doctor 
the wilsons said shielding doctors from such suits restricts 
freedom of choice for women by allowing physicians who oppose 
abortion for moral or religious reasons to withhold vital 
information from the mother 
the case is wilson vs kuenzi 88362

they attorney for a key defendant in the 
71 million wells fargo robbery trial told jurors today that his 
client knew in advance that the heist would occur received stolen 
money and distributed it to fellow puerto rican nationalists 
attorney leonard weinglass said however that his client juan 
segarra palmer was innocent of the crimes with which he has been 
charged because he didnt actually plan the robbery or carry it out 
the trial of segarra and four other defendants began today in 
us district court in hartford the robbery of 71 million from 
the wells fargo depot in west hartford on sept 12 1983 was the 
second largest cash heist in us history 
segarra was a leader in a group known as los macheteros which 
advocates independence for puerto rico and weinglass said that 
is the crux of the governments case 
this is a classic example of how the government deals with a 
political enemy weinglass said in his opening statment to the 
jury 
he said that in an attempt to crush the group the government 
has heaped 17 criminal counts on segarra weinglass conceded that 
receiving stolen funds is a crime but said segarra hasnt been 
charged with that offense 
the trial is expected to last several months 
the other four defendants are carlos ayes suarez norman ramirez 
talavera roberto maldonado rivera and antonio comacho negron 
the trial of nine other defendants was postponed following a 
ruling by us district judge t emmet clarie earlier this year 
tossing out some wiretap evidence collected against them by the 
fbi the government is appealing that ruling 
two other defendants pleaded guilty last month 
the fbi says that a wells fargo security guard who is now 
missing was actually responsible for the theft of the west 
hartford depot on sept 12 1983 victor m gerena formerly of 
hartford is accused of tying up coworkers loading the cash into 
a car and fleeing to cuba where he is still believed to be hiding 
out the fbi says 
us attorney albert s dabrowski told the 12 jurors and six 
alternates who will remain anonymous under claries order that 
segarra is the key defendant because he was the only one involved 
from the beginning in plotting the robbery to the end in the 
distribution of stolen funds 
dabrowski warned jurors that it would be a complex case 
it took years to perpetrate the offense and it will take 
months to prove it dabrowski said 
weinglass said gerena plotted and singlehandedly pulled off the 
robbery after becoming convinced that it was a way to further the 
independence of puerto rico 
he said gerena sought out segarra because of the defendants 
harvard education and knowledge of english though he didnt plan 
the heist segarra agreed to accept the money and distribute it 
through los matcheros weinglass said

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the death sentence of south carolina murderer demetrius 
gathers convicted of a 1986 killing in a charleston city park 
the justices said they will review a south carolina supreme 
court ruling that threw out gathers sentence last june 6 
gathers was convicted of killing richard haynes 32 during a 
sept 13 1986 attack in which haynes was beaten and stabbed 
the states highest court upheld gathers conviction but ruled 
that during the sentencing trial jurors wrongly were told that 
haynes was a religious man 
the state court said such comments by a prosecutor focused on 
the victims characteristics which it said is prohibited by a 1987 
supreme court decision in a maryland case 
in it the justices ruled that a murders impact on the victims 
family may not be considered when the killer faces a possible death 
sentence 
the justices also said in the 1987 ruling that there is no 
justification for letting a lifeordeath sentencing decision 
turn on the perception that the victim was a sterling member of 
the community rather than someone of questionable character 
in gathers case the south carolina court said the prosecutor 
acted unconstitutionally by focusing extensively on the personal 
characteristics of the victim 
the state court said the prosecutors remarks conveyed the 
suggestion gathers deserved a death sentence because the victim 
was a religous man and a registered voter 
in his closing argument the prosecutor told jurors that among 
the things found at the murder scene were various religious items 
and a voter registration card belonging to haynes 
we know from the proof that haynes was a religious person 
he believed in this community he took part the prosecutor 
had said 
in the appeal acted on today south carolina attorney general t 
travis medlock argued that the state court misinterpreted the 
justices 1987 decision 
and he urged the justices to reverse their 1987 ruling stating 
the eighth amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment does 
not preclude comments on victim characteristics related to a 
crime 
the case is south carolina vs gathers 88305

the national rifle association for the second 
time in two years lost a supreme court challenge to a minnesota 
law that required it to disclose the names of over 20000 nra 
members 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments that the 
minnesota controversy never should have landed in federal court 
the justices in 1986 let stand again without comment rulings 
that the minnesota ethics in government act does not violate the 
freespeech or associational rights of nra members 
the law requires lobbying groups to register with the state and 
disclose the names addresses and places of employment of all those 
who contributed more than 50 
the minnesota ethical practices board which enforces the law 
said the nra is a lobbying group because in part it spent 
thousands of dollars on mailings attacking former state attorney 
general warren spannaus in his 1982 gubernatorial campaign 
spannaus lost the democratic primary to rudy perpich who was 
later elected governor 
us district judge miles lord upheld the law in a may 2 1984 
ruling subsequent nra appeals to the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals and the supreme court failed 
the association in late 1984 complied with the law supplying 
the board with the names addresses and places of employment of 
more than 20000 minnesota members to whom letters had been sent in 
connection with the 1982 elections 
records show that 23256 was spent in connection with the 
mailings 
in its 1986 appeal the nra contended that no group should be 
held accountable to government regulation because it communicates 
with its members concerning candidates for state office 
but in the appeal acted on today the nra argued that lord 
lacked the authority to rule in the case because the state agencys 
lawsuit was based on alleged state law violations 
the lawsuit had been filed in a state court but the nra had the 
case switched to federal court 
the case is nra vs minnesota ethical practices board 88300

a 25yearold man has become the first hemophiliac 
in britain to be treated with genetically engineered blood protein 
a hospital said tuesday 
if the bloodclotting protein proves safe hemophiliacs may be 
able to avoid the risk of getting the deadly aids virus or 
hepatitis from donated plasma scientists say 
the royal free hospitals hemophilia center and hemostasis unit 
said victor budgen of london was the first patient in britain to be 
injected with the substitute protein factor viii 
about half a dozen hemophiliacs in the united states and west 
germany have been treated in recent months with genetically 
produced factor viii he said 
budgen responded excellently to his first injection last 
week and will be monitored for the next six months said dr peter 
kernoff director of the hemophilia center 
if the treatment is successful it will be offered to other 
hemophiliacs kernoff said 
there is an uncertainty associated with any new drug 
kernoff said in a telephone interview i think in this case there 
is every reason for optimism because what is produced is virtually 
the same as natural factor viii 
since about 1960 hemophiliacs have gotten factor viii which 
helps blood clot from the plasma of unknown donors but in the 
process they have risked contract all he said 
about 113 hemophilacs in britain have developed fullblown 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and an estimated 1100 have 
been infected with the aids virus because of exposure to 
contaminated blood products kernoff said

the labor department awarded 2 million in 
emergency grants tuesday to programs in four states for retraining 
migrant and seasonal farm workers whose jobs were lost to the 
effects of the summer drought 
the funds are from a special 5 million account established 
under the job training partnership act when it became clear that 
the dry summer weather would have a devastating effect on fall 
harvest employment 
these workers are caught in an adverse situation beyond their 
control said labor secretary ann mclaughlin we want to 
provide them with the necessary skills training so they can quickly 
return to being productive 
five areas of texas will get a total of 15 million to assist 
some 1100 migrant workers returning to the state their home in 
the winter with little or no income because of the effects of the 
drought on crops the five areas are rural costal bend middle rio 
grand south texas cameron county and hidalgo and wallacy counties 
oregon will get 824500 to help up to 360 of some 12000 
surplus farm workers because water shortages in the eastern part of 
the state decimated sugar beet onion potato and bean crops 
the rural alabama development corp was awarded 200000 to help 
up to 155 seasonal farm workers the money will go to providing 
them with child care health and medical services and in some 
cases emergency shelter clothing and food while they are in 
onthejob training programs 
indianas department of human services will receive 169760 to 
finance among other things a food pantry for farm worker families 
in central indiana through offices in kokomo anderson and south 
bend most of the money will be aimed at vocational skill training 
for migrant and seasonal workers wanting to switch to fulltime 
employment 
previous grants totaling 18 million from the emergency drought 
jobtraining fund job training were awarded last month to jtpa

the federal government resigned 
today staterun media reported one day after a shakeup led the 
nations premier and his deputy to step down 
the ctk news agency said the resignation of the entire 
government a formality following premier lubomir strougals 
resignation was announced in a letter to president gustav husak 
husak accepted the resignation and thanked the government for its 
work ctk said 
strougal a 63yearold economics expert believed to have been 
europes longestserving premier resigned monday the first day of 
a meeting of the policymaking central committee dealing with 
personnel and ideology questions 
he also vacated his seat on the ruling politburo 
his deputy in the federal government peter colotka resigned as 
premier of the slovak socialist republic one of the nations two 
republics and as a member of the politburo 
in a speech to the central committee on monday jan fojtik the 
communist partys chief ideologist made clear that the prague 
leadership was opposed to radical political and economic changes 
similar to those under way in the soviet union 
according to the text of his speech carried by ctk fojtik came 
out in favor of cautious reform and underscored the leading role of 
the party 
one of the most fundamental lessons of the past is that in 
looking for and pursuing new ways of development we must under no 
circumstances permit the weakening of the leading role of the 
communist party fojtik said 
fojtik rejected criticism of czechosovakias hardline approach 
to dissident movements 
we must not close our eyes to any of the risks of reform 
said the ideologist superficial journalism and here we are not 
speaking only about our own authors makes light of some of these 
problems or passes them over in silence altogether while 
dramatizing others 
the shakeup follows similar government reorganizations in the 
soviet union hungary and poland as well as unrest in yugoslavia 
but a liberalization of political life in czechoslovakia seemed 
unlikely 
in his speech to the central committee party chief milos jakes 
made it clear that unlike in neighboring hungary independent human 
rights ecological and other groups would not be allowed to operate 
he warned that formation and operation of antisocialist 
political structures will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted 
while considered a hardliner supporting the crackdown on dissent 
and other harsh policies in earlier years strougal was most 
recently known as a chief advocate of economic and social reforms 
initiated in the soviet union 
however his proposals were amended and watered down by a 
leadership that has so far been reluctant to adopt all the 
innovative changes that have become a trademark of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the names of strougal colotka and foreign minister bohuslav 
chnoupek also came up in a corruption scandal last year 
jakes who become party chief in december has said the fight 
against corruption would be among his priorities 
there have long been rumors about toplevel changes in 
czechoslovakia and jakes and other officials have indicated for 
some time that younger people would be promoted to senior positions 
it was believed that strougals departure and other changes 
affecting the party and government hierarchy were discussed and 
endorsed by a politburo meeting last week 
in interviews with western newspapers earlier this year 
strougal indicated that he was considering leaving the government 
he took over 16 months after soviet tanks crushed the czechoslovak 
reform movement known as prague spring 
restructuring affects all spheres of social life strougal 
said in a speech before workers in april this year it is not 
possible to relate it only to the economy because even the need 
for higher output and quality is not limited to the production 
sphere alone 
we have embarked on a difficult but indispensable path because 
continuing the way we went so far would mean allowing stagnation 
with all ensuing consequences he said

thousands of students at universities 
nationwide today rallied to demand legalization of the outlawed 
independent students association and solidarity 
demonstrations were held at about 30 universities and colleges 
in major cities throughout poland said piotr sosnowski an 
association spokesman in gdansk 
the government said it disapproved of the demonstrations and 
accused students of trying to torpedo upcoming talks between 
authorities and opposition leaders 
the talks were promised by the government after a series of 
prosolidarity strikes ended in august they are expected this 
month but no date has been set 
about 1500 students gathered at noon at warsaw university they 
raised banners for their organization and for the solidarity trade 
union federation and chanted the names of the two banned groups 
earlier members of the officially recognized polish students 
association distributed leaflets saying one students organization 
could not represent all students 
supporters of the other student group burned the leaflets and 
said the official organization was blocking their efforts to gain 
legalization 
polish authorities legally registered the independent students 
association in feb 1981 but it was banned shortly after the 
martial law crackdown in dec 1981 solidarity was also banned then 
the warsaw university students are demanding amendments to the 
law on higher education to give them more autonomy lifting of 
obligatory courses in the russian language and reform of the 
required military training course 
professor grzegorz bialkowski the rector of warsaw university 
which has the most politically active student body in poland said 
in an interview last week that he favors legalization of the 
independent students association because it would make it easier 
to negotiate with the students they are not criminals and they 
should be allowed to be active he said 
the government and the staterun press have criticized the 
student demonstrations saying they could hinder agreement between 
the authorities and the opposition 
we treat students demonstrations as excesses which are the 
symtom of bad intentions of the organizers and political immaturity 
of particpants government spokesman jerzy urban said at his 
weekly news conference today 
those demonstrations are being organized right before the 
debates of the round table so they are adventurous behavior aimed 
against national accord and in fact an attempt to torpedo the 
round table and show arrogance to all the participants urban 
said 
a week ago a small group of warsaw university students began a 
daily picket in front of the barracks where the military training 
course is held and more than than 300 have joined the protest 
said mariusz kaminski one of the organizers 
the banned student group also set up a human rights monitoring 
group students who were detained or beaten at an alternative 
demonstration on friday were urged to contact the group 
the demonstrators at warsaw university dispersed peacefully 
after about 45 minutes organizers had asked the students not to 
continue the rally on the streets outside the university grounds

hundreds of demonstrators angry with the 
federal governments response to the aids crisis effectively shut 
down the food and drug administrations headquarters today 
authorities arrested at least 50 protesters demonstration 
leaders said they were aiming for 300 arrests by early afternoon 
but it appeared they would not meet their goal 
scores of federal employees were stranded outside the sprawling 
17story building when montgomery county police stopped letting 
workers inside at 730 am 
the fda had planned for its workforce of 2000 out of 4500 
federal employes who work in the building to arrive early and use 
a rear entrance but a small band of demonstrators broke off from 
the main body of protesters at the buildings main entrance and 
blocked the other three entrances 
rather than trying to separate demonstrators from building 
employees police told arriving workers the building was closed 
two hours later police officers at intersections near the building 
approached workers and told them the building was closed 
many employees caught offguard when police closed the building 
lined up at pay phones nearby to call their coworkers inside and 
find out what to do 
one unidentified woman said she was told that only six of 30 
people in her office had made it in another person said he was 
told that just four of his 20 or so coworkers had arrived 
yet fda spokesman brad stone said were just trying to get 
through the workday as usual people seem to be taking it in 
stride and things are going pretty routinely 
stone said he had walked through several floors occupied by the 
fda and estimated that 75 percent of the fda workforce was on the 
job 
it sure looks more occupied than when there is a bad snow 
day he added 
the arrest procedure was simple groups of a halfdozen or so 
protesters would sit down outside the main entrance at the feet of 
a line of police officers when the officers actually handling the 
arrests completed processing one batch of arrestees they would 
return to the entrance and make more arrests 
others of the demonstrators circled in front of the buildings 
entrances chanting act up fight back fight aids and test 
drugs not people 
leaders of the protest describe the fdas response to the aids 
crisis as criminally inadequate 
on monday a small contingent of police watched as a series of 
speakers outside the headquarters of the health and human services 
department ridiculed the reagan administration saying it has done 
little to help aids victims or support research toward a cure 
protesters also castigated news organizations saying they have not 
paid enough attention to the disease 
mondays rally was organized as a mock trial with speaker after 
speaker reading off a list of charges against the 
administration as a judge stood by nodding affirmatively at 
each count 
guilty guilty guilty the crowd chanted as various charges 
were leveled 
a major focus of the rally was to press for wide access to 
experimental drugs for people suffering from aids or acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
as of sept 26 aids had been diagnosed in 74447 americans 
according to the federal centers for disease control of those the 
cdc says 41925 have died

an independent electric power generator said 
tuesday it would help finance 385 square miles of forests in 
guatemala to offset the carbon dioxide emissions expected from a 
connecticut generating plant over the next 40 years 
carbon dioxide is the principal gas responsible for the expected 
greenhouse effect warming of the earth it is an inevitable 
byproduct of combustion of all fossil fuels 
applied energy services inc of arlington va said it would 
give 2 million to a project aimed at planting almost 52 million 
trees in plantations and small farmer woodlots 
the peace corps the us agency for international development 
care and the government of guatemala also will contribute cash or 
services to the project 
applied energy services is building a coalfired 180megawatt 
plant at uncasville conn which will sell electricity under 
contract to connecticut light amp power co when it goes into service 
in about a year 
though a mature forest neither absorbs nor releases carbon 
dioxide on balance the widespread destruction of tropical forests 
and burning of their wood probably accounts for about a fifth of 
all releases of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere said gus speth

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
16yearold sex discrimination case against the cleveland plain 
dealer 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
the lawsuit because of delays by the cleveland newspaper guild and 
others in pursuing the case 
justices byron r white and harry a blackmun voted to hear 
arguments in the case but the votes of at least four justices are 
required to grant such review 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals in a 105 ruling last 
february said it would be unfair to permit the newspaper to be 
sued after such a long delay 
the appeals court also rejected arguments by the union and the 
women who accused the plain dealer of bias that the newspaper had 
unclean hands because it contributed to the delays 
the appeals court said that while throwing out such a civil 
rights suit is an extreme measure it is necessary when the 
prejudice to the defendant can be avoided in no other way 
the case began in april 1972 when the newspaper guild on behalf 
of its female members filed a charge with the federal equal 
employment opportunity commission 
the complaint accused the newspaper of sex discrimination in its 
handling of merit pay promotions and assignments and in other 
employment practices 
four years passed before the eeoc began its investigation 
another six years elapsed before the union and its members sued the 
plain dealer in federal court 
in 1976 the plain dealer refused to surrender personnel records 
sought by the federal agency in 1980 the newspaper said the 
documents no longer were available 
the 6th circuit court said the newspapers lack of cooperation 
with the commissions investigation does not explain the initial 
fouryear delay in launching the probe 
the appeals court noted that the trial judge who dismissed the 
suit initially had found that the eeocs notice to defendant to 
retain personnel records was too ambiguous to serve as a valid 
command 
the case is cleveland newspaper guild vs plain dealer 871864

michael dukakis boosted economic 
nationalism while tossing barbs at his republican opponents 
tuesday promising as president to restore american leadership in 
science and technology and translate that into dominance of global 
markets 
dukakis said that he and democratic running mate lloyd bentsen 
would be aggressive advocates for us companies and workers while 
republican george bush was satisfied with today and complacent 
about tomorrow 
dukakis delighted the partisan crowd at tufts university with 
new salvos at the gop ticket saying the republican campaign song 
seems to be dont worry be happy a tune played at a recent 
bush event 
i want us to be happy but i also want us to be concerned 
dukakis said then lashing out at the bottom half of the 
republican ticket he added dan quayle asks us to believe that 
if he ever had to fill in for george bush america could get by on 
a right wing and a prayer 
dukakis ticked off a sixpoint plan aimed at improving us 
science teaching and technology as well as product development and 
he spoke of the new economic patriotism that has become a 
staple of his attempt to win support from bluecollar workers and 
middle class voters concerned about their jobs and effects of the 
federal budget and trade deficits 
we have a choice dukakis said will we keep running in 
place or will we forge ahead will the future belong to our 
competitors or to us will we sell out more and more of our land 
and our factories and our banks or will we take charge of our 
future 
together we can build a future where the best products in the 
world are designed by american minds built by american hands and 
produce good profits and good paychecks here on american soil he 
said 
bush meanwhile in a speech prepared for delivery to college 
students in seattle accused dukakis of protectionist 
demagoguery in his criticism of foreign ownership of us 
businesses 
my opponent needs an issue and hes willing to scare people 
to find it bush said 
dukakis on another subject also appeared on national 
television to denounce what he called the crass and cynical 
campaign tactics of bush in connection with attacks on dukakis as 
soft on crime in addition he attended a breakfast with vietnam 
veterans and recipients of the congressional medal of honor and 
spent several hours preparing for his second and final debate with 
bush thursday night in los angeles 
dukakis was flying to california later tuesday 
at tufts university about two dozen bush supporters gathered 
outside and chanted bush 88 as dukakis arrived and left 
inside dukakis declared if we can build the greatest 
spaceship the world has ever seen then we ought to be able to 
build the televisions and the vcrs that compete and that win in 
foreign markets 
the six points discussed by dukakis most of them proposals he 
has touched on earlier in the campaign include 
having the national science foundation issue annual 
statebystate reports on the quality of science education 
establishing seminars to help science instructors improve their 
teaching 
calling on scientists and engineers including retirees to 
teach classes 
persuading industry to set up worksite technology training and 
retraining centers 
a nationwide network of centers of excellence modeled after 
state programs designed to foster research and new product 
development 
cooperation between us companies in advanced technologies 
such as superconductivity and consumer electronics 
we need a commander in chief who stands up and fights for 
american companies american products and american jobs said 
dukakis who said bentsen would be his top deputy in the trade war 
i want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact discs 
to the germans and the japanese and the koreans not arms to the 
ayatollah 
dukakis also joked about his october surprise a speech last 
week in which he warned against growing foreign investment in the 
united states only to find out after the speech that the company at 
which he sounded the warning was owned by an italian firm 
im not against foreign ownership dukakis said after making 
light of his mistake im against the policies that make us 
dependent im against a fire sale of america 
during the morning telvision appearance dukakis appeared upbeat 
about the debate and repeated his contention that bush was 
exploiting a tragedy involving a massachusetts furlough program for 
political gain because of bushs own failure as the reagan 
administrations point man on crime and drugs 
speaking on nbcs today program he denounced bush for 
repeatedly detailing the violent assault of a maryland couple by a 
murderer who escaped while on a massachusetts furlough 
to use these human tragedies for your own political purposes 
i think is really a very crass and cynical thing said dukakis 
who said similar tragedies have occurred in the federal furlough 
program and in one ronald reagan supported while governor of 
california

the conservative party opened its 
convention tuesday shadowed by massive security and memories of an 
irish republican army attempt to kill prime minister margaret 
thatcher in the same town four years ago 
the fourday annual convention began on a sour note as delegates 
booed the socialist mayor of brighton for implying in her welcoming 
speech that the tories freemarket doctrines were making britons 
greedy and uncaring 
defense secretary george younger pledged to retain britains 
independent nuclear deterrent by deploying usmade trident 
sealaunched missiles in the 1990s 
he ridiculed the opposition labor partys commitment to 
unilateral nuclear disarmament reaffirmed at labors convention 
last week saying it would leave us totally vulnerable to nuclear 
attack 
younger said there was no sign that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev had slowed the pace of military buildup adding by all 
means let us welcome the new atmosphere and the smile of mr 
gorbachev but let us recognize the military realities that lie 
behind that smile 
the convention was back in brighton for the first time since 
1984 when an ira bomb planted in mrs thatchers hotel killed five 
people the prime minister narrowly escaped harm 
before joining the convention mrs thatcher attended a private 
memorial service at the nearby church of st pauls for the bombing 
victims and unveiled a plaque inscribed they paid the price of 
freedom 
memories of the bombing surged back anew when former party 
chairman norman tebbit arrived on the conference floor pushing a 
wheelchair carrying his wife margaret who was paralyzed for life 
in the explosion 
delegates stood and cheered the couple 
more than 1500 police officers were drafted into the normally 
staid resort town on the southern coast in the biggest security 
operation ever mounted for a british political conference 
civil overflights were banned a royal navy destroyer patrolled 
the shore and delegates were forced to line up early outside the 
conference hall and endure rigorous security checks 
the bomb damage to the grand hotel has been repaired and as 
mrs thatcher checked in monday night she declared that her 
presence there was a gesture of nonsurrender to terrorism 
the ira issued a statement expressing delight at the hysteria 
and the expense surrounding the security of mrs thatcher and the 
tories at their brighton conference 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to rid 
protestantdominated northern ireland of british rule and unite it 
with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic 
mrs thatcher who turns 63 thursday returned to brighton with 
her dominance of british politics looking even more secure than 
four years ago 
elected in 1979 and 16 months into her third successive 
fiveyear term she is the longest continuously serving british 
prime minister this century 
despite rising inflation and interest rates and a record trade 
deficit the conservatives arrived in brighton with a healthy 
fivepoint lead in polls over the opposition labor party 
the proceedings opened with greetings from mayor pat hawkes a 
laborite who was booed when she urged the tories not to forget the 
needy in an orgy of getting and spending 
as you walk around in brighton she declared to mounting 
heckling look behind the facade of wealth and opulence and think 
about the people over whom the government rules not just the 
haves but the havenots 
a theme of this years conference is the tories need to restore 
their image as a party that cares for the underdog after years of 
budgetslashing and unioncurbing aimed at shaking britain out of 
its economic malaise 
many tories feel that with unemployment finally falling income 
tax slashed and the economy booming they should turn to social 
issues 
michael heseltine a former cabinet minister tipped as a 
possible thatcher heir urged the government to spend the cash from 
the richer britain it had created on inner cities and the 
environment 
we want a fair distribution of wealth between the 
privileged and the less privileged a generous society 
heseltine told a convention meeting

a philosophy student whose conscience 
apparently bothered him was arrested after he balked at keeping the 
booty from a shoe store robbery police said 
john p breuker a 20yearold parttime student at calvin 
college was released monday on 500 bond after being charged with 
attempted armed robbery 
jane kelm manager of payless shoesource in the grand rapids 
suburb said a robber saturday night handed her a note that said 
dont look at me if you do ill kill you i have a gun 
calmly quietly open the drawer and put all the bills in the bag 
the gun is ready and its aimed at you just do everything the way 
i want it and dont be stupid remember dont look at me 
kelm said she gave the thief an unspecified amount of money and 
he fled 
police say breuker called authorities about four hours later and 
said he would drop off the money at a gas station 
were thinking he had second thoughts and decided to give the 
money back with the idea that hed get out of it said police 
chief terry tobias 
ryan rohloff assistant manager at the gas station said he was 
working the night shift when a man entered and telephoned police 
it was a funny story the old friendofafriend story 
rohloff said he said a friend robbed a business and that he 
ended up with the money and that the friend asked him to turn it in 
anonymously 
rohloff said the man hung up the phone and asked him to hold the 
money until police arrived 
he said i just got to leave you do what you have to do i 
cant stay any longer rohloff said he seemed nervous 
his conscience was just eating him up 
the man drove off and rohloff said he copied down the cars 
license number and gave it to police a state trooper arrested the 
suspect several minutes later tobias said 
breuker faces an oct 24 preliminary hearing

the supreme court today rejected industry 
challenges to federal environmental rules governing the use of high 
smokestacks to disperse air pollution 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that 
strengthens clean air regulations by limiting the use of 
smokestacks as a substitute for other pollution controls 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled in january that the 
environmental protection agency validly adopted the regulations in 
1985 
the rules were prompted in large measure by amendments to the 
clean air act passed by congress in 1977 
the amendments were aimed at resolving disputes over the extent 
to which industries may meet their required contribution to local 
cleanair goals by dispersing pollution rather than by reducing 
emissions 
building taller stacks the leading technique of dispersal 
generally is cheaper than cutting emissions but environmentalists 
say that while dispersing the pollution may provide cleaner air in 
the vicinity of plants and factories it adds to the overall 
pollution in the atmosphere 
the rules upheld by the appeals court limit the extent to which 
reduction in groundlevel pollution near the plants counts toward a 
companys compliance with national cleanair standards 
there are several components to the regulations including the 
height of the stacks and when they were put in place generally 
the government permits higher stacks if they were built or approved 
prior to the adoption of tighter regulations 
coal producers utility companies and the united mine workers of 
america challenged the rules 
they said the environmental protection agency failed to give 
them adequate opportunity to be heard before approving regulations 
that were far more stringent than those originally proposed by the 
agency 
the appeals court said the epa can obviously promulgate a 
final regulation that differs in some respects from its proposed 
regulation we think the agencys ultimate choice in 1985 
qualifies if barely as a logical outgrowth of the original 
proposal 
the appeals court also rejected industry arguments that the 
agency illegally was enforcing new rules retroactively 
environmental groups had asked the appeals court to compel the 
epa to adopt even tougher regulations 
the appeals court ruled in favor of the environmentalists on 
some points and against them on others but the environmentalists 
did not appeal to the supreme court 
the cases are alabama power co vs thomas 872068 ohio power 
co vs thomas 8860 and national coal association vs nrdc

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that migrant workers who harvest cucumbers for pickling are 
protected by a federal law requiring fair treatment of employees 
the court rejected an appeal by a wisconsin farmowning couple 
who said the migrants are independent contractors not covered 
by the fair labor standards act 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
the votes of at least four justices are required to grant such 
review 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last december ruled 
against michael and marilyn lauritzen owners of a farm near 
waupaca wis 
the appeals court said the pickers like other migrant workers 
are employees under the federal law it ruled that the lauritzens 
are not entitled to a full trial in the case 
the migrants depend on the lauritzens land crops 
agricultural expertise equipment and marketing skills the 
appeals court said they are the defendants employees 
but the 7th circuit court said that does not mean the lauritzens 
must shoulder an unfair economic burden 
the couple need only think of the proceeds paid to the pickle 
pickers as wages keep the necessary records and make sure they 
abide by the protections that the act accords to working 
children the appeals court said 
the us labor department sued the lauritzens to force them to 
keep records of the names ages and work hours of the migrants to 
require them to determine whether young children were working in 
the fields and to guarantee payment of the minimimum wage 
allegations that the farm owners were not paying the minimum 
wage later were dropped 
the migrants usually work in the fields from july through 
september while the crop is often referred to as pickles it 
actually is a type of cucumber suitable for pickling 
the lauritzens subdivide their property into family plots and 
the migrant family decides which members will pick the pickles the 
migrants income is determined in part by their ability to judge 
the pickles size color and freshness so as to harvest the more 
valuable pickles 
the workers also can increase their income by caring for the 
plants and pickles on their plot 
but the 7th circuit court said those factors do not mean the 
workers are anything other than employees 
the lauritzens did not effectively relinquish control of the 
harvest to the migrants the appeals court said 
and the appeals court added the need for some skill in 
harvesting pickles does not make the migrants independent 
contractors 
skills are not the monoply of independent contractors we do 
not find that this level of skill sets the pickle harvester apart 
from the harvester of other crops the appeals court said 
the case is lauritzen vs brock 871853

former cambodian leader prince norodom 
sihanouk voiced support today for any move to get pol pot and other 
leaders of the khmer rouge exiled from the wartorn southeast asian 
nation 
following a brief meeting at the white house with president 
reagan sihanouk was asked by reporters to comment on a report 
saying many asian officials see such an exile as a key element to a 
political settlement in cambodia now known formally as kampuchea 
the prince who will travel to the united nations after meetings 
with us officials here said when i met with the chinese 
leadership in peking before coming to europe and to america i did 
not get from china any indication that china would like to accept a 
pol pot in exile 
but sihanouk who heads a small anticommunist faction known as 
the national party of sihanouk added that i think that it is 
necessary to give the world some guarantee about the khmer rouge in 
the future 
i think the ones who are responsible for the genocide of the 
cambodian people in the 1970s must not continue to lead the 
khmer rouge movement and they must go into exile if possible he 
said 
the new york times in a story published in todays editions 
said many diplomats view china as a likely haven for pol pot and 
other figures of the khmer rouge the communist regime that pol pot 
headed before being ousted during the vietnamese invasion of 1978 
during his daily news briefing white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said that reagan told sihanouk that he supported 
sihanouks efforts to establish a reconciliation government in 
cambodia 
he said our policy rests on two elements a complete 
vietnamese withdrawal and no return to power of the khmer rouge 
fitzwater said 
he said that reagan told the prince that the united states is 
prepared to join an international conference to ratify any solution 
worked out by the parties and further that we believe an 
international presence in camobodia is needed 
the vietnamese announced months ago that they planned to pull as 
many as 50000 troops out of cambodia by the end of this year 
but sihanouk said today that the withdrawal is not progressing 
satisfactorily 
he said the puppet regime installed by hanoi to run 
cambodias affairs refuses to give a precise timetable for the 
withdrawal of the approximately 120000 vietnamese forces from the 
country

and communications skills was kicked off tuesday at a local 
elementary school

together is aimed at parents with children in grades 1 through 
3 local programs are to be organized by schools and parentteacher 
associations 
the newspaper is the reading material we use most frequently 
in this country said patricia s koppman president of the 
international reading association told a group of educators and 
parents at the gageeckington elementary school 
with newspapers as an inexpensive and readily available 
resource parents can help children have fun with words said 
manya s ungar president of the national congress of parents and 
teachers another program sponsor 
suggestions for parents range from helping children read 
headlines to having youngsters search the paper for pictures of 
their favorite foods to cutting a comic strip into individual 
pictures and asking the child to put them in order 
the exercises are designed to establish an enthusiastic

king fahd held out an olive branch 
to iran on tuesday 5 months after severing relations with tehran 
saying he was sorry the iranians werent at a meeting of islamic 
information ministers 
i would have wished the iranian delegation to be with us he 
told 45 ministers when the session opened in this red sea city 
iran is an islamic country and deep in my heart i would have 
loved to see my iranian brothers here today the monarch said in 
his speech 
fahds signal was the clearest in a series of recent saudi 
gestures toward iran 
the kings moves came amid efforts by tehran to improve its 
relations with its arab neighbors and western nations following the 
aug 20 united nationssponsored ceasefire in the 8yearold war 
with iraq 
the saudis broke off diplomatic relations with tehran april 26 
after accusing the tehran regime of carrying ojuly at the end of the hajj 
or annual pilgrimage to islamic 
shrines in saudi arabia 
iranian pilgrims boycotted the pilgrimage this year because of 
the rift between the two moslem nations 
the kings remarks came a week after the saudi government 
executed four saboteurs it said were working on irans behalf 
the iranians have condemned the executions and accused saudi 
arabia and other gulf arab states of producing more oil than the 
quotas set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries to 
drive down oil prices to weaken tehran 
nonetheless the war of words between the two gulf giants has 
eased in recent months 
fahds conciliatory gestures were in sharp contast to the 
antiiranian sentiments in some of the literature handed out at the 
conference 
one tract titled khomeini and israel detailed alleged 
dealings between ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime and the 
jewish state 
another was a slick publication in several languages and filled 
with color photos of the bloody riots during the 1987 pilgrimage to 
mecca 
more than 400 people 275 of them iranians were killed in that 
violence saudi officials said the bloodshed was instigated by 
iranian militants 
the book also contained photos of iranian dead and prisoners in 
the war with iraq as well as pictures of iranian clerics and 
blackcloaked women parading with automatic rifles and 
rocketpropelled grenade launchers 
the friction between iran whose 50 million population is 
overwhelmingly shiite moslem and saudi arabia most of whose 12 
million people are sunni moslems mirrors a centuriesold schism in 
the islamic world and historical animosity between the arabs and 
persians 
fahds remarks opened a meeting that officials indicated was 
aimed at improving the exchange of information between moslem 
countries and islams image in the nonmoslem world 
this reflected concerns acknowledged privately by some 
officials that iranianbacked terrorism and other aggressive 
fundamentalist activities have harmed islam with 800 million 
adherents around the world 
during the gulf war iran accused kuwait and saudi arabia of 
aiding iraq 
kuwait has increased diplomatic links with tehran in what was 
seen as a general move by gulf states to normalize relations with 
iran

the supreme court on tuesday dismissed 
an appeal by a sikh sentenced to death for the 1984 assassination 
of prime minister indira gandhi 
a panel of three judges said it found no merit to entertain 
the petition of kehar singh one of two sikhs sentenced to death 
by hanging for the 1984 murder of mrs gandhi 
kehar singhs lawyer ram jethmalani had said there was no 
evidence linking his client who was convicted in january 1986 on 
charges of conspiracy with the prime ministers assassination 
pratap singh a sikh doctor said in the appeal that he opposed 
kehar singhs conviction because no autopsy was performed on mrs 
gandhi 
mrs gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her new delhi 
home on oct 31 1984 by two of her sikh bodyguards satwant singh 
and beant singh 
security guards fired at the two after the assassination and 
beant singh was killed satwant singh was convicted of murder in 
1986 and sentenced to death 
the two singhs were not related singh which means lion in the 
punjabi language is part of every sikhs name by doctrine of the 
faith 
kehar singh a former government employee and beant singhs 
uncle was arrested on nov 30 1984 and charged with conspiracy 
he was convicted and sentenced to death along with satwant singh in 
january 1986 
the supreme court on sept 7 rejected a previous appeal by the 
two men 
satwant singh and kehar singh have no legal appeal left but 
they can ask president ramaswamy venkataraman for mercy if the 
president turns down their pleas they will be hanged 
 
mrs gandhis assassination apparently was in revenge for an 
army attack she ordered on sikhisms holiest shrine the golden 
temple in amritsar which was used as a base by sikh militants 
fighting for a homeland in the northern state of punjab at least 
2000 sikhs died in the attack 
sikhs comprise 2 percent of indias 800 million people but they 
form a majority in punjab radical members of the community claim 
they are discriminated against by the hindus 
the sikh campaign for a homeland has claimed more than 1800 
lives this year

energy department officials declaring a need 
to rectify past sins in its operation of atomic reactors today 
announced that the introduction of new safety procedures would 
delay restarting the savannah river plant which produces nuclear 
weapons materials 
energy undersecretary joseph salgado also gave assurances that 
plutonium and tritium supplies are adequate to ensure that existing 
nuclear weapons would not degrade or be cannibalized to assure a 
continued strategic deterrent 
the three aging reactors at savannah river in aiken sc have 
been shut down for safety considerations construction of new 
reactors to produce nuclear weapons materials is not expected to 
start until the early 1990s 
salgado addressing a midday news conference said that energy 
department officials have ordered engineers at the savannah river 
plant to start up the kreactor in december during a fourweek 
phased operation that should bring it close to full steam in early 
january 
department officials have also decided to postpone restarting 
the plants preactor which experienced problems in august in 
congressional testimony on sept 30 salgado said the preactor 
could be restarted within 3045 days but department officials now 
have decided that it should not be brought back into operation 
until late 1989 he said 
the third facility at the plant the lreactor is scheduled to 
be restarted in the first three months of next year he said 
all three reactors will be started slowly using what deputy 
assistant energy secertary richard w starostecki described as a 
phased operation designed to test and assess each step before 
the reactor is brought to full power 
new operating procedures are needed to ensure safety at savannah 
river which has come under renewed scrutiny on capitol hill in the 
wake of internal memoranda detailing operting problems since the 
plant opened in the early 1950s said salgado starostecki and 
other energy department officials 
we have a moral obligation to rectify past sins salgado 
told the news conference 
an energy department statement issued after the news conference 
said that three savannah river reactors are the nations only 
source of the tritium needed for the nations nuclear deterrent 
plutonium also produced by the reactors has a longer halflife 
than tritium and therefore does not pose as critical a problem 
at present all three reactors are out of service for routine 
maintenance and accelerated safety upgrades the statement said 
the department is implementing a comprehensive program at the 
savannah river plant to enable the facility to resume production of 
tritium within acceptable margins of safety it said 
the program is designed to resolve uncertainties about safety 
issues improve operations improve the departments technical 
vigilance and strengthen oversight it said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president reagan had 
been briefed by his national security adviser lt gen colin 
powell on the savannah river situation and related matters 
we feel the supplies of tritium will be maintained as 
production schedules are maintained in a safe manner fitzwater 
said

a us navy chemist has found a way to convert 
sewer gas into diamonds 
dr james e butler tapped washingtons sewage system for the 
methane gas he used to grow diamond crystals at the naval research 
laboratory other chemists at the lab have grown diamond crystals 
by using an oxygenacetylene torch butler said in a telephone 
interview tuesday 
the tiny diamonds made in his process using chemical vapors to 
deposit crystals on a surface could have a variety of industrial 
applications including abrasives protective coatings and 
computer insulators he said 
but i dont think well be able to grow diamonds of gemstone 
size and quality in the near future butler said 
the navy scientists are working on a process that entails 
heating chemical vapors under normal air pressure or less and 
getting carbon from the vapor to crystallize on a surface at 
temperatures of about 1440 degrees fahrenheit 
current industrial processes for making diamonds require much 
higher heat and pressure 
why use sewer gas 
sewer gas was just a case of having a convenient inexpensive 
source of methane butler said the naval research laboratory is 
next door to washingtons blue plains waste water treatment plant 
methane a combination of carbon and hydrogen is a primary 
constituent of sewer gas it is generally burned as waste 
researchers in other countries have performed some similar 
experiments butler said commenting that such sources of carbon as 
vodka have also been used 
it will be years before the diamondmaking system could be 
developed into an industrial scale he said but when that happens 
plenty of raw material will be available

a federal study of elderly motorists called 
tuesday for better screening to identify impaired drivers but 
concluded there is no justification to restrict driving solely on 
the basis of age 
the report by the national research council said that older 
drivers pose a greater risk of being involved in accidents because 
of their slower reaction time vision problems and difficulties in 
gauging heavy traffic flow 
but the study said while driving skills often deteriorate after 
age 75 many elderly people are capable and safe drivers who 
pose less of a risk to highway safety than teenage drivers 
the panel of experts suggested some of the problems with elderly 
drivers could be eased if roadway signs were made larger and 
brighter and highway markings were redesigned to meet the needs of 
older drivers many road signs cannot properly be seen by 40 
percent of the drivers who are 65 years of age or older the study 
said 
age alone is a poor predictor of the driving performance of 
any individual said the report although acknowledging after age 
75 a driver is about twice as likely per mile driven to be 
involved in a crash as middleaged drivers 
the panel called on states to adopt tougher screening methods to 
weed out problem drivers no matter what their age it also 
suggested broader reliance on restricted licenses such as limiting 
driving by some elderly people to daylight hours if they have 
problems seeing at night 
in a costsaving effort some states in recent years have turned 
to mailin license renewals the study noted it criticized such 
practices saying drivers should be required to undergo vision 
tests at least every four years as part of their license renewal 
the national research council panel composed of experts 
assembled by the national academy of sciences spent two years 
examining questions about transportation and the elderly 
it said problems of meeting the transportation needs of older 
citizens will increase in the future as the number of people over 
age 75 increases and more elderly people live in the suburbs where 
less public transit is available 
today about 12 percent of the population is 65 years of age or 
older by the year 2020 the number will increase to about 17 
percent or more than 50 million elderly citizens who will be 
eligible to drive 
the states are not prepared to handle the growing number of 
very old drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident 
involvement the study concluded 
most older persons will probably be quite capable and safe 
drivers but current statistics indicate that drivers 75 and over 
are more at risk of crash involvement than the average driver 
these facts must be acknowledged even though there is no 
justification for restricting driving on the basis of age alone 
it continued 
furthermore the panel said elderly people are more likely to 
suffer serious or fatal injuries than other drivers in accidents of 
similar severity 
the study said elderly people especially those 75 years or 
older often have problems seeing clearly at night gauging traffic 
flow when merging or making left turns and turning their heads 
when backing their vehicles 
communities should improve public transit for the elderly 
develop subsidized taxi programs and construct walkways in suburban 
areas if the transportation requirements of the elderly are to be 
met the study said

montana and wyoming officials are plotting 
a 3 million program to get a message to the worlds vacationers 
yellowstone national park is still there and worth visiting 
john wilson chief of montanas travel promotion office said 
the two states have asked for 3 million in federal money to 
convince travelers here and abroad that the wildfires of 1988 
left much of the park unscarred 
reports on the fires wrongly suggested most of the park was 
blackened said wilson there wasnt a blanket wall of flame that 
just obliterated 12 million acres of the park he said 
while the boundaries of the fires may have encompassed about 
half of yellowstone only 40 percent of that land actually burned 
and a third of that was meadows and undergrowth that will quickly 
grow back he said 
also the fires did not wipe out wildlife or fisheries and the 
major structures and natural features were undamaged wilson said 
before a sept 28 meeting with wyoming tourism officials and 
park representatives at mammoth wilson and members of the montana 
tourism advisory council toured yellowstone and were buoyed by how 
much of it remained uncharred 
it lifted our spirits he said we thought the damage was 
going to be much greater than we saw the fires burned a mosaic 
the beauty of the park will come back 
there are areas that were severely burned but much of the 
underlying layer of plants and grass will grow back next year he 
said 
yellowstone is alive and well he added we can put an 
honest effort together to tell the rest of the world 
the states are working together on a 15minute film chronicling 
the condition of yellowstone the oldest national park the film 
will be sent to travel agencies tour planners and magazines 
wilson said 
if federal funding is provided the states may conduct trade 
missions to personally spread the message throughout the country 
he said

nancy reagan called george bush and his wife 
to say she is very supportive of bushs presidential campaign 
and to deny reports shes loath to turn the white house over to 
them presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
the stories are not true fitzwater said when asked to 
respond to several recent published reports 
fitzwater called such stories outrageous and said it would 
be wrong to assume president reagans wife did not support bush 
because she has not been present at some campaign appearances 
she has not gone on day trips as i recall ever the 
spokesman said 
he added the first lady is very supportive of the bushes 
fitzwater said mrs reagan first spoke with the vice president 
on monday and then later with barbara bush because the vice 
presidents wife was not present when she first called 
the vice president sent her a note thanking her for her 
graciousness and support over the last eight years fitzwater 
said 
mrs reagans spokeswoman elaine crispen said i have to 
laugh a year ago stories were written about her househunting 
and how eager she was to leave now its said shell flatten the 
tires on the moving truck 
the spokeswoman said mrs reagan referred to the stories as 
such foolishness and mrs crispen recalled that at the 
republican convention in new orleans mrs reagan spoke publicly of 
it being time to leave center stage and of her confidence in 
and support of the bushes 
the spokeswoman said mrs reagan did not attend one los angeles 
rally for the bushes because the event was scheduled after she had 
made appointments to be with friends and to deal with the reagans 
new home in bel air 
shes never campaigned for anyone but ronald reagan but that 
doesnt mean she doesnt support the bushes mrs crispen said

a governmentrun newspaper said tuesday 
there has been no progress in the iraniraq peace talks since they 
started over six weeks ago 
the front page editorial in aljoumhouriya was the first comment 
by iraqs official media on the statement saturday by iranian 
foreign minister ali akhbar velayati who said the two sides agreed 
in principle to united nations proposals to end the war 
the daily said that the peace talks to end the war remain 
deadlocked because iran has not committed itself to respecting free 
navigation in the persian gulf and clearing the shaat alarab 
waterway 
it said there was no breakthrough in negotiations and accused 
iran of continuing delaying tactics and procrastination 
the negotiations are still on square one where they started on 
aug 25 aljoumhouriya said of the talks which moved from 
geneva to new york and are expected to return to geneva at the end 
of the month 
the paper said that iraq will not give up its demand for free 
navigation in the gulf and the clearance of the shatt alarab the 
estuary of the tigris and euphrates rivers and iraqs main outlet 
to the sea 
velayati said that iran agreed to a un proposal that it give 
up its right to search ships in the strait of hormuz the strategic 
mouth of the gulf 
he did not mention iraqs demand to clear the shatt alarab 
which forms the southern boundary between the foes before letting 
the talks progress 
neither of the two principles can be substituted for the 
other aljoumhouriya said both are closely linked 
the paper said that iraq cannot benefit from free navigation in 
the gulf without being able to use the shatt alarab 
iraq will not relinquish its rights in seeing these two 
principles applied the paper said 
aljoumhouriya said iraq is ready to show the same patience it 
displayed during the war but the iranian rulers should realize 
that they are impeding the process of peaceit said 
in a related development a senior un official visited the 
iraqi port of basra the countrys secondlargest city and the 
southern sector of the warfront 
un peacekeeping troops have been posted along the border to 
monitor the ceasefire in the 8yearold war

several thousand university of maryland 
students are being tested for aids in what researchers say is the 
first voluntary study to determine how widespread the disease is on 
a college campus 
the universitys college park campus was selected because with 
38000 students it is one of the nations most populated campuses 
enrolls a heterogeneous group of students and is in the 
washingtonbaltimore area where the aids virus is more prevalent 
than is typical nationwide researchers said 
the study is sponsored by the university of marylands medical 
school in baltimore and the national institute for allergy and 
infectious diseases in bethesda 
we wont be able to say where the infection was obtained but 
well be able to assess the rate said the studys director dr 
karen kotloff an assistant professor of pediatric infectious 
diseases at the university of maryland at baltimore 
this is one very unique population we are monitoring a large 
somewhat contained population with a high level of sexual 
activity kotloff said tuesday 
kotloff said she did not expect the rate of positive test 
results for the aids antibody to be as high among college students 
as among military recruits an equivalent age group tests of 
military recruits found 16 out of every 1000 tested positive for 
the hiv virus 
about 200 students were tested monday the day the study began 
kotloff said researchers hope to draw blood from 6000 students 
through nov 30 
students in late adolescence and their early 20s simply dont 
perceive themselves as being at risk because they identify 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome as a disease that primarily 
strikes homosexual men and intravenous drug users said stan 
kinder assistant director of the university health center 
students who participated expressed hope the study would 
increase awareness 
i think its really good theyre doing it because maybe it 
will make people more aware you cant just jump in anybodys bed 
and cavort around said tanya mattocks a sophomore the 
disease is there you cant just say i wont get it 
senior tom fennelly called the study a good way for students 
who are shy about it to find out confidentially if they have the 
virus 
the federal centers for disease control in atlanta is also 
sponsoring a study involving 20 campuses nationwide including 
college park each campus is being asked to provide samples of 
blood from 1000 students 
kotloff said the new study differs significantly from the cdcs 
the cdc study is an anonymous test of the blood of students who 
come into campus health clinics for other reasons and gave a blood 
sample while they are there 
the college park study uses volunteers who are asked to complete 
a questionnaire about their sexual practices along with basic 
information such as age race sex and residence students are 
counseled about the implications of the test results before 
donating blood kotloff said 
participants will be able to find out the result of their tests 
which will remain confidential officials said 
kotloff said her study will also test an additional 2000 blood 
samples obtained anonymously to use as a check of the voluntary 
study

the supreme court agreed today to decide the 
deadlines for filing a civil rights discrimination case 
the case involves patricia a lorance janice m king and carol 
s bueschen employees in the atampts montgomery works in aurora 
ill who were demoted in 1982 because of a restructured seniority 
system 
the women claim that the seniority system incorporated into a 
contract between atampt technologies and local 1942 of the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers were designed to 
limit the job rights of female workers who had recently been 
promoted into traditionally male jobs 
they filed charges with the equal opportunity commission in 
april 1983 within the 300day time period prescribed by law if 
that period started with the date the seniority system caused their 
demotions 
in 1986 a federal magistrate determined the three had slept 
on their rights because they did not file charges within 300 days 
of when the new seniority system was adopted in august 1980 a 
federal district judge and the 
7th us circuit court of appeals issued similar rulings 
the plaintiffs lawyers told the high court that there are 
conflicts among different appeals court circuits on what 
constitutes filing within a proper time limits 
three circuits have determined that the mere existence without 
an application of a discriminatory practice is an insufficient 
basis for a cause of action they told the court in their 
petition for a hearing 
however the 7th circuit requires workers to forfeit their 
rights if they do not file charges of discrimination within 300 
days of becoming subject to a discriminatory practice even though 
there has been no application of the practice 
the case is lorance vs atampt technologies 871428

nearly 11000 kurdish refugees who 
fled iraq for turkey amid allegations of chemical weapon attacks on 
their homes reportedly have been transfered to iran in the last 
four days 
turkeys semiofficial news agency anatolia reported tuesday 
that 10862 refugees who were among the 60000 kurds who fled 
iraq were taken in buses and trucks from two tent cities in 
southeast turkey and transferred to iran

called zive which was operated by massoud barzani president of 
the kurdish democratic party zive is near the iraqi border 
about 8000 went to iran last month before the transfers were 
halted because of lack of shelter 
iran offered to accept any of the kurdish refugees in turkey 
during the iraniraq war iran supported kurdish guerrillas 
fighting for autonomy in northern iraq

residents will decide next month whether a 
proposal to permit predominantly black boston neighborhoods to 
become a separate new city named mandela amounts to segregation or 
good civic sense 
the nonbinding referendum on the ballot nov 8 is similar to 
one soundly defeated in 1986 by a 31 margin those results were 
far better than the 91 margin of defeat predicted and backers who 
say the change would improve municipal services said they were 
encouraged to try again 
if the reaction had been a big yawn then we probably wouldnt 
be doing this right now said state rep byron rushing a boston 
democrat 
but this time there is little of the excitement created two 
years ago the movement that inspired its own rap song in 1986 
hasnt even drawn formal opposition this time 
the rev charles r stith a prominent black leader and a chief 
opponent said the proposed city of mandela named after jailed 
black south african nationalist nelson mandela could not survive 
without the citywide tax base of boston 
mayor raymond flynn opposes the referendum because it would 
segregate the community said his press secretary arthur jones 
and if the measure were approved it would have to be signed by 
gov michael s dukakis who also is against it 
the proposed city of about 125000 people would include a 
12squaremile area made up of all of roxbury and parts of the 
dorchester mattapan and jamaica plain sections of the city boston 
covers 427 square miles and has 570000 residents 
supporters argue the areas have long been neglected and would 
fare better with control of their own tax dollars 
the secession drive stemmed from a feeling that city leaders had 
run out of options for improving municipal services such as police 
and garbage collection said andrew p jones a violinist and 
independent television producer he was a cofounder of the greater 
roxbury incorporation project that got the secession movement 
started 
right now hardly any of the teachers send their kids to our 
schools he said most of the police live outside the 
community if the police live in the community then theyre 
protecting their home if they just work in the community then 
theyre protecting their job 
jones says his support of the proposal is to blame for an 
attempt to evict him from his apartment the owners of the building 
insist the matter has nothing to do with politics 
the secession proposal will be voted on in 10 state 
representative districts covering all of proposed mandela and some 
fringe areas that include white residents 
rushing said he expects white residents who vote for the measure 
would do so for improved municipal services not to promote 
segregation 
if the nonbinding referendum passes rushing said he would 
introduce secession legislation which would eventually lead to a 
citywide vote 
the campaign has sparked charges of reverse racism and 
segregationism but rushing said eyebrows would not be raised if 
white neighborhoods were trying to secede 
choosing the name of mandela gave some a false impression that 
the campaign had a militant character rushing said in fact he 
said the incorporation campaign is merely a way to control and 
improve municipal services 
it is a symptom of racism in this country that you always 
expect black people to somehow want to be with white people 
rushing said thats what i call paternalistic 
this is not utopian if this happens all the problems are not 
going to be solved the question here though is will things get 
better if you have more direct control

president reagan on tuesday reassured prince 
norodom sihanouk that the united states supports the former 
cambodian rulers quest to win a negotiated political settlement in 
the wartorn country a white house spokesman said 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president reiterated 
american policy favoring a complete withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
and opposing a return to power of the khmer rouge the communist 
group that ruled cambodia during the mass killings and forced 
relocations of the 1970s the khmer rouge were overthrown by the 
vietnamese in 1978 and replaced with a regime installed by hanoi 
describing a meeting that reagan and sihanouk had in the oval 
office the spokesman said the president told the prince that the 
united states is prepared to join an international conference to 
ratify any solution worked out by the parties and further that we 
believe an international presence in camobodia is needed 
reagan met briefly with sihanouk who heads the national party 
sihanouk an anticommunist faction now loosely aligned with the 
khmer rouge against vietnamese occupation forces 
sihanouk will hold talks with state department officials before 
traveling to new york later in the week for discussions with 
diplomats at the united nations 
answering reporters questions after meeting with reagan 
sihanouk said he seeks a moderate leadership of the khmer rouge and 
would support any move to exile pol pot and other leading khmer 
rouge figures to china 
the new york times reported tuesday that many asian officials 
see exile in china for khmer rouge leaders as a key element in any 
political settlement for cambodia 
but sihanouk said that in his recent trip to peking i did not 
get from china any indication that china would like to accept a pol 
pot in exile 
sihanouk speaking in english also said i think the ones who 
are responsible for the genocide of the cambodian people in the 
1970s must not continue to lead the khmer rouge movement and they 
must go into exile if possible 
fitzwater said reagan and sihanouk talked about a peacekeeping 
force a un force of some kind i think we would want to reserve 
some flexibility in how that would be defined 
he also said that reagan strongly supports increased aid to 
the noncommunist resistance and we are consulting with congress to 
bring that about 
the united states provided 35 million in aid to cambodia last 
year and plans to increase that to as much as 5 million this year 
although this figure may fluctuate he said fitzwater said 
reagan and sihanouk did not discuss new aid figures 
sihanouk said he is not optimistic about the prospects for 
peace talks he is scheduled to have in paris in early november with 
hun sen the hanoiinstalled prime minister of cambodia 
there are still obstacles and difficulties on the road towards 
solution because of vietnam itself because of the puppet regime 
in pnom penh he said they continue to refuse to give a 
precise timetable concerning the withdrawal from cambodia of the 
vietnamese troops 
the vietnamese announced months ago that they planned to pull as 
many as 50000 of their more than 120000 troops out of cambodia by 
the end of this year but there have been reports that the pace of 
the pullout has stalled as some vietnamese have remained behind to 
keep the khmer rouge from capturing abandoned territory 
sihanouk also said he has asked french president francois 
mitterand to organize an international peace conference on cambodia 
in paris he said such a conference should include the soviet 
union vietnam china and the united states

when jose canseco steps up to home plate 
during the world series the hopes of more than baseball fans will 
be riding on his performance 
civic leaders investors and residents hope the world series 
will do what years of community effort and millions of dollars have 
so far failed to do make this other citybythebay a major 
league town 
plagued by drug problems high crime and an economy that stalled 
somewhere after world war ii oakland has hovered in the shadow of 
big neighbor san francisco 
the citys image is so bad it almost makes you feel bad to say 
you live in oakland said phyllis bonner a resident of the acorn 
housing project a complex plagued by drugrelated crime 
the citys chance may finally have arrived now that the oakland 
as have earned a spot in the world series 
its exciting everybodys talking about it said elva 
manuel another resident of the acorn project she hopes the series 
will improve the citys image it cant get any worse she said 
now that the city is to be host to baseball fans and television 
cameras the oakland chamber of commerce is hanging banners 
wrapping hospitality baskets in green and gold and painting 
billboards touting the city 
weve had our problems with drugs and crime theres no 
question said acting chamber president connie shapiro but 
theres been a real turnaround 
among oaklands blessings are a worldclass port and a climate 
thats the envy of fogenshrouded san franciscans who routinely 
endure consecutive summer days with barely a glimpse of the sun 
more than 356000 people live in oakland about 10 miles 
southeast of san francisco although the oakland as draw fans from 
all over the bay area 
theres an excitement created by the oakland as thats picked 
up by many many people of all ages and all economic levels 
of the city mayor lionel wilson said it really wasnt there 
until the last couple of years you can see it you can feel it 
the bestofseven world series opens saturday in either new york 
city or los angeles depending on the outcome of the national 
league playoffs and comes to oakland on tuesday 
officials expect the world series to generate at least 5 
million for the city each of up to three days the teams face off in 
oakland in addition to an estimated 7 million for the oakland 
coliseum 
ed church director of program development for a communitybased 
advocacy and planning organization called the urban strategies 
council hopes the series will provide a psychological boost 
if people talk about oakland derisively people pick up on 
that he said when people come here from around the country 
theyre amazed they find its a beautiful beautiful place 
indeed oakland has had serious problems 
infant mortality rates down dramatically from a decade ago 
still remain well above the national average druglinked killings 
were up 83 percent in 1987 from the year before in 1986 oakland 
had the nations 10thhighest homicide rate 
wilsons efforts to revitalize downtown met with moderate 
success the hyatt regency built a hotel downtown five years ago 
but it didnt turn a profit until last year 
the oakland symphony canceled its season not long ago the zoo 
was nearly closed for lack of funds the oakland museum has 
suffered budget cuts 
some say the city hasnt been the same since it lost the oakland 
raiders to los angeles in a 1982 national football league transfer 
but an upscale shopping hub is on the drawing boards for 
downtown bigname retailers such as nordstrom neimanmarcus and 
possibly saks fifth avenue have expressed interest said chamber 
president shapiro 
harry edwards a sociology professor at the university of 
california at berkeley who pioneered the field of sports sociology 
doubts that the series alone will turn around oaklands image 
business will benefit he said but for the rest of oakland the 
series will be at best a nice entertainment spectacle 
its like christmas he said it depends on how low down 
in the slime you are at some point it could be a very depressing 
thing 
and history may offer a lesson for those who pin their dreams of 
oaklands renaissance on the world series the oakland as were the 
world champions for three years starting in 1972

a bureau of land management ground search in 
central nevada has found 180 more slaughtered wild horses to bring 
the total of mustangs believed shot to death up to 450 blm 
officials said tuesday 
every time we go out there we seem to find more blm 
spokesman bob stewart said the carnage that occurred out there 
was terrible almost unbelievable 
the carcasses have been found in wild horse management areas on 
unfenced federal land killing them is a violation of the wild and 
free roaming horse and burro act of 1971 a misdemeanor with a 
penalty of up to a 2000 fine and one year in jail for each dead 
animal 
stewart said he would not be surprised if more carcasses were 
found before the investigation is complete 
he refused to say if the blm had any suspects or strong leads 
one possible motive is that in some areas the horses consume scarce 
water and grass in areas that also are leased for cattle grazing 
maxine shane another blm public affairs officer said federal 
authorities in washington have promised us the full resources of 
the blm to solve this case 
were not at liberty to say how many people are working on the 
case she added 
discovery of the mass horse killings began last month with the 
sighting from a helicopter of 41 carcasses in the austin area 
since then the discoveries have spread over 102000 acres 
mostly in lander county stewart said the investigation has been 
difficult because the shootings were spread over such a vast area 
last week blm officials spotted 140 carcasses near bald 
mountain during a aerial search bringing the total found to 268 
the ground search in the same area during this weekend turned up 
the additional carcasses for a total of 450 
you just cant see as many from the air it takes a trained 
eye stewart said so every time we spot them in a plane we 
know therell be more on the ground than we can count 
ms shane said the killings apparently began about two years 
ago although some of the horses were shot late this spring or 
early this summer 
investigators believe the slaughters in the bald mountain and 
mount callaghan areas are related ms shane said but killings in 
the mount moses area near the pershinglander county border are 
being handled as a separate case she said 
there are an estimated 28000 wild horses in nevada 
rewards as high as 12000 have been pledged by animal rights 
groups for information leading to the arrest and conviction of 
those responsible

the senate putting the finishing touches on a 
27 billion tax bill that would dole out special benefits to 
selected individuals and businesses refused today to boost a 
special tax benefit for lowincome working families 
on an 852 vote the senate defeated an amendment by sen bill 
bradley dnj that would have raised the maximum earnedincome 
credit for families from 875 to 978 a year bradley would have 
financed the increase by deleting from the bill several provisions 
that would have helped corporations and some individuals 
this is not the time to do it sen max baucus dmont who 
is managing the bill told bradley baucus said the amendment would 
have jeopardized passage of the bill 
only sen christopher dodd dconn voted with bradley 
the legislation which includes a bill of rights for 
taxpayers tangling with the internal revenue service is one of two 
items standing in the way of final adjournment of the 100th 
congress leaders of the house and senate hope to finish the tax 
bill and approve a battle plan against drug abuse before quitting 
by weekend 
before a final vote on the tax bill the senate faced two dozen 
amendments that would add new provisions or remove others that the 
finance committee wrote into the voluminous measure whatever 
version finally is approved by the senate must be reconciled with a 
larger one approved by the house and then could face a veto by 
president reagan 
one of the thorniest amendments to be considered by the senate 
written by sen ted stevens ralaska would allow corporations set 
up by alaska natives to keep a special but costly tax benefit that 
the bill otherwise would repeal opponents say the benefit has been 
abused 
other amendments would expand the earnedincome credit which 
benefits lowincome working families with children eliminate a 
provision calling for a treasury department study of how the 
cigarette tax affects the number of smokers and impose sanctions 
against iraq for using poison gas against its kurdish minority 
like any tax bill this one is used by senators to promote 
favorite projects in a long day of debate on friday for example 
senators sought to add provisions dealing with abortion equal pay 
for jobs of comparable worth a bigger tax break for some commuters 
and a requirement that television programs provided to cable 
systems also be made available to owners of home satellite dishes 
the senate added one big unrelated amendment that could result 
in a veto of the entire bill that would require the federal 
government to seize 540 acres of land that was the site of the 
second battle of manassas in northern virginia in order to block 
construction of a shopping mall at the site 
the house has approved the same provision but not as part of the 
tax bill the reagan administration wants to protect only 80 acres 
of the site 
congress began work on the bill in the summer of 1986 
immediately after it passed the landmark overhaul of the tax law 
its main purpose is to correct errors and clear up ambiguities in 
that new law 
but because the technical corrections measure is the only 
tax bill with a chance of becoming law this year the finance 
committee attached to it dozens of amendments and the assorted tax 
increases to pay for them 
the amendments include a taxpayers bill of rights which 
among other things requires the irs to inform an individual of all 
rights and obligations any time he or she is questioned or the 
subject of collections arises 
the bill would extend a handful of expiring tax benefits 
including those that go to workers with employerpaid legal or 
educational assistance firsttime homebuyers and corporations that 
increase spending for research 
it would exempt farmers from paying tax on offroad diesel fuel 
allow immediate writeoffs of certain expenses associated with 
livestock and permit delays in paying tax on any livestock that was 
sold this year because of the drought 
under the bill freelance writers and artists could deduct 
certain expenses before their works produce income and families 
could avoid tax on interest earned on us savings bonds that are 
redeemed to pay for higher education

philippine and us officials have 
tentatively agreed that washington will pay more than 550 million 
annual compensation to use its military bases in the phillipines 
official sources said tuesday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said an accord 
on terms to cover the us lease through 1991 is expected within a 
week 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
there was no agreement assistant secretary of state gaston sigur 
and philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus discussed the 
subject there tuesday 
the philippine sources said negotiators agreed on a basic annual 
package of 550 million to 580 million in economic support 
military aid and commodities mostly wheat for the united states 
continued use of the six bases through 1991 
us and filipino panels began reviewing the 1947 agreement on 
the base leases in april but talks stalled over compensation and 
other issues 
the united states has been paying about 180 million a year 
under the current agreement but filipino officials reportedly want 
that increased to 12 billion for the last two years of the lease 
the facilities include clark air base and subic bay naval base and 
comprise the largest us garrison in southeast asia 
any extension on the lease past 1991 must be approved by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to the us 
presence is strong mrs aquino who holds office until 1992 has 
refused to say where she stands on the issue 
opponents of the bases say they infringe on philippine 
sovereignty and pose dangers to the country in the event of 
superpower conflicts 
sources close to the talks said the filipino negotiators in 
washington were bargaining for an additional loan of 100 million 
to purchase us treasury bonds which would be used to help pay 
the philippines 28 billion foreign debt 
teodoro benigno the spokesman for president corazon aquino 
told reporters the size of the compensation package had not yet 
been agreed upon he said the 550 million figure was a hard cash 
component and officials were still discussing creative 
portions meaning the debt relief part 
in congress rep renato unico told reporters that us 
ambassador nicholas platt who heads the american negotiating 
panel met him and another proadministration congressman at lunch 
tuesday 
he quoted platt as saying that the americans were offering 481 
million a year through 1991 and that us officials believe most 
filipinos will opt for the retention of the bases when the lease 
expires 
it was not clear if the figure platt mentioned was offered 
before manglapus went to washington

to his supporters serbian communist 
party chief slobodan milosevic is the second tito the new 
leader yugoslavia needs to extricate the country from its worst 
crisis since world war ii 
to his detractors milosevic is a serbian nationalist who 
threatens the delicate unity of his ethnically diverse nation and 
wants to expand the power of serbs at the expense of other ethnic 
groups 
milosevic has ridden to national prominence in recent months on 
a wave of mass rallies by slavs enraged by the alleged harassment 
of the serb and montenegrin minority in kosovo a backward southern 
serbian province now dominated by ethnic albanians 
the 47yearold serbian leader has won the hearts of the crowds 
who adoringly wave his portrait with a combination of tough 
politicking and rousing oratory 
by pushing for greater control over serbias two autonomous 
provinces of vojvodina and kosovo milosevic has struck a chord 
with many of yugoslavias 8 million serbs who have a strong 
attachment to kosovo because it was the heart of their medieval 
empire 
but he has automatically antagonized other ethnic groups fearful 
of serbian nationalism and may be toppled by communist leaders from 
other republics if they feel he is pushing too hard 
milosevics chief opponents the communists in yugoslavias 
most prosperous republics of slovenia and croatia may force a 
showdown as early as next week when the party holds a key meeting 
of its central committee 
there milosevic is expected to come under fire for failing to 
stop the nationalist rallies and allowing them to turn into 
antigovernment protests as they did in the southern republic of 
montenegro last weekend 
if milosevic is ousted however the other republics could face 
even worse unrest from the serbs who see him as a hero 
some of yugoslavias top leaders got a taste of milosevics hold 
over serbs last week when angry workers from the belgrade 
industrial suburb of rakovica marched on the federal parliament 
demanding wage hikes to feed their families 
belgrade journalists at the scene said leaders such as vice 
premier milos milosavljevic and dusan popovski president of 
parliament hesitated before addressing the crowd and were 
instantly booed by workers shouting milosevics name 
displaying a populist touch that has helped him rise throughout 
his political career milosevic drove up in his own yugo and calmly 
told the workers to leave 
they were hypnotized by him recalled a journalist who saw 
the scene 
born aug 20 1941 in the southern serbian town of pozarevac 
milosevic studied social sciences in belgrade before going into 
industry 
his political career began in earnest only in 1982 when he quit 
his job as president of the boar at a belgrade bank to sit on the 
presidium or top party body in belgrade the federal and serbian 
capital 
in 1984 he gained a seat on the party presidium in serbia 
vaulting into the top party seat last year after making his mark at 
a demonstration in kosovo where he prevented police from beating a 
crowd of slav protesters 
to get the top spot in serbia milosevic forced out a man who 
had been his political patron petar stambolic 
milosevic succeeded by skillful use of the serbian media to 
portray himself as a firm leader attacking fellow communists 
dithering about how to handle the economic and political crisis 
since last fall belgrade journalists say milosevic has moved 
to bring key serbian newspapers and the television and radio under 
his sway the communist party daily politika is full of emotional 
writing on kosovo in almost every issue 
detractors particularly in liberal slovenia often portray 
milosevic as a hardliner who wants to impose firmer oneparty rule 
in a country where the communists have lost much of their authority 
in an economic crisis that has sent inflation spiraling over 200 
percent 
however the serbian party chief has taken on board many 
liberalizing economic reforms outlined in the memorandum a 
document prepared by serbian intellectuals in 1986 and officially 
denounced by the communists at that time 
an english speaker milosevic is married with a son and a 
daughter

diplomats left weekend talks still 
laboring to agree on a timetable for withdrawing cuban troops from 
angola according to cuban and angolan envoys involved in the 
negotiations 
deputy foreign minister ricardo alarcon de quesada of cuba and 
angolan un ambassador manuel pedro pacavira told reporters monday 
that negotiators reached no breakthrough in new york on a timetable 
for pulling out 50000 cuban troops 
at this meeting there was no agreement whatsoever alarcon 
said 
earlier news reports quoted us officials as saying cuba 
angola south africa and the united states had agreed to a 
withdrawal of cuban forces within 24 to 30 months 
however a us official in washington told the associated press 
on monday the sides had only substantially narrowed 
disagreements on a timetable 
while no final deal was struck in new york cuban officials 
suggested they were willing to step up the pace of withdrawal from 
the 2000 soldiers a month they had proposed said us officials 
in washington speaking on condition of anonymity 
in new york pacavira said negotiators were still split over 
proposals for a 24month or a 30month timetable 
up to now at the negotiating table there is a proposal from 
the mediator the united states that was accepted by the south 
african delegation for 24 months said pacavira 
however he said the angolancuban delegation considers the 
proposal only a basis for discussion because our proposal is 30 
months and we consider that the last limit of our concessions 
he said the conflicting proposals were advanced a month ago in a 
meeting in brazzaville congo all three previous rounds of talks 
have been mediated by chester crocker us secretary of state for 
african affairs 
south africa has linked its scheduled nov 1 implementation of a 
oneyear independence plan for neighboring southwest africa also 
known as namibia to the cuban troop withdrawal pretoria which 
withdrew its troops from angola earlier this year says the cubans 
threaten the independence of the territory which borders angola 
diplomats involved in the talks had said they were working

the supreme court agreed tuesday to decide 
whether police violate a suspects rights when they fail to recite 
the precise words familiar to every fan of tv cop shows the

the justices said they will hear an appeal by indiana officials 
seeking to reinstate a conviction for attempted murder a lower 
court said the suspects rights were violated when police strayed 
from the exact wording of the miranda warnings 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide in a case from florida whether states may bar 
publication or broadcast of a rape victims name reporters get from 
law enforcement officials 
agreed to decide whether us courts have authority over damage 
suits against owners of the italian cruise ship achille lauro the 
suits stem from a 1985 hijacking in which american passenger leon 
klinghoffer was killed 
rejected industry challenges to federal environmental rules 
governing the use of high smokestacks to disperse air pollutants 
refused to kill a lawsuit charging boeing company with illegal 
age discrimination because it bars its pilots from active flight

rejected an appeal by former major league pitcher art ditmar 
who said his reputation suffered from a beer commercial that 
mistakenly identified him as the man who gave up a decisive world 
series homer 
in the miranda warnings case the court will hear arguments by 
indiana officials that there should not be overly simplistic 
reliance upon the use of magic words to inform a defendant of his 
rights 
the case involves gary eagan who was sentenced to 35 years in 
prison for attempted murder 
eagan telephoned chicago police on may 16 1982 and told them he 
found a dead naked woman along the shore of lake michigan in 
indiana 
when he led police there the woman was still alive and upon 
seeing eagan exclaimed why did you stab me 
she later testified she was was picked up by eagan and some 
companions in south chicago was taken to the beach and had sexual 
relations with several of the men when she refused eagan she said 
he stabbed her 
chicago police had turned over the case to police in hammond 
ind at the station house there eagan signed a police form that 
included this paragraph 
you have this right to the advice and presence of a lawyer 
even if you cannot afford to hire one we have no way of giving you 
a lawyer but one will be appointed for you if you wish if and 
when you go to court 
eagan subsequently confessed to attempted murder but the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals ruled that the wording of the police 
form was ambiguous and misleading and violated the rights protected 
by the supreme courts 1966 miranda ruling 
the miranda warnings usually carried on a walletsize card by 
police officers advises people under arrest that they have the 
right to remain silent and that anything they say can be used 
against them in court 
the suspect also is told you have the right to the presence 
of an attorney to assist you prior to questioning and to be with 
you during questioning if you so desire if you cannot afford an 
attorney you have the right to have an attorney appointed for you 
prior to questioning 
the indiana attorney generals office said surely miranda is 
not a ritual of words to be recited by rote according to didactic 
niceties what miranda does require is meaningful advice to the 
unlettered and unlearned in language which he can comprehend and on 
which he can knowingly act 
in other action the court 
agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of south 
carolina murderer demetrius gathers convicted of a 1986 killing in 
charleston 
said it will consider reducing the award of more than 4 
million in legal fees to lawyers who won a kansas city school

vice president george bush had only a minor 
role in the irancontra affair but the iranians were convinced he 
was the mastermind behind the weapons deal a former government 
consultant says in a new book 
so far as i can tell and so far as the available documents 
show bush was not a major participant in the irancontra affair 
and efforts to drag him into it in some way or other seem to be 
forced michael a ledeen a former consultant to the national 
security council writes in perilous statecraft an insiders 
account of the irancontra affair 
bush was a loyal vice president supporting president 
reagans policy ledeen writes 
but the book says that the iranians had a different view of bush 
and even had a codename for the vice president battri that 
derived from the bestselling automobile battery in iran called 
the busch 
ledeen writes that the iranians thought bush was the most 
powerful man in the world hence the man pulling the strings on the 
iran initiative 
the iranians view stemmed from the fact that bush had once 
headed the cia which the tehran regime considered the root of 
ultimate power in the united states 
bushs resignation from the cia in the mid1970s was simply a 
cover story the iranians thought 
ledeen knew about the beginnings of the irancontra affair 
because he was involved in the earliest efforts to learn more about 
the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime 
us intelligence agencies had huge gaps in their knowledge 
about the fundamentalist khomeini regime so in may 1985 ledeen 
suggested approaching the israelis who were known to have contacts 
in iran former nsc adviser robert mcfarlane agreed with that move 
the meeting with israeli foreign minister shimon peres 
ultimately led to the us decision to ship weapons to iran through 
israel the americans hoped the sale would lead to the release of 
us hostages held by proiranian shiites in lebanon 
by november 1986 when the irancontra affair was exposed only 
three american hostages had been freed while millions of dollars in 
profits were secretly diverted to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
among ledeens observations 
any deals with the hostages required khomeinis direct 
involvement that was because th fight between those who 
favored hostage release and those who opposed it was so intense 
that only the ayatollah could decide 
former cia director william casey ordered the cia to go all out 
to try to find william buckley the cia station chief in beirut 
after buckley was captured in march 1984 by proiranian terrorists 
buckley later died in captivity reportedly after being tortured 
casey informed the president of the situation at regular 
intervals thereby reinforcing reagans strong passions about the 
lebanon hostages casey felt responsible for buckleys fate 
because he had urged the reluctant cia man to take the job ledeen 
said 
casey never approved of the secret irancontra operation 
masterminded by oliver l north a former nsc aide according to 
milton gould caseys longtime friend and lawyer quoted in the 
book 
casey suffered a cerebral seizure in late 1986 shortly after 
the irancontra affair was made public and died from brain cancer 
in may 1987 
mcfarlane was in a psychological crisis in the second half of 
1985 more than a year before he tried to commit suicide by taking 
a pill overdose 
it was clear that mcfarlane was no longer functioning 
effectively ledeen writes the nsc adviser resigned in november 
1985 but within hours he was seized with remorse and wished he 
had remained to fight to the end 
ledeen denied allegations floated by an israeli amiram nir 
that he may have had a personal financial stake in shipping weapons 
to iran 
nir an israeli official who served as a liaison between his 
government and the united states raised that possibility with 
north 
it was all nonsense ledeen wrote i never received a 
penny aside from salary and reimbursement of expenses as a result 
of my work on this project

babe ruth drank here between innings bill veeck 
threw his wooden leg across a stool and rhapsodized here for hours 
and future baseball legends it now appears will get a chance to 
become part of the lore at mccuddys saloon 
the tavern is one of 11 businesses scheduled for demolition as 
the state clears the area around ancient comiskey park for a new 
stadium for chicagos white sox by 1991 
but gov james r thompson has promised that mccuddys with a 
little help from the state will rise from those ashes like a 
phoenix in the same spot it has occupied for 78 years directly 
across the street from comiskey park 
im ecstatic pat senese the bars 65yearold owner said 
monday my wife is the third generation of the mccuddy family to 
have a stake in this and now we know itll go on beyond that 
itll be sad to see the building come down and besides well 
be closed for two years during stadium construction senese said 
but they tell me its sitting where the thirdbase line of the 
new one stadium will be 
and opening again in two years is better than not opening at 
all 
the interior of mccuddys will be all that survives the move 
thompson said he wanted to save the exterior but noted there is no 
way to build the new stadium and parking lots and still accommodate 
mccuddys during the twoyear construction 
itll have the same feel even if the exterior is new and even 
if were sitting on stateleased land said senese who sold his 
old parcel of land the bar an adjoining home and two lots to 
the state for about 235000 
well be across from the park and well put a few cracks in 
the floor and walls if we have to 
mccuddys has been a chicago institution since john j mccuddy 
got a tip from a rich and powerful friend named charles comiskey 
known as the old roman comiskey owned chicagos american 
league franchise at the turn of the century and long harbored 
dreams of one day moving from the old wooden ballyard at 39th 
street that was the clubs home 
john j mccuddy was one of the few people comiskey let in on the 
dream and mccuddys opened its doors in time to serve the 
construction workers who built comiskey park dubbed the 
baseball palace of the world when it opened july 1 1910 
weve been open for every home game ever since said senese 
in fact thats the only time we are open they have rock 
concerts here soccer games whatever our doors are shut 
this is a baseball joint always has been always will be 
so much so that ruth legend has it came across the street 
between innings of yankeeswhite sox contests during the mid1920s 
and tipped a few beers before making his way tipsy sometimes back 
to right field 
the babes visits to mccuddys would have come right in the 
middle of the prohibition era which began in 1920 and lasted until 
1933 when elizabeth toots mccuddy headed the family and ran 
the tavern 
but that didnt mean babe would have had a problem getting a 
beer said pudi mccuddy seneses wife and elizabeth mccuddys 
daughter 
i know mccuddys used to serve what they called near beer a 
legal weaker version of beer in those days said mccuddy who 
still has the photograph depicting ruth holding her when she was a 
young girl 
but its also possible the real stuff was available for 
special customers as well knowing toots that would be my guess 
unfortunately the only person who would know for sure is my 
aunt frances she added and she died two years ago 
he was the only guy ever allowed into the place wearing 
spikes said senese he ate everything he could eat and drink 
in about three minutes is how my wife tells it of course she was 
a little girl then so were relying on secondhand information 
yet the day after the white sox final home contest this season 
originally thought to be mccuddys last stand ruths daughter 
called up senese and said she wanted to see the place so lovingly 
described by the babe 
people get emotional about this place bil veeck when he 
owned the club always found time to come in for a beer and hed 
end up sitting for hours always had time and a few good stories 
for the fans senese said 
in fact weve had women bring their infants in and fill up a 
thimble with beer just so they can say that the little one had 
his first one at mccuddys

egyptians had their first taste of japanese 
kabuki theater at the grand opening of cairos new opera house but 
the some who saw the musicanddance drama found it puzzling and 
even funny 
as solemnfaced japanese actors in elaborate costume and makeup 
told with mournful music and sobbing voices a tragic story of 
prisoners exiled on an island many in monday nights audience were 
cracking up with laughter 
the haunting wail of the background music and songs in the 
hourlong performance was too close to egyptian wails of mourning 
the stiff measured movements of the actors were alien to egyptians 
nurtured on freewheeling gesticulating emotion in their drama 
president hosni mubarak sat solemnfaced in the presidential box 
during the performance and applauded politely at the end his face 
became animated however and he tapped his fingers when the 
orchestra and chorus struck up a song by egyptian composer mohamed 
abdelwahab after the kabuki performance 
the 50member kabuki troupes performance the first in the 
middle east was the first part of the gala inauguration ceremony 
for the 50 million neoislamic cairo education and culture center 
the new opera house 
kabuki was included on the program as a tribute to japan which 
financed and built the sprawling cultural complex 
several egyptians in the plush rosecolored main auditorium 
watched the actors with seeming interest many others either sat in 
bored resignation or had difficulty hiding their laughter 
farid shawky a wellknown actor in the egyptian cinema left 
the hall during the performance apparently unable to contain his 
mirth 
during the intermission several dignitaries were overheard 
saying they found kabuki a bit hard to take one said that perhaps 
the art which dates from the 16th century is an acquired taste 
the troupe was to give three more performances through wednesday 
although attendance at the inaugural performance was by 
invitation only the whole inaugural was broadcast live on 
television and radio 
i am not narrowminded i appreciate western classical music 
and music from other cultures but i just find no rhythm in the 
wailing that accompanies kabuki said amina eissa who watched on 
television 
it was just too different from our music and acting said 
heba kamel a teacher and another viewer even after the 
announcer explained the story before the show i found it difficult 
to absorb and it was all so tragic 
two of the governments three channels broadcast the drama the 
third which normally features a heavy diet of egyptian soap 
operas was off the air 
we like the japanese people and it was very nice of them to 
give us the opera house but i didnt like their kabuki said 
mohamed said a garage attendant then again i dont think they 
would appreciate our music and theater either 
mustafa hussein cartoonist for the daily newspaper alakhbar 
depicted on the newspapers back page tuesday the reaction of many 
egyptians his cartoon showed a lawyer in court with a 
terrifiedlooking young woman sitting in the background the 
lawyer waving papers tells the judge 
i demand a divorce for my client on ground of cruelty these 
are medical certificates showing that she had a nervous breakdown 
because her husband stood at the bottom of the stairs and performed 
kabuki in front of her

a salvadoran leftist leader said tuesday his 
countrys guerrilla insurgency would support a political settlement 
that guaranteed the continued existence of private industry and a 
representative democratic system 
ruben zamora a member of the revolutionary democratic front 
told reporters the experience of the sandinista government in 
nicaragua illustrates the dangers of a program of radical reform 
and has has a moderating effect on the salvadoran left 
we have learned a lot from the nicaraguan experience zamora 
said alluding to the support the united states has provided to the 
contra rebels 
the us government has the capacity not to defeat a 
government like the sandinistas but has the capacity to ruin 
whatever social and economic programs a revolutionary government 
has in mind he said 
zamoras group has been allied with the fmln insurgency since 
the early 1980s under president jose napoleon duarte el salvador 
has been a major recipient of us assistance because of concern 
that a rebel victory would lead to the establishment of another 
soviet foothold in the hemisphere 
the reagan administration maintains that the rebels receive 
material and other support from cuba and nicaragua 
more than 60000 salvadorans have died since the civil war there 
erupted in 1980 zamora said a new political dynamic now exists 
in el salvador in support of a negotiated settlement 
agreements in three basic areas are essential for the fighting 
to stop he said the first involves agreement on a ceasefire and 
the disposition of the two armies now at war the regular army 
and the guerrilla army 
the second zamora said would lay down the rules that guarantee 
a pluralistc system and respect for civil liberties and human 
rights finally he said there would be guarantees for private 
enterprise so long as the business community pays taxes and free 
for trade unions to organize 
zamoras group whose initials in spanish are fdr boycotted the 
1984 national elections but is participating in balloting set for 
next march when a successor to duarte will be chosen the ticket 
is headed by guillermo ungo a onetime ally of duarte 
zamora said the fmln rebels have adopted a neutral position 
toward fdr participation in the elections a prime purpose of the 
fdr candidates is to rally public support for negotiations to 
achieve a political settlement to the civil war he said 
he added that the fdr will take part in the elections so long as 
its candidates are assured freedom of movement including security 
for its nominees access to the mass media and fair treatment from 
salvadoran civilian and military authorities

the energy department has admitted hundreds of 
eastern bloc and other foreign visitors into its nuclear weapons 
labs without required security checks a senate hearing was told 
tuesday 
the visitors included suspected foreign agents and people from 
overseas facilities believed to be trying to build nuclear weapons 
according to keith fultz of the congressional general accounting 
office 
fultz who did not identify any of these people told 
governmental affairs committee chairman john glenn dohio that 
gao does not believe the three highlevel research labs are fully 
protected against espionage 
the visitors mainly scientists came from a variety of 
communist bloc nations headed by the soviet union and china and 
nuclearsensitive nations like israel india south africa 
pakistan iran and iraq he said 
we could not determine if sensitive or classified information 
has been lost but because of weaknesses in does foreign 
visitor controls we have little confidence that adequate 
protection of weaponsrelated information and technology is 
achieved fultz said 
he said that even if no supersecret data were available the 
situation threatens us interests 
doe studies have concluded that unclassified information at 
the laboratories may provide foreign countries details on sensitive 
and even classified activities that the united states 
conducts fultz said 
richard du val a deputy assistant energy secretary said 
officials began tightening security a year ago but he could not 
assure chairman glenn that no foreign visitor was getting into the 
labs now without proper screening 
fultz detailed the results of a gao study of foreigners who 
between january 1986 and september 1987 visited los alamos and 
sandia labs in new mexico and californias lawrence livermore lab 
which is doing work on the strategic defense initiative sometimes 
called the star wars program 
energy department security procedures require a background check 
in most cases before a lab admits someone from a communist or 
nuclearsensitive nation 
fultz said a review of the files on 181 communistbloc visitors 
showed that 176 should have been checked out with the fbi and 
intelligence agencies no checks were done for 119 and only 7 
checks were completed before a visit began 
doe obtained even less background information on visitors from 
other sensitive countries said fultz 637 visitors 77 
background checks only 14 completed before the visitor arrived 
he said that no checks were done on the approximately 10 percent 
of the these visitors who are affiliated with organizations on the 
departments watch list because of suspected nuclear weapons 
activities 
fultz quoted department officials as saying that only one of the 
818 visits broached a sensitive topic we found at least 37 
others related to inertial confinement fusion and isotope 
separation which are identified as sensitive by doe 
energy officials say their basic line of defense is security 
plans tailored to specific visitors and setting parameters for what 
can be discussed and what areas of a lab can be visited 
fultz said the labs prepared such plans in only 89 of the 248 
visits that fell under this requirement 
he said that there are problems even when the department knows 
about visitors in advance 
the energy field office in san francisco tried to limit a soviet 
officials visit to livermore to public access areas but lab 
officials allowed the official to spend a significant part of 
this visit in classified areas according to fultz 
and in a recent case the department officials in washington 
denied two israelis access to an unidentified lab one of them got 
a lab employee to tap into the labs unclassified computer from a 
terminal in the employees garage according to du val 
im not aware of any other cases like this but i wouldnt bet 
on it du val said its no longer a matter of whether the 
visitors are inside the fence

protesters stayed off the streets 
tuesday after a week of violence that killed more than 400 people 
but the young men who led the revolt against economic hardship 
remained angry and impatient 
tanks and soldiers guarded areas most affected by the riots 
including babeloued belcourt and ruisseau helicopter gunships 
chuffed overhead 
shops were halfopen with metal curtains ready to slam down at 
any sign of trouble and people bought large quantities of staple 
foods that had suddenly become available 
truck convoys brought flour butter semolina and cooking oil 
into algiers during the night and government stores sold the food 
to all comers at subsidized prices butter that was available only 
on the black market last week at 430 a pound could be had for 
175 
a communique from the presidents office announced that the 
state of emergency proclaimed oct 6 would be lifted shortly 
after dawn wednesday 
government officials said the first official casualty toll 
showed 176 people had died as of sunday night but they 
acknowledged that was lower than the actual number of dead 
reports from hospital medical and police sources indicate at 
least 400 were killed and more than 1000 injured the french news 
agency agence francepresse estimated the number of dead at 500 or 
more the government said the reports were exaggerated 
thirtyfive people including a correspondent for the official 
news agency were reported killed in an outbreak of violence monday 
night shortly before a speech in which president chadli benjedid 
promised sweeping reforms 
diplomatic and family sources said sid ali benmechiche a senior 
editor of algerie presse service was hit by machine gun fire while 
covering the disturbances in babeloued he was buried quietly 
tuesday in the presence of several foreign reporters 
the us government denounced the riots and also said the 
algerian government was cooperating in ensuring safety of americans 
there 
we dont believe violence is the appropriate way to achieve 
political change in any country state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said in washingon and we continue our close 
cooperation with officials from the government of algeria 
displeasure with the presidents television address was 
widespread despite vigorous government efforts to drum up support 
it was his first official comment since riots over over high prices 
and food shortages began last week 
the official news agency newspapers radio and television 
carried many reports of messages supporting benjedid flowing in 
from outlying districts such as enthusiastic support and the 
women declare their backing 
his speech promised farreaching economic and political change 
but contained few specifics to cool the anger 
its all very well to promise changes but we want to know 
what hes doing to get more and cheaper goods on the market and 
quickly said mohamed belaid a university student 
similar views were expressed tuesday wherever groups of young 
men gathered to discuss the situation and the presidents speech 
islamic fundamentalists who tried to take over the revolt at the 
end of last week seemed to be left temporarily without a cause but 
one declared while leaning against a tree outside the main post 
office 
just give us a little time if nothing else happens give us 
at least until prayers next friday then youll see something 
information minister bachir rouis in an interview broadcast by 
monte carlo rado expressed more optimism 
the political reform announced by president chadli will go in 
the direction of a larger democratic participation by all 
algerians it is not excluded that we will see other political 
concepts than the single party system there will certainly be 
amendments to the constitution 
rouis said he was extremely optimistic that the crisis would 
be resolved

us to this point dan mcelderry spokesman for the pulaski

agree on something to find the money for the teachers she said 
they just wont wait and all i can say is how desperately sorry 
i am 
the pulaski school board voted 43 to reopen negotiations if 
money becomes available for raises the board in effect rejected

is tied up in federal litigation the raise sought by the teachers 
would cost about 1 million

some flights should be rerouted to reduce 
congestion and the potential for errors by air traffic controllers 
at chicagos ohare international airport a federal aviation 
administration report says 
the faa also should offer higher pay and other incentives to 
attract experienced controllers to ohare and should improve their 
crowded facilities and old equipment said y 
prepared for the agency 
the congestion in chicagos skies also drew attention tuesday 
from american airlines which asked the faa to limit flights at all 
three of than internal stude citys airports 
the faa report not yet released recommends 80 steps for 
improving operations and safety at ohare the nations busiest 
airport the proposals resulted from a monthlong investigation 
into the large number of flighthandling errors there 
there have been 30 controller errors so far this year in the 
chicago area which includes ohare midway airport and several 
satellite airfields compared with 12 during all of 1987 the 
agency said 
in its report the faa said the combination of flights taking 
off and landing at ohare and traffic from other nearby airports 
may be too much for controllers to handle 
although the practice of crossing flight paths with planes 
separated by altiship nj ap a regulatory board tuesday gave 
unanimous approval to entertainer merv griffins offer to buy 
resorts international inc its casinos and property despite 
lingering questions about whether griffin will complete the deal 
thank you for the unanimous vote griffin told the casino 
control commission after its ruling it was a vote of 
confidence 
the commissions decision came a day after griffins company 
announced it had allowed a deadline for its 36pershare tender 
offer to resorts stockholders to expire the move gave rise to 
speculation that griffin was trying to back out of the deal 
it also drove down the price of resorts stock by 4875 monday 
to 29125 
griffin told reporters after the ruling that the speculation was 
ridiculous but that allowing the deadline to expire was 
designed to allow him to get out of the deal if conditions were not 
favorable 
it gives me the right to continue on and close the deal as 
quickly as i can he said it gives me a chance to leave it if 
all things arent in place 
i want to be able to stay very fluid and to be able to make a 
businessmans decision and to walk if everything is not done 
griffin added 
under the deal griffin would purchase resorts stock including 
that owned by billionaire developer donald trump griffin would 
take control of the resorts international casino hotel resorts 
vast land holdings in atlantic city and a casino and property 
resorts owns in the bahamas 
trump would purchase from resorts its unfinished 1250room taj 
majal casino next door to resorts gaming hall on the boardwalk in 
atlantic city 
griffin is still awaiting approval from the bahamian government 
on his request to purchase resorts property there the commission 
has not yet acted on his request for a permanent casino license 
although it granted him a 90day license tuesday 
his attorney howard goldberg assured the commission that 
griffin wasnt pulling out of the sale 
i hate to paraphrase mark twain he said but the rumors 
about the death of this deal are greatly exaggerated 
goldberg said the refusal to extend the tender offer gives 
griffin flexibility to reconsider the deal if market conditions 
take a downward slide or if griffin fails to get approvals he is 
waiting for 
robert trump executive vice president of the trump organization 
and the brother of donald said he was confused by griffins 
announcement 
we didnt quite understand it he said 
i read and reread the griffin news releases and i dont 
know what they mean said joel sterns an attorney for resorts 
reading from a prepared text griffin said if an acquisition is 
completed it would be done through a merger not a tender offer 
a merger offer was approved aug 30 by the required number of 
shareholders said griffin 
griffin who recently has turned his attention to real estate 
would take the company private by buying out trumps controlling 
stock and all remaining shares 
griffin and trump had engaged in bitter negotiations for control 
of resorts but appeared to have come to terms about their 
differences and worked out the deal now in question 
griffin has offered to pay trump 135 a share or 96 million 
for trumps class b stock trump also would receive another 63 
million from griffin to break trumps management contract with 
resorts 
griffins tender offer for class a stockholders would cost him 
2052 million griffin would also invest 50 million in resorts to 
help it generate enough cash flow to cover interest payments on 
resorts debt 
in turn trump would pay resorts 273 million for the taj mahal

further discussions with the soviet union on a 
new longterm grain agreement have been tentatively scheduled to 
resume in london later this week the white house said tuesday 
no further details were provided in the brief statement by alan 
f holmer deputy trade representative who leads us negotiators 
the meetings are scheduled for thursday and friday he said 
the previous 5year agreement expired on sept 30 despite 
months of negotiations and informal talks by us and soviet 
officials one possibility has been a simple extension of the old 
pact for a year while negotiators work out details of a new 
arrangement 
meanwhile the soviet union has been buying us grain in large 
quantities including an additional 250000 metric tons announced 
tuesday by the agriculture department 
the sale brought total corn sold to the soviets for delivery in 
the 198889 corn marketing year that began on sept 1 to more than 
43 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 250000 tons of 
corn would be about 985 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 273 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 27 million 
according to the old agreement the annual purchases were 
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
prior to the round of sales announced since sept 1 the soviet 
union had purchased 905 million tons of wheat and 517 million 
tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the 
agreement plus 830000 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of 
soybean meal

opponents of a proposed state constitutional 
amendment to make english the states official language went to 
federal court tuesday to try to knock the measure off the november 
ballot 
we are opposed to it said monsignor bryan walsh a 
spokesman for the roman catholic archdiocese of miami on the steps 
of us district court we do not think that we have problems in 
florida which merit such a constitutional amendment 
he said the diocese was supporting the effort to block amendment 
11 
a group called florida english circulated petitions to get the 
amendment on the november ballot if approved the measure would 
require all state business be conducted in english 
opponents and supporters of the measure however disagree over 
what changes would be required under the amendment 
in their suit the opponents argue that the petitions circulated 
throughout the state were only written in english 
florida is a state that is extensively populated by persons 
whose primary language is not english says the suit filed on 
behalf of four us citizens of mexican cuban and puerto rican 
descent 
citing a us district court decision in colorado the suit 
argues that the voting right act of 1965 mandates that the 
petitions be circulated in minority languages in counties where 
more than 5 percent of the residents speak that language 
seven southern florida counties fall in that category because of 
their spanishspeaking population according to the us census 
bureau 
for example in dade county which includes miami 40 percent to 
50 percent of the population speaks spanish as their first language 
supporters of the official english initiative were angered by 
the suit 
its an outrage that people will be deprived of the 
opportunity to vote yes or no on this if the lawsuit 
succeeds said pat fulton spokeswoman for florida english 
state officials never told them they must circulate petitions in 
spanish she said and her group contends the voting rights act 
applies to governments not private organizations 
we will be responding to it on a legal basis she said we 
are also asking people to phone their legislator to complain that 
they are being disenfranchised if such an injuction is granted 
in tallahassee gov bob martinez said he agreed with the 
objectives of the suit 
i think its a known fact to this country we didnt use 
english only to assimilate italianamericans germanamericans or 
anyone else and this nations been doing that for way over a 
century martinez said 
the suit filed against secretary of state jim smith and local 
elections officials was assigned to us district judge james 
kehoe it seeks an injunction preventing the issue from appearing 
on the ballot and preventing the state from counting the votes 
kehoe is out of town until monday and no hearing has been set 
in colorado a federal judge recently took that states 
officialenglish initiative off the ballot because the petitions 
were not circulated in spanish as well as english in colorados 12 
heavily hispanic counties 
that ruling could affect not only other initiatives on this 
years ballot in colorado but laws passed by previous initiatives 
and 36 initiatives pending in 11 states according to steve 
workings of the washingtonbased us english 
fourteen states have adopted official english proposals to date

the attorney for former gov edward j king filed 
a motion for a new trial tuesday in a libel suit against the boston 
globe 
a suffolk superior court jury on sept 29 ruled that while a 
1981 globe column was false it didnt libel king in filing his 
motion robert h goldman asks the court to set aside the judgment 
and schedule a new trial 
the column alleged that king had telephoned the judge in a 
controversial rape case seeking a tougher sentence king and the 
judge both denied the call ever took place 
the jury was asked to answer two questions it agreed that 
former globe columnist david farrell was wrong when he wrote in a 
nov 8 1981 column that king called a judge to demand harsher 
sentences in a gangrape case 
but the jurors said no when asked if they believed the statement 
discredited king king needed to prevail on each question 
in his motion goldman said the court erred in instructing 
the jury that as a matter of law no crime was alleged in the 
statement in issue

seven current and former city police detectives 
were sentenced tuesday to federal prison terms ranging from two to 
five years for soliciting bribes from restaurant and bar owners 
they were convicted sept 13 of federal charges of conspiring to 
extort more than 18000 in return for protecting the 
establishments from inspections overlooking violations or seeking 
to influence liquor cases in court or before the citys licensing 
board 
prosecutors diane kottmyer and james farmer accused the 
detectives of selling their badges for influence while defense 
attorneys maintained that the detectives were only accepting gifts 
from people they worked with closely over several years 
they sold the public trust in return for personal gain 
kottmyer said 
the prosecutors had sought longer sentences but they said they 
were satisfied the message is that police officers just like 
all other citizens are bound by the constraints of the law 
in handing out sentences well below those recommended by 
prosecutors us district judge a david mazzone said its 
difficult not to be impressed by their records 
all seven defendants remain free on their own recognizance 
pending appeals to the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
the officers were indicted last year following an investigation 
of more than six years by the new england organized strike force 
whose last major case was the prosecution of boston mobster gennaro 
angiulo 
the trial lasted more than eight weeks 
two defendants also were convicted of 19 and 18 counts of mail 
fraud in connection with a scheme to extort 15000 for a police 
detail that they never performed 
a group of detectives handed out a press release after the 
sentencing saying they had attended the hearing to demonstrate 
our support for our seven brothers who are the victims of a 
terrible injustice by overzealous prosecutors

a key defendant in the 71 million wells 
fargo robbery admitted tuesday that he agreed before the heist to 
accept the money for the puerto rican independence movement 
the revelation by juan segarra palmer came as he and four 
codefendants went on trial in us district court in hartford 
after more than three years of pretrial proceedings 
the first day of the trial before a packed court room was 
highlighted by surprising disclosures heated exchanges a motion 
for a mistrial and stern lectures by judge t emmet clarie 
the government also called its first witness a former wells 
fargo security guard who was tied up during the sept 12 1983 
robbery at the companys west hartford depot 
the 71 million theft was the secondlargest cash robbery in 
us history the only money ever recovered was the torn halves of 
a 10 bill 
in addition to the segarra 38 the others standing trial are 
carolos ayes suarez 29 norman ramirez talavera 32 roberto 
maldonado rivera 52 and antonio comacho negron 43 all residents 
of puerto rico 
the government contends that all five were members of a group 
known as los macheteros which advocates independence for puerto 
rico and which the government contends is a terrorist organization 
the defendants are accused of participating in a conspiracy to 
plot the heist to transport the stolen money out of the country 
and to distribute the money 
both the prosecution and the defense agree that the robbery was 
committed singlehandedly by victor m gerena a former wells fargo 
security guard he is accused of overpowering two coworkers and 
fleeing with the millions 
the trial of nine other defendants has been postponed while the 
government appeals a ruling tossing out some evidence collected 
through wiretaps two other defendants pleaded guilty last month 
it took years to perpetrate the offense and it will take 
months to prove it assistant us attorney albert dabrowski told 
the jury in his opening remarks 
segarras attorney leonard weinglass said although his client 
knew in advance that the heist would occur and received stolen 
money he was innocent of the crimes with which he has been 
charged segarra faces 17 counts including robbery but no charge 
of receiving stolen funds 
weinglass said gerena decided on his own to rob wells fargo to 
support los macheteros segarra said he was not a member of the 
group 
gerena has not been seen since the robbery the government 
believes he is probably in cuba 
the opening remarks became heated when maldonado an attorney 
defending himself said if im guilty of all the charges i 
could go to jail for 55 years 
the judge told him the remarks were improper when maldanado 
persisted the judge said he was ready to cite him for contempt 
clarie then got into another exchange with juan ramon acevedo 
who is representing ramirez acevedo said the defense intended to 
put the fbi on trial as part of its claim that the defendants are 
being prosecuted for political reasons 
clarie was visibly angry as he raised his gavel and issued a 
warning saying the remarks were inappropriate 
the defense later asked for mistrial because of claries remarks 
to acevedo and maldonado the judge denied the motion 
the first witness was timothy r girard a former wells fargo 
guard and gerenas partner he told the court how gerena held a gun 
to his supervisors head and ordered girard to lie on the floor of 
the depot 
girard said he was bound gagged and left behind as gerena took 
about an hour to load cash into a car and flee

president reagan said tuesday that republicans 
have a real shot at getting back control of the senate in this 
years elections which he painted as a referendum on 
liberalism 
in a speech prepared for delivery at a reception for two western 
gop senatorial candidates reagan predicted voters will reject 
senators who talk conservative back home but vote liberal in 
washington 
his remarks were aimed at sen john melcher dmont who is 
opposed by yellowstone county commissioner conrad burns and sen 
quentin burdick dnd facing a challenge from minority leader 
earl strinden of the north dakota house of representatives 
republicans won control of the senate with reagans election as 
president in 1980 but lost it in 1986 democrats now hold control 
by a margin of 5446 
reagan who has been stepping up the pace of his campaign 
activity as the nov 8 voting approaches told the republican 
gathering this is a great time of year because it gives me an 
opportunity to get out and around and spread some gospel 
ive been out on the campaign trail lately and im just 
starting to wonder if this year there isnt something in the air 
he said 
he said sen rudy boschwitz of minnesota chairman of the 
national republican senatorial committee and senate gop leader bob 
dole of kansas deserve enormous credit because far from being 
discouraged theyve realized that with voter interest much higher 
in this presidential year theres a real shot at getting back 
control of the senate 
you see all the issues we had so much trouble getting out 
there in 1986 are automatically there in 1988 the public is 
beginning to realize that this election is a referendum on 
liberalism he said 
and when the good conservative voters of montana and north 
dakota begin to realize that the opponents of conrad burns and earl 
strinden are nothing less than hardcore liberals senators who 
talk conservative back home but vote liberal in washington they 
are not going to be happy 
reagan flies to pennsylvania and new jersey on wednesday to 
campaign for republican candidates

one of several cadets stricken by a 
kidney ailment during police training last month reentered the 
hospital tuesday with intestinal bleeding officials said 
cadet joseph metcalfe of ludlow was in guarded condition at the 
intensive care unit following surgery at baystate medical center 
said hospital officials 
a nursing supervisor said shortly after metcalfe was admitted 
hes bleeding heavily and is pretty bad 
also tuesday secretary of public safety charles v barry 
recommended an inquest into the 1985 death of a state police cadet 
after meeting tuesday with medical examiner brian blackbourne and 
public safety commissioner william mccabe 
james whitehouse of braintree was 22 when he died on the second 
day of training at the state police academy in framingham a 
medical examiner ruled that he died from a genetic disorder but 
the doctor has since called for the state to reopen the case 
saying he made his diagnosis on the basis of faulty information 
including police claims that whitehouse had been exercising only 
moderately 
metcalfe was in the class of 50 cadets who apparently underwent 
strenuous exercise with little water the first day of class sept 
19 at a police academy in agawam which provides uniform training 
for police departments in the 74 towns and cities of western 
massachusetts 
metcalfe was hospitalized for at least two days that week with 
kidney problems that required dialysis treatment authorities said 
fifteen other cadets were also hospitalized for ailments from heat 
stroke to exhaustion and dehydration 
timothy shepard 25 of pittsfield the only other cadet still 
hospitalized tuesday remained in critical condition at the 
pittsburgh hospital where he underwent a liver transplant two weeks 
ago 
metcalfes boss ludlow police chief john jorge said he 
believed the cadet suffered a relapse after his doctor allowed him 
back to the academy last week 
the nursing supervisor said he didnt know if metcalfes 
rehospitalization was related to his police training but said the 
cadet had been healthy before beginning training 
the state department of public safety has suspended such 
discipline techniques as pushups and laps at the states six police 
academies but it was unclear if physical training had resumed 
department spokesmen were at meetings tuesday and did not 
immediately return telephone calls 
at least four state investigations are under way into the cause 
of the hospitalizations and the regimen at the staterun academy 
at least a dozen state representatives headed for a meeting 
tuesday on their investigation of academy practices the committee 
has said it will submit recommendations to the full state house by 
dec 31

us authorities may offer ferdinand marcos a 
promise he will not go to prison if he pleads guilty and forfeits 
money he allegedly stole from the philippine treasury when he was 
that countrys president government sources said tuesday 
the possibility of making the offer to marcos who has not been 
indicted was discussed last week at a meeting between the state 
departments chief legal counsel abraham sofaer and an aide to 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the sources supplied the information following a story in the 
los angeles times which had obtained a state department cable 
relayed from sofaer to other department officials following last 
weeks meeting between sofaer and thornburgh aide robin ross 
the discussions between the state and justice departments 
revolve around a criminal investigation of marcos by us attorney 
rudolph giuliani in manhattan 
the white house said the national security council staff has 
informally reviewed information from the justice department 
outlining a proposed fraud case against marcos 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday that the 
matter hasnt come to the president yet 
the justice department is considering whether to bring it 
before a grand jury fitzwater said they have given us 
information on the case 
fitzwater said the matter would be presented to reagan for a 
decision after a formal recommendation has been received from 
thornburgh recommendations also will be sought from secretary of 
state george shultz and others in the cabinet he said 
asked if a decision from reagan can be expected before the nov 
8 presidential election fitzwater said i have no idea the 
justice department has given us a preliminary indication of the 
basis of the case 
according to the cable obtained by the times the state 
department wants to give marcos a last chance prior to 
indictment to reach a settlement federal prosecutors prefer to 
indict him first to gain added leverage 
the department of justice has presented no good reason why 
we should not continue to insist on offering mr marcos a chance to 
reach a voluntary plea agreement prior to indictment the cable 
said 
the cable also said federal officials fear that marcos if 
indicted might seek to involve and embarrass us and 
philippine officials by making allegations of improper or illegal 
conduct by them 
the times quoted unidentified sources familiar with the 
investigation as saying us officials are worried that marcos may 
threaten to reveal politically damaging information about his 
dealings with us officials to pressure the white house to block 
prosecution 
the state department also had argued that any indictment of 
marcos should be limited to alleged criminal acts committed after 
he fled to hawaii 
prosecutors in giulianis office have countered that the only 
way to recover any of the allegedly illgotten fortune in manhattan 
real estate and fine art that marcos allegedly has acquired is to 
charge him with acts of fraud that began while he was still 
president of the philippines 
state department officials according to the cable finally 
accepted the prosecutors argument on condition that the indictment 
be drawn and that thornburghs public statements be constructed 
to emphasize illegal conduct after marcos came to the united states 
the cable said its is important to offer marcos a plea bargain 
even if he declines to accept it 
prosecution of mr marcos could set a precedent that would 
have a negative impact on our ability to influence other heads of 
state who may be similarly situated to leave power the cable 
said

the equal employment opportunity commission 
did not fully investigate up to 82 percent of job discrimination 
claims over a threemonth period last year the general accounting 
office reported tuesday 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif who ordered the gao study as 
chairman of the house education and labor committee said i find 
it outrageous that there are people across the country who may have 
a legitimate job discrimination claim denied because the eeoc 
mishandled the case didnt enforce the law or was more concerned 
with reducing paperwork than with protecting claimants civil 
rights 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said the stated 
policy of the eeoc since 1983 has been to fully investigate 
charges of violations of federal state and local antiemployment 
discrimination laws however the task has proved difficult because 
more than 100000 employment discrimination charges are filed 
annually the agency said 
gao reviewed investigations of cases closed between january 
through march 1987 in which no evidence of discrimination was 
found the gao said 41 to 82 percent of the charges closed by the 
six eeoc district offices and 40 to 87 percent of charges closed by 
five state agencies were not fully investigated 
the state agencies reviewed were in georgia michigan new york 
northern california and tennessee 
the report said eeoc chairman clarence thomas and four of the 
five state agencies reviewed generally disagreed with the gaos 
findings among the criticisms included the criteria gao used in 
reviewing the investigations how gao applied the criteria and how 
gao selected the samples to review 
however hawkins said the results showed another giant step 
backward in the fight against job discrimination 
the eeocs failure to fully investigate job discrimination 
claims is further evidence of the agencys attack on civil rights 
protections said hawkins the agency is showing a total 
disregard for the law and for the individuals they must serve 
these investigative breakdowns give a tragic human perspective 
to the reaganbush administration civil rights failures he said 
from the first day in office their policy was to undermine and 
eliminate civil rights protections for women and minorities today 
this gao report shows just how damaging this policy has been

president augusto pinochet and his aides 
are like sullen children in their reluctance to accept defeat 
in last weeks plebiscite the main political opposition leader 
said tuesday 
in another development the air force commander disagreed with 
gen pinochets claims of a hidden victory in his loss of the 
yesorno plebiscite in which he sought to extended his presidency 
until 1997 
patricio aylwin president of the centrist christian democrats 
and official spokesman of a 16party opposition alliance said he 
was not surprised by pinochets initial rejection of calls to 
negotiate with the coalition 
we understand how the first reaction of those who are 
accustomed to imposing their will at any cost is one of sullen 
children as pinochet and the governing team that surrounds 
him he told a news conference 
aylwin 69 is widely considered the most likely alliance 
candidate in an open election planned for december 1989 asked by 
reporters about speculation that pinochet might run he said 
i believe that for us democrats the best adversary we could 
face is precisely pinochet we already beat him once and 
undoubtedly we would beat him again 
in the referendum last wednesday more than 38 million people 
or 54 percent voted against pinochets bid for another eightyear 
term 
pinochet seized power in september 1973 ousting the elected 
government of president salvador allende an avowed marxist who 
died in the coup the terms of his 1980 constitution call for the 
general who still is army commander to turn over power in march 
1990 to the winner of next years election 
the opposition wants the government to negotiate several changes 
in the constitution particularly to hasten the election and 
pinochets departure but pinochet has said no changes in the 
timetable will be permitted 
pinochet and some cabinet members claim the referendum showed 
him to be the most popular political figure in the country since 
the no votes came from several opposition groups 
its natural for everyone to try to draw water to his own 
mill air force commander fernando matthei said tuesday using a 
chilean expression for pursuing personal interest but the only 
reality is that chileans as a majority said no 
gen matthei is considered a moderate in the military junta 
whose four members act as a legislature the other members are army 
gen humberto gordon designated by pinochet adm jose merino the 
navy commander and gen rodolfo stange director of the national 
police

the justice department on tuesday announced a 
final settlement providing 750000 to nine people who were 
subjected to mindcontrol experiments by their psychiatrist whose 
research was aided by a cia front organization 
the cia in the late 1950s granted 60000 to dr ewen cameron a 
canadian and former president of the world psychiatric association 
as well as the canadian and american psychiatric associations who 
used the money to conduct a series of experiments with his patients 
he subjected the patients to druginduced sleep therapy for 
weeks at a time gave them lsd and administered electroshock 
therapy at up to 75 times the usual intensity 
camerons goal to reprogram behavior caught the attention of 
cia officials at a time when the agency was concerned with 
countering purported soviet and chinese breakthroughs in 
brainwashing and interrogation techniques 
the cia initiated a chemicalbiological warfare research project 
known as mkultra to aid in eforts 
the nine former patients of cameron brought a suit in 1980 in 
us district court in washington dc and a tentative settlement 
with the cia now given final approval was disclosed last week in 
court

a former weapons analyst for the army pleaded 
guilty tuesday to espionage for passing classified information to 
the south african government the first such prosecution involving 
that country 
thomas joseph dolce 49 once a civilian employee at the 
aberdeen proving ground north of baltimore admitted mailing a 
classified document in 1979 to col bernardus redelinghuys a 
defense and armed forces attache at the south african embassy in 
washington 
assistant us attorney gary p jordan did not describe the 
information saying only that dolce provided it because of its 
potential use for sabotage and because dolce felt the united states 
should be sharing the information with south africa a staunchly 
anticommunist country that is ruled by its white minority under a 
system of racial segregation known as apartheid 
authorities said dolce who is now cooperating with the 
investigation insisted his activities were motivated by 
ideological rather than financial concerns jordan said there is 
no evidence that dolce accepted money from the south africans 
defense attorney harold i glaser said dolce was the only us 
citizen involved adding the government learned of his clients 
activities inadvertently glaser declined to elaborate 
the attorney said dolce acted out of a misguided sense of 
patriotism he did it out of what he considered to be loyalty but 
it was of course a gigantic gigantic mistake 
dolce was employed by the army material systems analysis 
activity a department of the army agency charged with evaluating 
weapons systems he held a security clearance of secret and the 
documents involved were classified secret 
dolce told investigators that he had a longtime interest in 
south africa and in 1971 sold his residence in this country and 
emigrated there according to jordan however he became frustrated 
by the job opportunities there and south africas oneyear 
residency requirement before he could obtain a defenserelated 
position 
dolce returned to the united states and in 1973 he was hired by 
the department of the army 
authorities would not discuss the extent of the damage dolces 
activities caused national security 
the extent of mr dolces relationship with south african 
officials will be the subject of debriefings by the fbi us 
attorney breckinridge l willcox said in a statement only after 
those debriefings will we be in a position to assess the full 
extent of his dealings 
in the first instance we consider this whole thing history 
said alayne resberg press secretary for the south african embassy 
two of the officers allegedly involved have already retired from 
active service and the third officer is no longer in the united 
states of america 
we would just like to point out that south africa doesnt 
consider itself an unfriendly nation toward the usa she said 
adding that neither the fbi nor the justice department has talked 
to anyone in the embassy about the case 
although dolce pleaded guilty to only one count authorities 
said dolce passed over numerous documents until he terminated his 
relationship with the south africans in 1983 apparently because of 
a personality clash with the embassys new defense attache 
dolce agreed to plead guilty as part of an arrangement with 
federal prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation with 
government investigations he was not prosecuted under a more 
severe statute carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison 
authorities said they would recommend dolce be sentenced to 10 
years in prison and a 10000 fine the maximum for his conviction 
us district judge herbert f murray ordered that dolce be held 
in jail without bail pending a sentencing date which has yet to be 
set

three evangelists who traveled the southern 
revival circuit pleaded guilty tuesday to running an interstate sex 
ring of boys they recruited with gifts and money and then molested 
mario tony leyva rias edward morris and freddie m herring 
entered guilty pleas to federal charges they used the tony leyva 
evangelistic association inc based in columbus ga to recruit 
boys for homosexual prostitution 
dozens of boys told investigators they were given money lodging 
and gifts in return for letting the preachers molest them the 
evangelists were not accused of selling the boys services to 
others 
leyva took the witness stand and said he had molested at least 
100 boys beginning in the 1960s in north carolina where he began 
having sex with the young brothers of his wife from whom he has 
since been divorced 
fbi special agent john terry said an investigation had uncovered 
dozens of the preachers victims in the south and midwest 
four of the boys stated they were victims of all three 
terry said six of the boys were victims of at least two the 
victims ranged from an 8yearold on up to the midteens 
leyva pleaded guilty to conspiracy and four counts of shipping 
minors across state lines for prostitution the charges carry a 
penalty of 45 years in prison but assistant us attorney jennie 
montgomery agreed to seek a maximum of 20 years in a child 
molesters prison unit in butner nc 
the preachers will undergo psychiatric evaluations at the 
pedophile unit beginning oct 25 
morris leyvas ministry organist pleaded guilty to conspiracy 
and three counts of aiding and abetting the interstate transport of 
a minor for prostition the charges carry a penalty of 35 years in 
prison but the prosecutor agreed to ask for no more than 15 years 
herring founder of the lighthouse assembly in douglasville 
ga pleaded guilty to one count of interstate transportation of a 
minor for homosexual prostitution and one count of aiding and 
abetting interstate transportation of a minor for prostitution the 
counts carry 20 years in prison but the plea bargain calls for a 
maximum sentence of 15 years 
im sorry that this happened and i hope that their hurt will 
not linger herring testified im asking for their 
forgiveness 
ms montgomery said the plea agreements were a good deal for the 
government as well as for the victims who did not have to relive 
their molestation by testifying 
the indictment alleged that the pentecostal preachers abused 
boys in virginia north carolina georgia florida mississippi 
louisiana arkansas ohio and indiana police received complaints 
about leyva over the years but usually by the time they got them 
he had crossed state lines en route to the next revival making it 
hard for a case to be built ms montgomery said 
up to seven more preachers were identified as child molesters 
when the fbi questioned leyva morris and herring she said the 
offenses sounded like local crimes and she said she would turn over 
information to authorities in indiana mississippi and alabama 
last month leyva was convicted by a roanoke county circuit 
court jury of two counts of oral sodomy on teenage boys and 
recommended that he receive counseling during a twoandahalfyear 
prison term

the communist party leadership 
made changes at the top of the party and government tuesday in a 
meeting that also expressed clear opposition to sweeping economic 
or political reform 
ladislav adamec 62yearold premier of the czech lands was 
chosen as new federal premier to replace lubomir strougal who 
resigned monday after more than 18 years in the job and gave up his 
seat on the communist partys ruling politburo 
jaromir johanes becomes foreign minister replacing bohuslav 
chnoupek he has been first deputy foreign minister since july 1987 
and is a former ambasssador to canada and the united states 
interior minister vratislav vajnar 58 will be replaced by 
frantisek kincl 
the changes were made at a twoday meeting of the party central 
committee session which ended tuesday and were announced at a 
news conference by jan fojtik the new party ideologist he also 
said five men were made full members of the politburo increasing 
the membership from 12 to 15 
peter colotka who resigned as premier of slovakia on monday 
also stepped down from the politburo 
czechoslovakias leaders appear to have been discouraged by 
developments in neighboring hungary and poland efforts toward 
reform there or public demand for it have created serious 
problems for the communist governments 
this country has no shortage of basic consumer goods and the 
foreign debt and inflation are comparatively low 
vasil bilak a hardline member remained on the politburo but 
now is in charge of foreign policy because fojtik has been given 
bilaks old job as party ideologist 
bilak and party chief milos jakes are among only a few senior 
officials left from the leadership installed after a sovietled 
invasion crushed alexander dubceks brief prague spring 
liberalization in 1968 
fojtik said rudolf rohlicek first deputy premier will be in 
charge of the government until the changes can be approved by the 
parliament next month 
ladislav gerle in charge of the recently created super 
ministry including metallurgy engineering and electrotechnical 
industry is being replaced by karel julis 59 a former czech 
minister of education youth and physical training 
savotpluk potac head of the state planning commission gave way 
to bohumil urban 
new politburo members are miroslav zavadil 56 miroslav stepan 
43 karel urbanek 47 frantisek pitra 56 and ivan knotek 52 
fojtik said colotka would become ambassador to france and knotek 
would replace him as premier of slovakia 
strougal 63 was considered the chief advocate of economic 
reforms but observers said party conservatives diluted his plans 
in a long speech to the central committee on monday fojtik made 
clear that the leadership opposes radical political and economic 
changes similar to those mikhail s gorbachev is promoting in the 
soviet union 
according to the text distributed tuesday by the official news 
agency ctk he expressed support for cautious reform and emphasized 
the partys leading role 
one of the most fundamental lessons of the past is that in 
looking for and pursuing new ways of development we must under no 
circumstances permit the weakening of the leading role of the 
communist party fojtik said 
he warned of privateownership petitbourgeois ideology and 
rejected foreign criticism of czechosovakias tough approach to 
dissident movements 
we must not close our eyes to any of the risks of reform 
the party ideologist said superficial journalism and here we 
are not speaking only about our own authors makes light of some 
of these problems or passes them over in silence altogether while 
dramatizing others

the rev ian paisley a militant 
protestant member from northern ireland shouted i renounce you 
as the antichrist as pope john paul ii spoke of unity tuesday 
to the european parliament 
paisleys outburst came as the pontiff began delivering the key 
speech of his trip to northeastern france in which he urged europe 
to adopt a common political structure the european parliament is 
an advisory body to the 12member european economic community 
the pope returned to rome tuesday evening ending the fourday 
visit he met briefly with premier michel rocard before boarding 
his special airliner in a heavy rain 
paisley stood by his desk in the back of the assembly chamber 
during welcoming remarks by lord plumb president of the 
parliament as the pope began speaking he was immediately 
interrupted by paisley standing about 11 rows from the pontiff 
i renounce you i renounce you as the antichrist shouted 
paisley leader of the irish protestant democratic unionist party 
who was instantly surrounded by about a dozen deputies to the 
parliament they shouted to drown out his insults threw paper at 
him and tore from his hands a crude orange banner reading pope 
john paul ii antichrist 
plumb twice called for order and then evicted paisley to the 
applause of deputies and an estimated 300 spectators in the gallery 
a group of deputies dragged and shoved paisley from the hall he 
later told journalists i was hammered i was beaten about the 
ears and body 
john paul smiled briefly at the outburst and resumed his speech 
that was again interrupted this time by a round of applause 
paisley has spearheaded opposition to the 1985 angloirish 
agreement which granted the government of catholicdominated 
ireland a say in the running of northern ireland a british 
province where 60 percent of the population is protestant 
the pope has not taken a stand on whether the province should be 
united with the irish republic but has called for peace and 
reconciliation between catholics and protestants 
as he has throughout his trip john paul urged the unification 
of europe and encouraged the nations to serve as a beacon in the 
civilization of the world by fighting pollution prejudice and 
secularization 
john paul said the agreement by the 12 european community 
members to integrate their economies by 1992 would hasten political 
integration some common market officials have called for 
development of a common political organization perhaps even a 
united states of europe 
a common political structure far from endangering the 
identity of the people of the community will be better suited to 
guarantee more fairly the rights of all regions said the 
68yearold pontiff 
the comment challenged a statement last month by british prime 
minister margaret thatcher who said creating a paneuropean 
political structure was utopian and would detract from the 
diversity of european cultures 
in addition to britain and france the eec members include 
belgium denmark greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands portugal spain and west germany 
paisley was first elected to the european parliament from 
northern ireland in 1979 he was elected by a similar but larger 
mainly protestant constituency that has elected him to britains 
house of commons since 1970 
the polishborn pope encouraged the parliament to unite with 
central and eastern europe and build on a shared christian heritage 
speaking in both english and french he said a united europe 
would benefit the individual countries economically and that some 
of the wealth should be used to help the third world without any 
thought of domination with the intention of helping poor countries 
to take in hand their own destiny 
europe should remember its common christian roots and look to 
the church to guide society he said 
the pope began his day by paying homage to the patron saint of 
alsacelorrain at the mountaintop monastery of mont saint odile 
after the address at parliament he said mass at a packed stadium 
in the industrial city of mulhouse near the swiss border 
on saturday john paul began his visit by launching an appeal 
for a unified europe at the council of europe and the european 
court and commission of human rights

hundreds of demonstrators demanding 
easier access to experimental drugs for people with aids blocked 
entrances to the food and drug administrations headquarters 
tuesday prompting police to close the building to arriving 
employees 
vito russo a new york writer who said he was diagnosed with 
aids in 1985 said the demonstrators did not want the fda to stop 
testing drugs but to move faster and make aids drugs available as 
soon as it is determined they are safe rather than waiting to 
judge their effectiveness as well 
the side effect of aids is death russo said 
montgomery county police some of them wearing clear plastic 
surgical gloves arrested and charged 175 demonstrators with 
loitering for blocking entrances one protester was arrested and 
charged with assault and battery of an officer during the slow 
methodical process which went on for more than six hours 
most of the arrested protesters elected to walk to the waiting 
police buses where they were handcuffed with plastic ties a few 
chose to be dragged and were accommodated by pairs of officers 
police said all those arrested were later released and would be 
scheduled to appear in court at a later date 
four men climbed atop two of the buses and huddled under 
blankets whipped by a chilly wind police made no attempt to remove 
them until they got ready to move the buses when the men refused 
to get off the rooftops they were handcuffed and dropped through 
hinged skylights into the compartments below to cheers and 
laughter from their watching compatriots 
at least two glass door panels were broken during jostling 
between surging crowds and police during the early minutes of the 
demonstration 
police allowed demonstrators wearing armbands designating them 
as medical personnel to go onto the buses to check on those already 
handcuffed and arrested some of whom wore lettered shirts saying 
they had aids 
a woman police officer carrying two cups of coffee walked past 
some of the protesters and was jokingly offered 5 for one of 
coffees hows this she said giving away one of the cups 
without breaking stride 
before returning to her assignment of helping usher arrestees 
onto a bus the officer slipped on a pair of plastic gloves and 
then hid them from view with a pair of white mittens 
there was no accurate count of how many of the estimated 4500 
people who normally work in the sprawling 17story building had 
arrived at work early and were inside when police started turning 
people back at 730 am edt about 2000 fda employees work in the 
building and agency spokesman brad stone said he thought about 
1500 made it in they were urged to report early before the 
demonstration began

two men won seats in armenias legislature with 
support from leaders of strikes that paralyzed the southern 
republic for weeks but armenian authorities voided their 
elections an activist said tuesday 
their victories were among the first in which unofficial 
candidates defeated communist party nominees 
a highranking communist who had certified the two mens 
elections was kicked out of the party and faces dismissal from his 
government job the official news agency tass reported 
it said the bureaucrat falsified the election returns by 
certifying h stamboltsyan as a winner 
stamboltsyan and candidate ashot manucharian were backed by the 
karabakh committee activist galstyan ambartsum said the committee 
wants the nagornokarabakh region of neighboring azerbaijan whose 
population is predominantly armenian to be made part of armenia 
the karabakh committee organized strikes the ethnic dispute led 
to arson and gunfights and the central government sent soldiers 
with tanks to armenia and nagornokarabakh last month 
soviet officials say the situation in both areas has stabilized 
and workers have been returning to their jobs 
ambartsum a member of the karabakh committee said by telephone 
from yerevan capital of armenia that the group put up two 
candidates in an interim election for three seats in the supreme 
soviet of armenia 
he said stamboltsyan beat the interior minister the republics 
top police official by a 41 margin and manucharian got 70 percent 
of the vote against the foreign minister neither he nor tass said 
when the election was held 
on monday the central committee of the armenian communist party 
threw out stamboltsyans victory on grounds he was not a registered 
candidate ambartsum said tass said stamboltsyan had not been 
registered and did not receive a majority of the votes of all the 
voters of the district 
tass did not mention manucharian ambartsum said the leadership 
canceled manucharians victory by saying that he had to win with 75 
percent of the vote which the activist declared to be a lie 
several nonparty members backed by unofficial citizen groups 
have won local offices this year in the baltic republics of 
estonia latvia and lithuania 
according to tass the armenian central committee expelled kl 
mandalyan from the party and recommended he lose his job in the 
bureaucracy for certifying stamboltsyans victory 
it said mandalyan presided over a meeting of the local election 
commission and pushed through acceptance of the victory while only 
six of the 14 members were present the agency said he delivered 
the documentation to the karabakh committee which announced the 
victory in yerevans central square 
mandalyans action was a deliberate political provocation 
that fired ethnic and nationalist passions the local party 
committee said tass reported that v galumyan the republics vice 
president was reprimanded for failing to prevent mandalyans 
action

diplomats were deadlocked over the weekend in 
trying to set a timetable for pulling out 50000 cuban troops from 
angola cuban and angolan envoys involved in the negotiations said 
tuesday 
south africa has scheduled for nov 1 the start of an 
independence plan for neighboring southwest africa known as 
namibia but it has linked it to cuban troop withdrawal from angola 
the pretoria government says the cubans threaten the 
independence of namibia which borders angola 
cubas deputy foreign minister ricardo alarcon de quesada and 
angolas ambassador to the un manuel pedro pacavira said the 
us cuban angolan and south african negotiators reached no 
agreement in talks held friday through sunday 
they spoke at a news conference in response to published reports 
saying the talks reached agreement on a 24to30 month pullout by 
the cubans 
we are at an impasse which is not precisely synonymous with 
agreement said alarcon 
as you can see in the newspapers reports almost daily we 
havent yet achieved an agreement or understanding on the calendar 
for the withdrawal of the cuban forces in angola he said 
pacavira reiterated that assessment during the news conference 
held at the national council of churches headquarters in manhattan 
alarcon said cuba and angola need 30 months to train and equip 
angolan forces to deal with any future raids by south africa or by 
the unita rebels that are backed by the united states and south 
africa 
the united states serving as mediator in the talks has 
suggested a 24month withdrawal and south africa agrees said 
alarcon and pacavira 
pacavira said the conflicting proposals were advanced a month 
ago in a meeting in brazzaville congo 
south africa in the past has launched periodic raids from 
namibia into southern angola to back up unita forces when they 
encountered heavy resistance from cuban forces 
under a preliminary agreement in the peace talks all south 
african forces left southern angola by sept 1 
president pw botha of south africa on tuesday termed reports 
of an agreement inaccurate saying the timetable needs to be 
worked out he commented while on a visit to zurich switzerland 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the talks were helpful in more precisely defining the gaps 
remaining between the parties 
they recognize that further decisions are required to reach an 
agreement acceptable to all sides she said 
diplomats involved in the talks say they are working toward 
reaching agreement on a cuban withdrawal timetable at a meeting to 
be held this month in brazzaville 
however us officials botha and alarcon have said it may not 
be possible to reach the nov 1 deadline set by the united nations 
for transition to independence for namibia 
when the independence plan begins the united nations will send 
7500 peacekeepers and 2000 civilian support staff to supervise 
elections for a national assembly that will adopt a constitution 
and form an independent government 
under the un plan independence will be achieved in one year 
as the un peacekeepers maintain order and supervise the south 
african withdrawal

michael dukakis and george bush sparred at a distance over trade 
issues on tuesday in a prelude to this weeks primetime debate 
the democrat vowed to stand up for american companies and jobs 
while the vice president charged that his rival was guilty of 
protectionist demagoguery 
my opponent needs an issue and hes willing to scare people to 
find it bush said of dukakis recent emphasis on a need to 
regain american dominance in world economic competition 
dukakis counterpunched a few hours later as he left boston for 
the west coast im for more trade not less trade i want to 
export american products not american jobs he said 
dukakis also took a fresh swipe at the republican vice 
presidential candidate as new polls indicated bushs ticketmate is 
draining support from the gop said the democrat dan quayle asks 
us to believe that if he ever had to fill in for george bush 
america could get by on a right wing and a prayer 
bush defended his pick for vice president saying quayle had 
helped draft legislation that created jobs for the poor 
the two combatants in the race for the white house exchanged 
barbs as fresh polls charted a dwindling lead for bush with four 
campaign weeks remaining the surveys showed dukakis and running 
mate lloyd bentsen gaining ground since last weeks vice 
presidential debate 
despite the polls surveys by the associated press and others in 
recent weeks have indicated that bush holds a marked advantage in 
the electoral college with the race likely to be decided by the 
results in several large swing states 
the democratic gains were also tempered when party officials 
announced that two senior strategists had been pulled out of 
florida in what seemed to be a concession that bushs doubledigit 
lead there would be all but impossible to overcome the two were 
headed for ohio a swing state where dukakis is viewed as trailing 
more narrowly 
both candidates set aside time over the next few days to prepare 
for their second and final debate of the fall campaign set to 
begin at 9 pm edt thursday on the campus of ucla in a race as 
close as theirs a nationally televised debate could be critical in 
shaping the outcome 
debate sponsors announced late in the day that cable news 
network anchorman bernard shaw would moderate the bushdukakis 
encounter the questions will be asked by andrea mitchell of nbc 
ann compton of abc and margaret warner of newsweek 
in a speech near boston before flying west dukakis mentioned 
several steps to improve americas ability to take charge of our 
future including a major effort to improve the nations 
scientific and engineering capabilities i want us to begin 
selling cars and computers and compact discs to the germans and the 
japanese and the koreans not arms to the ayatollah he said 
together we can build a future where the best products in the 
world are designed by american minds built by american hands and 
produce good profits and good paychecks here on american soil 
added dukakis who has campaigned recently as a critic of foreign 
ownership of american firms 
the democratic candidate said the formula for victory in the 
global economic battle might include government protection for some 
firms struggling against foreign competition 
bush campaigned in seattle where he said foreign ownership of 
us plants helps to create jobs and suggested that dukakis was 
mouthing campaign rhetoric that he doesnt believe 
frankly ive been surprised at my opponents recent turn to 
protectionist demagogury the vice president said in prepared 
remarks i dont think he really believes it 
bush added that like the know nothing party a century before 
him dukakis had turned to fear of foreigners or maybe with 
this latest flipflop hes become a believenothing candidate 
bush coupled his attack with a pledge to throw the book at 
inside stock traders and other whitecollar criminals they may 
not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits but they are a real

bush led dukakis 5047 percent in the abc newswashington post 
poll conducted wednesday through sunday the survey of 600 likely 
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage 
points statistically negating the lead 
a gallup survey of 1007 registered voters found bush ahead of 
dukakis 49 percent to 43 percent the survey conducted friday 
through sunday also had a fourpoint margin of error bush pulled 
farther ahead among respondents who seemed likely to vote 5241 
in a group of 748 but the gallup organization said it used a 
fairly loose gauge of voting likelihood and felt the results were 
not fully reliable 
a los angeles times poll released monday found that quayle

4441 percent but bush alone led his democratic opponent 4839 in 
the poll the weekend survey of 893 registered voters had a margin 
of error of five percentage points 
quayle took a winding campaign bus tour through rural ohio he 
attacked dukakis handling of a massachusetts furlough program in 
which a firstdegree murderer failed to return from a weekend pass 
and later attacked a couple in maryland 
even after the horton case the governor strenuously defended 
the furlough program quayle said he did not act to change it 
the indiana senator added saying changes were made in the law only 
after pressure from the state legislature 
bentsen campaigned in new jersey and pennsylvania where he 
sought to minimize a disagreement with dukakis over the death 
penalty well im one that favors it but i must say reasonable 
people can differ on that one he said

nobel peace laureate mother teresa 
of calcutta has telephoned five carmelite nuns barricaded inside a 
monastery to offer support for their cause a sister of one of the 
nuns said 
the nuns have been locked inside an infirmary since oct 4 
saying they feared eviction from the monastery because of their 
complaints that the new prioress was instigating too many changes 
at the monastery of the most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel 
the introduction of television snacks and videotaped movies 
were some of the changes to which the nuns objected 
the nuns received the call from mother teresa monday night 
telling them not to feel deserted by the church said doreen 
ercolano the sister of one of the nuns sister maria 
the phone call from mother teresa put new wind in their 
sails ms ercolano said 
mother teresa assured the nuns she would speak to pope john paul 
ii on their behalf when she meets him in rome in a few weeks ms 
ercolano said 
the five nuns denied reports tuesday that they are disobedient 
sister john of the cross a spokeswoman for the group said she 
and the other four are awaiting word from the vatican as to how 
they can settle their standoff with diocesan and carmelite 
officials 
at this moment i think they are trying a lot of pressure and 
a lot of scare tactics but we will not be intimidated sister 
john said in a telephone interview we are confident in the 
higher authorities in rome 
sister john said the nuns were upset after paterson diocese 
bishop frank rodimer took the highly irregular move of putting 
mother theresa hewitt in charge of the monastery without consulting 
the 13 nuns who live there she said the nuns are supposed to elect 
the next prioress 
tim manning a spokesman for mother hewitt and rodimer said 
church officials decided to appoint someone to run the monastery 
because tensions there were already high he did not elaborate 
in her first public comment on the situation monday mother 
hewitt said some of the changes under fire from the nuns were 
instituted by some of her predecessors including allowing 
television and magazines in the monastery 
when the nuns were given official dismissal warnings in june 
they hired the rev milan mikulich to defend their effort to remain 
in the cloistered order sister john said she said mother hewitt 
accused them of being disobedient 
sister john said four of the nuns went to the infirmary last 
week because they grew restless waiting for an official response 
from rome and were afraid visiting church officials would 
physically evict them from the monastery a fifth nun later joined 
them

gives guerrillas access to jalalabad asadabad is about 12 miles 
from pakistan where border towns and refugee camps serve as 
guerrilla bases and 100 miles northeast of kabul 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and the soviet union sent military forces to afghanistan in 
december 1979 under a unmediated agreement signed last april 
the soviets have been withdrawing their estimated 115000 soldiers

a coroners inquest jury ruled tuesday that all 31 
people killed in a fire at londons busiest subway station last 
year died accidentally 
the jury ruled that all but one of the victims died from smoke 
inhalation when fire raced up a wooden escalator at the kings 
cross station and a ball of flames exploded in the ticket lobby 
nov 18 
one man died later in hospital from complications resulting from 
his burns eighty others were injured 
matthew scott representing relatives of some of the victims 
had urged coroner dr douglas chambers to instruct the jury it 
could also bring in a verdict of unlawful killing 
there is some evidence albeit partial and incomplete that 
there has been gross negligence scott said 
i refer in particular to the failure to apply a drop of water 
to that fire for the first 15 minutes of its existence i refer 
possibly to the 18 previous fires which were either undiscovered or 
not acted upon on that escalator he said 
these are simply the tips of the iceberg scott said the 
jury of course havent heard the full story 
chambers rejected the submission and told the jury there was 
no place for a verdict of unlawful killing it isnt that sort 
of court 
such verdicts were best left to a crminal court with a judge 
and lawyers trained in criminal law he said the only other 
possible ruling beside accidental death was an open verdict he 
said 
investigators believe the fire started when a lighted cigarette 
fell onto a wooden escalator surrounded by greasesoaked trash 
smoking has since been banned throughout the subway system 
the sixday inquest was delayed while police inquiries and other 
investigations were completed an inquest was required by law to 
formally rule on the cause of deaths 
the governments public inquiry into the fire concluded in june 
but its findings have not yet been made public 
after tuesdays ruling sophie tarassenko whose rock musician 
brother ivan 25 died in the blaze complained this is a 
complete travesty of the truth 
i was pretty angry before but i am feeling very very angry 
now she said 
we came here to find out how our relatives died and what 
happened to them and they were only ever mentioned as a broad list 
the rest of the time was spent patting people on the back and 
saying what a good job they did 
mary groombridge whose widowed mother natalie falco died 
said she was also very very angry as we all are 
she said i dont think it was an investigation into how they 
died at all there has been an inquiry investigating the 
circumstances of the deaths but this has been just a total farce

us nuclear weapons are made in an industrial 
labyrinth spreading over 13 states and occupying 90000 people in 
16 major plants three laboratories and a test range spending 
about 76 billion a year 
all of the weapons are produced by a civilian agency the energy 
department and always have been no administration or congress has 
wanted to give the job to the military 
it wasnt until the 1950s in fact that the armed forces were 
even allowed to keep weapons on hand if they had wanted one they 
would have had to get it from the atomic energy commission one of 
the departments predecessors 
the doe operations have recently been the focus of studies and 
news reports alleging serious breaches of safety or security at 
several facilities 
the most recent major study of weapons production was published 
in 1987 by the natural resources defense council a group best 
known for its lawsuits on behalf of environmental causes 
the study estimated that the energy department in 19851990 
would produce each year slightly more than 1800 nuclear bombs 
warheads shells and other weapons in 10 different types with 12 
more designs in research and development 
through 1986 the armed services had deployed 71 different 
weapons in 116 different systems only 29 types were still in the 
stockpile and the total explosive force available had declined 
drastically as new weapons incorporating improved accuracy came 
into service 
two laboratories design the weapons often competing with each 
other and a third designs the nonnuclear components of a bomb or 
warhead 
the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico was established 
in the greatest secrecy by the armys manhattan engineer district 
the fabled manhattan project in 1943 to design and build the two 
bombs dropped on japan in august 1945 
the lawrence livermore national laboratory at livermore calif 
was established in 1952 for edward teller the principal backer of 
what was called then the super the hydrogen bomb 
los alamos in fact designed the first hydrogen or 
thermonuclear weapons and after a few test failures lawrence 
livermore started putting its designs into the national stockpile 
in 1958 
the sandia national laboratory in albuquerque nm designs the 
fuses security features and new delivery systems in cooperation 
with the armed services 
recently the energy department has been making only two of the 
six materials that have been used over the years for nuclear and 
thermonuclear weapons tritium and plutonium 
the other four lithium6 uranium235 uranium238 and 
deuterium are not in production for weapons although some 
stockpiled weapons still incorporate uranium and the uranium is 
recycled into new weapons 
plutonium made from uranium in nuclear reactors is used for 
modern weapons in preference to uranium even though its more 
expensive 
only onethird as much plutonium is needed to form the 
critical mass that sustains the nuclear reaction according to 
thomas cochran principal author of the natural resources defense 
council study this permits a lighter smaller bomb 
tritium is used to boost the explosive power of nuclear weapons 
and in thermonuclear weapons all of which use a nuclear device as 
a trigger 
at the moment there is no production of either plutonium or 
tritium 
these materials recently have come from two sites a reactor at 
the hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash and three 
reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken sc hanford made 
plutonium and savannah river made both plutonium and tritium 
the feed materials production center near fernald ohio and the 
ashtabula plant near ashtabula ohio supply fuel assembliesto 
hanford and savannah river 
these reactors start with uranium from a variety of sources 
including research reactors spent fuel from warships recovered at 
the idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho falls 
inventory accumulated over the years and uranium recycled along 
with plutonium from weapons being retired the government hasnt 
bought uranium for weapons since 1971 
tritium is produced from lithium6 recovered from retired 
warheads at the mound plant at miamisburg ohio 
it is believed the three reactors at savannah river had been 
concentrating on tritium energy secretary john herrington has told 
congress were awash in plutonium 
it takes 24000 years for half of a given mass of plutonium to 
decay but half of any amount of tritium is gone in 123 years the 
tritium in any weapon must be refreshed from time to time 
the rocky flats colo plant assembles the fissionable 
materials inside conventional high explosive that sets off a 
nuclear explosion the y12 plant at oak ridge tenn casts 
uranium apon 
the kansas city plant in missouri makes fuses and other components 
using electronics from sandia 
all these various parts are sent to the pantex plant at 
amarillo texas for final weapons assembly and shipment to the 
military 
this plant also disassembles warheads being taken out of 
service modifies existing weapons and tests components for 
reliability and conformity with design

republican george bush promised on tuesday to 
crack down on whitecollar crime including insider trading in 
stocks saying people guilty of such activities may wear fancy 
suits but are dangerous all the same 
bush also took democratic presidential rival michael dukakis to 
task for his recent criticism of foreign ownership of us 
businesses bush said my opponent needs an issue and hes 
willing to scare people to find it 
his remarks prepared for delivery to the seattle university 
business school were released just before he left washington dc 
for the west coast bush is to spend the next few days in light 
campaigning and in preparing for thursday nights debate with 
democrat dukakis in los angeles 
we will throw the book at insider traders and other 
whitecollar criminals said the republican presidential nominee 
they may not carry guns and they may wear fancy suits but they 
are a real danger to society and they should be hit with the 
maximum penalties of the law 
bushs speech to the catholic college was disrupted by shouting 
from a jesuit priest who was forcibly removed from the room by 
police and taken away in a squad car he identified himself as 
william bichsel who operates a program for the homeless in nearby 
tacoma 
isnt this a great country you csn run into all kinds of 
characters in my line of work bush said continuing with his 
speech this one amazing 
bichsel shouted questions at bush about the homeless and as he 
was led away said they stand for the complete destruction of 
the people of this country and abroad the rich grow richer and 
poor grow poorer 
another protester john whitney 30 a philosophy teacher at the 
college also shouted questions at bush but left the room when 
officials asked him to and was not arrested 
whitney who said he was an associate of bichsels complained 
that only business students and faculty were invited to the speech 
and that questions were not permitted 
i stood up because he would not answer questions of 
students said whitney who was wearing a dukakis button i 
thought the school was being used 
bushs harshest words came in his criticism of the democratic 
candidates recent assault on foreign ownership 
frankly ive been surprised at my opponents recent turn to 
protectionist demagoguery bush said i dont think he really 
believes it he ran against this socalled economic nationalism 
in the primaries but now for political reasons he sees advantage 
in stoking fears about foreign influence 
bush said that like the know nothing party a century before 
him dukakis had turned to fear of foreigners or maybe 
with this latest flipflop hes become a believenothing 
candidate 
last week dukakis in a speech in missouri voiced concern about 
a rise in foreign ownership of businesses and plants in the united 
states 
and he returned to the subject on tuesday asking college 
students in medford mass will we sell out more and more of our 
land and our factories and our banks or will we take charge of our 
future 
bush on the other hand said foreign investment in the 
united states whether its in wellston mo or marysville ohio 
or right here in seattle helps create jobs 
the vice president for the second day in a row appeared to go 
out of his way to mention his running mate by name 
under the leadership of my running mate dan quayle weve 
revamped our job training program so that it actually helps the 
economically disadvantaged find jobs in the private sector he 
said 
on monday at an airport rally in trenton nj bush said i 
urge you to work for me and dan quayle 
before this week bush hardly ever mentioned the indiana 
senator who recent polls suggest has become a political liablity 
to the vice presidents campaign 
in his remarks on whitecollar crime bush said for every 
share of stock that is bought from someone with inside information 
there is an innocent investor who has paid too much for his or her 
goods just as surely as if a product was misrepresented in a 
simple fraud 
bush added without elaboration i am against business 
journalists who buy stock in a company just before writing a 
favorable story on that same company 
he took another swipe at the news media in the remarks prepared 
for the audience of business students i dont have to tell you 
the image that many americans and many in the press have of 
business students bush said 
instead of recognizing that youre learning to help make our 
economy run better theyve painted a picture of a generation only 
concerned about quick and easy money bush said 
from seattle bush was going to los angeles to prepare for the 
debate with dukakis

a federal embezzlement and racketeering trial 
opening wednesday that once centered on the late jackie presser 
will now focus on a longtime presser associate who has emerged as 
ohios most powerful teamsters official 
harold friedman 66 was indicted may 16 1986 on two counts of 
labor racketeering two of embezzlement and two of making false 
statements to the us department of labor 
the president of the 5000member teamsters local 507 founded 
in cleveland in 1967 is also an international vice president of 
the union the new president of the ohio conference of teamsters 
and the leader of teamsters joint council 41 in northeast ohio he 
also is president of bakery workers local 19 in cleveland 
his codefendant is anthony hughes 52 local 507 recording 
secretary who is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and 
one count of embezzlement 
until recently both friedman and hughes were overshadowed by 
the defense of presser teamsters president from 1983 until this 
year and local 507s secretarytreasurer presser who was accused 
in the indictment of masterminding the 700000 scheme died july 9 
after numerous delays the trial is set to begin wednesday with 
jury selection in us district court on oct 3 questionnaires 
were handed out to some 125 prospective jurors in an effort to save 
lawyers time in the interrogation process needed to come up with a 
12person panel 
the trial is expected to last four to six weeks 
federal prosecutors will try to prove that friedman and hughes 
had a role in placing three ghosts or people who were paid and 
did no union work on the local 507 payroll 
the jury trial will culminate a federal probe that first came to 
light six years ago on oct 8 1982 when us marshals and agents 
of the department of labor inspector generals office seized 
records at the local 507 building 
federal prosecutors had considered the indictment in 1985 but 
held back after fbi agents revealed pressers fbi informant 
relationship 
pressers defense according to statements of defense attorney 
john r climaco would have been that presser was told to place 
certain men on the locals payroll and to keep them there in order 
to protect and enhance his informant role 
the justice departments strike force against organized crime 
maintains that presser never had such authorization 
unlike presser who made numerous public appearances as the 
teamsters leader and vowed to beat the governments case friedman 
has never publicly commented in line with his preference to shun 
the press 
presser and hughes have been identified in pretrial documents 
filed with us district judge george w white as fbi informants 
who would provide their fbi handlers with information about 
organized crime and teamsters innerpolitics friedman apparently 
had no such fbi link and court documents leave unclear whether he 
knew anything about the others fbi connection

the senate on tuesday revived attempts to 
impose punitive sanctions against iraq for its alleged use of 
poison gas against kurdish civilians but eliminated sanctions 
senators said would harm us farm exporters 
the 870 roll call vote by which the sanctions measure was 
adopted was the third time the senate has voted on the issue since 
poison gas attacks by the iraqi army were reported in late august 
the senates third attempt to deal with the poison gas issue 
came on a bill far less sweeping than sanctions legislation 
originally adopted early in september the new senate bill closely 
follows the line of legislation adopted by the house and represents 
a compromise with three house committees 
it would impose two sanctions immediately they are 
a ban on the export of munitions and certain high technology 
items 
a requirement that the united states oppose loans to iraq by 
international financial institutions such as the world bank 
the bill requires president reagan to impose additional 
sanctions by the end of the year if iraq does not stop the use of 
chemical weapons and provide verifiable assurances it will not 
again use them 
the president is required to choose from a list of potential 
sanctions that include denying exportimport credits restricting 
imports from iraq expanding restrictions on exports to iraq and 
downgrading of diplomatic relations 
contracts entered into prior to the imposition of sanctions 
would be protected 
responding to the demands of senators representing farmers 
producing such crops as rice or wheat the legislation imposes no 
limitation on agricultural exports to iraq or the provision of 
credit or credit guarantees for agricultural purchases 
the concern is that this not lead to an embargo on 
agricultural exports to iraq said sen david pryor dark 
sen jesse helms rnc saying sanctions are fully justified 
by the horrifying acts of the iraqi government to systematically 
eliminate its own citizens 
the world cannot stand by in the face of repeated use of 
poison gas by iraq said sen albert gore dtenn 
but sen john heinz rpa complained that the measure unfairly 
penalized us manufacturers 
unilateral controls on us agriculture do not work and they 
dont work on medical equipment personal computers or machine 
tools heinz said adding that iraq would turn to other suppliers 
if us exports of those products were cut off 
theyre probably laughing at us in iraq right now heinz 
said declaring that the bill would not cut off the export to iraq 
of the equipment and chemicals needed to produce such chemical 
weapons as mustard gas and nerve gas 
it shoots american exporters in the foot and does not get to 
the root of the problem he said

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen took target practice at a police academy tuesday 
then turned his rhetorical fire on george bush accusing the 
republican of playing politics with the tragedies of crime 
bentsen watched a policedog demonstration and then picked up an 
ar15 rifle the civilian version of the military m16 the avid 
sportsman fired three times and left a tight cluster of holes in 
the silhouette targets chest 
asked if he were a quail hunter bentsen cracked jokes about 
quayle season starting around the first week of november 
ending nov 8 i plan on bagging a quayle that day at least he 
said referring to his gop vice presidential rival 
speaking afterward to the recruits at the allentown police 
academy bentsen said that while bush talked about fighting crime 
this administration has voted to either cut or do away with every 
federal assistance program for local law enforcement 
the democrats would add drug enforcement officers and us 
attorneys to prosecute cases against drug traffickers and put 
those fellows in the slammer where they belong he said 
later at a rally in a philadelphia union hall bentsen 
ridiculed bushs choice of dan quayle to head the drug interdiction 
effort in his administration 
george bush wants us to follow dan quayle into battle he 
said ill tell you ive been in combat and ill pass on that 
one 
if george bush is serious about being president why would he 
chose dan quayle for being vice president 
bush has repeatedly criticized dukakis in connection with a case 
in which a massachusetts inmate attacked a maryland couple after 
failing to return from a furlough that criticism is off target 
bentsen said 
when we get into the furlough program he said bush was 
playing politics with the tragedies of crime 
bentsen was highlighting the issues of drugs and crime areas 
where the democrats have suffered from republican attack on a 
oneday swing through eastern pennsylvania and nearby new jersey 
the democrats are trying to get off the defensive on those issues 
while dukakis has tightened up massachusetts furlough program 
which he inherited from the previous governor the federal 
government has had an extensive furlough system of its own and 
tragedies have occurred there also bentsen told the police 
recruits 
he said of the vice president he has to assume 
responsibility hes been the second man in command of the 
government 
earlier bentsen told high school students in blackwood nj 
that a democratic administration would separate the united states 
from panamanian gen manuel noriega 
you know that song breaking up is hard to do he said in 
response to a student question drawing giggles from the crowd 
well its not going to be hard to do for mike dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen 
what youve seen in george bush and noriega is kind of a 
shotgun wedding he said the democrats he said would initiate 
a very well publicized divorce from mr noriega 
while this administration has been talking illegal drugs have 
been flooding our country at a record rate he said in his speech 
at highland regional high school which he praised for declaring 
itself a drugfree zone 
asked about applying the death penalty to drug kingpins bentsen 
said well im one that favors it but i must say reasonable 
people can differ on that one dukakis opposes the death penalty 
one student noting talk about legalizing some drugs asked 
bentsen if he saw any positive angle in that approach 
no thats my answer he said i just think you shouldnt 
be able to go down to the grocery store and pick between the corn 
flakes and the oatmeal and find a package of drugs

are 96 active astronauts 
he said he decided monday to have his name taken off the flight 
list but it doesnt mean he is leaving nasa 
although he has not decided what he will do next he said 
possibilities include a different job at the national aeronautics 
and space administration or returning to the navy 
the other discovery astronauts pilot richard covey and mission 
specialists john m lounge david c hilmers and george d

most of the orings on both booster 
rockets from the space shuttle discovery have been examined and 
appear to be in excellent condition a morton thiokol inc official 
said tuesday 
a faulty oring was blamed for the jan 28 1986 explosion of 
the shuttle challenger and the deaths of all seven astronauts 
aboard 
engineers worked around the clock at cape canaveral to take 
apart the solid rocket motors that helped launch the discovery 
sept 29 said morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab 
they disassembled the joints and then they did a visual 
inspection of the orings raab said they looked for soot 
charring and there was none 
the seals might have been marred if gas from solid propellant 
burning inside the motors reached them but there was no evidence 
that hot gases reached any of the 24 orings that had been 
inspected as of tuesday raab said 
after separating from the shuttle two minutes into flight the 
boosters fell by parachute into the atlantic ocean and were towed 
to shore the next day

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
is calling on house speaker jim wright dtexas to unsnarl the 
legislative knot that has blocked passage of a bill granting banks 
new securities powers 
a bill relaxing most of the depressionera separation between 
commercial and investment banking passed the senate in march 
competing although more restrictive versions have cleared the 
energy and commerce and banking committees in the house 
however a jurisdictional battle between rep fernand j st 
germain dri chairman of the banking committee and rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce committee 
has dimmed hopes of passing a banking bill before congress adjourns 
for the fall election campaign 
according to a congressional aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity staff members from the banking and energy and commerce 
committees met tuesday but fundamental differences remain 
wright has taken the position that st germain and dingell must 
resolve their dispute themselves 
but greenspan told wright in a letter dated friday i am 
certain that those differences could be quickly resolved with the 
assistance of your leadership a copy of the letter was obtained 
tuesday 
greenspan said the legislation was of vital importance for 
the longterm strength stability and viability of the banking 
system and of great importance to the public because it will 
result in reduced cost and improved financial services 
in the senate banking committee chairman william proxmire 
dwis said tuesday he plans to move forward with his plan to 
attach the senate bankingsecurities bill to an unrelated banking 
bill that has already passed the house the idea is to give the 
house a way to act without sorting out its jurisdictional snarl 
however proxmire has been unable to get unanimous consent from 
all of the senates 99 other members for the move he could proceed 
without such an agreement but only at the risk of prolonged debate 
at a time when congress is trying to adjourn

the soviet union embraced the ecology 
movement on tuesday after years of indifference and declared 
protection of the environment second only to the need to prevent 
nuclear war 
deputy foreign minister vladimir f petrovsky also announced at 
a news conference devoted entirely to ecology that the soviet 
union two days ago ratified the 1987 montreal treaty on protecting 
the ozone layer 
petrovsky told reporters that life on earth transcended 
ideological differences 
he called for an environmental summit meeting of 15 to 20 top 
world leaders proposed a series of international meetings on the 
environment and said funds saved from disarmament should be used to 
upgrade the environment 
petrovsky said the soviet union would follow international laws 
and regulations concerning the environment including compensation 
that could be paid for environmental accidents like the chernobyl 
nuclear plant disaster 
moscow has seldom if ever before championed environmental 
causes and has been notably absent from joining international 
ecological decrees the soviets have been known more for exporting 
arms and building heavy often polluting industry in the third 
world 
now moscow says saving the amazon rain forests ending toxic 
waste dumping in africa and saving endangered species are high on 
its list of priorities 
the chernobyl disaster in 1986 awakened his government to the 
dangers of nuclear radiation and a broad policy debate was under 
way petrovsky said 
the pollution of lake baykal in asia and dangerous emissions by 
automobiles also were serious problems and would be addressed he 
said in answer to questions about what the soviet union would do in 
its own territory 
ensuring environmental security has become second only to 
eliminating the nuclear risk in the battle for the survival of 
mankind said petrovsky who is attending the 43rd general 
assembly 
his statement echoed the words of soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze who devoted more time to the environment than to 
disarmament in his recent speech to the assembly 
petrovsky called protection of the environment an example of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs new political thinking 
and an important part of a new comprehensive system of 
international peace and security 
he said that just as the world must transcend blocs and national 
politics to save the world from nuclear war so it also must 
address environmental problems on a global scale 
petrovsky said the biosphere does not accept discussion from 
strength division of the world into systems and blocs it 
transcends ideological differences 
he proposed an international environmental security fund 
channeling funds from phasedout or defunct military programs into 
ecological concerns he proposed the united nations play a larger 
role in safeguarding the environment and said an international 
mechanism must be created to work out solutions regarding urgent 
ecological problems 
petrovsky proposed three emergency meetings under un auspices 
in 1989 a meeting of international experts on the health of the 
earth 
in 1990 a meting of the top leaders of 15 to 20 nations 
representing all continents and the nonaligned movement 
a second un international conference on the environment to be 
attended by heads of state and government before the 1992 target 
date 
petrovsky also said the international community should adopt 
binding principles and rules of behavior he said these would 
include broad exchange of information on ecological questions 
mutual access to advanced technologies and strict accountability 
of states for their environmental protection activities and 
ecological accidents

the savannah river plant is moving ahead with 
plans to ship some of its radioactive waste to new mexico and a new 
federal report estimates environmental cleanup costs at the plant 
could reach 65 billion 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
said the savannah river plant and four other department of energy 
nuclear plants should be added to the national priority list which 
would mandate schedules for environmental cleanup 
one energy department plant lawrence livermore national 
laboratory in california is already on the list 
the list is corollary to a list of superfund projects that need 
quick cleanup federal plants are not eligible for superfund 
cleanups which are administered by the environmental protection 
agency 
the gao cites an energy department estimate of 285 million to 
clean up 69 waste sites at the savannah river plant but says 
recent information from the energy departments headquarters in 
washington indicates the total cleanup cost could be as high as 
65 billion 
energy department officials at savannah river and in washington 
said the cleanup would probably cost between 300 million and 400 
million unless the department is required to package hazardous 
waste there and remove it from the site 
the cost could then run in the billions of dollars they said 
for all waste sites at the six energy department plants the gao 
cited estimates of up to 60 billion 
the energy department released an environmental assessment 
report monday on a proposed transuranic waste facility at 
savannah river 
that facility would prepare savannah river waste for shipment 
starting next year to the departments waste isolation pilot plant 
near carlsbad nm 
the energy department report said the new mexico plant which 
has not yet begun receiving shipments would eventually remove a 
potential source of groundwater contamination from the plant 
thousands of cubic feet of stored waste containing elements 
heavier than uranium which are called transuranic 
plutonium manufactured at the plant for use in nuclear weapons 
is one example of a transuranic element 
in addition to the savannah river and livermore plants the gao 
named hanford reservation in washington idaho national engineering 
laboratory rocky flats plant in colorado and the y12 plant in 
tennessee as plants that should be added to the cleanup list 
environmental problems including contamination of groundwater 
with radioactive chemical and other hazardous substances were 
found at all six sites the gao said 
in some cases the contamination was detected at levels hundreds 
to thousands of times above federal drinking water standards

congress on tuesday completed final action on 
a bill to extend and tighten controls on clinical laboratories to 
make sure they are doing accurate and reliable testing work 
the senate approved the bill on a voice vote sending the 
measure to president reagan for his signature the house passed it 
last week 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee said the new law will set standards for 
virtually all labs and give the department of health and human 
services new enforcement tools 
the bill was prompted by reports of problems sometimes 
lifethreatening at unregulated labs doing shoddy work sponsors 
were particularly concerned about labs in doctors offices which 
had been exempt from existing federal regulation 
dingell said the new law will set strict standards for pap 
smears require dissemination of information on lab performance 
and set new civil and criminal penalties for labs that violate 
regulations a new and tougher method of evaluating lab performance 
would be instituted 
the bill also would strengthen federal oversight of the 
professional organizations that have been largely responsible for 
monitoring lab performance 
some flexibility would be given to labs that only perform tests 
in which erroneous results would not pose a significant risk to 
patients 
pap test regulations would include workload limits for those 
reading the slides improperly collected specimens would be 
returned to doctors and slides of women in highrisk groups would 
be rescreened before a diagnosis was made

the shutdown of plutonium processing at the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant because of a safety violation 
follows repeated complaints by workers citizens groups and the 
government that management had a cavalier attitude toward health 
and safety 
jim wilson who heads a stateappointed monitoring commission on 
radioactive waste at rocky flats called the shutdown saturday 
symbolic of the department of energys new attention to problems at 
the countrys aging nuclear weapons plants 
he gave the doe credit for taking the offensive 
tom rauch of citizens against rocky flats contamination a 
grassroots group formed last year to protest the proposed 
incineration of radioactive wastes at rocky flats saw the shutdown 
as a slap at plant management 
it simply confirms what many people have said all along that 
safety and health problems at the plant are greater than the doe 
and rockwell international corp which operates the plant have 
been willing to admit he said 
doe shut down the main plutonium processing room at rocky flats 
16 miles northwest of denver the plant which employs about 6000 
people uses highly radioactive plutonium to make triggers for 
nuclear weapons 
rockwell spokesman pat etchart said tuesday the closure of the 
processing room has had little effect on production at rocky flats 
we have 100 major buildings out here if this is shortterm 
it will have minimal effect on the plant operation if it is longer 
term yes it could significantly impact production efforts he 
said 
it was the second major suspension of nuclear weapons production 
in two months three reactors at the savannah river plant in south 
carolina were shut down in august because of safety concerns 
the doe has made no plans for either plant to reopen 
the shutdown in building 771 at rocky flats apparently stems 
from a sept 29 incident in which a rockwell supervisor and two 
employees entered a building without respirators because a warning 
sign was blocked from view 
richard w starostecki the deputy assistant energy secretary 
for safety health and quality assurance told a washington news 
conference that the decision to close the facility stemmed from an 
incident on sept 29 
a department inspector and two rockwell employees entered a room 
in which workers were cleaning up radioactive contamination but had 
not posted the required warning signs said starostecki 
the workers in the room were wearing protective clothing and 
masks but the inspector and the two rockwell employeers were not 
starostecki said two of them had positive nasal smears which 
means that there was some degree of contamination 
we do not view this as life threatening said starostecki 
we are trying to quantify the amount of material they might have 
breathed in 
rocky flats has been inspected by the doe three times since 
1986 the most recent doe report found pervasive inadequacies in 
worker protection fire protection maintenance and repeated 
failure by rockwell to address the departments previous concerns 
the large number of repeat concerns from previous technical 
safety appraisals of rocky flats facilities found in this appraisal 
raises questions regarding managements full commitment to andor 
involvement with safety the report said 
rockwell spokeswoman carol groves said tuesday the company had 
reemphasized safety in the past couple of months and had 
restructured some departments such as radiation monitoring to 
improve performance 
safety is the highest priority at this plant she said 
where there are safety problems management has to take 
responsibility its not that its lax but we can always stand 
improvement 
among other recent episodes in the plants troubled history are 
officials of the united steel workers local 8031 announced 
in march 1987 that safety complaints had jumped nearly sixfold in 
the previous five years 
a may 1987 doe report said workers at rocky flats were 
operating under questionable safety standards and were performing 
hazardous jobs without proper guidance the report capped a federal 
investigation into the death of a rocky flats electrician 
rockwell proposed a test burn of radioactive and chemical 
wastes at rocky flats in early 1987 mounting public opposition and 
a lawsuit filed by the sierra club and rauchs citizens group 
resulted in the doe shelving the burn pending an environmental 
assessment 
allegations that rocky flats employees operated a model 
shop there as a sideline and made 1 million worth of gadgets and 
trinkets over 17 years 
a feb 12 doe study found sloppy work habits faulty equipment 
and lax attitudes at the plant had created significant safety 
concerns 
in may the doe ripped rockwells management saying 
inattentiveness and disorganization had caused safety problems 
in late may radioactive and hazardous material spilled from 
several defective concrete containers which had deteriorated to the 
consistency of mayonnaise state health officials said 
in june rockwell was fined for safety violations including 
failure to report fires and improper handling of stored waste 
in june epa reported 103 past waste disposal areas at rocky 
flats that needed to be cleaned up a doe study in july found the 
government would have to spend more than 900 million there by 1995 
to comply with safety and health laws and clean up pollution 
on july 22 12 cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive waste 
spilled but plant officials waited a week before reporting it 
in august it was revealed that doe officials earlier had 
considered shutting down the plant entirely because of repeated 
safety violations and because of rockwells managers and 
employees lax attitudes

a prosecutor said tuesday he will file 
suit against a black teenager and her three advisers who falsely 
accused him of involvement in an alleged sexual assault against her 
steven pagones a dutchess county assistant district attorney 
was cleared by a grand jury of accusations he sexually attacked 
tawana brawley 16 formerly of nearby wappingers falls 
the grand jury concluded miss brawley made up her story she was 
attacked by six white men last year the girls advisers without 
offering evidence had accused pagones of being one of the 
attackers 
pagones said lawyers are preparing a lawsuit that will be filed 
within a month against miss brawley the rev al sharpton and 
attorneys c vernon mason and alton maddox jr 
pagones had harsh words for the brawley advisers labeling their 
verbal attacks as blatant disgusting and deplorable lies 
miss brawley who never cooperated with the grand jury during 
its sevenmonth investigation was found in wappingers falls last 
nov 28 smeared with dog feces and with racial slurs scrawled on 
her body wappingers falls is about 70 miles north of new york city 
pagones announced the lawsuit at a news conference which 
sharpton tried to interrupt by shouting through a hotel doorway 
im here pagones your accusers here why dont you give me the 
papers 
a hotel employee closed the door on sharpton and held it closed 
for the rest of the news conference 
hayes would not say how much the lawsuit would be for only that 
it would be millions of dollars 
pagones said he will also file a grievance against mason and 
maddox and will seek discipline against the two lawyers for 
knowingly making false statements of law and fact 
i feel they should be disbarred he said 
last week state attorney general robert abrams announced that 
he asked for investigations of the lawyers for possible 
disciplinary action 
miss brawley denounced the grand jurys report as did sharpton 
mason and maddox 
during the grand jury investigation pagones was questioned 
about a friend of his harry crist jr a parttime fishkill 
policeman who committed suicide three days after miss brawley was 
found 
glenda brawley tawanas mother raised questions about crists 
possible involvement in her daughters alleged attack but crist 
was also cleared by the grand jury 
during the grand jury investigation pagones testified that he 
and crist were at a connecticut shopping mall the day miss brawley 
was found 
they have made the past six months a living hell for the 
parents and family of harry crist pagones said 
he also criticized the media calling it the life support 
system for sharpton maddox and mason 
this charade will not end until the media ends it he said

moslem legislators on tuesday called for 
a prompt presidential election echoing a group of christian 
lawmakers and raising hopes of ending a major constitutional crisis 
the 16 prosyrian members of parliament also rejected any kind 
of partition and ruled out the rehabilitation of an estimated 
500000 palestinians in south lebanon 
in a statement the group urged speedy and strong efforts to 
break the presidential election deadlock and overcome the obstacles 
and hardships that still prevail 
a similar call was made monday by 29 christian deputies who said 
they had authorized patriarch nasrallah sfeir head of the dominant 
maronite catholic community to negotiate with rival moslems to 
elect a new head of state 
the political crisis was triggered after parliament failed three 
times to elect a successor to president amin gemayel before his 
6year term expired sept 23 the christians boycotted all three 
sessions of parliament prompted by syrian efforts to promote an 
ally for president 
the power vaccuum resulted in two interim governments one 
christian one moslem each claiming legitimacy 
the christian deputies said the new presidents mandate should 
reject all forms of partition and rehabilitation 
both groups of lawmakers stressed that the presidential vote 
should take place before oct 18 when parliament speaker hussein 
husseinis term runs out 
between them the moslem and christian legislators total 45 
only six short of the quorum needed to hold an electoral session of 
parliament 
parliament has 99 seats but there are only 76 members still 
alive after 13 years of civil war 
there have been no parliamentary elections since 1972 and the 
house has repeatedly renewed its mandate since then 
the statements by the two groups suggested that they may be 
ready to seek a compromise candidate for president provided that 
syria the main power broker in lebanon responds favorably 
if a president and speaker are not elected soon parliament is 
likely to disintegrate and the de facto partition of this 
mediterranean country would be likely be formalized 
parliament has not convened since aug 18 
syria which supports the moslems and their leftist allies has 
been pressing for the election of either expresident suleiman 
franjieh a 78yearold christian warlord closely allied with 
damascus or prosyrian deputy mikhail daher 58 also a christian 
rightwing christians have vetoed both candidates claiming they 
are too heavily committed to the syrians who maintain 40000 
troops in north and east lebanon and beiruts moslem sector 
under an unwritten covenant dating from 1943 when lebanon gained 
independence from france maronites have held the posts of 
president army commander and central bank governor 
the prime minister hs traditionally been a sunni and the 
parliament speaker a shiite

cream parlor tuesday and opened fire killing an offduty policeman 
and injuring a man and a woman police reported 
the attack occurred an hour after two shots were fired at a 
british army foot patrol in the predominantly catholic lenadoon 
area of west belfast the soldiers returned one shot nobody was 
reported injured in that incident 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the policemans 
death but suspicion inevitably fell on the outlawed irish 
republican army fighting to end british rule in northern ireland 
none of the victims was immediately identified there was no 
indication whether the gunmen targeted the man and woman or whether 
they were shot accidentally 
a press officer at belfast police headquarters who in 
accordance with british practice spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the lives of the two injured people were not in danger 
the ice cream parlor is off lisburn road a main traffic artery 
in south belfast where sectarian divides are not as strictly 
observed as in other parts of the city 
the death of the policeman brings to at least 2700 the death 
toll since sectarian and political violence flared in northern 
ireland 20 years ago 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of 
ireland under socialist rule

spokesman who demanded anonymity said of mrs nadgorny 
baker subsequently asked yuri marchuk president of the soviet 
academy of sciences to press emigration authorities for all nine 
refuseniks to receive travel documents 
i am delighted they the nadgornys are to be allowed to 
emigrate it is marvelous news baker said tuesday on the first 
day of the ruling conservative party conference in brighton 50 
miles south of london 
i hope now that two have come that others might also get 
permission to leave he said 
refusenik is the name given to people who have applied for 
permission to emigrate from the soviet union and been denied 
nadgorny lost his job as a physicist shortly after he and his 
wife applied for emigration visas in 1981 the applications were 
denied on grounds that they held information vital to the soviet 
union 
the couple staged hunger strikes to protest the refusal but 
were again denied permission to leave earlier this year to join 
their 26yearold son boris a scientist at princeton university 
in new jersey 
in a telephone interview with the british domestic news agency 
press association nadgorny thanked baker for speaking to the 
soviet authorities 
my wife and i kissed each other when the visa department 
told them their official exit papers would be ready within two or 
three weeks nadgorny was quoted as saying 
we want to leave here as soon as possible he was quoted as 
saying we hope it will be before the new year 
they expect to join their son before deciding where to settle 
nadgorny said 
some of nadgornys writings have been smuggled out of the soviet 
union and published in britain mrs nadgorny is a leader of the 
refusenik pressure group women in refusal and serves as a 
correspondent for the londonbased weekly jewish chronicle 
newspaper

a cuban gunboat seized a 156foot supply ship 
carrying new zealands entry in the americas cup race and detained 
eight united states citizens tuesday the coast guard said 
the tampa sea horse a new orleansbased ship was sailing about 
12 miles off the southeastern tip of cuba when the gunboat 
approached and seized the ship said coast guard spokesman dan 
vogeley 
the ships agent zapata marine of new orleans later told the 
coast guard in miami that the americas cup entry the new zealand 
was aboard the ship which was en route from long beach calif to 
new york city 
there were no reports of shots fired or use of force and the 
ship and crew were taken without further incident to cayo mola 
cuba vogeley said 
the master of the ship disputed the cuban navys claim that the 
vessel was inside the island nations 12mile territorial waters 
limit and placed an urgent call to the coast guard at about 3 pm 
edt coast guard officers advised the master to comply vogeley 
said 
lowell oswald spokesman for zapata marine said he doesnt know 
why the ship was seized but insisted it was in international waters 
were at as much of a loss as anyone else he said 
he estimated the tampa sea horses value at 3 million but said 
he didnt know what the sailing vessel was worth 
hopefully theyll let us go tonight and theyll keep going to 
new york he said theres no way to really tell 
the ship was escorted to the port for inspection purposes 
said maggie kerrigan a spokeswoman at the new zealand consulate in 
los angeles 
the passenger list supplied to the coast guard by zapata listed 
all eight on board as americans but kerrigan said one new 
zealander also was on ship 
we feel that after a brief inspection they will probably be 
released said us state department press officer ben justesen 
in washington dc 
if the crew is detained for an extended period the state 
department would seek counselor access to the crew through the us 
diplomatic mission in havana he said 
kerrigan said new zealand officials have asked the state 
department and coast guard to help gain the vessels release 
they are confident of no significant delay in winning 
release of both vessels said kerrigan 
we understand this type of incident has on occasion occurred 
in the past with us ships sailing through the passage between 
cuba and the dominican republic kerrigan said 
the chairman of the new zealand challenge michael fay was not 
aboard the ship fay forced the san diego yacht club into an early 
defense of the cup this year after winning a court order that 
validated his challenge of the race rules 
the sloop fay used in the race was twice as long as the 
traditional 12meter yachts used in cup competitions the san diego 
yacht club responded by building a dualhulled catamaran to defend 
the cup and dennis conner skippered the stars amp stripes to two 
easy victories over the kiwis to sweep a bestofthree series 
a catamaran had never before been used in the 137year history 
of the cup 
fay is planning to return to the new york court holding 
jurisdiction over americas cup disputes to seek forfeiture of the 
cup on grounds that the san diego yacht club used an allegedly 
illegal defender

argonne national laboratory has sold a process 
that could dramatically reduce pollution from coalfire power 
plants to a pennsylvania company lab officials said tuesday 
the buyer dravo lime co of pittsburgh which makes chemicals 
for smokestack scrubbers is betting that tighter acidrain 
controls will make the deal a profitable one 
officials say the process can be used with existing equipment to 
reduce by 70 percent a plants output of nitrogen oxide believed 
along with sulfur oxides to be a major cause of acid rain 
the driving force on all this is the potential of new 
legislation on acid rain said david livengood an argonne 
researcher who managed the project 
acid rain formed when the sulfur and nitrogen gases combine 
with the air to form acids is believed to cause widespread damage 
to forests and lakes 
the new process called argonox involves spraying water mixed 
with substances called metal chelates into a chamber through 
which coal smoke must pass the metal chelates then combine with 
nitrogen to form a solid substance that can be removed from the 
chamber and hauled away 
dravo says the new technology will pay for itself because power 
plants seeking to comply with tougher acidrain laws will prefer 
the argonox system which can be fitted to existing scrubbers to 
other methods requiring costly equipment changes 
scrubbers which use lime to remove sulfur oxides from coal 
smoke have been installed at many power plants and other 
industries 
dravo spokesman ron sommer said the company expected to have a 
pilot project installed at the miami fort power plant near 
cincinnati sometime in the next year 
dravo bought the process from argonne a department of energy 
lab in suburban lemont operated by the university of chicago as 
part of a program encouraging the sale of the fruits of government 
research to private industry

iranians involved in the irancontra affair 
thought george bush was the most powerful man in the world and 
the person pulling the strings from behind the scenes according to 
a new book 
the book is written by michael a ledeen a former consultant to 
the national security council who played a role in the earliest 
stages of the affair he says the iranians overestimated bushs

cia which they considered to be the root of ultimate power in the 
united states 
ledeen says his book is an attempt to shed light on how the 
irancontra affair happened and set the record straight about 
myself and my role in the affair

at one point in a perfect spy british 
intelligence officer magnus pym is told by axel his symbiotic 
partner in eastwest espionage you are a perfect spy all you 
need is a cause i have one 
pym rejects axels attempt to recruit him ideologically for 
him the game is career enhancement and the thrill of the scam 
but pyms search for an inner cause is a continuing theme in john 
le carres best seller which was also a thinly veiled account of 
the authors relationship with his reallife father 
the best seller is brought to the screen with perfection in the 
sevenpart bbc series that can be see on pbs beginning sunday one 
hour a week 
this intricate and moody piece owes its success to screenwriter 
arthur hopcrafts adaptation of the book the novel began with 
pyms disappearance from his post in vienna then alternately told 
of his earlier life and of his british superiors efforts to locate 
him 
hopcraft who previously adapted le carres tinker tailor 
soldier spy also for the bbc tells pyms life in 
straightforward chronological order but instead of 
oversimplifying the tale his script combined with peter smiths 
direction draws the viewer into the story so prepare to be hooked 
ray mcanally is superb as rick pym the con man based on le 
carres father ronnie cornwell le carres real name is david 
cornwell peter egan is the adult magnus rudiger weigang an 
excellent german actor plays axel alan howard is jack 
brotherhood the british agent who recruits magnus jane booker 
plays mary magnus perfect diplomatic wife peggy ashcroft is miss 
dubber the keeper of the seaside boarding house where pym goes to 
hide 
the miniseries begins with magnus as a young boy played by 
twins nicholas and jonathan haley watching his beloved father 
hauled away by the police for embezzlement his delicate mother 
cracks under the strain and is also taken away to a mental 
institution magnus father later rescues him from a stern uncle 
and begins his education in deception 
benedict taylor plays the collegeage magnus who fumbles his 
fathers assignment to travel to switzerland and fleece a 
baroness who turns out to be the superior con artist rather 
than return and face his father magnus enrolls in a swiss college 
it is there he meets axel a leftwing czech poet and encounters 
brotherhood and is recruited by british intelligence 
eventually pym is drawn into an arrangement with axel that has 
him bargaining with his own countrys secrets together he and axel 
conspire to get themselves posted to the disneyland of spydom 
america 
continually surfacing is rick pym the ultimate charmer who 
cons his son along with the other pigeons imbuing him with the 
need to always go for the one last swindle that will see you 
right 
in a 1986 article in the london sunday times le carre described 
the emotions that led him to write an account of his late fathers 
life albeit as part of a fictional spy story 
so what broke the code for me what enabled me to write about 
ronnie at last in part it was the sheer effort of thinking about 
him for so long had i loved him or hated him it no longer 
mattered i had done both so amply that the distinctions had 
disappeared and with them any thought of judgment 
i had fled from his delusions only to find them reproduced all 
around me in the sleeping castles of secret england where i had 
taken refuge i had met bigger wreckers than ronnie bigger 
hypocrites and bigger liars dressed in the trappings of high 
office and still rising with indexlinked pensions and knighthoods 
to take them into old age the difference was they lied out of 
obedience to some illperceived higher cause and did their 
wrecking in the name of service

in offering a homebuying program gov michael 
dukakis has focused on an issue that conceivably could be decisive 
in how certain groups vote 
among them are voters in the 20 to 40year age brackets and 
young singles and couples who want to own but rent instead because 
they cannot afford the down payments 
it is an allamerican issue along with flag and parenthood 
intertwined with ideals americans admire including individualism 
independence freedom security wholesome family life and success 
but if it is an allamerican goal it is a faltering one home 
ownership isnt what it used to be after climbing from 436 
percent in 1940 to 658 percent in the third quarter of 1985 it 
now rests at 637 percent 
the full significance of those numbers isnt apparent however 
until the breakdown is analyzed then it is found that the most 
pronounced decline in home ownership is concentrated in the younger 
households 
in some respects the figures suggest a growing split between 
the haves and the havenots the former being the older households 
who got into the market before the big price increases and the 
younger households who are shut out 
among the haves there is no group with a higher rate of home 
ownership 807 percent than those aged 60 to 64 but every 
fiveyear age group from 40 years to 75 years and older has an 
ownership rate in excess of 70 percent 
now the contrast among those in the 2529 age group only 363 
percent owned homes in the first quarter of 1988 according to the 
national association of home builders 
confronted with those numbers some older homeowners contend 
that younger people should not expect to own houses often adding 
that young folks today do not understand patience let them save 
for it like i did they say 
but the fact is that it was easier for a young couple to buy a 
house 15 years ago throughout the 1970s the ownership rate in the 
2529 age group was regularly near or above 40 percent annual 
declines were unknown 
since 1981 the ownership rate in that age group has declined 
every year but 1984 and that exception was only by a small 
fraction of a percent 
in the age 3034 category there has also been a sharp decline 
from 626 percent in 1978 to 528 percent in 1988s first quarter 
cold figures describe a hot issue 
for one thing it is households in these age categories that are 
most often used to illustrate the american dream of happy 
homeownership the sense of denial therefore is enhanced by daily 
repetition of what might have been 
the havenots pay rent instead and rents sometimes take a huge 
toll on savings a report by the joint center for housing studies 
of harvard university notes that many households pay rent equal to 
30 percent or even 50 percent of income 
the obvious consequence one shared by the center is that 
money spent on rent depletes savings that otherwise could have gone 
toward the purchase of a home meanwhile home prices rise 
demolishing the dream 
among the proposals made by dukakis would be a major change in 
individual retirement accounts to allow firsttime homebuyers to 
use such funds in meeting down payments 
at present ira funds accumulating free of annual taxes cannot 
be used before the year in which a person turns 59 years except 
by paying stiff financial penalties thus they are almost useless 
to firsttime buyers 
while those same funds cannot be invested in housing because 
housing oddly does not qualify as an investment for the 
future they can be left in stocks bonds and a variety of 
securites even speculations 
those who believe iras can be made more versatile ask 
therefore why such funds cannot be used in housing which has been 
perhaps the best longterm investment of all not just for future 
retirement but for present living

steven levys book is about a hippielike new 
age guru who allegedly killed his girlfriend and stuffed her in a 
trunk teresa carpenters book is about a professor who battered 
his prostitutemistress 
when this husband and wife dine at night does mayhem mingle 
with the meatloaf not necessarily they say 
it would be wrong to suggest our conversations were 
excessively morbid they dont tend to be morose says levy 
but carpenter quickly adds we could swap forensic stories and 
i could tell him who he should talk to in the fbi 
for three years levy 37 and carpenter 40 worked separately 
but simultaneously on these two accounts of similarly repulsive 
crimes 
the experience of both writing at the same time turned out quite 
well carpenter said during a recent interview at the couples 
fifth avenue apartment a welllighted bookfilled home 
in his book the unicorns secret murder in the age of 
aquarius to be published this month by prentice hall press 
levy examined the bizarre case of ira einhorn philadelphias 
enigmatic peaceandlove freak and parapsychology crusader who was 
charged in 1979 with killing his girlfriend holly maddux eighteen 
months after maddux was last seen alive her decomposed mummified 
body was found in a locked trunk in their apartment 
einhorn known about town as the unicorn shrugged off the 
allegations and accused the cia and others of planting evidence in 
his home but he skipped bail before trial he remains a fugitive 
likely living in europe 
carpenters book missing beauty published in june by ww 
norton is the story of what led tufts university medical 
researcher william douglas in 1983 to smash the skull of robin 
benedict the highpriced boston prostitute with whom hed fallen 
insanely in love 
even though the essentials of the stories are similar both 
victims were women trying to extract themselves from relationships 
with obsessively possessive men the two men could not be more 
unalike 
the unicorn was a brilliant and charismatic bear of a figure a 
ladies man extraordinaire and counterculture oddball given to such 
benign weirdness as answering his door stark naked though he 
dressed in a dashiki and dirty jeans sported a full beard and 
shoulderlength hair and frequently smelled bad einhorn 
established an incredible global network of scientists corporate 
sponsors and wealthy benefactors 
ira was the epitome of the guy who worked in fringe circles 
was antiestablishment and still looked like a hippie when he was 
almost 40 says levy douglas was this traditional respected 
man 
superficially douglas did appear to lead a normal life he was 
a solidly middleclass family man with three children an eminent 
medical school professor and acknowledged expert in cell culture 
everything about him was so normal so stultifyingly normal 
he was a man who one would never imagine could have gotten 
himself into a situation like this carpenter said 
but then there was that other side sufficiently dark private 
and perverse to fascinate the pulitzer prizewinning reporter for 
four years carpenter received the award in 1981 for her crime 
coverage for the village voice 
here was a scientist who had been embezzling research funds to 
support a mistress who happened to be a hooker he was living a 
double life thats what hooked me she said 
researching her book carpenter spent weeks walking the streets 
and hanging out in the bars and strip joints of the combat zone 
the netherworld that is bostons redlight district talking to 
bartenders pimps whores and strippers who knew douglas young 
victim 
that was very difficult for me im not a street person and 
never dared pose as one she said 
while carpenter was exploring the gamy depths levy was having 
anxieties of his own as he waited for her nightly call from boston 
assuring him that she was safe 
i wasnt happy about it but this is what teresa does its 
important for her to do the story right levy said 
missing beauty is carpenters first book but she was 
already a respected master of crime stories she had reported on 
the killings of playmate dorothy stratton and politician allard 
lowenstein 
the unicorns secret is levys first major excursion into 
the genre his other book hackers is about the personal 
computer revolution levy is a freelance writer and contributing 
editor for rolling stone 
so what is the allure of the macabre 
says levy when something happens it gives you a window into 
the way people live the way people are its like an 
archaeological dig like if someone unearths a civilization frozen 
by a volcano or something thats what a murder does it freezes 
details of our lives

for forest whitaker playing charlie parker 
didnt just mean looking or sounding like the great jazzman it 
meant making sure everything fit 
i was nervous i was scared admitted whitaker who stars in 
bird clint eastwoods critically acclaimed film biography of 
the late jazz saxophonist 
i was going into areas i hadnt really dealt with it was a 
most challenging role as a person i felt really honored to bring 
the character to life it was so fortunate that it happened 
parker who died in 1955 when he was just 34 moved into musical 
areas that few touched with such musicians as dizzy gillespie he 
revolutionized jazz in the 1940s helping create the style called 
bebop a brilliant and troubled man he was no less overwhelming 
as a person 
i think he embraced life whitaker said he took whatever 
pleasure he could find in it he wasnt afraid to do that it held 
a lot of bad consequences for him but he did that and thats where 
he hurt himself 
where parker primarily hurt himself was by a heroin addiction 
that plagued him for much of his life 
he was trapped and he started very young whitaker said i 
think it has to do with his particular way of life he was very 
sensitive about a lot of things i think he knew it was destroying 
him he didnt want other people using it 
whitaker awarded this years prize for best actor at the cannes 
film festival gives a performance that should get academy notice 
he was born in longview texas and grew up in los angeles he 
attended the university of southern california and originally 
studied opera but he became interested in acting and began 
appearing in local equity productions his involvement with movies 
came later 
i was probably going to go to new york and work on stage and 
that was it whitaker said in an interview it just so happens 
i was working on a play and it turned into an opportunity to do a 
film 
whitaker beat paul newman at pool in the color of money and 
played robin williams protege in good morning vietnam he has 
been directed by martin scorcese oliver stone and eastwood 
they all have a very keen sense of focus although their 
focuses are different some go out in a circle and encompass 
everything some just focus on this little tiny thing 
whitaker had not even met eastwood when he was given the part 
i didnt know he had any interest in jazz whatsoever i didnt 
have any preconceived ideas about him i never expected to see 
dirty harry walk into that meeting he turned out to be a real jazz 
aficionado and really easy to work for 
whitaker is something of a rarity in hollywood a successful 
black actor he had always been aware of the difficulties in 
getting good parts but was not deterred from going into films 
im fortunate because i never wanted to do film im real 
fortunate that i never really thought about it that fear wasnt 
there because there wasnt a great need at first he said a 
lot of the roles ive played have not been written for black 
actors 
as part of his research for bird whitaker talked to those 
who knew parker including the jazzmans wife chan he discovered 
that no one really knew parker 
it seemed they didnt know what was going on with him that 
helped me immensely to understand where he was coming from 
whitaker said 
what did he really say to them what did they really know 
about his fears how he felt about this when they told me what 
they knew it was more important what they didnt know someone 
would say he had no fear and that would tell me how much they 
knew 
parker was true to the spirit of his music spontaneous and 
emotional given to extreme highs and lows understandably 
whitaker was drained by the effort to sustain those feelings 
there are scenes in the latter part of his life when hes 
closer to death when hes lost almost everything hes walking 
around like a lost soul the only thing thats moving him around is 
a little pilot light the actor said 
that was difficult to understand trying to find that place 
where youre still alive but you have nothing left 
but how well could anyone really understand parker bird has 
disentegrated into pure sound a musician once said was parker 
beyond words 
he was pushing towards sound whitaker said the sound was 
totally coming from emotion more than words can express i think 
that was something he felt understood and put in his music 
but whitaker believes he shares an important philosophical goal 
with parker 
i think he had a quest for understanding openness i believe 
i have that trying to figure that stuff out being open to all 
kinds of different things

life comes to a near standstill monday 
nights as millions of egyptians sit riveted before their television 
sets to watch angela channings melodramatic malevolence on 
falcon crest 
however jane wymans character and the others in the series 
have few counterparts in egyptian society even the setting a 
winery in a napa valleylike area of california might have 
alienated many egyptian moslems taught by islams holy book the 
koran to abstain from alcohol 
yet the show is a fabulous hit 
egypt has nothing similar to the nielson ratings to gauge 
exactly how popular it is but sohair eletriby head of egyptian 
televisions second channel which airs the series has no doubts 
egyptians have become addicted to falcon crest she said 
theyve become very attached to it 
whether rich and educated or poor peasants reading arabic 
subtitles on the screen falcon crest fanatics consider the 
characters a part of their extended families their fortunes and 
disasters are eagerly followed and discussed everywhere 
the american series also has proved lucrative for stateowned 
egyptian television channel two buys an episode for around 1000 
and on a recent monday sales of commercials brought in almost 20 
times that 
angela channing the scheming matriarch of the falcon crest 
brood ruthless but charming richard channing and dedicated and 
romantic if somewhat naive maggie are among the main characters 
in the colorful series that depicts love hate and events both foul 
and fair 
early episodes of falcon crest began appearing on egyptian 
screens several years ago because of finances egyptian television 
bought only a few 26episode seasons at a time showing them daily 
and then stopping for months until money was found for succeeding 
episodes 
despite the gaps in transmission falcon crest fans remained 
true and for two consecutive months last summer the fifth and 
sixth seasons were aired every night from 915 pm to 10 pm 
the show was so popular that all over cairo appointments were 
made before or after falcon crest tv parties with friends were 
common and cairos congested streets emptied as each episode was 
shown 
at the end of august eletreby changed the schedule showing 
two episodes every monday night she said her office immediately 
was swamped with hundreds of calls and letters demanding that the 
series be shown daily again 
i had only a few episodes from the seventh part and the 
eighth is now running in the united states she said in an 
interview either i could have stopped it for several months and 
then shown the seventh part in its entirety or i could have shown 
it once a week like television in america and europe do all the 
time 
falcon crest isnt the first american tv series to make a 
big splash with egyptian viewers in the 1960s and 70s peyton 
place and rich man poor man were favorites 
in 1982 egyptian television began showing dallas which 
quickly became almost as popular as falcon crest would become 
later dallas was stopped however after a member of 
parliament complained that it was corrupting the morals of egyptian 
youth 
the morality of falcon crest would not seem to be much 
different with angelas scheming against her own son and the 
characters frequent exchanges of bed partners 
but the serial has escaped unscathed so far except for egyptian 
televisions routine censorship which unskillfully scissors about 
five minutes of what the censors consider passionate lovemaking 
from each 50minute episode 
so falcon crest giving egyptians a glimpse of a completely 
different and glittering world easily captures its audience 
viewers have different reasons for appreciating the series 
i like watching it because the men and women are so beautiful 
wearing lovely clothes and living in beautiful houses said 
fawziya ahmed a peasant from a small village north of cairo in the 
nile delta 
christiane latif who helps run a familyowned marble factory 
said the characters are interesting and become like your family 
and the plot makes you want to know what will happen next i try 
not to miss any of the shows 
such sentiments arent universal however 
one government official who declined to be identified said he 
finds nothing special about falcon crest he complained that his 
wife and 5yearold daughter cannot be distracted from the screen 
when the show was on 
and some americans worry that egyptians might think all 
americans are the glittery hollywood types of falcon crest

the outcome of closely fought 
presidential races in texas and california may hinge on whether 
george bush or michael dukakis captures the hispanic vote but both 
candidates seem surprisingly inept in pursuing this fastgrowing 
electorate 
although the democratic nominee speaks spanish the dukakis 
campaign only recently has begun scrambling to deal with what some 
observers say is a dangerous lack of local organizing and his 
halfhearted postprimary courting of hispanics in california 
at this moment it the hispanic vote is in jeopardy said 
ruben bonilla director of the mexicanamerican democratic 
political action committee there are certain things that need to 
be done and were in danger of running out of time 
at the same time bushs own hispanic initiative hasnt lived up 
to his republican supporters expectations and has been weakened 
by highly publicized comments by the vice president that some 
hispanic leaders found offensive 
everyones angry the latino democrats and republicans 
said richard santillan a professor at california state polytechnic 
university at pomona 
both campaigns are doing the same thing taking the hispanic 
vote for granted he said 
at stake in the hispanic community ironically are enough votes 
to tip the balance of victory in a close contest 
in the past 12 years rapid population growth and massive voter 
registration efforts have nearly tripled the number of eligible 
hispanic voters more than half of all hispanics live in 
california texas and new mexico which together carry 81 electoral 
votes or 30 percent of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the 
presidency 
pollsters say the presidential races in california and perhaps 
in texas may come down to margins of about 100000 votes either 
way hispanic groups have registered 100000 new voters in 
california and 70000 in texas this year 
hispanics already are credited with providing victory margins 
for sen alan cranston dcalif in 1986 and for dukakis on the 
super tuesday primary in texas 
but to provide the margin of victory over bush who leads in 
most polls analysts say dukakis would have to win upwards of 75 
percent of a large hispanic turnout bush is seeking at least 
onethird of the vote or else a low turnout 
hispanics traditionally have low turnout rates in presidential 
elections excitement about dukakis and the prospect of helping to 
decide a close race led experts to predict record numbers of 
hispanics casting ballots on nov 8 
those predictions may now be in doubt in poorer hispanic 
neighborhoods which usually are democratic strongholds the key to 
winning is effective doortodoor campaigning highprofile rallies 
and workable getoutthevote machinery there also must be a close 
race where hispanics believe their votes can make a difference 
the burden really is on dukakis to convince people and for 
his machine to get people to come out and vote said cal techs 
santillan an expert on voting trends and ethnic studies i dont 
know if hes been able to do that 
said richard martinez california director of the nonpartisan 
southwest voter registration education project 
the longer they wait the more options they cut off the key 
for the democrats is are you going to be smart enough to make the 
investment and get out that 75 percent you need are you going to 
play your hispanic card 
bush has tried to corral hispanic voters by stressing his stands 
for a strong military and against abortion and crime and pointing 
to the reagan administrations new hispanic education secretary 
lauro cavazos 
the vice president is targeting middleclass neighborhoods which 
are more likely to vote republican 
bushs efforts have been hampered by several incidents that many 
hispanics regard as mistakes one was when he referred to his 
hispanic grandchildren as the little brown ones 
another was when he told students at an east los angeles high 
school renowned for its high rate of collegebound graduates that 
you dont have to go to college to be a success we need those 
people who build our buildings who send them soaring into the 
sky 
dukakis hasnt campaigned in the hispanic stronghold of south 
texas since july bonilla and other south texas leaders complain 
they dont have access to the massachusetts governors top 
advisers who dont understand the hispanic community even though 
they cast their whole fortunes in texas with the hispanic 
community 
in california campaigning was so laggardly that a group of 
local elected officials who support dukakis demanded a meeting with 
his state campaign officials to plead for action result an 
immediate bolstering of the campaign staff in the primary hispanic 
battleground in east los angeles 
we stepped in and said if youre committed to more than a 
symbolic hispanic campaign then you should have in place a strong 
getoutthevote effort said los angeles city councilwoman 
gloria molina 
in other areas i think it may only be a superficial 
campaign she said in our area we stepped in theres still 
time for the dukakis campaign to put that network in place 
dukakis met privately with about two dozen texas hispanic 
leaders during a late september trip to dallas four days later 
bonilla was contacted to tape hispanic radio ads for the democratic 
nominee 
richard ybarra chief of hispanic strategy for the dukakis 
campaign said he is counting on local leaders to energize their 
communities because dukakis cannot appear everywhere at once 
he has to go to places targeted for improvement ybarra 
said its up to us to get our job done well be spending more 
advertising money in the hispanic community than our party has ever 
before and it will be more effective than ever before 
some prominent hispanic leaders like mayor henry cisneros of 
san antonio texas are campaigning hard as dukakis surrogates 
i see a lot of excitement the mayor said people have 
been out of power long enough now and they sense that this 
election makes a difference 
doortodoor voter registration and leafleting is more intense 
than ever in some communities notably san antonio 
dukakis aides say running mate sen lloyd bentsen a native of 
south texas who is popular among hispanics gives the campaign a 
logistical and emotional boost in texas 
observers say some of the complaints may stem from dukakis 
showing in public opinion polls which place him as much as 10 
percentage points behind bush in texas the vice presidents 
adopted home state and slightly behind in california 
whoever wins and whatever role hispanics play local organizers 
say the campaign has been good for hispanics emergence as a 
political power 
the southwest voter registration and education project will have 
its most productive voter registration drive in any presidential 
election year since it was founded in 1974 said director andy 
hernandez 
i think the fact that so much attention has been paid to the 
hispanic vote has tended to create more momentum hernandez said 
i think it is watershed election for us from now on no one 
can think about winning the presidency or the governorship without 
hispanics being a critical element in there he said 
the fact is we are now part of the equation even before the 
election takes place weve already arrived

drought may have slowed a longawaited 
rebound in farm equipment sales but manufacturers say they believe 
demand will rise in 1989 as farmers are expected to significantly 
step up planting 
the size and condition of an aging fleet of farm equipment may 
not be adequate to handle 25 million or more additional acres of 
crops anticipated next spring said john tye president of the tye 
co and newly elected chairman of the farm and industrial equipment 
institute 
this factor combined with the fact that many farmers who will 
be handling the increased production are more secure financially 
than a year ago should stimulate demand tye said 
tye said the government has agreed to allow farmers to 
substantially increase 1989 plantings without jeopardizing their 
federal subsidies he said such increased activity would come at a 
time industry inventories are at the lowest levels in years and 
the fleet of machines in use has the highest average age in two 
decades 
the comments came in assessments released at the annual 
convention of the equipment manufacturers which ends today in boca 
raton fla and distributed by the chicagobased group 
hans w becherer president of deere amp co said he believes 
farmers deferred purchases this year and are awaiting signs 
therell be no repeat of this summers drought 
he noted record levels of farm income in 1987 and 1988 and said 
that should boost sales in 1989 
farmers overall are in a better financial situation than 
they have been for many years the need for new equipment is there 
if the weather cooperates 1989 could be a very good year said 
bernard l nielsen president of the gehl co 
the drought hit the farm equipment industry just as it was 
making headway in a recovery from a severe slump 
after seven years of decline spending on farm machinery rose to 
577 billion in 1987 from 461 billion in 1986 according to the 
economic research service of the us department of agriculture 
that still was below the record of nearly 12 billion in sales in 
1979 
the usda is forecasting 1988 sales may range from 57 billion 
to 62 billion spurred by a sales boom early in the year before 
the drought shriveled crops in the field 
in spite of the drought the combination of high commodity 
prices and government drought payments mean the farmer will have 
significant net farm income available with which to purchase 
said john annin vice president of operations for farmhand inc 
james k askford president of case ih predicted sales of 
twowheeldrive tractors over 130 horsepower would rise from 15 
percent to 20 percent as droughtdelayed purchases are made in 
1989 he also said his company expects sales of combines 
implements hay and forage equipment will increase 
we feel very positive about the agricultural outlook in 
1989 said william templeton vice president for marketing at 
deutzallis corp we see very strong sales gains in large 
twowheeleddrive farm tractors and selfpropelled combines along 
with significant gains in tillage and hay tools 
robert f moglia chairman of ford new holland inc said 
more favorable weather this fall and winter should help industry 
sales resume predrought recovery for tractors over 40 horsepower 
and related equipment 
he predicted the heaviest buying activity would occur early next 
year with sales continuing at a more moderate rate for the rest of 
1989 
richard anderson general manager of the agriculture products 
group of behlen manufacturing co said he feels there is only 
limited demand for grain storage and handling equipment 
lower than expected yields and greater exports of grain in 
1988 will definitely have a negative effect on the grain storage 
market he said

a top federal regulator says the banking 
industry should to take a more active role in dealing with the 
growing savings and loan crisis because if they dont congress 
might unilaterally take unpopular action to do so 
the banking community must by necessity be involved in shaping 
the resolution of thecrisis comptroller of the currency 
robert l clarke told a gathering of bankers monday at the 114th 
annual convention of the american bankers association here 
my mission is to challenge you to thinkin broad terms to 
avoid placing banking in the position of being a prisoner of 
events 
about a quarter of the 3200 federally insured sampls are 
considered insovlent or close to it with most of the problem 
thrifts concentrated in the energy and farm belts those sampls 
accounted for a large portion of the 36 billion in overall losses 
by thrifts in the second quarter 
estimates for the cost of liquidating or bailing out the 
troubled thrifts have ranged from 45 billion to 100 billion some 
experts say the taxpayers may have to pick up at least some of the 
tab 
clarke said it was inevitable that congress and the next 
president would consider merging the healthy federal deposit 
insurance corp which insures most of the 14000 commercial banks 
and a few thrifts with the weaker federal savings and loan 
insurance corp the main sampl insurer 
if that occurred clarke said it is conceivable that a merger 
of the fdic and fslic funds could lead to a merger of all the 
depository institution regulatory authorities 
the fdic and fslic both insure deposits of individuals for up to 
100000 but while the fslic posted a 137 billion deficit last 
year the fdic had 18 billion in reserves and expects to have 
funds totaling 15 billion by years end 
merging the fdic insurance fund with the thrift insurance fund 
has a political attractiveness said clarke whose agencies 
regulates nationally chartered banks certainly there isnt 
enough money in the fdic fund to solve the problem but the fund is 
enough to serve as a significant downpayment and it is available 
fdic chairman l william seidman and the aba long have opposed 
merging the two insurance funds 
for one thing bankers fear a merger would drive up the cost of 
their their insurance premiums which are about 2 percentage 
points below what thrifts pay 
bankers also worry that tapping into the fdic may aggravate the 
banks own failure problem the fdic says a record number of banks 
will fail this year as many as 250 compared with a record 184 
banks that closed last year and 19 others that needed federal 
assistance 
clarke says he also is against an fdicfslic merger but if 
the banking industry refuses to acknowledcge even the mere 
possibility of using fdic funds as part of a solution to the thrift 
crisis it is walking away from the table 
at a news conference monday the abas newly elected president 
thomas rideout said the thrift crisis was a top priority of the 
trade group along with bankingreform legislation 
the aba released a report last month calling for insolvent 
thrifts to be liquidated at a faster pace it also criticized the 
federal home loan bank board which regulates thrifts for failing 
to provide proper supervision of sampls

ira c herbert has been named president of 
cocacola usa the flagship division of cocacola co as part of 
what the company calls a strategy to increase its advertising 
firepower in the cola wars

executive 
pepsico inc cocacolas chief rival in the soft drink market

cocacolas advertising has been more conventional 
emanuel goldman a beverage industry analyst for painewebber in 
san francisco said cocacola has not necessarily been upstaged by

a concern about marketing among the companys top management

ike herbert and not somebody else says something goldman said 
herbert the executive vice president of the parent company 
will replace edwin r mellett as president of both cocacola usa

attorneys for donald trump and 
resorts international inc as well as state casino regulators say 
they are puzzled by an apparent shift in entertainer merv griffins 
plans to purchase the hotelcasino business for 364 million 
a lawyer for griffin said monday he could offer no assurances 
that the deal which only recently seemed on the verge of 
completion would go forward 
griffin was to appear today before the state casino control 
commission to discuss the matter 
there are a lot of questions said joel sterns an attorney 
for resorts i frankly dont know what this means 
griffin issued a prepared statement monday saying he allowed a 
deadline to complete the acquisition to expire on friday and that 
any party to the proposed deal was free to terminate its 
obligations 
the former talkshow host had offered to pay 36 a share for the 
class a stock of resorts which owns a casino and real estate in 
atlantic city plus land and a casino in the bahamas 
resorts class a stock closed down 487 a share at 2912 
monday on the american stock exchange and traded as low as 26 a 
share during the session 
griffin who recently has turned his attention to real estate 
would take resorts private by also buying out real estate magnate 
trumps controlling class b stock for 135 a share and pay trump 
63 million to break his management contract with resorts griffin 
also planned to 
griffins latest move could be an indication that he believes he 
can buy resorts at a lower price by threatening to withdraw from 
the deal 
a spokesman for griffin co thomas gallagher said we have 
not made any decision that were going to terminate on the other 
hand were not giving any assurance that the deal is going to go 
forward 
a lawyer for trump was more optimistic 
the deal is going to go forward said jack nusbaum from his 
new york office he said griffin has given us no indication hes 
going to back out of the deal 
griffin said in the news release that if an acquisition was 
completed it would be done through a merger not a tender offer a 
merger offer was approved aug 30 by the required number of 
shareholders said griffin 
griffin and trump had engaged in bitter negotiations for control 
of resorts but appeared to have come to terms about their 
differences and worked out the deal now in question 
in addition to the money griffin would pay for resorts stock he 
would invest 50 million in resorts to help it generate enough cash 
flow to cover interest payments on resorts debt 
in turn trump would pay resorts 273 million for its 
unfinished 1250room taj mahal casino

fill er up may take on a whole new meaning 
if a partnership between amoco corp and dunkin donuts inc catches 
on around the country 
the two companies have merged a selfservice gas station in 
downers grove ill a chicago suburb with a doughnut shop under 
the same roof and say the results have been promising 
we dont have an awful lot of experience said richard hart 
vice president and treasurer of the randolph massbased dunkin 
donuts but the results are satisfactory enough that were 
looking at other locations with amoco 
the partnership is a departure from having convenience stores 
adjacent to gas pumps and having service stations and fast food 
restaurants share sites on highways or near toll booths 
at the moment chicagobased amoco stands alone in putting gas 
stations and fastfood stores under one roof 
this may be a trend were looking at said joseph koach 
executive director of the service station dealers of america 
for amoco the deal with dunkin donuts is one of a number of 
agreements with various fast food firms including burger king 
corp and international dairy queen inc 
the thinking is that their amoco customers and our customers 
are looking for the same thing convenience good products and good 
prices said colt hothorn national director of development for 
burger king 
there are compatible needs on the part of the customer its 
not difficult to see a person filling up and buying a doughnut or 
a hamburger or an ice cream cone said robert rauscher amocos 
vice president for marketing 
amoco and dunkin donuts started the downers grove project in 
1986 and since then the oil company has started similar joint 
ventures with burger king in pillsbury colo and dairy queen in 
westminster colo 
two more partnerships with joyces subs and pizza a 
denverbased chain are scheduled to start this fall in colorado 
in all cases the food stores will sell only takeout items and 
the gas stations are all selfservice 
the concept has attracted customers notice 
i come in all the time said keri moon a college student 
who uses the downers grove station its a quick way to get 
breakfast if she could not buy doughnuts there she said id 
probably buy gas someplace else 
there are a lot of stations down the street selling gas for 
the same price so its not the price said alan buresz of 
lemont another chicago suburb who is a frequent customer i 
come in for the convenience 
other firms such as texaco inc and phillips petroleum co have 
built gas stations in tandem with mcdonalds restaurants along 
highways and each is looking to add more 
but unlike amocos project mcdonalds likes to place sitdown 
restaurants next to gas stations and have the two businesses 
operate separately 
mcdonalds is in the business of selling hamburgers we want 
to leave selling gasoline to the oil companies said melissa 
oakley a spokeswoman for the fast food giant 
but rauscher said other oil companies will follow amocos lead 
its too soon to say that this is the next thing he said 
but if successful these things tend to be duplicated

buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
today withdrew its 503 billion offer to acquire kroger co 
saying it was disappointed the supermarket chain had rejected the 
proposal 
in a letter to cincinnatibased kroger kohlberg said we find 
it difficult to understand that the board acted on matters of such 
importance to stockholders without the benefit of meeting with us 
we can only conclude that the board has decided the company is 
not for sale at any price 
kohlberg said it did not anticipate making any further proposals 
a week ago new yorkbased kohlberg sweetened its bid for the 
nations secondlargest supermarket operator to 64 a share in cash 
and securities the bid was competing against a 55ashare offer 
from marylands haft family which began the contest last month 
although analysts said kroger managers might be pressured to 
accept kohlbergs latest offer the grocer last week began laying 
off employees as part of a restructuring plan designed to fend off 
the two unwanted suitors 
some 300 positions were eliminated at kroger headquarters and 
the company also has announced plans to sell off certain assets 
as part of its restructuring kroger plans to distribute a 
special dividend of 40 in cash plus notes and stock for each 
kroger share in its letter to the board kohlberg said the 
financial community had valued the kroger restructuring at 53 to 
56 a share 
on wall street trading in kroger shares was halted temporarily 
the last sale of kroger stock was at 5750 a share on the new york 
stock exchange down 12 cents from monday 
the buyout firm hinted it might have been willing to improve its 
offer if it had an opportunity to meet with the board 
we are perplexed that the board found our proposal to be 
inadequate the letter said adding that kohlberg was not even 
asked if we were in a position to improve the bid 
the haft family which controls dart group corp and has a 
reputation as corporate raiders last week offered to help kroger 
fight the kohlberg bid by proposing to provide additional equity 
for krogers restructuring 
the 105yearold kroger has 170000 employees and 52000 
shareholders the companys main businesses are its supermarkets 
and convenience stores

notice to the company 
polzin declined to discuss the situation further union 
officials were not immediately available for comment today but 
chief uaw negotiator bill casstevens said the union wanted to get 
down to serious talks immediately 
negotiators could keep talking right through the deadline in an 
effort to reach an agreement they could extend the deadline or the 
union could call a strike 
the unions membership has voted to authorize a strike 
union officials had said monday they believed a new deadline 
would prompt the two sides to negotiate at a quick pace picking up 
where they left off before the extension without such a deadline 
they said there would be less incentive for either side to make 
rapid progress

reaching a new agreement with deere amp co uaw members ratified an

610 million in the comparable period in 1987 
results were restated to reflect intercos announcement in 
august to put its apparel manufacturing group up for sale 
cardinal acquisition corp headed by the rales brothers of 
washington dc has launched a 70ashare tender offer for 
interco that is being contested in the courts

oil futures are bounding up from twoyear lows 
reached last week but analysts say it is unclear whether the 
recent downward trend in prices has been reversed or merely 
interrupted 
trading was active monday analysts said as saudi arabia the 
worlds largest oil exporter reaffirmed it would stick to its 
production quota if other members of opec did 
the statement triggered speculation that other members of the 
13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries would 
reduce production in order to help boost prices 
but nauman barakat vice president for energy investment at 
prudentialbache securities inc said he remained skeptical 
because other opec members have shown no indication they are 
willing to cut back output 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate climbed 66 cents to settle at 1360 a 
barrel at one point during the days trading the contract traded 
as high as 1380 a barrel 
after opening lower today prices retraced lost ground by 
midday the november crude contract was up 6 cents at 1366 a 
barrel 
crude oil prices had tumbled to around 1230 a barrel last week 
as saudi arabia threatened to produce more than its quota if the 
other opec members continued pumping more than their quotas 
among refined oil products traded on the exchange the november 
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 128 cent to settle 
at 4141 cents a gallon while home heating oil rose 150 cents to 
3896 cents a gallon 
steven chronowitz director of futures research at smith barney 
harris upham amp co inc said mondays rise could mean prices 
bottomed out last week 
but he said if over the next few weeks we dont see any real 
action to back up the words then the market may sag again 
saudi arabia delivered its affirmation about its willingness to 
abide by its quota if others did at the weekly cabinet session 
presided over by king fahd and reported by information minister ali 
alshaer 
prudentialbaches barakat said the saudis have made similar 
statements before but that this statement is being taken more 
seriously than before 
he said one explanation is that a published report from the 
mideast said saudi arabia produced an average of 43 million 
barrels a day in the first week of october matching its quota he 
said previously the saudis reportedly had been producing 57 
million barrels a day 
barakat said the market was asking whether they have cut back 
output intentionally as an overture to others to cut back output or 
is it result of scheduling problems that is the 64000 question 
he said trading was heavy and was driven by professionals buying 
contracts to cover borrowed contracts they sold earlier on the 
expectation that prices would fall further 
the rally was a combination of technicals and fundamentals 
people are still not giving too much credence to the saudi 
statement he said

but gains were limited by expectations that the agriculture 
department will increase its corn and soybean harvest estimates in 
a crop production report scheduled for release wednesday afternoon 
analysts said 
that type of attitude may also prevail a bit tomorrow in 
trading ahead of the report said ted mao a grain specialist in 
new york with shearson lehman hutton inc 
but barring any major surprises i would not view this crop 
report as the major one he said we already know the general 
size of the crop this report is just fine tuning 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 434 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 295 cents a 
bushel oats were 5 cents to 7 cents higher with december at 
254 cents a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents higher with

earlier this year

bigger deficit than in july

business challenges to federal environmental 
rules governing the use of high smokestacks to disperse air 
pollution were rejected tuesday by the supreme court 
in another case the justices refused to revive a challenge to 
the way laurence a tisch became president of cbs inc letting 
stand rulings that his assumption of power two years ago did not 
amount to a transfer of control requiring prior approval by the 
federal communications commission 
the court also refused to kill a lawsuit charging boeing co 
with illegal age bias because it bars pilots from active flight 
status when they reach 60 
in the environmental case the justices without comment left 
intact a lower court ruling that strengthened clean air regulations 
by limiting the use of smokestacks as a substitute for other 
pollution controls 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled in january that the 
environmental protection agency validly adopted the regulations 
involving use of high smokestacks in 1985 
building taller stacks the leading technique of dispersal 
generally is cheaper than cutting emissions but environmentalists 
say that while dispersing the pollution may provide cleaner air in 
the vicinity of plants and factories it adds to the overall 
pollution in the atmosphere

kroger cos stock slumped tuesday after buyout 
specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co withdrew its 503 billion 
takeover bid saying it concluded the supermarket chain is not 
for sale at any price 
in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange kroger stock 
fell 262 a share to 55 far below kohlbergs cashandstock 
offer that was valued at 64 a share 
in a letter to kroger kohlberg said while we are perplexed 
that the board found our proposal to acquire the company at 28 
times earnings to be inadequate we were not even asked if we were 
in a position to improve our offer we can only conclude that the 
board has decided that the company is not for sale at any price 
kohlberg said it did not anticipate making any further proposals 
paul bernish a spokesman at krogers headquarters in 
cincinnati had no comment except to note that the company was 
proceeding with its previously announced restructuring plan 
bidding for kroger began last month when marylands haft family 
offered to acquire the big supermarket chain for 55 a share 
kohlberg came on the scene with a 5850ashare offer but last 
week sweetened the proposal to 64 a share 
although financial analysts had said kroger managers might be 
pressured to accept kohlbergs latest offer the companys board 
denounced the proposal last week as inadequate and put its 
restructuring plan in motion by laying off 300 employees kroger 
also has announced plans to sell off certain assets 
analysts speculated kohlberg bowed out of the contest because 
the aggressive new york buyout firm did not want to proceed in a 
hostile manner and launch a tender offer 
it would hurt their image of being a white knight and a 
defender of management said kimberly walin an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
kohlberg rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover in 
part because the success of its deals typically depends on having 
existing management remain with the target company 
but analysts also were not convinced that kohlberg was entirely 
out of the picture 
its possible that if something negative develops that kkr 
might be able to come back with a lower offer said linda morris 
a retail analyst at provident national bank in philadelphia 
she suggested kohlberg might be waiting in the wings to see if 
any new lawsuits surfaced that charge the kroger board with 
breaching its fiduciary duties for failing to negotiate the best 
price for shareholders 
at least four shareholders suits already were filed against 
kroger contending that the restructuring plan was not in 
shareholders best interests 
kroger valued its restructuring at between 57 and 61 a share 
but kohlberg challenged those figures noting that the financial 
community had put a pricetag of between 53 to 56 a share on the 
plan 
under terms of the restructuring kroger would distribute a 
special dividend of 40 in cash plus notes and stock for each 
kroger share 
disagreements over the value of the plan centered on a stub 
share of stock that kroger officials estimated would trade at 
between 9 and 13 a share wall street investors however 
estimated the stubs value as low as 5 a share 
analysts discounted the effect kohlbergs withdrawal might have 
on the haft bid the hafts who control dart group corp and have a 
reputation as corporate raiders still have their fingers in the 
pie but id be surprised if they were serious morris said 
furthermore after rejecting the kohlberg bid as inadequate it 
would be difficult for kroger to look favorably upon the haft 
proposal which was considered inferior by the investment community 
the hafts offered last week to help kroger fight the kohlberg 
bid by proposing to provide additional equity for krogers 
restructuring 
dart group president robert haft reiterated tuesday that the 
family remains interested in working with kroger to strengthen 
the company and enhance their restructuring by providing additional 
equity 
he declined to comment on whether the haft bid has been 
withdrawn but representatives of the haft family had contact 
with kroger management last week about remaining involved with the 
company a source said 
the 105yearold kroger has 170000 employees and 52000 
shareholders the companys main businesses are its supermarkets 
and convenience stores kroger operates more than 1300 
supermarkets 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses 
in 29 states

the european economic community and 66 
developing nations open formal negotiations wednesday for a new 
fiveyear multibillion dollar aid and trade accord due to take 
effect in 1990 
the negotiations are expected to last at least a year officials 
said on the eve of the talks 
at issue is the renewal of an accord under which the eec grants 
the african caribbean and pacific acp nations duty and 
quotafree access for virtually all their industrial and farm 
goods soft loans for development projects and financial guarantees 
against drops in commodity export prices 
the first such fiveyear accord was signed in lome the capital 
of togo in 1975 and the second socalled lome convention was 
concluded in 1980 
the third signed in 1984 and worth 85 billion european 
currency units 95 billion expires at the end of february 1990 
the aid comes from the eecs development fund and is separate 
from the food aid the eec grants annually to the developing nations 
the price tag on the fourth accord is open for negotiations but 
will doubtlessly exceed that of the current treaty 
the new talks open against the backdrop of the eecs plan to 
forge a single borderless market within the eec by 1992 
this plan fueled concern within the acp nations that the eec 
will become less sensitive to the need to support imports from them 
for its part the eec is expected to insist that acp nations 
implement sounder economic policies as outlined by the 
international monetary fund 
the eec has had special trade links with developing nations for 
25 years but this has not significantly raised the wealth of the 
recipient nations and today not one acp nation figures on the list 
of newly industrialized nations 
the 12 eec member states which were not able to agree on 
precise offers to make to their acp associates adopted a vague 
position which allows them to open the talks but postpones the 
problems 
the eec countries disagree on the future status of the stabex 
the system which guarantees the acp states part of their farm 
export earnings some want it linked to stricter economic policies 
but others object another question is whether the funds will be 
reimbursed or not 
another problem is the further trade liberalization the eec is 
ready to grant the acps spain and italy fear the increased 
competition of tropical products will harm their own mediterranean 
production 
but the biggest obstacle seems to be the shape of the future aid 
the eec is willing to give should it be longterm development 
funds or emergency assistance enabling the associates to overcome 
their debt problems and start some kind of economic revival 
finally the question of human rights is likely to arise again 
the eec wants it mentioned in the new convention while the acp 
states consider it an interference in their internal affairs

toyota motor sales usa will increase us 
sales to about 15 million cars and trucks annually by the 
mid1990s a twofold sales boost fueled by a new truck plant a 
company executive said tuesday 
at the introduction of the japanese automakers 1989 models bob 
mccurry executive vice president for sales and operations for the 
us arm of the company said he didnt know where that plant would 
be located 
weve got to get a truck plant in the united states he said 
flatly adding it would take about 2 years from site selection to 
production at a new truck plant 
the light truck market in the united states has been booming 
and industry analysts arent sure where it will level off included 
in the category are pickup trucks sport utility vehicles and the 
popular minivans 
toyota now imports a wide variety of pickup trucks with assorted 
cab and bed sizes the company also builds a van in japan and 
brings it to the united states but sales of the vehicle have been 
slipping against stiff competition from domestic and overseas 
minivan makers 
mccurry said the toyota van is designed for japanese consumers 
and that a new small van would be built in japan specifically for 
the us market 
for the first nine months of this year toyota has sold 684961 
cars and trucks in the united states up 14 percent over the same 
period last year the reason that percentage isnt higher mccurry 
said was a limited availability of the vehicles from japan 
but he added that will change 
by 1995 if we implement all our plans nearly half of our 
products will be built right here in north america and many of them 
will have more american content than some big three products he 
said

they have plenty to look to this week the government plans to 
report this week on the august trade balance and on september 
wholesale prices 
jack baker head of block trading for shearson lehman hutton 
inc said the markets pullback also reflected a decline of the 
dollar in foreign exchange trading which serves to discourage 
foreign investment in us stocks

dow jones industrial average up nearly 57 points over the past four 
sessions

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
tuesday that broad new guidelines for increasing banks capital are 
the key to maintaining stability in the financial world 
capital acts as a buffer against unexpected shocks to a firm 
and thereby helps to insulate both individual firms and the system 
from risk greenspan said at the 114th annual convention of the 
american bankers association 
greenspan also assured bankers that the repeal of the 
depressionera glasssteagall act which separates commercial and 
investment banking remains one of the feds highest priorities 
bankers have been trying to gain a foothold in the securities 
industry for the past several years arguing that it is necessary 
to compete more efficiently with banks abroad 
banking reform legislation has been tossed around in congress 
although it appears unlikely any major changes will come this year 
to help maintain a more level playing field between banks here 
and abroad the united states and 11 other industrialized nations 
agreed in july to standardize capital requirements for banks by 
1992 
capital represents a financial cushion of profits and 
stockholder money reserved for times of stress the purpose of the 
international accord was to link capital requirements to the 
riskiness of bank assets 
under the new guidelines all of the nations 14000 commercial 
banks will be required to have capital reserves equivalent to 8 
percent of assets weighted by risk in the next four years the 
total capital requirement now is 6 percent 
greenspan praised the new guidelines which the fed voted to 
enact in august as a way of providing shock absorbers for the 
financial system by discouraging excessive risktaking 
there is no better way to ensure that owners exert discipline 
on the behavior of their firm than to require that the owners have 
a large stake in that enterprise greenspan said the safety 
and soundness of the financial system requires that banks have 
adequate capital 
the new guidelines will force several money center banks to 
raise as much as 15 billion experts predict that many banks will 
have to issue new stock and sell some assets to raise their capital 
base 
i recognize that some of these banks not feeling market 
pressure to raise capital ratios may consider increased capital 
requirements unnecessarily burdensome greenspan said however 
given the existence of the federal safety net market signals 
regarding the level of capital may not be appropriate from a 
broader perspective

precious metals futures prices fell sharply tuesday giving back 
most of the previous days gains after gold ran into resistance at 
410 an ounce 
on other markets cocoa futures plummeted grains and soybeans 
advanced livestock and meat futures were mixed energy futures 
were mixed and stockindex futures retreated 
gold may be headed below 400 a troy ounce the key 
psychological barrier it struggled past last week analysts said 
after climbing 540 to 40860 a troy ounce monday on new 
yorks commodity exchange spot gold prices peaked at 410 monday 
night on overseas markets then began to retreat 
gold for october delivery on the comex settled at 40440 a troy 
ounce down 420 from mondays final price 
the markets basically got up to their first main resistance 
area then started picking up selling which seemed to accelerate 
throughout the day said david syphen manager of metals futures 
trading for merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
this is an indication that the gold market is still 
fundamentally on the defensive and may retest the previous lows 
below 395 he said 
spot gold fell to 392 an ounce on the comex late last month 
reflecting slack investment demand and low inflation 
analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york said rising crude oil prices and a softer dollar early in 
the session held some promise of supporting gold prices but those 
markets reversed direction later in the day 
on the comex gold settled 420 to 430 lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 40840 a troy ounce silver 
was 142 cents to 147 cents lower with december at 6275 a troy 
ounce 
on the new york mercantile exchange platinum settled 730 to 
810 lower with october at 51310 a troy ounce 
cocoa futures prices plummeted on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange ending a sevenday rally that had pushed the 
december contract up 174 a metric ton 
the market gave up more than a third of its recent gains on 
tuesday in what traders termed a mostly technical correction 
cocoa futures are at 13year lows due to a glut of cocoa and the 
inability of producer and consumer nations to agree on a 
pricesupport program 
cocoa settled 51 to 74 lower with december at 1216 a metric 
ton 
grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade in response to a surge in foreign demand analysts 
said 
reports that china was bidding for 400000 metric tons of 
subsidized us wheat sparked speculative and commercial buying of 
wheat futures egypt and yugoslavia were said to be in the market 
for us corn and exporters said taiwan had purchased 54000 
metric tons of soybeans 
after the close the agriculture department announced the soviet 
union had purchased 250000 metric tons of corn the usda also said 
it had targeted mexico for 300000 metric tons of subsidized wheat 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with december at 
434 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
december at 295 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 7 cents higher 
with december at 254 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents 
higher with november at 793 a bushel 
cattle futures posted modest losses on the chicago mercantile 
exchange on technical factors while pork futures were narrowly 
mixed on a combination of steady cash hog prices and light retail 
demand analysts said 
live cattle settled unchanged to 45 cent lower with october at 
7235 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 48 cent lower

consolidated gold fields plc and newmont mining 
corp said they filed a federal suit tuesday to block a 35 
billion hostile buyout bid by a south african conglomerate on 
grounds the offer violates federal securities and antitrust laws 
the us district court suit was the latest action the companies 
have taken to thwart the overture by south africancontrolled 
minorco sa which has offered 35 billion for the 706 percent of 
consolidated gold fields it does not already own 
londonbased gold fields owns a 493 percent stake in newmont 
gold fields and new yorkbased newmont last week asked president 
reagan to block the takeover on national security grounds 
contending a buyout would endanger us access to strategic metals 
such as gold platinum and zirconium 
gold fields has asked the british government to review the bid 
because of the south african connection and the south african 
government also is investigating the proposed acquisition 
named as defendants in the suit filed tuesday were anglo 
american corp of south africa ltd de beers consolidated mines 
ltd and minorco 
luxembourgbased minorco which owns 294 percent of gold 
fields is controlled by anglo american and de beers consolidated 
mines the gold and diamond mining interests of the wealthy 
oppenheimer family of south africa 
anglo american and de beers have said they would relinquish 
control of minorco if the bid succeeds minorco has said it plans 
to sell gold fields south african interests and gold fields stake 
in newmont if it acquires the company 
the gold fieldsnewmont suit contended the defendants had 
conspired to monopolize the gold market and that a successful 
acquisition likely would substantially lessen competition in that 
market 
gold fields controls 8 percent of the worlds gold production 
it also produces rutile and zircon which are raw materials for 
metals used in military aircraft and submarines 
the suit claimed a takeover of gold fields by minorco would give 
the south african syndicate control over a third of the worlds 
gold market 
the suit stated the oppenheimer syndicate has major investments 
in companies that control more than 20 percent of the wests gold 
production has interests controlling more than 50 percent of the 
free worlds platinum production and has what it claimed the

a regulatory board tuesday gave 
unanimous approval to entertainer merv griffins offer to buy 
resorts international inc its casinos and property despite 
lingering questions about whether griffin will complete the deal 
thank you for the unanimous vote griffin told the casino 
control commission after its ruling it was a vote of 
confidence 
the commissions decision came a day after griffins company 
announced it had allowed a deadline for its 36pershare tender 
offer to resorts stockholders to expire the move gave rise to 
speculation that griffin was trying to back out of the deal 
griffin told reporters after the ruling that the speculation was 
ridiculous but that allowing the deadline to expire was 
designed to allow him to get out of the deal if conditions were not 
favorable 
it gives me the right to continue on and close the deal as 
quickly as i can he said it gives me a chance to leave it if 
all things arent in place 
i want to be able to stay very fluid and to be able to make a 
businessmans decision and to walk if everything is not done 
griffin added 
mondays announcement that griffin had declined to extend the 
deadline drove down the price of resorts stock by 4875 but they 
rebounded on tuesday closing up 3 at 32125 
under the deal griffin would purchase resorts stock including 
that owned by billionaire developer donald trump griffin would 
take control of the resorts international casino hotel resorts 
vast land holdings in atlantic city and a casino and property 
resorts owns in the bahamas 
trump would purchase from resorts its unfinished 1250room taj 
majal casino next door to resorts gaming hall on the boardwalk in 
atlantic city 
griffin is still awaiting approval from the bahamian government 
on his request to purchase resorts property there the commission 
has not yet acted on his request for a permanent casino license 
although it granted him a 90day license tuesday 
his attorney howard goldberg assured the commission that 
griffin wasnt pulling out of the sale 
i hate to paraphrase mark twain he said but the rumors 
about the death of this deal are greatly exaggerated 
goldberg said the refusal to extend the tender offer gives 
griffin flexibility to reconsider the deal if market conditions 
take a downward slide or if griffin fails to get approvals he is 
waiting for 
robert trump executive vice president of the trump organization 
and the brother of donald said he was confused by griffins 
announcement 
we didnt quite understand it he said 
i read and reread the griffin news releases and i dont 
know what they mean said joel sterns an attorney for resorts 
reading from a prepared text griffin said if an acquisition is 
completed it would be done through a merger not a tender offer 
a merger offer was approved aug 30 by the required number of 
shareholders said griffin 
griffin who recently has turned his attention to real estate 
would take the company private by buying out trumps controlling 
stock and all remaining shares 
griffin and trump had engaged in bitter negotiations for control 
of resorts but appeared to have come to terms about their 
differences and worked out the deal now in question 
under the proposal griffin would pay trump 135 a share or 96 
million for trumps class b stock trump also would receive 
another 63 million from griffin to break trumps management 
contract with resorts 
griffins tender offer for class a stockholders would cost him 
2052 million griffin would also invest 50 million in resorts to 
help it generate enough cash flow to cover interest payments on 
resorts debt 
in turn trump would pay resorts 273 million for the taj mahal 
trump announced tuesday that resorts internationals board of 
directors set oct 31 as a deadline for closing the deal 
if the deadline passes resorts may take other actions as it 
deems appropriate under the circumstances said a statement 
released by the company it did not elaborate

macmillan inc said tuesday it lost nearly 11 
million in the third quarter as it took a charge for disposing of 
some inventory and recorded expenses related to tender offers being 
made for the company 
the latest loss contrasts with macmillans earnings of 433 
million in the julythroughseptember period a year earlier 
thirdquarter revenue rose 59 percent to 3407 million from 
3222 million in 1987 
the company said it took a charge of 294 million for a 
disposal of inventory resulting from its decision to close its 
scribner laidlaw elementary school book line and to reorganize its 
educational publishing group to achieve economies within its 
elementary and high school textbook publishing business 
it said the results also reflected expenses of 397 million 
resulting from the tender offers and the companys own proposed 
restructuring later dropped 
since midmay macmillan has been the target of competing offers 
from the groups led by texan robert m bass british publisher 
robert maxwell and the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
it proposed a restructuring plan that would have divided the 
company into separate publishing and information services companies 
but later abandoned it 
it has accepted a 25 billion offer from the kohlberg group 
that includes members of its senior management although maxwell 
has offered 251 billion under certain conditions and is 
challenging the companys agreement with the kohlberg group in 
court 
for the first nine months of the year macmillan said it earned 
95 million or 40 cents a share down 83 percent from 553 
million or 210 a share a year earlier 
ninemonth revenue rose 84 percent to 7643 million from 
7049 million a year earlier

last nights meat loaf might keep for several 
more days with the addition of a substance from the shells of crabs 
and lobsters an agriculture department scientist said tuesday 
john r vercelloti a chemist at the departments southern 
regional research center in new orleans said the substance called 
chitin inhibits a warmedover flavor in uncured meat poultry or 
fish that is cooked stored and reheated 
the additives have shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the 
offtaste for up to five days when mixed with hamburger he said 
vercelloti in a report issued here by the departments 
agricultural research service said tv dinners microwave foods and 
leftovers are prime candidates for offtastes meats cured with 
nitrite such as bacon ham and lunch meats dont have such 
problems he said 
the warmedover flavor also is described by the food industry as 
cardboardy or painty the offtaste is caused when fat in 
the uncured meat breaks down as it is reheated 
vercellotti and a fellow chemist allen j st angelo are 
seeking a patent on additives made from chitin which he described 
as a surplus material from the shellfish industry chitin is 
most commonly found in the shells of lobsters crabs and other 
shellfish 
the warmedover flavor occurs when oxygen in the atmosphere 
breaks down fats in the meat the report said large amounts of 
iron present in meat speeds up the oxidation 
but when the chitin additives are added to the meat they bind 
the iron so it cannot speed up the oxidation thus slowing down the 
development of the warmedover flavor 
chitin additives would have to be approved by the food and drug 
administration before being available to consumers the scientists 
said

polaroid corp and wouldbe buyer roy e 
disney battled for support of the companys workers tuesday with 
disney publishing a letter of reassurance about his plans for an 
employee stock plan 
disney who through his shamrock holdings inc is pressing an 
unsolicited 26 billion offer for the instant film maker also 
suggested a buyout would increase job security by making polaroid 
a vigorous productive and more progressive company 
disney the millionaire nephew of the late animator walt disney 
addressed the workers in an open letter to be published wednesday 
in newspaper advertisements near polaroids cambridge mass 
headquarters and released earlier to the press 
the letter said burbankbased shamrocks attempts to overturn a 
new employee stock ownership plan as part of its buyout would be 
replaced with unspecified opportunities for workers to profit from 
anticipated growth at polaroid 
polaroid officials refused to comment on the open letter but 
did reveal that it had rejected an oct 7 request by shamrock 
president stanley gold to meet with the employees 
that refusal was in keeping with company policy against putting 
outside speakers in touch with employees said i macallister 
booth polaroids president and chief executive officer 
shamrock the vehicle for disneys diverse investments has made 
a 42ashare tender offer to polaroid stockholders for a majority 
of the companys 619 million shares that offer is valid only if a 
recently announced employee stock ownership plan is overturned 
under the plan the company would issue new stock totaling 14 
percent of the shares outstanding 
a parallel disney offer would pay 44 a share if management 
drops its opposition and negotiates a sale 
polaroid management which has sued to stop shamrock from 
increasing its 8 percent stake in the company has characterized 
the suitors objections to the esop as a threat to employees 
in the letter shamrock asks why is polaroids president 
afraid to allow shamrock to meet with polaroid employees 
it accuses management of cutting pay 5 percent and laying off 15 
percent of its us workforce while establishing golden 
parachute payments for top executives in event of a buyout 
we intend to replace the esop with meaningful opportunities 
for employees to participate in the future growth of polaroid 
the letter says without specifying what those opportunities would 
be 
in his letter polaroids booth invited shamrock to reveal its 
plans for shamrocks revitalization in a formal proposal

a senior federal judge accused defense lawyers 
tuesday of ethical misconduct in the drexel burnham lambert inc 
securitiesfraud case escalating what has become a hottempered 
courtroom battle pitting the octogenarian jurist against some of 
the nations bestpaid legal talent 
judge milton pollack made the accusations in response to defense 
efforts to have him disqualified on grounds his wife moselle 
stands to gain about 30 million from the sale of her stock in 
palais royal a houston company going private in a deal financed by 
drexel 
the judge said he would forward a complaint to the chief judge 
of manhattan federal court charles brieant for a possible 
disciplinary hearing into how two defense lawyers martin 
flumenbaum and arthur liman obtained the palais royal information 
both attorneys denied wrongdoing 
the judge also chastised other defense attorneys for what he 
called their ethical misconduct and irresponsible behavior for 
notifying him at home on saturday oct 10 of their belief he had 
a conflict of interest in the case 
id have preferred it if youd not called me privately 
pollack said angrily it isnt appropriate to call up a judge on 
a saturday afternoon 
the developments marked the angriest exchanges yet between 
pollack and the drexel legal team fighting the securities and 
exchange commissions wideranging civilfraud charges 
the sec charges filed last month after an intense 
investigation allege drexel its highyield bond chief michael 
milken and others colluded with nowimprisoned insider trader ivan 
boesky to violate a variety of securities laws 
so far the drexel case has been stalled in pretrial maneuvering 
that centers on factgathering and whether the case should be 
handled by pollack a highly regarded 82yearold jurist known for 
tough rulings in securities fraud cases from the start drexel and 
the others have sought his removal 
in arguments tuesday defense attorneys claimed they only 
learned about moselle pollacks drexelrelated business deal on 
oct 9 and felt obligated to notify the judge promptly as 
specified under federal litigation rules on conflicts of interest 
they said that even if the judge can rule objectively his 
wifes business deal creates the appearance of conflict 
barry goldsmith a deputy sec litigation counsel argued that 
moselle pollacks financial interests in the drexel deal are 
extremely remote and indirect because she will get 30 million for 
the sale of her ownership interest whether drexel is involved or 
not 
he also implied drexel created the conflict by agreeing to 
become involved in the palais royal transaction drexel attorneys 
denied it 
the judge did not rule tuesday on whether he should disqualify 
himself but is expected to issue a written decision in a few days 
people familiar with the case said they doubted he would surrender 
the case to another judge

a district court shouldnt have dismissed a 
120 million lawsuit against officers and directors of the bankrupt 
1984 louisiana world exposition a federal appeals court said 
tuesday in remanding the case for further proceedings 
it is clear that louisiana law does in fact recognize that a 
corporation may hold its officers and directors liable for gross 
negligence mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty the 5th 
us circuit court of appeals said 
the suit sought damages for contractors and other creditors who 
lost money when the worlds fair declared bankruptcy four days 
before it closed in november 1984 
the lawsuit was filed by a committee of creditors of the 
exposition against the events directors and officers 
the district court threw out the case without a hearing because 
state laws protected officers and directors of the bankrupt fair 
from lawsuits by creditors of the event the appeals court said in 
reviewing the suit 
the directors included fair president petr spurney and other 
officials of the corporation that sponsored the exhibition such as 
mayor sidney barthelemy who was a city councilman at the time 
city councilman james singleton and other former city officials 
this appeal involves the interaction of louisiana corporate 
law and federal bankruptcy law the fundamental question before us 
is whether the committee can maintain an action against the 
appellees for gross negligence mismanagement and breach of 
fiduciary duty the appeals court said 
in short we have corrected the district courts mistaken 
impressions as to the nature and viability of this lawsuit the 
appeals court said

striking nuclear submarine builders at 
electric boat voted tuesday to accept a new fouryear contract 
almost identical to one rejected in august ending a 103day 
walkout without achieving many of their demands 
im glad its over said joseph messier president of the 
10200member metal trades council which represents 10 trade 
unions union members voted 3752 to 1822 in favor of the new pact 
theres going to be a lot of animosity in the shipyard 
messier said 
the agreement reached after four days of negotiations provides 
a 3 percent pay raise in the third year of the contract and bonuses 
in the other years 
the wage and benefit package is identical in dollar value to the 
one union negotiators rejected in august and refused to put to a 
vote of the rank and file a company spokesman said 
before walking off the job july 1 workers voted 4921 to 3140 
to reject electric boats offer of lumpsum bonuses in lieu of wage 
increases the union insisted on a threeyear contract with a 5 
percent raise in the first year and 4 percent raises in each of 
the next two years 
a number of recent developments in the 14week strike put 
pressure on negotiators to get the strikers back to work including 
a finding by a national labor relations board official that the 
strike might be illegal because the council failed to give the 
required 30 days notice before calling the walkout 
more than 300 union jobs including machinists grinders and 
laborers have been permanently lost to replacement workers or 
subcontracting as a result of the threemonth strike union and 
company officials said

builder of nuclearpowered attack submarines and the sole maker of 
trident ballistic submarines the nations largest 
it had sought to limit percentage pay increases and pay bonuses 
to reduce costs and remain competitve for submarine contracts with 
rival newport news shipbuilding amp drydock co of virginia 
firstclass mechanics a classification that covers about 85 
percent of electric boats workers earned 1202 per hour under 
the old contract the new contract provides for workers to receive 
as much as 2250 in bonuses within about a month of returning to

countries was indicted tuesday in what federal agents described as 
the first drugrelated moneylaundering case involving a global 
banking institution 
william von raab head of the us customs service called it 
the first corporate raid adding we have given new meaning to 
the term hostile takeover 
for some international banks their sleaze factor is higher 
than their interest rates thats what were talking about here 
just pure greed he said 
in a twoyear undercover sting dubbed operation c chase 
from the c in cnote or a 100 bill customs agents were able to 
infiltrate powerful colombian moneylaundering syndicates and help 
launder an estimated 32 million in drug proceeds federal 
authorities said 
the money was intended principally for colombian drug 
traffickers including the medellin cartel customs said 
indictments unsealed tuesday named nine banking officials along 
with a luxembourgbased bank holding company bcci holdings as 
well as two subsidiaries bank of credit and commerce international 
sa which has operations in the united states and england and 
bank of credit and commerce international overseas limited 
organized in the cayman islands and operating in france the 
republic of panama colombia bahamas and the united states 
in addition to the indictments the government filed civil 
complaints seeking forfeiture of individuals property and funds as 
allegedly representing drug profits and it also seeks forfeiture 
of bcci assets 
the announcement of the indictments followed the arrest of 11 
people here sunday after they had been lured to a fictitious 
wedding which one official compared to a cecil b demille 
production invitations were sent and seven were nabbed en route 
to a bachelor party 
a federal judge late tuesday lifted a restraining order that had 
been issued against the bank and allowed the bank to resume normal 
business after bcci put into escrow 14 million the amount the 
government alleged the bank had laundered before the escrow 
deposit was made the bank had been restrained from conducting all 
but routine business without clearance from us marshals 
altogether 85 defendants were named in indictments returned in 
tampa new york chicago detroit philadelphia houston 
additionally five other warrants were issued in miami los 
angeles london and paris with two in london

among those indicted was fight promoter felix tuto zabala who 
was ordered held without bail in miami tuesday on six counts of 
marijuana smuggling and moneylaundering 
it is the first time an entire international financial 
institution and its important members have been indicted said 
von raab who appeared at a news conference here with highranking 
customs representatives from england and france drug agents from 
england and france participated in busting the ring 
colombian traffickers are really looking to europe to improve 
their markets von raab said saying cocaine prices are double 
there but they cant without help from financial institutions 
thats why this case is important 
the holding company prosecutors said is the worlds 
seventhlargest privately held financial institution most large 
banks have publicly traded stock while prosecutors couldnt be 
reached to elaborate on the banks size a spokesman for the banks 
lawyers said it was an apparent reference to the geographical size 
in the number of countries served 
the trade journal american banker said bank of credit and 
commerce international ranks as no 326 among the worlds biggest 
banks as measured by deposits and no 378 as measured by assets 
the bank said in a news release that its officials and lawyers 
had not seen the allegations and couldnt respond 
the bank is wholly unaware of any violations of law that 
allegedly have been committed the release stated adding that it 
was confident the outcome will be satisfactory 
beginning in july 1986 the undercover agents dealt primarily 
with gonzalo mora jr who controlled a laundering network in 
medellin colombia home of the medellin cartel to service 
traffickers john doe also known as don chepe in that south 
american city and roberto baezalcaino in los angeles the 
indictment said 
undercover agents received the money from various defendants and 
laundered it for a commission officials said in most instances 
the money was deposited in bank accounts in tampa then transmitted 
to mora in colombia via blank checks drawn on the tampa account 
prosecutors said 
officials estimated that 14 million was laundered through the 
bcci subsidaries 
according to the indictment agents first contacted bcci 
representatives in february 1987 and began opening accounts at 
various branches in july 
authorities said the alleged scheme operated this way bank 
officials placed the drug money in certificates of deposit in 
branches in france panama uruguay bahamas luxembourg and 
england then created a loan at another branch and allowed the 
trafficers to withdraw the funds the bank repaid the loan with 
funds in the cds officials said 
the indictments alleged possession and smuggling conspiracies 
as well as conspiracy to defraud the irs launder proceeds of 
domestic cocaine sales and engage in a continuing criminal 
enterprise

developer donald trump was reported tuesday to have 
agreed to buy eastern airlines northeast air shuttle with one 
estimate putting the price at more than 350 million 
in separate reports the miami news and the dow jones 
professional investor report said a deal had been reached and could 
be announced as early as wednesday the new york times in its 
wednesday editions quoted a source that it did not identify as 
saying a wednesday morning news conference had been scheduled at 
new yorks plaza hotel to announce the deal 
sources had reported last week that trump was negotiating to buy 
the shuttle operation which links new york boston and washington 
sources also reported that carl icahn the financier who heads 
trans world airlines was discussing a possible purchase of the 
struggling eastern from its parent texas air corp 
neither trump a new york developer who owns casino property in 
atlantic city nj nor officials at easterns miami headquarters 
would comment on the latest reports 
the news quoted an unidentified source close to eastern as 
saying trump would pay more than 350 million 
dow jones said eastern president phil bakes was in new york but 
airline spokesmen declined to say why he was there 
in recent court testimony eastern executives said the shuttle 
was the only profitable eastern operation 
texas air citing a billion dollars in eastern losses over the 
past decade has said it must have labor concessions to keep the 
airline going 
eastern made the shuttle into a separate division last year 
leading to speculation that texas air was considering selling it to 
raise cash 
asked about tuesdays reports norma foerderer spokeswoman for 
the trump organization said i have nothing to say about this 
matter at his time 
eastern spokesman robin matell also declined to discuss the 
reports 
leaders of eastern unions who went to court to block an earlier 
planned spinoff of the shuttle from eastern to a new texas air 
subsidiary said they had no firsthand confirmation on the shuttle 
sale but would fight it 
ron cole a spokesman for the air line pilots association local 
representing eastern pilots said alpas position all along has 
been we would oppose the sale we will take whatever legal means is 
possible 
officials of the machinists union which filed the suit that 
derailed the spinoff of the shuttle were reported to be in an 
arbitration meeting and unavailable to comment 
that suit stemmed from texas airs announcement last february 
that it planned to transfer the shuttle to a new subsidiary in 
return for an infusion of 225 million in cash for eastern 
in march us district judge john h pratt blocked the plan 
with a contempt of court finding against eastern 
a federal appeals court reversed pratts contempt order in june 
but left the door open for the unions to mount another court 
challenge the following month eastern announced that the plan was 
off 
in recent weeks reports surfaced that the shuttle again was for 
sale this time to an outside buyer 
trumps desire for the shuttle became public knowledge last 
week and then icahn was reported to be interested in buying all of 
eastern union sources said that they had met with icahn and there 
was speculation icahn would make an offer for eastern only if the 
unions agreed to concessions in their pay and work rules 
the miami herald reported tuesday morning that easterns unions 
were continuing talks with icahn the herald quoting unidentified 
sources said icahn wanted the pilots union to accept 15 percent 
paycuts while the pilots offered to freeze their salaries at 
present levels until 1992 
cole the pilots spokesman declined comment on the heralds 
report
