president daniel ortega of 
nicaragua on tuesday promised earlier elections and campaign reform 
and leaders at the central american summit agreed to try to 
dismantle the nicaraguan rebel movement 
but the five presidents did not resolve what was the major 
stumbling block during the two days of talks verification of 
progress toward democracy under the central american peace plan 
nicaraguas leftist government committed itself to hosting un 
observers to guarantee the integrity of presidential legislative 
and municipal elections to be held on or before feb 25 1990 10 
months earlier than scheduled 
ortega also promised to ensure that opposition parties have 
access equal to that of the sandinistas to radio and television air 
time during the campaign 
the leaders agreed to draft within 90 days a detailed program to 
effect the demobilization repatriation or voluntary relocation in 
third countries of an estimated 20000 nicaraguan rebels and their 
families in neighboring honduras the usbacked rebels known as 
contras have been fighting nicaraguas government since 1981 
the declaration signed by the presidents said nicaraguas 
electoral law would be reformed and opposition parties would be 
represented on the supreme electoral council 
elections had been scheduled for november 1990 ortegas term is 
scheduled to end in january 1991 
ortega asked if moving up elections implied he would hand over 
power before the end of his term said power resides in the 
people in february of 1990 the people will again be voting 
exercising their will their decision their power to say who will 
govern 
he would not say specifically if his term in office might be 
shortened but foreign minister miguel descoto told a questioner 
after the summit ended 
the idea is not to have a lameduck government forever you 
have to read between the lines but what president ortega said 
leaves open the possibility that his term could end before january 
1991 
nicaragua also committed itself to release of political 
prisoners including jailed contras and former soldiers of the late 
president anastasio somoza whom the sandinistas overthrew in july 
1979 
paul reichler a us lawyer and adviser to nicaraguan said up 
to 1600 prisoners could be released he said about 100 former 
somoza soldiers and contras would not be released because they were 
jailed for heinous crimes 
descoto asked if the commitment on elections was a concession 
in response to the program for definitive dismantling of the 
contras said these democratization commitments are not 
concessions they have always been our intention part of our 
program now that the military threat to us no longer exists we can 
carry them out 
reichler said earlier tuesday that an 11thhour accord on 
verification of progress toward democracy had been hammered out but 
the presidents made no mention of agreement on such a mechanism in 
their final document and the thorny issue remains for lower level 
officials to grapple with in the future 
adolfo calero one of the main leaders of the contras reacted 
harshly to the summits resolution on the guerrillas organized as 
the nicaraguan resistance 
any accord based on ortegas promises is like trying to leash a 
dog with sausages he told reporters outside the hotel 
calero later told a news conference the agreement on election 
reform is a trium for the contras and is a public confession that 
the sandinistas have not fulfilled their commitments to 
democratization 
we are willing to return to nicaragua as soon as we see that 
ortega seriously begins to implement the commitments he said 
adding that if the sandinistas go back on the agreement our 
option is to continue with the armed struggle 
on whether the contras might participate in elections aristedes 
sanchez another contra leader said first we have to see the 
electoral reforms 
ortega upon arrival at managuas international airport tuesday 
night said the summit was a victory for the nicaraguan people 
today february 14th we lovers of peace have delivered a final 
blow to the war 
this summit was an attempt to resuscitate the esquipulas peace 
plan signed aug 7 1987 which called for ceasefires in civil wars 
affecting nicaragua el salvador and guatemala democratization 
amnesties and a halt to outside aid for insurgents 
the peace plan named for esquipulas the guatemalan town where 
the presidents first met in may 1986 also banned use of one 
signatorys territory as a base for aggression against that of 
another 
president oscar arias who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for 
drafting the esquipulas peace plan said the achievements reached at 
this meeting have encouraged the presidents to meet more often they 
last held a summit 13 months ago 
the lack of progress at that meeting began a period of stagnation 
of the central american peace process 
leaders of the five countries said they would next get together 
in honduras at a date to be announced 
in addition to ortega and arias presidents vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala jose napoleon duarte of el salvador and jose azcona hoyo 
of honduras attended the summit 
an estimated 11000 contra fighters and another 10000 of their 
family members remain in camps in honduras near the nicaraguan 
border being supported by us humanitarian aid many of them have 
expressed a desire to go on fighting despite lack of us military 
help 
arias asked what would happen if the contras resisted 
disarmament and disbanding said it is the responsibilty of the 
international community but above all of those who for many years 
sponsored the contras to find a solution to this problem he 
said apparently referring to the united states

sixty years ago today machinegun fire echoed 
from a garage in a near north side neighborhood and seven members of 
george bugs morans gang fell dead in the st valentines day 
massacre 
it was the prohibition eras goriest crime and the beginning of 
the end of gangster rule 
now prohibition is dead and the garage is gone but the memories 
live on for some chicago residents who vividly recall when 
gangland graduated from murder to massacre as news accounts of 
the day put it 
a senior citizens home borders the site and residents of the 
lincoln park senior center say their parking lot is on the very spot 
where the seven fell some residents believe their ghosts still walk 
id be sitting on my reclining chair and hear things moving 
around knives and forks clanging together id hear someone 
go out the door said madeline bushbaum 84 who lived in the 
neighborhood at the time 
we always figured it was the dead ones looking for the ones 
that killed em said mrs bushbaum who has moved out of the room 
closest to the murder site i dont hear em anymore but several 
people moved out of the building because they said they were 
disturbed 
at the time of the massacre scarface al capone leader of 
near south side bootlegging operations wanted morans territory up 
north 
on the morning of feb 14 1929 a day when the temperature was 
10 below zero four men two wearing police uniforms raided 
morans garage headquarters 
they lined the men up against the wall as if for a routine frisk 
for weapons and instead delivered a valentines day hail of gunfire 
that riddled the victims almost severing limbs 
mrs bushbaum then a 24yearold evening telephone operator was 
playing pool with the guys in the back room of drake braithwaite 
undertakers about three blocks from the scene she said she often 
helped out answering the telephone when the employees went out to 
pick up a stiff 
while we were playing the garage door flew open and there were 
the coppers and the paddy wagon she recalled 
they brought in two bodies on two slabs and just slid em off 
on the floor and said we gotta go back we got five more dead out 
there 
i saw the guy with half his brains shot out and i tell you i 
didnt feel so good mrs bushbaum said 
six of the victims died instantly 
frank gusenberg fading fast in his hospital bed upheld the 
gangland code when police asked whod done the shooting 
nobody gusenberg said its getting dark sarge so long 
moran who was not at his headquarters that day later told 
police only the capone gang kills like that 
authorities never proved a capone connection and the massacre is 
still listed in police files as murder by persons unknown 
but the violence hastened a resurgence of law and order that 
crushed gangster rule and eventually brought the arrest and downfall 
of capone 
another senior center resident said living on the site doesnt 
bother him one bit 
you get used to that living in chicago you get used to the 
violence said alfred schiller 71 who was 11 at the time of the 
massacre i used to go by there all the time on the way to go 
fishing in the park 
schiller recalled chatting with garage mechanic johnny may who 
was ordered out from beneath a truck and lined up with the others 
against the wall 
he was a nice guy just a working stiff thats all he was 
schiller said of course they dont come up and say hey im a 
mafia man wanna see my machine gun

china is in the throes of its worst ecological 
crisis ever with industrial pollution acid rain and the conversion 
of arable land into desert posing critical threats an official 
newspaper reported today 
the china daily quoted zhou guangzhao a leading scientist as 
noting at a recent conference that 5 billion tons of topsoil are 
washed away every year because of erosion and that vast stretches of 
grassland are lost annually 
forests are shrinking rapidly and deserts take over an 
additional 600 square miles of land each year zhou was quoted as 
saying more than 11 percent of chinas territory is now arid land 
he said 
zhou said acid rain is a problem in southwestern china and that 
150 million chinese drink polluted water as a result of industrial 
pollution 
china once claimed environmental pollution was a capitalist vice 
that did not affect socialist states but now acknowledges that its 
emphasis on rapid development and lack of pollution standards 
serious damaged the environment 
the state environmental protection bureau spent about 18 
billion last year cleaning up the environment and plans a 50 percent 
spending increase in coming years 
but chinas leading paper the peoples daily said last year 
that even that may not be enough 
if forceful policies are not implemented the nation faces a 
future of denuded forests dirty lakes barren grasslands and smoggy 
skies it said

driving miss daisy a 
prizewinning american play about an elderly white woman and her 
black chauffeur has opened here to rave reviews from critics 
delighted by its lowkey handling of racial friction 
with the exception of one critic who found the script too bland 
black and white reviewers from progovernment and opposition 
newspapers praised the play and the production 
driving miss daisy opened last week at the market theater 
which for the past decade has been johannesburgs main showplace for 
multiracial drama and has featured many militantly antiapartheid 
works 
barry ronge a critic for the sunday times said the 1988 
pulitzer prizewinning play by alfred uhry is about whites and 
blacks interacting without anger and threat a rare sight on the 
markets stages 
the audiences relief at seeing a play and not another harangue 
was palpable wrote ronge who is white 
writing in a sunday times supplement for black readers black 
critic ezra mantini described it as a masterpiece with lots of 
laughter and no reveling in anger or outcry 
a review in the star johannesburgs largestcirculation daily 
said our playwrights could learn a lot from the effect of 
subtlety and understatement in uhrys handling of racial tension 
the play depicts the evolving relationship between daisy werthan 
an elderly white aristocrat in atlanta and hoke coleburn hired as 
her chauffeur when she is no longer able to drive herself 
the initial discomfort felt between the two gradually transforms 
into deep friendship 
a review in the sowetan the countrys largestselling black 
daily said the play is sure to win many theatergoers hearts with 
its easily recognizable and universal truth that racial discord 
makes no sense at all 
the sowetans critic victor metsoamere said the bond that grows 
between hoke and miss daisy is bound to take a 
hunndredandnevermind years to be cultivated in south africa 
this is because of the unnerving charades of south africas 
ultraright wing groups who squirm no end at the black mans 
extended hand of friendship metsoamere wrote 
two progovernment newspapers the citizen and beeld also 
praised the production beeld an afrikaanslanguage daily echoed 
the star in suggesting that playwrights should emulate uhrys 
indirect approach to political issues 
the only mildly negative review come from the financial newspaper 
business day which praised the production but described the play as 
very sweet entirely innocuous and utterly inconsequential 
it is the theatrical equivalent of greeting card philosophy 
designed to appeal to everyone offend no one and contribute little 
to the sum of human knowledge wrote business days robert grieg 
two of south africas bestknown actors john kani and annabel 
linder play the leads in driving miss daisy 
kani last year became the first black to play othello in a 
professional production in south africa starring at the market 
under the direction of janet suzman the south africanborn actress 
based in london 
the director of driving miss daisy is another white woman 
janice honeyman whose previous production at the market was a 
highly praised enactment of african folk tales 
ms honeyman told the antiapartheid weekly newspaper new nation 
the message of driving miss daisy is that people are people 
they can relate to each other and enjoy each others company 
and give to each other and teach each other without all the other 
stuff that were subjected to all the time in this godforsaken 
country she said 
there are going to be people coming here to the market and 
saying id forgotten that someone of another color can be my best 
friend she said

for gov michael dukakis the hard times didnt end 
with his defeat in the presidential election 
the severe state budget problems that haunted the final stages of 
his campaign have hurt his support political allies have started 
attacking him over the deficit and his decision that more taxes were 
the only way to balance the books 
meanwhile fatigue and depression associated with the 
presidential campaign defeat led to his wife kitty entering an 
alcohol treatment program 
and a recent public opinion poll found him about as popular as a 
swim in polluted boston harbor 
i dont believe i can remember a massachusetts governor who 
went from that high to such a relatively low period in such a short 
period of time said john volpe a former republican governor 
you can go downhill as fast as you can go uphill 
most of dukakis friends maintain that his stoicism is seeing him 
through 
i dont see a mike dukakis who is worn down or torn down by 
these events said boston attorney paul brountas chairman of 
dukakis presidential campaign and a personal friend 
if dukakis occasionally seemed distracted it was because the 
family is obviously the most important consideration brountas 
said i dont think its easily compartmentalized 
these should have been his golden years culminating more than a 
decade in the states highest office instead since becoming a lame 
duck by announcing in january that he wont run for governor again 
dukakis has wrestled with some of the biggest problems to face state 
government in years 
and he is doing it without the usual support 
on sunday a week after kitty dukakis entered a rhode island 
center to be treated for an alcohol problem headlines announced 
that for the first time in his statewide political career dukakis 
favorability rating had dipped below 50 percent the poll of 603 
democrats and independents by secretary of state michael connolly 
showed only 435 percent rating the governor favorably 
on monday dukakis went before the state house taxation committee 
to defend a 735 million tax increase proposal he says he needs the 
money to help close a 600 million budget gap this year and keep 
next years budget in balance 
all this for a politician who in 1986 won reelection by better 
than a 21 margin who gained the democratic presidential nomination 
after winning primaries in every region of the country and who as 
recently as december had a favorable rating among democrats of 83 
percent 
since the presidential election dukakis has occasionally shown 
more fire than he did on the campaign trail in his 
stateofthestate address for example he called his opponents on 
fiscal issues gutless wonders and on monday he was more 
aggressive than usual at a state budget hearing blasting 
legislators as free spenders yet tax foes 
brountas said that dukakis is if anything in a better position 
to handle his current political troubles than he was on the 
presidential campaign trail amid the attacks by bush on such 
subjects as furloughs for prisoners and the unclean waters of boston 
harbor dukakis was unable to get his message through 
in massachusetts brountas said this is different this is 
where he is at his best in terms of controlling the situation

christian dior anna pavlova and the empress 
josephine found immortality in the rose garden but the honor 
possibly the ultimate valentines day gift requires luck and lots 
of money 
for centuries rose breeders have named new varieties in honor of 
the heroic the beautiful and the famous but they wont guarantee 
the flower will catch the publics fancy 
it costs up to 62000 to buy the right to name a rose says 
terry kenwright vice president of the british association of rose 
breeders 
he said it can take as long as 15 years to develop a new blossom 
and breeders are businessmen they want some reward for their 
effort 
britains 17 professional breeders introduce only 35 new 
varieties each year on average and only a fraction of those are 
available for private naming 
so rose lovers shouldnt get their hopes too high said dee 
dealtry the associations secretary who fields requests from the 
public 
newspapers charities and big businesses have roses named after 
them theres a chrysler imperial rose and a times rose the everest 
double fragrance is named after a storm window factory 
one of the oldest and most famous cultivated roses is the fragile 
pink flower the french call cuisse de nymphe nymphs thigh the 
british who have grown it for 500 years prefer to call it great 
maidens blush 
a blossom named after a factory might smell as sweet but could 
it so perfectly evoke the silken cheek of youth 
in the depths of winter a rose catalog with its mysterious and 
seductive names offers a promise of spring there is eglantine 
celestial rose damour black prince and the splendid crimson 
cardinal de richelieu 
even rosa horrida described in one catalog as a strange 
gooseberrylike bush from the 18th century appeals to the 
curiosity 
there are dashing dukes grandpa dickson and the dress designer 
dior but the honors go mostly to the ladies penelope ballet 
dancer anna pavlova dozens of duchesses and ma perkins 
roses have inspired wonderful tales about their origin a jealous 
goddess created the flower to rival venus beauty the first rose 
sprang from the sweat of the prophet mohammed or fell from the hair 
of aurora as she combed her golden locks 
one of historys greatest rose lovers napoleons empress 
josephine grew every known rose of the day at malmaison chateau and 
is honored by the pale pink souvenir de la malmaison 
she sent botanical expeditions around the world unhindered even 
by the napoleonic wars and by the time she died in 1814 250 
varieties grew in her garden 
when the british enemy intercepted her plant shipments on the 
high seas they were immediately sent on to malmaison by order of the 
british regent a london rose grower had a pass enabling him to take 
josephines plant orders to france unmolested 
as british troops approached paris in 1815 the empress 
gardener aimee vibert got away with 10000 seedlings a white 
climbing rose bears his name 
the unfortunate atom bomb reputedly quite a nice red rose never 
caught on and disappeared from the catalogs soon after its 
introduction in 1954 
some say the peace rose by any other name might not have become 
one of the most popular modern varieties bred in southern france 
during world war ii and shipped out of the country just before 
hitlers armies invaded it was named in the united states on the 
day berlin fell to the allies 
hundreds of peace blooms were sent to the first united nations 
conference in 1945 it was planted in gardens and at memorials and 
by the mid1950s an estimated 30 million of the bushes had been 
sold 
few dare to speak ill of this famous yellow rose tinged with 
pink but some mutter under their breath that it has no fragrance 
and can a rose be a rose be a rose without perfume

occupying st michael of the archangel church since saturday 
afternoon 
but they cant throw us out she said its our church 
the dissidents originally planned a twoday vigil but have since 
vowed to remain in the church until bridgeport bishop edward m egan 
agrees to discuss their demands with them

and a popular associate the rev roman palaszewski to be returned 
about 20 dissidents sat in the front pews of the ornate 
89yearold church monday morning down from about 80 on sunday 
singing hymns and praying aloud in polish the dissidents say they 
have the support of 800 of the churchs 1200 parishioners 
despite a decision by church officials to turn off the heat the 
group of protesters swelled monday night to nearly 100 many of them 
wearing parkas or sweaters with the temperature outside 35 degrees 
daily masses in both polish and english have continued during 
the protest the dissidents remain inside during mass but said they

talk to bishop egan halina chemiel a spokeswoman for the 
dissidents

parish to other ethnic groups but said they have received 
assurances from the rev daniel pietrzak the provincial for the 
franciscan order in baltimore who assigns priests to st michaels 
that it will remain polish 
he knew that if everybody started coming the polish language 
would die out genevieve kozlowski a parishioner for 25 years 
said of bambol 
the dissidents believe bambol helped engineer palaszewskis 
ouster in december because palaszewski was too active in the polish 
community 
the rev james smyka an associate pastor at st michaels 
answered the door at the church rectory on monday and said bambol 
was not available for comment 
im sorry we have nothing to say smyka said

the impending changeover in the deanship of 
washingtons diplomatic corps is not something ambassadors or state 
department protocol officers like to discuss its simply not 
diplomatic 
its almost as rude as asking an ambassador how much he makes or 
drinking out of a finger bowl at an embassy dinner party 
but the current dean count wilhelm wachtmeister of sweden is 
vacating the post in april and his heir is not so apparent 
wachtmeister toast of society columns and tennis partner of 
presidents and congressmen presented his credentials to president 
richard nixon on june 5 1974 three years ago he became dean of the 
153nation diplomatic corps succeeding soviet ambassador anatoly 
dobrynin 
the popular envoy leaves washington in april a victim of 
swedens mandatory retirement age of 65 
the vice dean of the diplomatic corps cypriot ambassador 
andrew jacovides would be a shooin for the promotion were it not 
for two obstacles the ambassadors of western samoa and tuvalu 
rules of international diplomatic protocol dictate that 
succession is determined by seniority the ambassador of western 
samoa who presented his credentials in february 1978 is next in 
the order of seniority 
but ambassador maiava iulai toma represents the south pacific 
archipelago of 141000 at the united nations as well and maintains 
his office and residence in new york 
there is nothing in the rules that says an ambassador has to be a 
resident of the capital to become dean but state department 
officials say it would not be practical to have a nonresident dean 
for the demanding ceremonial post 
tuvalu a pacific island nation of 6000 is next in line its 
ambassador ionatana ionatana doesnt live in washington either as 
a matter of fact he doesnt live in the united states at all 
actually state department officials say he has been given 
another job back home and is only accredited here on paper 
but who knows we have to call them up and tell them theyre 
next in line they might be sufficiently attracted by the prestige 
to set up shop in washington said one us protocol officer he 
declined to be named it wouldnt be diplomatic he said 
an official at the western samoan mission in new york said no 
decision had been made about the deans post and declined to 
discuss it further its not something you discuss publicly she 
said 
prestige is a strong draw of the job which sometimes elevates 
littlenoticed countries to great prominence 
the guide to diplomatic practice the 1917 manual by sir 
ernest satow that clues protocol officers worldwide on the mysteries 
of diplomatic etiquette describes the dean as the mouthpiece of 
his colleagues on diplomatic occasions the defender of privileges 
and immunities of the diplomatic corps from injuries or 
encroachments 
in practice the dean represents the diplomatic corps at the 
white house every time a visiting head of state comes to town he 
sits on the right of the presidents wife or the wife of the 
secretary of state at official functions he presents the official 
toast on behalf of the ambassadors at white house or state 
department receptions in honor of the corps 
the dean also represents the corps with the state department on 
collective problems of immunity or waivers for customs taxation 
parking tickets and other bureaucratic nuisances 
the deanship of washingtons diplomatic corps has a history of 
great stability nicaraguan ambassador guillermo sevilla sacasa was 
dean from 1958 to 1979 his ouster came with the overthrow of the 
late nicaraguan strongman anastasio somoza by the sandinistas 
he was replaced by soviet ambassador dobrynin who held the reins 
until he was recalled to moscow in 1986 to become secretary of the 
communist partys central committee 
at the ceremony marking the handing of the baton from dobrynin to 
wachtmeister thensecretary of state george shultz joked that it 
was the first case in modern history of a communist handing over 
power to a count 
the chance to joke with secretaries of state and socialize 
regularly with the president is a powerful draw 
its a great honor said cyprus jacovides who presented his 
credentials in july 1979 cyprus which holds the deanship of the 
london diplomatic corps would like to top the washington list as 
well the cypriot foreign service is small and there is good job 
security joked jacovides at a recent diplomatic reception 
but jacovides isnt worried if he doesnt get the job he also is 
accredited to jamaica and the bahamas and is the most senior 
diplomat in at least one if not both of those countries i can 
just be dean there he said

a federal appeals court on monday ordered the 
us department of transportion to require transit authorities 
across the country to equip new buses with wheelchair lifts 
attorneys who brought the lawsuit that led to the ruling called 
it the most important decision ever handed down for handicapped 
people needing public transportation 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals said a transportation 
department regulation requiring all new buses to accommodate 
wheelchairs conflicts with another allowing communities to offer 
only an alternative service such as special vans to the 
handicapped 
the court said a rule requiring reservations 24 hours in advance 
for use of the alternative transporation hinders the spontaneous use 
of mass transit by the handicapped as a result the court ordered 
transit authorities to make reasonable accommodations to their 
programs ie purchase wheelchairaccessible buses 
the court also upheld a controversial decision requiring the 
transportation department to eliminate a cap on the amount of money 
transit authorities need to spend on making transportion accessible 
a coalition of disabled people and 12 organizations called 
americans disabled for accessible public transportation filed the 
lawsuit last year 
adapt contended that a provision of the federal regulations 
allowed authorities receiving federal transportation funds to 
exclude the handicapped from effective and meaningful access 
the provision allows transit authorities to decide among three 
types of handicappedaccessible transportation accessible buses 
special vans for the handicapped or a combination of the two 
us district judge marvin katz overturned the provision in cases 
where the transit authority buys any buses he also overturned a 
regulation requiring authorities to spend no more than 3 percent of 
their average annual operating costs on transportation for the 
handicapped 
katz called the limit arbitrary and said it allowed transit 
agencies to eviscerate the civil right to transit service that 
congress mandated for the handicapped 
circuit judge carol los mansmann in writing the 21 opinion 
also cited congress intent 
congress wanted to provide the disabled with the capability to 
utilize mass transit to the maximum extent feasible the dot has 
failed to show that requiring the future purchase of accessible 
buses oversteps this legislative intent mansmann wrote 
in a dissenting opinion judge morton i greenberg said the 
section requiring new buses to be accessible was not meant to apply 
to transit systems choosing a paratransit system such as special 
vans 
he also contended the 3 percent cap was not arbitrary 
the impact of the majoritys decision will be very substantial 
throughout the country and will interfere with the local 
decisionmaking authority greenberg wrote i feel the court is 
overreaching 
timothy m cook who argued the case before the court said the 
ruling was a major major victory for the handicapped community 
we cant say enough positive things about it 
cook who is now director of the washingtonbased national 
disability action center said he hoped the ruling would not be 
appealed in light of president bushs recent comments about wanting 
to bring the handicapped into the mainstream 
transportation department officials could not be reached for 
comment after office hours monday

full international support for peace and democracy as envisioned

enough dioxin could be getting into milk from 
the bleachedpaper cartons now in use to raise the risk of children 
getting cancer says an environmental group urging the agriculture 
department to require different containers 
the petition monday by greenpeace says the department could 
require schools and other institutions receiving money from it to 
buy their milk in cartons made of unbleached paper glass or some 
other material that is biodegradable and not putting the toxic 
chemical in milk 
the department provides some 5 billion halfpint cartons of milk 
a year through five different subsidy programs 
greenpeace was relying on a canadian government study reported 
last fall that found dioxin leaching from cartons of bleached paper 
into the milk no government agencies have tested milk in the united 
states 
milks high fat content appears to attract dioxin from the paper 
according to janet hieber of greenpeace if the carton were filled 
with water instead of milk chances are the dioxin would have stayed 
in the carton she said 
washington television station wjla conducted its own tests and 
found dioxin in school milk at concentrations similar to those found 
in canada according to roberta baskin a wjla reporter convering a 
greenpeace press conference monday 
dioxin is the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested in lab 
animals but has not been shown to cause cancer in humans health 
agency concerns about human cancer are based on animal studies in 
high doses dioxin is a proven cause of a severe form of acne and 
some studies suggest it can cause reproductive disorders 
paper bleached with chlorine can contain tiny amounts of dioxin 
according to environmental protection agency studies of paper mills 
released two years ago epa said the amounts in products such as 
toilet tissue were too small to be of concern 
the concentration in eight ounces of milk in the canadian tests 
worked out to 06 picograms of the most potent form of dioxin per 
kilogram of body weight for a child of 110 pounds that is 100 times 
the lifetime daily intake that the environmental protection agency 
says will increase the risk of cancer by one in a million 
epas risk estimates for dioxin yield higher cancer estimates 
than those used by other agencies but even if epa cut its risk 
estimate as it is proposing to do the canadian milk would contain 
six times as much dioxin as the amount that would raise the risk of 
cancer by one in a million 
chris lecos of the food and drug administration said the agency 
saw no immediate threat to health that would justify action without 
further data the basic concern is longterm exposure he said 
the canadian study he said was quite limited 18 samples and 
from only one area of canada around halifax 
the agency and the paper industry are beginning a more detailed 
study said carol raulston vice president for government affairs of 
the american paper institute the chief trade group she said the 
study should yield more reliable results in a few months 
the industry is committed to providing safe packaging and if 
theres anything theyre uncomfortable with at fda well have to 
address that ms raulston said 
diane durant spokeswoman for the food and nutrition service of 
the agriculture department said her agency was reviewing material 
provided by greenpeace 
epa spokeswoman alicia tenuta said she had been unable to reach 
agency officials in a position to comment

six months after he first uttered the 
catchphrase 1000 points of light president bush is still 
trying to explain exactly what he meant 
bush said monday that if he makes the point often enough the 
nation may finally come to understand what he was talking about 
the phrase has sparked a flurry of jokes and even a protest 
poster campaign since bush used it at the republican national 
convention last summer to refer to volunteer groups across the 
country 
the boy scouts of america became the latest group identified by 
bush as a point of light during a white house event on monday he 
lauded the group for its accomplishments and said 
if we do this enough and if i make the point how strongly i 
feel about what you do i think the country will understand very 
clearly what i mean when i talk about 1000 points of light he 
said 
bush first used the phrase in his acceptance speech last summer 
saying that the many american volunteer associations were like 
1000 points of light spread like stars in a broad and peaceful 
sky 
the phrase baffled many people and sparked a flurry of washington 
wordplays and jokes as well as a poster campaign featuring protest 
posters that have appeared around the capital with the phrase 
1000 sparks of dissent 
bush has resurrected it off and on since the election on monday 
telling the boy scout group i think of what you all do to help 
others and its clear bright light bright and shining and youre 
an inspiration to all of us

the philippine justice secretary today 
ruled out any talks on the return of ferdinand marcos until the 
ailing former president resolves criminal charges pending against 
him in the united states 
marcos in exile in hawaii since he was ousted in a february 1986 
popular uprising has asked to be allowed to come home to die 
president corazon aquino has refused to allow the return citing 
national security concerns 
the deposed president and his wife imelda were indicted in 
october on federal racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury funneling much 
of it to foreign bank accounts and using it to buy prime new york 
city real estate 
because of his ill health marcos has not been arraigned in 
january he was admitted to a hospital in honolulu for respiratory 
ailments 
marcos 71 was reported in guarded condition monday in the 
intensive care unit of honolulus st francis medical center 
it is difficult to talk about the return of marcos while he 
faces criminal charges in the united states justice secretary 
sedfrey ordonez said in a television interview in case he is 
absolved then we can talk about the issue of his coming home 
if the decision of the american court is that marcos is not 
guilty then thats the time to discuss if he can really come 
back ordonez said 
last week mateo caparas chairman of the presidential commission 
on good government confirmed that he met supposed 
representatives of marcos in the united states but said he ended 
the talks after learning they were not authorized to speak for the 
deposed leader 
caparas commission is trying to recover up to 10 billion that 
mrs aquinos government claims marcos plundered during his 20year 
rule marcos faces 39 civil suits in manila but no criminal charges 
have been filed 
ordonez said criminal charges would automatically be dropped if 
the ailing marcos were to die but that the government can still sue 
the estate

us district court judge alcee l hastings 
impeached last year by the house of representatives is asking the 
senate to dismiss 16 of the 17 articles of impeachment 
the 52yearold florida jurist sought dismissal of 15 counts in 
which the house accused hastings of conspiring with a washington 
attorney to receive a 150000 payoff in exchange for a guarantee 
that two racketeers would not serve time in prison 
hastings was acquitted in a 1983 criminal trial on that charge 
but the articles of impeachment also accuse him of making false 
statements and fabricating evidence in the trial 
hastings contended that an impeachment trial on those counts 
constitutes double jeopardy in view of his acquittal in criminal 
court and also denies him due process because witnesses have died 
and records have been lost 
the motion seeks dismissal of the final 17th article on grounds 
that it is a catchall count aimed at allowing the senate to 
remove hastings from the bench with a finding that he is unfit even 
if a majority finds him innocent on each of the 16 other articles 
the only article of impeachment which hastings didnt seek to 
have dismissed is one that accuses him of disclosing secret wiretap 
information in an unrelated investigation to steve clark the mayor 
of dade county fla

a pittsburgh company will donate 600000 to 
three medical associations to settle complaints of false 
advertising according to the federal trade commission 
general nutrition corp signed a consent decree under which it 
pledged not to make false or unsubstantiated claims about its 
products the ftc said monday 
signing the decree is not an admission of any violations 
violation of its terms can mean a fine of 10000 
the commission said the company made false and unsubstantiated 
claims that its healthy greens diet supplement was effective in 
reducing the risk of cancer 
also the commission said the company falsely claimed that six 
other supplements mainly sold to body builders promoted weight 
loss increased muscle growth and slowed aging 
the consent order was approved by a 31 vote commissioner margot 
machol did not participate the dissenter commissioner mary l

the energy department says it will keep selling 
tritium to private customers despite what it calls an approaching 
shortage of the radioactive gas used in manufacturing most us 
nuclear weapons 
the government has been selling tritium to private corporations 
and research groups both domestic and foreign for decades the 
practice has come under review since the nations only maker of the 
gas was shut down last spring 
the energy department in charge of making all us nuclear 
warheads and their components has cited the risk of a tritium 
squeeze in urging congress to approve construction of two 
newgeneration tritiumproducing reactors to replace the aging and 
inefficient savannah river reactor complex near aiken sc 
the savannah river reactors were closed down last spring for 
safetyrelated reasons and no firm timetable for resuming operation 
has been set 
phil keif a department spokesman said monday officials decided 
to continue the tritium sales since the amounts involved are a 
small piece of total supplies and since the government expects at 
least one of the three savannah river reactors to be restarted by 
years end

duquesne universitys campus newspaper has been 
shut down by the student government in a dispute reportedly 
resulting from a birth control advertisement 
the decision was made because of serious concerns unrelated 
to the dukes editorial content said happy meltzer president of 
the roman catholic schools student government 
but an attorney for the paper joel a klein said as far as 
we know it is over the ad its a form of censorship but its more 
than censorship i see it as the latest attempt to gain control of 
the student newspaper so it is no longer an independent voice of 
the students 
editors recently refused meltzers request to pull an ad by 
family planning services regarding confidential contraceptive 
counseling meltzer said monday the ad was inappropriate because it 
conflicted with the mission of the roman catholic college 
the student government association appropriates funds to various 
student organizations this year it gave 10000 to the duke which 
also generates money through advertising 
in 1984 the university administration suspended the duke because 
of an april fools day parody that included references to sexual 
acts and sex organs 
student government really got on the bandwagon then trying to 
repress the paper klein said its been simmering ever since 
theyre using the ad as a pretext to go after the paper on the 
larger issue of control part of which is its independent checking 
account 
ann rago a duquesne spokeswoman said the university has nothing 
to do with the controversy because it is a conflict among students

japanese construction industry officials and 
academics will visit nicaragua next month to study prospects for 
building a canal linking the atlantic and pacific oceans 
nicaraguas envoy to tokyo said today 
from 10 to 12 builders will go to nicaragua including 
representatives of several major construction firms who are very 
much interested in the project jorge huezo the nicaraguan 
ambassador to japan told reporters during a briefing at the embassy 
huezo declined to identify the japanese firms but said they were 
among the four or five companies involved in a feasibility study he 
said about 20 university professors have also expressed interest in 
the study 
finance minister william hupper of nicaragua announced friday 
that ountry planned to build a canal and welcomed the 
collaboration of any and all governments institutions and 
private companies 
hupper estimated that the feasibility study would take about 
three years to complete and that construction of canal would require 
10 more years 
on monday an official of japans foreign ministry said private 
japanese firms have been holding talks with the leftist sandinista 
government 
he said however that the japanese government will not 
consider participation in the nicaraguan canal project on a 
governmental level because it is working with the united states 
and panama on a project to construct a second panama canal 
under an agreement signed in 1985 the three countries will 
complete studies on alternatives to the panama canal by september 
1990 
at the turn of the century nicaragua was considered as a 
possible canal site but panama was finally chosen the united 
states has a lease on the panama canal until 1999

south floridas weather has been the envy of the 
nation in recent weeks but the abnormally hot dry winter is 
depleting the regions water supplies drying up wetlands and 
hastening the start of the wildfire season 
from lake okeechobee to key west rainfall has been running only 
about 50 percent of its historic average since december 
combine that with temperatures consistently in the low 80s at 
least 5 degrees hotter than normal and you have the makings of a 
drought 
you might as well call it the south florida desert says 
henry larose a hydrologist with the us geological survey office 
in fort myers the trouble is things are going to get worse 
before they get better 
thats because the region is in the midst of its cyclical 
winterspring dry season that doesnt end until june when afternoon 
showers and hurricanefed storms become the norm 
rainfall was slightly below normal last summer and the drought 
began to take hold around october 
what weve had this year is three or four very dry months 
before the dry season even started said steve lamb wateruse 
director for the south florida water management district now we 
dont have any substantial rain to look forward to for months 
normal rain of two inches a month isnt going to solve it he 
added we need several days of soaking rain 
lake okeechobee the 714squaremile heart of the regions water 
system and its primary source of drinking water has been dropping 
steadily since last april and could reach a critically low depth of 
10 feet by the end of may according to water district spokeswoman 
anne overton the lowest level on record came during the drought of 
1981 when the lake dipped to 975 feet 
mandatory wateruse restrictions already have been imposed on the 
gulf coast resort of marco island in parts of coastal lee county 
and in northern palm beach and martin counties 
its not unusual to have wateruse cutbacks whats unusual is 
to have them so early in the year lamb said as far as water 
levels go this is what were used to seeing in late april and may 
not february 
southwest florida homeowners who depend on backyard wells for 
their water needs are beginning to come up dry with groundwater 
levels as much as 8 feet below what they were two years ago 
the lack of rain is also having an impact on the everglades 
which despite some flows of water from lake okeechobee is already 
starting to show subtle signs of springlike dryness areas on the 
fringe of everglades national park that are usually covered in water 
are now too dry to ride an airboat across and some parts of the 
wetlands are hard enough to walk on 
a major concern from the dryness is wildfires which tore through 
the everglades and every region of the state in 1981 and 1985 in 
each of those years at least 150000 acres were blackened and 
hundreds of homes destroyed 
were not only expecting a busy year weve already got a busy 
year said david utley district administrator for the state 
division of forestry we normally only had four fires a week now 
were running out to two or three a day 
even though the fire season doesnt officially begin until march 
state firefighters already have responded to 72 fires this year 
utley said 
were preparing to step everything up to suppress the big fires 
we expect in march and april utley said 
most of the time we just watch the fire to make sure it doesnt 
get too close to a road or a populated area said forestry duty 
officer peter karayeanes we let it burn itself out so we dont 
have to go into the same spot anytime soon 
significant rain is the only hope of turning the dry spell 
around but longrange forecasts from the national weather service 
give little hope for relief they call for more of the same 
temperatures above normal rainfall below

a military technician who was worried 
about the safety of a 4500 infrared light tester used on 
helicopters went to the local hardware store and built his own for 
875 
now after saving the military more than 6 million a year john 
ledoux is getting his reward a check for 25000 
ledoux a parttime sergeant in the vermont army national guard 
and a fulltime civilian employee of an army national guard base in 
burlington vt received a 10000 incentive prize from the 
government more than a year ago 
today he was to receive the larger prize from the federal office 
of personnel management 
im just kind of glad im finally getting the monetary award 
it seems like its a long time coming said ledoux who explained 
that bureaucratic errors delayed the check 
i feel like its been put off for so long its lost its glow 
he said but im glad things are finally coming to a head 
the award is the maximum allowed by law and the largest given to 
a federal employee said joseph jamele press secretary for sen 
patrick leahy dvt he said only 20 such awards have ever been 
granted 
ledoux 33 and father of five said the money would come in handy 
my wife and i have a big family so of course the money is 
nice he said 
ledoux said he developed his handheld device in 1986 after 
watching engineers with the lockheed aircraft corp install infrared 
lights on helicopters using the standardissue testing device which 
was built into a pair of goggles 
ledoux said the engineers often perched in precarious positions 
on the helicopters to test the lights concerned for their safety 
he went down to a local electronics store and picked up a 
phototransistor a lightemitting diode a switch and a ninevolt 
battery after fiddling around with the parts for a couple of days 
he put the device together 
he said it took the army a bit longer to realize the potential 
savings first he sent a diagram of the device but it was only 
after he sent the device itself that the army congratulated him on 
his ingenuity 
army officials are crediting the device with saving 987000 hours 
of labor a year for a total of 685 million they estimate net 
savings of 63 million after subtracting the costs of materials and 
of implementing the device 
jamele said ledouxs buddies in the national guard now call him 
the 6 million man

broussard founded the religiousathletic camp at a rural house 
southeast of portland he also ran the watts christian center in los 
angeles 
prosecutors say they plan to present evidence that dayna was 
struck hundreds of times slammed against a wall and floor and hung 
out a window on the night she died 
defense attorneys have not disclosed what their arguments will 
consist of 
fiftythree other children at the camp were taken into state 
custody after daynas death and authorities said many of them were 
subjected to ritualistic whippings with a paddle or electrical cord 
while the others were forced to watch 
the children were removed from a sparsely furnished farmhouse 
after ecclesia members delivered daynas body to a fire station 
broussard 35 denied that the children were beaten or abused

asias already teeming cities will 
grow rapidly in the 1990s requiring major efforts to provide 
adequate housing communications and transport an asian development 
bank study said today 
the bank predicted that by the end of the century 12 of the 
worlds 25 largest urban centers will be in developing asian 
countries 
they will include the indian cities of calcutta with a 
population forecasted to increase from 95 million to 165 million 
and bombay predicted to rise from 85 million to 16 million 
many of the future super cities are already jammed with hundreds 
of thousands of squatters beggars and unskilled laborers who have 
flocked to urban centers to escape poverty in the countryside 
the population increase will place considerable strain on 
municipal services such as water supply electricity transport 
facilities housing communications and public health services 
the report says 
adequate provision of these support systems will thus require 
major efforts in planning and development it adds 
the study attributes the predicted increase in city dwellers on a 
shift from agriculture to industry and continuing high birth rates 
india will thus have to cope with an additional 98 million 
urban dwellers china with 73 million indonesia with 25 million and 
thailand with 7 million over the 1990s the bank said 
according to the bank asian economies will continue to grow at a 
healthy rate through the coming decade although regional 
disparities will still be profound 
the study says asian nations averaged an economic growth rate of 
more than 6 percent a year in the 1970s and 1980s bringing vast 
improvements in the quality of life in nations such as south korea 
singapore and taiwan 
however the report says that despite all that has been 
achieved in terms of increases in production and improvements in 
social conditions asia still remains the habitat of half a billion 
persons living lives of deprivation and extreme poverty 
it says the number of women of childbearing age is expected to 
increase from 640 million to nearly 900 million throughout asias 
developing countries excluding china by the end of the century 
the need to control population growth will remain pressing in 
lowerincome countries the report says to accomplish this 
emphasis needs to be devoted to the extension of womens education 
and health facilities to greater participation by women in the 
work force and to efforts to encourage delay in the age of marriage 
and family formation 
it says the life expectancy in asias developing countries is 
expected to rise from an average of 64 years in 1990 to 66 years a 
decade later 
however this will range from an average of 52 in nepal to 76 
in hong kong the report said 
the asian development bank based in manila raises funds from 
private and public sources to finance and direct development 
programs within asia advise on economic policies and provide 
technical assistance

opposition leaders have threatened to 
boycott scheduled may 1 elections if the new military government 
does not postpone the balloting to give them time to organize 
early elections do not allow the serious participation of our 
parties on the basis of equality of opportunities without any 
discrimination said an opposition petition filed with the 
government monday 
the petition also calls for creation of an independent panel to 
reform electoral law 
gen andres rodriguez called the election shortly after he ousted 
gen alfredo stroessner in a bloody feb 3 coup ending nearly 35 
years of authoritarian rule rodriguez is the presidential candidate 
of the ruling colorado party which has ruled paraguay since 1947 
the twopage petition stops short of suggesting an election 
schedule though opposition leaders have said they need at least six 
months and perhaps as much as two years to prepare 
if all of our conditions are rejected it would be impossible 
to participate even if we wanted to because none of us are on voter 
registration lists said domingo laino of the authentic radical 
liberal party 
laino said he expected a reply within one week 
the may 1 election date is based on a constitutional clause 
calling for elections within three months of the resignation 
disability or death of a president 
laino paraguays most popular opposition leader and leaders of 
the revolutionary febrerista and christian democrat parties argue 
that since stroessner was deposed by coup that clause does not 
apply 
laino was exiled under stroessner and his party banned along 
with the christian democrats 
opposition leaders say they need time to register their voters 
and campaign to have any chance to unseat the rich wellentrenched 
colorado party 
the provisional government has indicated that voter lists might 
be updated before the election but so far has not said unequivocally 
that it would do so and if so how or when 
an unofficial us delegation led by robert white who was us 
ambassador to paraguay under the carter administration left 
asuncion monday after meeting with opposition leaders and members of 
the provisional government 
i think were going to see in paraguay one group that honestly 
wants democracy and another group that would prefer the status quo 
continued in one way or another stroessnerism without 
stroessner white said 
said former arizona gov bruce babbitt i think not only for 
the united states but for all the international community the 
question that will be most frequently asked is will there be real 
electoral and institutional reforms before the elections 
us ambassador timothy towell met for more than an hour monday 
with rodriguez afterwards towell told reporters we will work 
together to achieve these goals democracy and the respect for 
international norms of human rights 
at least 50 troops were reported killed in the coup which sent 
stroessner into brazilian exile

a summit of five central 
american presidents has become mired in a dispute over who should 
monitor moves that nicaraguas leftist government promises to make 
toward democracy 
the longdelayed meeting an attempt to revive a stalled 1987 
regional peace plan enters its final day today 
nicaragua has pushed for the united nations the organization of 
american states and human rights groups to monitor its democratic 
reforms in the region 
the other four countries el salvador honduras guatemala and 
costa rica want a watchdog commission comprised exclusively of 
central americans 
we have the moral authority to select a commission of central 
americans foreign minister ricardo acevedo of el salvador told a 
news conference 
they are afraid of foreign observers foreign minister miguel 
descoto of nicaragua said of the other governments its 
indispensible if you want to have credibility to have outside 
auditing 
the reforms such as free and fair elections were a key element 
in the august 1987 plan to end warfare and strengthen democracy in 
the region 
nicaraguas neighbors have criticized its ruling sandinista party 
as authoritarian and are pressuring managua to honor the regional 
peace plan by instituting political reforms 
they say the sandinistas have no excuse for not doing so now that 
the contra rebels have retreated into honduras stripped of us 
military aid 
descoto and acevedo spoke late monday as presidents daniel 
ortega of nicaragua jose azcona hoyo of honduras oscar arias of 
costa rica vinicio cerezo of guatemala and jose napoleon duarte of 
el salvador worked in a closed meeting 
arias who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for the plan said 
monday that the summit offered the five presidents a chance to 
regain credibility by getting the peace process moving again 
the plan helped prod the sandinistas and contra rebels into 
signing a preliminary ceasefire in march after seven years of 
fighting but civil wars continue in el salvador and guatemala 
ortega has indicated that nicaragua might hold elections 
scheduled for november 1990 sooner than planned to show that the 
sandinistas are ready for democratic reforms 
he was quoted in todays editions of the new york times as saying 
in an interview taht his government plans to hold the elections in 
the first three months of 1990 
opposition political groups in nicaragua have dismissed promises 
of democratic reform as window dressing and say the sandinistas must 
guarantee the right of free assembly and give up control of the 
electoral system to ensure free elections 
paul reichler a consultant hired by the sandinistas said monday 
that they are ready for change because they now regards the contras 
as a defeated force 
he said the sandinistas also hope to leave the summit with an 
agreement from honduras to dismantle refugee camps for an estimated 
11000 contra guerrillas on that countrys territory 
the regional peace plan specifies that no central american 
country allow its territory be used for attacks on another it also 
bans outside aid to insurgents the contras fled to honduras after 
us military aid expired 12 months ago 
members of the nicaraguan delegation said monday that ortega 
presented a proposal on rebel disarmament to azcona at the feb 2 
inauguration of president carlos andres perez of venezuela 
under the proposal the contras could take advantage of an 
amnesty offered by the sandinistas or go to third countries under 
the supervision of international organizations the sandinistas 
would release the estimated 3500 contras and former nicaraguan 
national guardsmen now in sandinista prisons 
opening the meeting monday the five presidents were encouraged 
by the mere fact that they were together at this beach resort 40 
miles southeast of san salvador 
the summit had been rescheduled and postponed five times over six 
months the last central american summit was 13 months ago the 
original deadline for implementing the peace plan

gov gaston caperton elected on a 
pledge to straighten out west virginias troubled economy proposed 
a massive borrowing program to allow the state to pay its overdue 
bills and build new schools 
caperton fresh from a special legislative session that gave him 
392 million in tax increases asked the legislature on monday for 
authority to borrow up to 765 million more 
let there be no mistake the people of this state need no 
longer despair over the financial condition of west virginia because 
this governor and this legislature will pay their bills on time 
caperton said to applause from a joint session of the senate and 
house of delegates 
in his first state of the state address the democrat presented 
lawmakers with a proposed 1781 billion budget for 198990 with 
budget cuts averaging 45 percent for all state agencies except 
education health and human services 
the current state budget is 1464 billion the state deficit is 
projected to be 260 million by june 30 and 376 million by next 
year 
caperton defeated threeterm gov arch moore last year in a 
campaign that focused on moores handling of the states economy 
which has been battered in recent years by widespread unemployment 
a slump in the coal industry and cuts in federal assistance 
during moores last year in office standard amp poors imposed an 
emergency financial watch on west virginia the states largest 
school system threatened to close down and the state supreme court 
declared the state budget unconstitutional because it threatened 
west virginias tenuous financial stability 
caperton asked for 5 percent pay raises for public school 
teachers and state workers beginning jan 1 but only if the state 
can save 40 million to 45 million in the first six months of the 
fiscal year to pay for them he also endorsed a plan to merge west 
virginia and marshall universities 
the governor said he wants authority to borrow up to 500 million 
for school construction 
he proposed borrowing funds to pay 85 million in backlogged 
insurance claims and repay a 50 million loan from the state 
consolidated investment fund 
in addition he said he wants to borrow 130 million to be 
repaid through tolls as part of a plan to replace the west virginia 
turnpike with the west virginia parkway economic development and 
tourism authority 
caperton also proposed a constitutional amendment eliminating the 
elected posts of agriculture commissioner secretary of state and 
treasurer in 1992

this eastern ohio city he was 77 
wayne hays lived and breathed his job as representative of the 
18th congressional district said john malick a belmont county 
commissioner and longtime friend of the 14term congressman 
no request was denied he was fair to republican and democrat 
alike rich or poor black or white it made no difference

drove him from congress 
about 170 people wore heavy coats and gloves during the service 
in the east richland evangelical friends church after its furnace

were disappointed at the turnout but blamed confusion over an 
earlier announcement that the service would be closed to the public 
hays wife pat had planned a private service but later changed 
her mind said monte beck of the beck funeral home she decided he 
was a public man so why not have a public funeral

mollohan dwva paid their respects on sunday at the funeral 
home beck said 
malick said hays was a gentle man who looked out for his 
constituents and he recalled a day when hays was traveling to 
cleveland and stopped to help a farmer 
he was riding along and saw a cow out in a field calving wayne 
stopped the car got out notified the farmer and stayed there with 
him to help deliver that calf malick said he was an hour late 
for his meeting in cleveland but thats the way wayne was 
hays also was known for bringing prominent people from washington 
to belmont county diab said 
ill never forget when he brought john kennedy here in 1960 
diab said 
you never knew who was going to show up down here with wayne 
malick said hays counted kennedy presidents harry truman and 
lyndon b johnson and former secretaries of state henry kissinger 
and dean rusk among his allies in washington 
hays was elected to his first term in the us house in 1948 he 
became chairman of the house administration committee in 1971 and

a judge who fled colombia after receiving death 
threats from leaders of a major drug cartel has become detroits 
worstkept secret in the three days since a newspaper disclosed she 
was living here 
an executive with the detroit news which first reported on 
sunday that consuelo sanchezduran had been relocated here said the 
publics right to know outweighed any potential threat to the judge 
sanchezs cover was blown further in todays editions of the 
detroit free press the newspaper said she has worked under her own 
name as colombias consul general in the detroit suburb of 
southfield since october shortly after she and her husband augusto 
arrived in detroit 
the free press also identified her current residence by name 
the news on monday identified the southfield apartment complex 
where sanchez originally stayed but did not specifically identify 
the detroit residence to which she was moved last week 
sanchez fled colombia after issuing a murder charge against pablo 
escobar gaviria according to the us drug enforcement 
administration escobar heads the medellin cartel blamed for 
smuggling most of the cocaine that reaches the united states 
escobar has not been tried law enforcement officials who 
requested anonymity say he has offered a 1 million murder contract 
for sanchez members of the cartel are suspected of carrying out 
dozens of killings in latin america and the united states 
a letter from the medellin cartel published in august in 
colombian newspapers threatened sanchez if she signed the arrest 
warrant 
we are capable of executing you anywhere on this planet the 
letter said there is no place you can hide 
the us state department declined to comment on whether sanchez 
would be relocated in the wake of the reports 
frank matthews director of security awareness for the bureau of 
diplomatic security also said he could not comment on whether 
action would be taken against tne news sources which it said were 
some of the 70 local offduty police officers hired to guard sanchez 
a spokeswoman at the colombian embassy in washington who declined 
identification had no comment monday on the news reports or whether 
that nations government would ask that sanchez be relocated 
roberto castro vice consul of the colombian consulate in 
southfield told the free press that sanchez went to work monday but 
was not allowed to discuss anything except consulate business 
robert giles executive editor of the news defended the 
newspapers reports 
you balance whatever the presumed risk to the judge against 
whether the community needs to know about this and there was no 
question to run the story he said 
in reporting on sanchezs current whereabouts giles said we 
recognized that many of the people in the current detroit location 
already knew she was there 
the newspapers case was stated more bluntly by columnist pete 
waldmeir under whose byline both the sunday and monday reports were 
published 
i figure that if i can find out where she is by making two or 
three phone calls somebody with a milliondollar incentive sure 
can waldmeir wrote in reference to the bounty reportedly offered 
by escobar 
sanchez ordered escobar and 15 others arrested and charged with 
murder in the dec 17 1987 slaying of guillermo cano owner of the 
bogota daily newspaper el espectador

a us appeals court ruling requiring 
wheelchair lifts on new public buses nationwide is the most 
important victory yet for disabled americans seeking access to mass 
transit plaintiffs lawyers say 
in its 21 ruling monday the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
also upheld a lower court order that the federal department of 
transportation eliminate a 3 percent cap on the amount of money 
transit authorities must spend to improve transportation for the 
disabled 
the impact of the majoritys decision will be very substantial 
throughout the country and will interfere with the local 
decisionmaking authority judge morton i greenberg wrote in his 
dissent i feel the court is overreaching 
the majority opinion by judge carol los mansmann said a 
transportation department regulation requiring all new buses to 
accommodate wheelchairs conflicts with a regulation allowing 
communities to offer only an alternative service to the disabled 
the court noted that a 24hour reservation needed for the 
alternative service hinders spontaneous use of mass transit and 
ordered transit authorities to make reasonable accommodations to 
their programs ie purchase wheelchairaccessible buses 
the cost of improving transit services for the disabled would 
depend on each system timothy cook who represented the plaintiffs 
has said it costs 15000 to equip a bus with a wheelchair lift and 
buses cost about 200000 according to joaquin bowman a spokesman 
for the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority 
greenberg said the section concerning wheelchair lifts for new 
buses was not meant to apply to transit systems choosing alternative 
transportation for the disabled he also said the 3 percent cap 
imposed in 1986 by the reagan administration was not arbitrary 
a coalition called americans disabled for accessible public 
transportation which has chapters in 25 cities and whose members 
have been arrested at demonstrations around the country filed the 
classaction lawsuit against the transportation department last year 
cook who argued adapts case called mondays ruling a major 
major victory for the handicapped community we cant say enough 
positive things about it 
we won on all points added stephen gold another adapt 
attorney 
cook now director of the washingtonbased national disability 
action center said he hoped the ruling would not be appealed in 
light of president bushs comments about wanting to bring the 
disabled into the mainstream 
transportation department officials in washington could not be 
reached for comment after office hours monday 
adapt contended that a provision of the federal regulations 
allowed authorities receiving federal transportation funds to 
exclude the disabled from effective and meaningful access 
the provision allowed transit authorities to decide among three 
types of transportation for the handicapped accessible buses 
alternative methods such as special vans or a combination of the 
two 
the lower court judge us district judge marvin katz upheld 
the provision but the appeals court said the regulation requiring 
modified buses also applies to transit authorities that have chosen 
alternative transportation as their sole system for the disabled 
the court agreed with katz in striking down the spending cap of 3 
percent of transit systems average annual operating costs on 
transportation for the disabled 
katz called the limit arbitrary and capricious and said it 
allowed transit agencies to eviscerate the civil right to 
transit service that congress mandated for the disabled 
the appellate decision also cited congress intent in ruling for 
the regulation requiring modified buses 
congress wanted to provide the disabled with the capability to 
utilize mass transit to the maximum extent feasible the dot has 
failed to show that requiring the future purchase of accessible 
buses oversteps this legislative intent mansmann wrote 
a year ago adapt identified seattle atlanta phoenix san 
francisco los angeles denver oakland calif johnstown kansas 
city mo and champaignurbana ill has having the most 
accessible transportation systems for the handicapped 
it identified the worst as philadelphia chicago baltimore 
cleveland cincinnati st louis houston san antonio el paso

lanka did not open today after sinhalese extremists issued death 
threats and called a twoday strike in an effort to disrupt 
wednesdays parliamentary election 
i didnt want to take a risk said a colombo grocer who kept 
his shop shuttered after leaflets appeared in the capital on monday 
threatening death to anyone who ignored the strike 
in anuradhapura 100 miles northeast of colombo police shot and 
killed at least four sinhalese extremists and arrested 11 others who 
tried to set fire to buses military officials said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
they identified the dead men as members of the peoples 
liberation front the ultranationalist sinhalese group whose name 
appeared on the deaththreat leaflets 
in colombo the few big department stores remained open but 
small shops whose owners faced the greatest personal losses and 
threats generally heeded the strike call 
residents of the sinhalese heartland east and south of the 
capital said business was at a standstill in their towns all those 
who spoke asked not to be identified out of fear for their safety 
contacted by telephone they said shops were closed in a string 
of coastal towns and villages stretching from colombo to moratuwa 
down to galle on the southwest tip of the island and east to 
tangalle 
many privately owned buses stopped running while

on minority tamil separatists and unknown elements 
the victims have included 14 of the 1396 people running for the

and military have made too many concessions to the tamil minority 
tamil guerrillas whose separatist campaign has claimed 8500 
lives since 1983 say there havent been enough concessions 
the tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of the 
indian ocean island countrys 16 million people 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists account for 75 percent 
there also are small communities of moslems who claim descent from

state attorney general jim mattox said he 
welcomed a lawsuit accusing his office of being lax in enforcing 
child support laws a problem he blames on the legislature 
the lawsuit raises many of the same issues that we have raised 
over the past several years mattox said monday after the 
classaction suit was filed in dallas by the association for 
children for enforcement of support 
we have more than 370000 cases in the system and the 
legislature has given us the money to handle less than half of 
them he said in a statement when they give us the money well 
do the job 
but members of the child advocacy group said maddox is the one 
who should be doing the job already 
after many attempts to get jim mattox to follow the law our 
members are still not receiving the service they are entitled to 
receive said lynda milot benson president of the groups texas 
chapter 
benson said mattox is responsible for locating parents 
establishing paternity for children born out of wedlock and 
collecting child support 
he doesnt do any of that benson said the laws are in 
place to get help and its past time that these laws be followed 
steve levine a spokesman for mattox said the attorney generals 
office has asked for 634 million in fiscal year 1990 and 623 
million the next year for the program that would be an increase 
from the current 398 million

postmaster lane edstrom said workers had put the loveland mark on 
245000 letters from more than 100 countries by monday night

275000 pieces of mail to loveland for its special valentines day 
posting edstrom said 
but mrs thompson thinks the recent wave of winter weather may 
have chilled the hearts of lovers 
the storm in the east probably hurt quite a bit because we 
didnt come up with as many from there as we usually do she said 
the us postal service also put out a list of post offices for 
valentines day postmarks that included loving texas hart mich

pacific telesis is eager to invest in 
japans 1 billion longdistance market now that its become the 
first baby bell to be allowed to tap into a major foreign 
telecommunications venture 
weve been working for more than two years to gain this 
foothold said lee cox president and chief executive of pactel 
corp which heads san franciscobased pacific telesis groups 
unregulated operations 
cox made his comment monday after a federal judge in washington 
dc cleared pactel to take a stake of up to 10 percent of a 
japaneseled consortium that will own and operate a fiberoptic 
cable between the united states and japan 
at the same time us district judge harold h greene refused a 
request by nynex corp another baby bell to take a 50 percent 
stake in a transatlantic fiberoptic cable with great britains 
cable and wireless co 
the approval of pactels request marks the first time since 
greenes 1984 order to break up the american telephone and telegraph 
co that one of the seven regional phone companies has been 
permitted to invest in a major foreign telecommunications operation 
american companies supported by arguments by us trade policy 
representatives have aggressively sought entrance into japans 
telecommunications industry for the past decade 
the japanese overseas telephone market makes 1 billion worth of 
calls a year and is growing annually by 20 percent 
pactel needed judicial approval because of concerns over 
antitrust violations the atampt breakup barred the regional companies 
from entering the longdistance telephone business 
the transpacific cable would run from honshu in japan to 
alaska and then to pacific city ore and is scheduled for 
completion by the end of next year 
greene who said he based his ruling on the commercial and trade 
policy implications of the case dismissed objections raised by atampt 
and mci telecommiunications corp which argued that pactels 
venture would constitute an antitrust abuse of its monopoly status 
as a local telephone utility 
writing that the investment serves positive american 
purposes greene added that without pactels investment the 
united states could also lose a longterm opportunity to influence 
policies that could open more japanese markets 
greenes order said he was permitting the pacific telesis 
investment because the company would only take part in the japanese 
end of the project and could not exercise monopoly power over the 
lines in this country 
he said nynex had failed to show that there is no substantial 
possibility that it could use its monopoly power to impede 
competition in the market it seeks to enter 
unlike pactel nynex would have been responsible for marketing 
the services of its venture in the united states 
greene said pactels lack of marketing involvement made it 
difficult for pactel to discriminate in favor of its transpacific 
customers inasmuch as it could not communicate the necessary 
information directly to such customers 
the consortium is to be named international digital co inc and 
pactel will have one seat on its board of directors to be based in 
japan 
cox said pactels option to be part of the venture would have 
expired feb 23

wanna be another springsteen maybe madonna 
ii 
twentyfive people this summer will get the chance to learn how 
from those who have already made it in the music biz during the 
first rock n roll fantasy camp 
itll be a total immersion into the world of a rock n roll 
star said the programs creator gilbert klein who modeled the 
idea after baseball camps in which fans get to play alongside major 
leaguers 
after getting coached by reallife rockers campers will live 
the dream of everyone who ever played in a garage band performing 
at san franciscos legendary fillmore auditorium 
guitarist craig chaquico of the starship will be among the 
professional musicians instructing the aspirants who must only be 
competent performers klein said monday 
while claiming he could not yet release the names of other pro 
participants everyone weve spoken to has been enthusiastic about 
it he added 
klein said the camp to be held aug 2027 is partly for 
musicians who want to break into the business but its mainly 
aimed toward people who are doing it for fun and have another 
profession they do 
klein fits the latter description himself the owner of a 
combination nightclubbowling alley in the citys haightashbury 
neighhborhood he is a rock n roller from way back he played in a 
band on new yorks long island 20 years ago and several years ago 
formed a group buzzin the system with some of his employees 
once youve played you never forget your instrument and you 
never get rock n roll out of your system he said

seventy drug smugglers were hanged in tehran 
and 25 other iranian cities today an official report said the 
largest number of traffickers executed in a single day of a 
ferocious antinarcotics crackdown 
sixtyseven men were hanged in public at dawn in a blinding 
snowstorm and three women were executed inside iranian prisons the 
official islamic republic news agency reported 
seven of the men were hanged in tehrans shusha and korasan 
squares in a public spectacle that underlined the governments 
determination to eliminate drug smuggling and abuse which officials 
say has become a major problem 
but few people turned out to witness the executions because the 
storm paralyzed traffic in the city more than three inches of snow 
fell during the night 
the mens bodies were cut down from the makeshift gallows after a 
short time instead of being left hanging for a day as has been the 
case with earlier executions 
nearly 200 men and women identified by the official media as 
convicted drug smugglers have been executed since early january 
fiftysix were executed jan 16 a few days before a new law went 
into effect that set a mandatory death penalty for people convicted 
of possessing even small amounts of narcotics 
an antinarcotics task force made up of revolutionary guards and 
the revolutionary committees who have largely taken over law 
enforcement have rounded up more than 2000 drug suspects in recent 
weeks 
scores of heavily armed smugglers have been killed in gun battles 
with security forces in the eastern provinces bordering afghanistan 
and pakistan the main smuggling routes the official media has 
reported 
large quantities of narcotics including heroin opium and 
hashish have been reported seized by security forces backed by 
helicopter gunships 
todays hangings were the first since the execution of drug 
smugglers was suspended during feb 111 celebrations to mark the 
10th anniversary of the islamic revolution 
prosecutorgeneral musavi khoeiniha declared in a recent 
interview on tehran radio this is the end of the line if we do 
not destroy them they will destroy our youths 
police statistics released monday said 3300 drug traffickers 
have been arrested since 1987 and that police had seized 11 tons of 
opium 1540 pounds of heroin and 23 tons of hashish during the 
period 
irna says iran has 1 million drug addicts but unofficial 
estimates put the number at double that 
the execution of drug smugglers has coincided with reports that 
authorities have also executed hundreds of political prisoners the 
mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors the main iranian 
opposition group claims 12000 prisoners have been executed since 
august in a systematic purge of dissidents 
the united nations and the londonbased amnesty international 
human rights group have said at least 1000 have been slain in that 
period 
iranian leaders have admitted that scores of 
counterrevolutionaries have been executed but denied human 
rights violations 
the tehran times daily said in an editorial today that it 
supports allowing a un committee investigate the observance of 
human rights in iran 
the englishlanguage newspaper said it would be better to 
invite them and convince them that nothing unjust is being committed 
and that all is according to law although there may be a difference 
on how we look at it from how they do

concertgoers does it irritate you when someone 
whispers during the webern coughs during the copland sniffles 
through the schumann 
if so youre not alone in a recent survey commissioned by a 
cough medicine company symphony audiences rated whispering 
coughing and sniffling in that order as the most distracting 
concert noises 
what about the doctor down front whose beeper goes off during the 
brahms or the concertgoer who rustles his program during the 
rachmaninoff are they as much of an annoyance as the boor who 
applauds after the slow movement of the quartet instead of waiting 
for the end 
according to audience members at the atlanta symphony the st 
louis symphony and the los angeles philharmonic such people are a 
bother too but not as bad as the folks who rattle candy wrappers 
move around constantly in their seats or try to get into the act by 
singing or humming along 
some of the 2500 symphonygoers who were surveyed also objected 
to the tinkling of heavy jewelry but it was the least annoying of 
the 10 annoyances listed 
when asked the best means of eliminating such noise pollution 
los angeles concertgoers suggested throwing offenders off the 
balcony or cutting their ears off their st louis counterparts 
leaned toward decapitation or banishment to siberia or better yet 
to a rock concert 
others suggested less drastic though embarrassing methods from 
equipping each seat with a red bulb that would light up each time an 
individual made excessive noise to having ushers hand all offenders 
a note stating that they are annoying everyone around them 
the survey was commissioned by the warnerlambert co 
manufacturer of halls cough suppressant tablets 
as part of a promotion called silent nights at the symphony 
during the winter cough and cold season the company has begun 
distributing free samples of the tablets to all patrons of the 
orchestras where the survey was taken as well as to patrons of the 
new york philharmonic and the chicago and dallas symphony orchestras

negotiators for the long island lighting co and 
its 1 million customers were close today to an agreement under which 
ratepayers would drop a racketeering suit in exchange for smaller 
rate increases over the next 10 years 
however it was uncertain whether the proposed settlement would 
include the closing of the controversial shoreham nuclear power 
plant 
we have not reached a settlement but we made excellent 
progress said joseph mcdonnell a lilco spokesman late monday 
night after 10 hours of talks 
he said negotiators at the federal courthouse in brooklyn were 
very close to an agreement and would meet again this afternoon 
a federal judge last week dismissed a racketeering lawsuit filed 
by suffolk county against lilco but on monday he granted the 
ratepayers the right to sue the utility as a class that cleared the 
way for the ratepayers attorney judith vladeck to accept a 
settlement 
the class certification was a useful step in the negotiation 
process vladeck said during a break in the talks 
us district judge jack b weinstein noted that should his 
dismissal be overturned on appeal lilco would be liable to pay the 
ratepayers at least 4 billion in damages and will be forced into 
bankruptcy since its assets will not suffice to pay the judgment 
the settlement talks centered on a proposal to reduce planned 
increases in electric rates by 400 million over the next decade 
weinstein had previously severed the ratepayers case from the 
trial of suffolks suit which ended dec 5 with a jury finding that 
lilco lied to state officials to obtain rate increases and awarding 
the county 228 million in damages 
weinstein on saturday dismissed suffolks suit and the jury award 
on the grounds that the racketeering statute did not apply to the 
case 
an agreement between lilco and its customers would lessen the 
leverage suffolk county could wield in its negotiations with lilco 
over whether to appeal weinsteins ruling 
the county hoped to use the threat of a bankrupting damage award 
to force lilco to close its 54 billion shoreham nuclear power 
plant 
lawyers for suffolk county arrived at the brooklyn courthouse 
late monday fueling speculation that an agreement to close the 
plant was near 
the suffolk county legislature was scheduled to discuss the 
proposed settlement today 
any settlement to close the plant would require the approval of 
gov mario cuomo 
the governor had proposed last year to buy the troubled shoreham 
plant for 1 and dismantle it and allow lilco a rate increase of 63 
percent over 10 years in return however state legislators refused 
to go along with cuomos deal saying it was too expensive for 
consumers and too generous to lilco 
cuomo on monday issued a statement saying he would require the 
ratesaving proposal be adopted and that the legislature would not 
impede other portions of the agreement for the settlement to win 
his approval 
construction on shoreham located 60 miles east of manhattan 
began in 1973 and was completed a decade later but state and county 
authorities have refused to draw up emergency evacuation plans that 
would help the plant win an operating license from the nuclear 
regulatory commission

americas largest and bestknown legal brothel 
the mustang ranch has been given the goahead to become the first 
investorowned bordello through a 233 million stock offering 
my guess is in about 30 days there will be no more joe 
conforte mustang ranch owner conforte said monday the joe 
conforte mustang ranch is going to be history 
the stock offering won final approval of the federal securities 
and exchange commission late friday five months after it was sought 
by an investors group led by two attorneys and a reno businessman 
the mechanics of setting up the syndicate that will offer the 
stock at 20 a share began monday according to kevin ward lead 
underwriter for american wallstreet securities inc of tampa fla 
the primary investors reno attorney peter perry arizona 
attorney darrell rippy and reno businessman donald clough have 
proposed selling 1165 million common shares of mustang ranch inc 
under sec regulations none of the principals could discuss the 
pending offering but papers filed with the agency said the 53 
million difference between the stock income and the sale price would 
be used for capital improvements financial reserves and 
administrative costs 
conforte said he would receive 18 million for the 105bedroom 
brothel if the sale is successful but he does not expect to become 
rich from the transaction 
between my back taxes and the capital gains taxes the us 
treasury is going to end up with most of it or all of it he said 
i owe 12 million to 13 million in taxes and the capital gains 
are going to be 4 million to 5 million you figure it out im 
going to do my bit to reduce the deficit 
conforte was released from prison in early 1985 after serving 18 
months on tax evasion charges 
ward said escrow would not close on the sale until all shares had 
been subscribed to once that happens he said plans call for the 
stock to be traded publicly over the counter 
the brothel showed a decline in gross revenues from 59 million 
to 56 million in 1986 but profits rose from 848000 to 917000 
according to the prospectus 
the prospectus noted that the stock offering is a highrisk 
venture because of potential lawsuits adverse publicity and the 
possibility that clients could contract sexuallytransmitted 
disease including aids 
nevada law requires prostitutes to be tested monthly for the 
fatal disease and so far no prostitutes in licensed brothels have 
tested positive for the aids virus the brothels require customers 
to use condoms 
conforte and his wife sally began operations at the 440acre 
ranch in the late 1950s when prostitution was tolerated in nevada 
in 1971 conforte won county approval for the brothel 10 miles east 
of reno pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in 
most nevada counties 
prostitution is illegal in the counties that contain nevadas 
three major cities reno las vegas and carson city

a strong earthquake measuring 66 on the 
richter scale shook the solomon islands in the south pacific ocean 
the national earthquake information center reported today 
geophysicist bill schmieder said there were no reports on damage 
or injuries in the hours following the quake at 1120 pm mst 
monday 
a statement released by the national earthquake center said the 
quake occurred in the solomons about 1300 miles north of brisbane 
australia 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 
severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of

faststepping secretary of state james 
baker iii today turned his attention to bumpy relations with greece 
and turkey on his tour of all 15 nato allies 
in meetings in both nations traditional enemies whose relations 
with the united state also have been strained baker was seeking 
support for the bush administration as it forms a strategy for 
negotiations with the soviet union 
greece and turkey are the seventh and eighth countries on his 
itinerary now in its fifth day baker is due to return late friday 
the most critical talks wound up monday night in bonn with a 
commitment from chancellor helmut kohl to the principle of keeping 
nato nuclear forces up to date 
but the west german leader facing national elections next year 
in a country where disarmament sympathies are strong would not 
withdraw his proposal for a delay of two or three years in extending 
the range of usbuilt lance missiles which now can fire 70 miles 
kohl has revived a west german campaign to have nato assign high 
priority to negotiating reductions in shorterrange rockets with the 
warsaw pact 
former secretary of state george shultz persuaded nato foreign 
ministers two years ago to give the issue low priority in light of a 
ussoviet agreement to scrap intermediaterange missiles 
lets see what happens at the next nato summit baker said in 
acknowledging that he had not settled the issue in talks with kohl 
and west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
while in europe baker is making preliminary arrangements for a 
nato summit meeting in brussels in may 
in turkey which has the alliances secondlargest standing army 
after the united states modernization ranks high on the agenda 
turkey wants a billion dollars from the united states to refurbish 
troops and jet fighters 
accusations of human rights violations made in a state 
department report last week also are an irritant in relations with 
ankara 
baker scheduled a 2 hour visit with premier turgut ozal and 
foreign minister mesut yilmaz before flying to athens there he is 
to meet president andreas papandreou and foreign minister karolos 
papoulias 
a 1983 agreement to maintain military bases in greece expired in 
december and papandreou has vowed to force a us withdrawal 
negotiations continue and a compromise may be worked out to 
limit the pullout to single installation in athens area the united 
states now operates four large and 20 small bases in greece 
greek officials decision in december to free a suspected 
palestinian terrorist osama abdel zomar put a crimp in relations 
with the united states 
zomar who is alleged to belong to the abu nidal terrorist group 
is wanted for questioning about a 1982 grenade attack on romes main 
synagogue greece expelled him to libya 
greece has not disclosed whether it will allow another suspected 
terrorist mahammed rashid to be extradited to the united states 
for prosecution in the bombing of a 1982 pan am jetliner a 
passenger died in that attack

chancellor helmut kohl met with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and suggested the compromise 
move of producing new shortrange nato nuclear missiles but putting 
off their deployment 
the chancellor also said publicly for the first time monday that 
west germany wants a disarmament mandate built into nato strategy 
that would scuttle deployment plans if progress is made on reducing 
the soviet advantage in conventional weapons 
kohl faces stiff public opposition to deploying upgraded 
battlefield nuclear missiles on west german soil 
during his meeting with kohl on monday baker appeared to soften 
us demands that nato endorse a deployment plan this spring 
the new us secretary of state on an eightday tour of nato 
countries said the two agreed during a very very friendly talk 
to negotiate differences over the nato plan to develop produce and 
deploy new missiles to replace the aging usmade lance missiles 
kohl told reporters individual countries decisions to make the 
shortrange missiles could be approved and contained in a nato 
strategy statement expected this spring while the west german 
decision on whether to accept the new rockets could be made later 
his proposal would serve as a compromise between the us 
position calling for endorsement of the modernization project at the 
nato summit expected in may or june and the bonn governments 
reluctance to endorse a plan so widely opposed by its citizens 
defense ministry spokesman wilfried dunkel picked up the same 
theme during a news conference monday noting that what washington 
decides on production of the new missiles is its own business 
the national decision does not mean an anticipation of the 
alliance decision dunkel contended 
baker said he was assured west germany has not changed its 
commitment to the project 
this was not a decisiontaking meeting baker said that is 
not what we are here for it did i hope clear up some of the 
confusion 
he said his meeting with kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher also covered what steps bonn has taken to tighten export 
controls following us complaints that west german firms helped 
libya build a poison gas plant 
baker said kohl told him in no uncertain terms he plans to 
work out through further negotiations the bonn governments 
differences with washington over upgrading the lance missiles 
the lance system includes 88 launchers and about 700 missiles 
with a range of 75 miles it is scheduled for replacement after 1995 
with rockets capable of reaching targets 320 miles away seventysix 
launchers are in west germany the remainder in italy 
before meeting baker kohl restated to reporters his desire that 
the north atlantic treaty organization delay approving the missile 
replacement project until 1991 or 1992 
by then he said a soviet reduction of conventional arms could 
take place that would allow negotiations on the shortrange missiles 
for eventual removal of all nuclear weapons from europe 
before we lock ourselves in on this issue at the nato 
conference we and the americans need to clear up our positions 
kohl said 
west germany is to hold national elections late next year and 
kohl clearly does not want to jeopardize the governing christian 
democrats chances of remaining in power by taking an unpopular 
stance on the missile issue 
in a statement issued after his talks with baker kohl said he 
reaffirmed bonns willingness to define general defense policies at 
the next nato summit but he did not make clear whether that would 
include support for modernization 
bakers 15nation tour of alliance countries produced some signs 
of reluctance among other member states the danish foreign minister 
told reporters in copenhagen that he expressed support for the west 
german position during his talks with baker 
baker was to visit turkey greece and italy today

officials declared a water emergency 
early today and urged residents not to turn on their taps after two 
water pumps broke and left the boroughs 10 milliongallon reservoir 
perilously low 
the emergency affected some 20000 people in phoenixville and in 
upper providence east pikeland and schuylkill townships all 
philadelphia suburbs said borough manager bill herman who declared 
the emergency at 315 am after the water level dropped to just a 
foot above intake channels 
a hotel fire early friday that killed two people and injured 13 
others may have led to the emergency herman said one water pump 
had burned out a week ago before the fire and the second one 
burned out monday morning probably because of the strain of 
fighting the hotel fire 
more than 200 firefighters from 26 fire companies battled 
fridays blaze at the wall block inn using up an estimated 5 
million to 6 million gallons of water officials said at the time 
that the water flow was so slow partly because of freezing weather 
that a nearby canal had to be tapped to battle the blaze 
herman said another fire could deplete the reservoir in 15 to 30 
minutes and urged people who can still draw water from their taps to 
avoid doing so 
if the system is bone dry and we have a fire obviously theres 
some real problems he said 
a replacement pump was being flown in from memphis tenn and 
was expected to be on line by this afternoon 
its going to have to work like the devil to get the reservoir 
to a point where were going to feel comfortable herman said 
tanker trucks were set up at three sites today to provide water 
to residents and herman said others were being arranged

champagne and pink perrier but the guest of honor didnt so much as 
blush 
thats not surprising she was barbie the doyenne of fashion 
dolls who was honored monday night for her successful 30year 
career as one of the most popular american toys 
mattel inc billed the blacktie affair as barbies pink 
jubilee anniversary party company executives said the lavish 
party which helped kick off the annual toy industry fair was a 
fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable longevity 
and profitability 
whatever the cost is i think its worth it said john w 
amerman mattels chairman and chief executive officer 
although her popularity has waned now and then barbie has never 
fallen completely out of favor she has been one of the most 
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads 
barbie was the nations second biggestselling toy last year after 
nintendo video games according to toy amp hobby world magazine 
each year barbie dolls pull in 450 million to 500 million in 
revenue for mattel

lifestyles and fashions changed over the years barbies clothes and 
accessories kept pace

archbishop desmond tutu today 
urged fellow anglicans to fast three days each week for the duration 
of a hunger strike by about 300 black detainees who are demanding to 
be set free 
some of the strikers have not eaten for 22 days and 21 
reportedly have been hospitalized they have threatened to starve 
themselves if the government does not either release or charge them 
the ministry of law and order said detainees are reviewed and 
released every day and that 17 were freed today two detainees who 
had been on a hunger strike until saturday were freed monday but 
their release had nothing to do with their fast the ministry said 
tutu said he and other antiapartheid church leaders will meet 
thursday with law and order minister adriaan vlok to discuss the 
strike the strongest challenge yet to the whiteled governments 
policy of detention without trial 
vlok has agreed to meet starting today with lawyers for some of 
the detainees and was considering a request to meet with parents of 
hunger strikers 
you know how a mother feels it really hurts said 
neocwaka lamani one of six parents who flew to cape town today in 
hopes of seeing vlok 
she said her 27yearold son tango joined the strike last week 
at a port elizabeth prison where he has been held since june 1986 
tutu who spoke by telephone with vlok on monday described him 
as very concerned the very fact that he is ready to meet a 
delegation of lawyers and church leaders is an indication that he is 
prepared to listen to different points of view 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize called on anglicans 
to fast each monday wednesday and friday in support of the hunger 
strikers 
he said a prayer service will be held thursday at st georges 
cathedral in cape town prior to his meeting with vlok and that 
another service was planned for friday 
the rev allan boesak along with tutu one of the countrys most 
influential antiapartheid clergymen announced monday that he is 
fasting in solidarity with the hunger strikers 
none of us wish to die boesak said in a letter to vlok 
but if this is the road we must take to make you and your 
government understand the evil of your ways we will take it 
boesak 43 is a mixedrace clergyman and president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches tutu said of boesaks decision 
that is how he believes god is calling him 
the strikers include about 170 detainees at diepkloof prison 
outside johannesburg 105 at st albans prison in port elizabeth and 
11 at a port elizabeth police station many have been held without 
charge since a state of emergency was declared in june 1986 
vlok said the meetings with lawyers are part of a continuing 
process of reviewing the cases of an estimated 1000 detainees he 
said those deemed to pose no threat to state security would be 
released 
police have warned newspapers that reports about the condition of 
the detainees might violate a stateofemergency regulation public 
meetings intended to show support for the hunger strikers have been 
banned 
the citizen a progovernment johannesburg newspaper said in an 
editorial today that one of south africas worst stigmas could 
be removed if the government adopted a fresh approach to 
detentions 
business day another johannesburg newspaper asked how many 
more deaths will it take before the decent people of this country 
rebel against the rule of wickedness 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

president jose napoleon duarte 
could provoke a military coup if he accepts a proposal by leftist 
guerrillas to postpone next months presidential election the 
defense minister said 
if the president retains power beyond the end of his term the 
armed forces would be obliged to depose him either the armed 
forces or the legislative assembly defense minister gen carlos 
vides casanova told reporters monday 
duarte should not extend his term to accommodate the rebel 
proposal for elections in september vides said at this seaside 
resort where five central american presidents began a twoday 
summit monday 
the insurgents issued the proposal on jan 24 duarte said the 
following day that he would not remain in power under any 
circumstances beyond june 1 when his term ends 
the farabundo marti national liberation front said it would 
participate in the election if the balloting is delayed from march 
19 to september and certain security conditions are met 
the rebels pitted in a 9yearold war against the usbacked 
government previously had rejected the five national elections held 
this decade as antidemocratic and part of a ussponsored 
counterinsurgency campaign 
the government has described postponement of the election as 
unconstitutional 
asked monday if the elections could be postponed until september 
vides said they cannot 
asked if acceptance of the plan could divide the armed forces he 
said that danger exists then the entire democratic process that 
has cost so much could be broken 
a broad spectrum of political parties and labor organizations has 
said last week that there are constitutional means to postpone the 
election and the united states has called the rebel proposal a 
positive step 
duartes own christian democratic party has said elections could 
be legally postponed and an interim president named by the 
legislature if a political consensus to do so exists 
but the rightist arena party which is favored to win the 
election and the armed forces continue to cite what they say are 
constitutional injunctions against postponing elections 
if the constitution is violated we would be serving up on a 
silver platter an opportunity that could destroy the entire 
democratic process we have worked for said vides 
rebel chiefs may visit san salvador late this week to talk with 
representatives of the countrys political parties who have 
expressed a willingness to do so 
the war has claimed the lives of 65000 people

the supreme court today ordered union 
carbide corp to pay the indian government 470 million for the 1984 
gas leak in bhopal that killed more than 3300 people the worlds 
worst industrial disaster 
the payment is to be made by march 31 as full and final 
settlement of all claims said gopal subramanium an attorney for 
the indian government in its suit against the danbury connbased 
corporation 
india sought damages of 3 billion for the leak of methyl 
isocyanate at the bhopal pesticide plant which is operated by union 
carbides indian subsidiary the civil suit in which more than 
500000 people filed for compensation bogged down in legal 
maneuverings in a series of indian courts 
subramanium said india agreed to drop all criminal charges 
against union carbide officials as part of the settlement 
warren anderson former union carbide chairman was charged with 
culpable homicide in the disaster 
a company spokesman earl slack told the associated press by 
telephone from his new york home that union carbide has accepted the 
470 million judgment and march 31 deadline 
this is a just and fair settlement subramanium told a 
reporter outside the supreme court chambers 
slack said the courts order was based on its review of all 
pleadings in india and the us applicable law and facts and the 
enormity of human suffering that requires substantial and immediate 
aid 
a source close to the case speaking on condition of anonymity 
said an important element of todays settlement was that it called 
for a speedy lump sum payment and was designed to end further 
judicial proceedings including the charge against anderson 
in november 1987 both sides came close to accepting an 
outofcourt settlement of 500 million but that amount would have 
been paid over a decade or more 
todays settlement came as a surprise when the court reconvened 
after lunch press trust of india reported 
the news agency said chief justice rs pathak suddenly 
interrupted union carbide lawyer fs nariman to say the court had 
reviewed the case in detail and considered it preeminently fit 
for an overall settlement in view of the acute suffering of the 
victims 
press trust of india and united news of india said pathak told 
the court the case should be settled and set the 470 million 
figure pti said both sides immediately agreed 
slack said the court directed the parties to submit a detailed 
agreement by wednesday 
according to india at least 3329 people died after inhaling the 
deadly gas that leaked out of the pesticide plant on dec 3 1984 
and drifted over bhopal many of the victims lived in shantytowns 
around the plant 
the government says people continue to die from exposure to the 
gas at a rate of at least one a day 
more than 20000 people were injured by the gas according to 
government statistics 
the indian government maintained the disaster was caused by 
negligence 
union carbide contended the disaster was caused by sabotage the 
plant was operated by an indian subsidiary 
in may 1986 a us court dismissed a suit on bhopal 
the supreme court had been hearing union carbides appeal of an 
order for interim compensation of 166 million ordered in april by 
the high court in madhya pradesh state where bhopal is located 
some initial compensation was paid to gas victims by the indian 
government a sum of 10000 rupees worth about 766 at the time 
was given to the nextofkin of each person who died from the gas 
on the anniversaries of the quake gas victims demonstrated 
against the company and the government in bhopal and new delhi 
saying they were tired of the legal wrangles and wanted financial 
and medical aid to help them rebuild their lives 
the gas leak raised fierce debate in india and abroad about the 
responsibility of multinational countries doing business in the 
developing world critics charged that the multinationals were more 
interested in profit than safety while union carbide officials 
argued privately that they were hamstrung by local restrictions

new york states democratcontrolled assembly 
has rejected after rancorous debate a resolution honoring former 
president reagan and his wife nancy for their eight years in the 
white house 
he made selfishness the national byword said democratic 
assemblyman anthony genovesi he made it legitimate for people to 
say i dont give a damn im not my brothers keeper 
genovesis remarks which drew hisses from republicans echoed 
other democrats who said reagans america left out the homeless the 
poor and organized labor 
im glad hes no longer president said assemblyman edward 
sullivan also a democrat i cant commend him for his years in 
office 
mondays vote was 78 to 58 only two democrats voted for the 
resolution 
the resolution sponsored by assembly minority leader clarence 
rappleyea said mere words cannot express the debt owed nor may 
brief phrases make manifest the leadership rendered 
assembly majority leader james tallon of binghamton implored 
rappleyea to water down his resolution 
tallon said democrats wish the reagans a peaceful retirement 
but in my opinion and in the opinion of many of my colleagues a 
number of the things that were carried out in reagans 
administration were not great successes in the united states 
republicans derided the democrats for voting against the 
resolution noting that new york state voters twice supported reagan 
in general elections 
ronald reagan was a leader who stuck to his guns who made us 
all feel better and made the country feel good about itself said 
republican assemblyman john faso i dont think anyone can 
disagree that the health of this nation is much better than when he 
took office 
if there was ever any doubt that the democrats represent the 
liberal fringe the defeat of this resolution honoring the eight 
years of the reagan administration proves it rappleyea said

the us army must return four watercolor 
paintings by adolf hitler to the children of hitlers personal 
photographer a man found guilty of war profiteering a federal 
judge has ruled 
us district judge lynn n hughes also ordered the federal 
government to return two archives containing hundreds of photographs 
to the familyof photographer heinrich hoffman sr who died in 1957 
two of the watercolors most likely will be returned to hoffmans 
family in germany while the remaining pair will remain in houston 
as part of the collection of billy f price an art investor who has 
been battling the government over their ownership for years 
assistant us attorney frank conforti said the government has 
contended the watercolors legally belong to the united states under 
a usgerman treaty signed after world war ii 
but hughes ruled thursday that the government failed to prove it 
had a legal claim on the watercolors or photographs 
equal justice under law protects people without exceptions for 
those people whose fathers politics were wrong hughes said 
hitler gave one of the watercolors to hoffman in 1936 as a 50th 
birthday present hoffman purchased the others in the 1930s and 
early 1940s 
us forces discovered them in may 1945 in a german castle where 
hoffman had stored them during the war they were mistakenly 
identified as german government property and seized 
after the war hoffman was found guilty at the nuremberg war 
crimes trials of war profiteering 
price traced the ownership of the watercolors in 1982 the 
photographers children henriette hoffman von schirach and heinrich 
hoffman jr agreed to convey a portion of their value to price for 
help in retrieving them 
price said all of hitlers drawings and paintings should be 
studied for clues to his personality and motivation 
he was not a simple man he was very complicated price said 
im not going to let people just say hitler was a monster and 
sweep him under the rug im going to pull him out shake him off 
and study this man 
another hearing is scheduled march 14 to discuss damages and

salman rushdie said today the furor caused by his 
book the satanic verses shows moslem fundamentalist leaders in a 
bad light and makes him wish he had been more critical 
frankly i wish i had written a more critical book he told 
cbs this morning i mean a religion that claims that is able 
to behave like this religious leaders lets say who are able to 
behave like this and then say that this is a religion which must be 
above any kind of whisper or criticism that doesnt add up 
he added it seems to me that islamic fundamentalists could do 
with a little bit of criticism right now 
rushdie regretted the violence caused by opposition to his book 
but denied that it was blasphemous as some moslems contend 
its not true that this book is a blasphemy against islam 
i doubt very much that iranian ayatollah ruhollah khomeini or 
anybody else in iran has read the book or more than selected 
extracts out of context 
obviously its horrifying that people are willing to proceed in 
this way against what is after all one novel in the face of the 
entire history of islam 
asked how he reacts to a death threat from khomeini rushdie said 
i think i have to take them very seriously indeed 
he told abc nightline on monday night 
the blood is on the hands of people who inflame the feelings of 
people who unfortunately have not and cannot read the book 
the idea that this is somehow an attack on the religion shows 
an absolute failure to understand what fiction is he said 
of the novel itself rushdie told cbs 
the sad thing is of course the book isnt really about islam 
its about migration and metamorphosis and all sorts of things 
theres one section where there are two dream sequences in the book 
in which what ive tried to do is write about the birth of a 
religion which obviously is like islam but is a fictional departure 
from islam and in that ive done it from a secular point of view 
if you cant believe in the literal truth of god transmitting 
words to a prophet then it seems to be a legitimate fictional 
exercise to say whats really happening what goes on what is the 
nature of revelation how does a religion come into the world 
what compromises does it face is it tolerant or intolerant 
he spoke about one section where a creature appearing to be like 
mohammed the prophet moslems believe is a messenger of allah is 
given the name for the devil 
the novel is about showing how devils are not always 
devilish rushdie told cbs one of the novels major emphases is 
to reclaim negative images 
my views dont have to be the same as the views of a fictional 
character finally the fictional character is actually losing his 
mind hes going insane hes a paranoid schizophrenic 
now when youve gone to that length to write fiction its 
very odd to have it judged as if you were writing some kind of as 
they say thinly veiled attack it was never my intention

a former mail carrier whose home was 
stacked with tons of undelivered junk mail was sentenced today to a 
year and a day in federal prison of failing to deliver two 
firstclass letters 
william ryan 59 of milton told the court that he felt he 
couldnt deliver all the mail assigned to him on his rural route and 
started leaving a few pieces in his car every day 
things just seemed to snowball ryan told us district judge 
roger vinson 
the firstclass letters were discovered among nearly 500000 
pieces of mostly advertising brochures catalogues sweepstakes 
offers giveaways and other socalled junk mail found heaped in and 
around his home last august 
the mail was found heaped inside ryans florida panhandle home 
about 30 miles northeast of pensacola in a shed his yard and a 
wooded area nearby after postal authorities received a tip 
the mail dated back three years about the time that ryan a 
15year postal employee had been working a rural route in escambia 
county out of the main post office in pensacola 
postal inspectors said about 500 pieces of firstclass mail were 
among the mainly thirdclass items ryan was charged with failing to 
deliver 10 firstclass letters five of those contained tax notices 
from the escambia property appraiser the other five were 
voterregistration renewal cards from the county elections 
supervisor 
ryan was allowed to plead guilty to two of the counts and in 
exchange prosecutors dropped the other eight for the two counts 
he could have received up to 10 years in prison and been fined up to 
500000 
the judge also placed ryan on probation for three years once the 
prison sentence is completed and he ordered him to pay 299194 in 
restitution to the postal service for the cost of maintenance 
personnel use of a bulldozer forklift and trucks and other 
expenses of recovering sorting and delivering returning or 
destroying the tons of mail he failed to deliver 
vinson also imposed a 100 special assessment but disallowed 
10974 in restitution for the salaries of postal supervisory 
personnel assigned to the case 
assistant public defender tom keith argued for leniency saying 
ryan never before had been in trouble with the law cooperated with 
investigators and didnt have the ability to pay a large amount in 
restitution or fines because he was fired from his postal service 
job after his arrest 
im very sorry for what happened the defendant told vinson 
its been a bad year last year for me 
postal authorities say they dont keep records on such things 
but one inspector said the nearly 500000 pieces may have been the 
largestever case of undelivered mail

union carbide corps 470 million 
settlement with the indian government over the 1984 bhopal gas leak 
met with approval today from financial analysts and wall street 
psychologically its terrific financially its reasonable 
said leslie ravitz a research director for solomon brothers inc in 
new york this relieves the pressure on union carbide and the 
stigma 
union carbides stock price soared 212 to 3125 a share in 
latemorning new york stock exchange trading today on news of the 
settlement 
the supreme court of india sitting in new delhi today ordered 
the 470 million payment by march 31 to settle charges resulting 
from the leak of deadly methyl isocyanate at the bhopal pesticide 
plant which is operated by union carbides indian subsidiary 
more than 3300 people died as a result of the dec 2 1984 leak 
the worlds worst industrial disaster 
in a statement from the companys danbury headquarters union 
carbide chairman robert d kennedy said we are pleased that this 
will now provide for the care and rehabilitation of the victims and 
their families and a fair resolution of all issues 
the alternative added company spokesman earl j slack is 
litigation that probably would have extended into the next century 
with the final outcome that would be completely irrelevant to the 
interests of the affected people in bhopal and a continuing drain on 
carbide 
union carbide said it would take a charge against 1988 earnings 
but that it would not exceed 50 cents a share 
slack said union carbide stands by its contention that sabotage 
by a disgruntled employee caused the gas leak the indian government 
had claimed that the companys negligence led to the disaster 
union carbide had offered to pay 350 million as early as 1986 
but even though that settlement was accepted by the us courts it 
was rejected in india 
the indian government which sued the chemical giant for 3 
billion had been seeking about 600 million in a settlement 
i think its a decision that was pretty much anticipated 
james wilbur a vice president with smith barney harris upham and 
co inc in new york said of the settlement you didnt need a 
slide rule to figure out what the settlement would be 
wilbur said union carbide has set aside 200 million toward the 
settlement and had 250 million in insurance coverage leaving it at 
risk for another 20 million as a result of todays settlement 
the risk is minimal he said 
todays settlement comes on the heels of a good year for union 
carbide in the year ended dec 31 union carbide earned 720 
million or 531 a share on revenue of 832 billion that 
compared to 1987 earnings of 231 million or 176 a share on 
revenue of 691 billion

a briton jailed in iran for more than 
three years on spying charges has been sentenced irans official 
islamic republic news agency said today 
the report did not specify the penalty against roger cooper 52 
but quoted iranian intelligence minister mohammad reyshahri as 
saying a heavy ruling had been issued 
cooper a businessman who had worked in iran for more than 30 
years still faced a final judgment reyshahri said he did not 
elaborate and it was unclear whether the sentence might be revised 
reyshahri also announced that 2600 political prisoners will be 
released from iranian jails irna said in the report monitored in 
nicosia 
he said cooper confessed to spying and nothing could halt this 
case 
cooper worked in key iranian government agencies since 1958 and 
began spying for britain in 1966 reyshahri said 
cooper was arrested in november 1985 and his continued detention 
has been a source of tension between britain and iran british 
officials have said better relations depended in part on resolution 
of the case 
reyshahri reiterating comments by interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi said british statements on the case were illegal and 
an interference in the countrys internal affairs 
britain withdrew all its diplomats from tehran and only one 
iranian envoy remained in london after a dispute that began when 
british police arrested an iranian envoy on shoplifting charges in 
may 1987 
iranian revolutionary guards then kidnapped and assaulted a 
british diplomat 
britain reopened its embassy in tehran dec 9 
reyshahri said the release of political prisoners is part of the 
amnesty iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini granted to mark 
the 10th anniversary of the islamic revolution 
he said 3500 counterrevolutionaries were held in jail before the 
anniversary and that 900 will remain there

the disabled american veterans today proposed a 
closer alliance between hospitals run by the veterans administration 
and the military services to save money and improve care 
some 300 installations in the va army navy and air force health 
systems have made 1800 local agreements to share facilities under 
1982 legislation this represents just the tip of a mammoth 
costeffective iceberg dav national commander billy e kirby told 
a joint hearing of the house and senate veterans affairs committees 
both the military and the veterans systems are in deep 
trouble kirby said 
years of belowinflation lessthancurrentservice budgets 
combined with rising beneficiary demands means that beds go 
unused staff quits and care is rationed he said 
va officials testified last fall they will fall 600 million to 
1 billion short in their medical budget for the current fiscal 
year a little over 10 billion for 172 hospitals and hundreds of 
other facilities the military services spend about 8 billion 
operating 130 hospitals in the united states and hundreds of other 
facilities around the world plus 2 billion in paying civilian 
doctors and others 
from the map is it not obvious to all that from the standpoint 
of the proximity of va and military treatment facilities and their 
beneficiaries the two systems enjoy a potential to operate more 
efficiently through sharing of resources mutual support and 
integration of planning and operations kirby said 
rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements 
the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance 
we propose the creation of a new nationwide veterans 
administrationdepartment of defense health care alliance he said 
two huge medical systems which presently go their own way in 
purchasing everything from cat scans to tongue depressors from 
laundry services to public utilities certainly could benefit from 
singlesource contracting and common purchases the dav leader 
said 
combining the patients of the two systems the older males of the 
va system with the younger serving men and women and their 
families should help staff recruiting he suggested

kidnappers released former prime 
minister paul vanden boeynants and he returned home safe and 
sound today after a month in captivity the justice ministry said 
unconfirmed reports said the family of vanden boeynants a 
wealthy businessman paid a ransom of as much as 51 million 
the 69yearold christian democrat was freed late monday near the 
railway station in tournai and took a cab to his brussels home 50 
miles away said brussels deputy prosecutor andre vandoren 
there was no immediate explanation of where or under what 
conditions he had spent the month the justice ministry said in a 
statement that mr vanden boeynants has returned safe and sound 
investigators said they questioned vanden boeynants whose career 
has been tainted by scandal and were satisfied he had been 
kidnapped 
mr vanden boeynants will make a public statement in the coming 
days but give him the time to rest vandoren said 
a group calling itself the socialist revolutionary brigade had 
said it kidnapped him and demanded a ransom the group demanded a 
790000 ransom twothirds of which was to be distributed to the 
needy 
the brussels daily le soir reported in its noon edition today 
that the family paid between 25 million and 51 million to the 
abductors on monday the belgian news agency belga also reported a 
ransom had been paid but gave no amount 
investigators said last month they would not prevent the family 
from paying a ransom it is a free country one official said at 
the time 
le soir said investigators believe vanden boeynants abductors 
fled to france tournai is a few miles from the french border 
the newspaper also reported investigators believe the socalled 
revolutionary brigade was nothing more than a band of criminals with 
no political motives 
this morning vanden boeynants wearing sunglasses appeared 
briefly at the window of his seventh floor apartment to wave at 
photographers and reporters outside 
he agreed to see one photographer catherine benoit of the daily 
la nouvelle gazette 
she later described him as looking tired weak and thin and said 
she photographed him without a flash light because he could not 
stand bright lights 
vanden boeynants disappeared jan 14 after he parked his car in 
his apartment buildings garage where police found his pipe 
hearing aid and one of his shoes 
three days after he disappeared a special parliamentary 
commission was to have opened a hearing into accusations he took 
bribes while defense minister in the 1970s the commission later 
said there were no grounds for prosecution and dropped the 
investigation 
vanden boeynants was a major player in postwar belgian politics 
until a conviction for business tax fraud ended his political career 
in 1986 
after the disappearance prime minister wilfried martens said 
vanden boeynants had received threats in the preceding weeks he did 
not disclose their nature vanden boeynants also had requested a 
meeting with the interior minister presumably to discuss his 
personal safety 
vanden boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and briefly 
in 1978 he was a skilled backstage negotiator during 40 years in 
politics and had a hand in most major government decisions 
he also made a fortune in the meatpacking industry and got into 
trouble over taxes the judge who gave him a threeyear suspended 
sentence in 1986 called the former prime minister an inveterate 
swindler for whom tax evasion is second nature

with winds gently rocking his balloon and 
tiny gondola fumio niwa rose into the nighttime sky early wednesday 
on what he hopes will be the first solo balloon flight across the 
pacific 
niwa plans to ride high altitude winds across the ocean to north 
america in about four days 
his goal is san diego sister city of his home town of yokohama 
but weather reports said the normally easterly high altitude winds 
had veered to the north and were likely to take him toward alaska 
my long dream of crossing the pacific is coming true today 
niwa said i still wonder if its really possible the jetstream 
is bending strangely but america is big so i think ill make it 
somewhere 
the huge orange and blue balloon has no maneuvering ability so 
its direction depends entirely on the wind 
niwa 38 says hes making the 5000mile flight to test the 
hightech helium balloon and enclosed gondola he designed himself 
the balloonist who quit his job in a computer company in 
november to prepare for the flight estimates it will cost about 
540000 he hopes to earn most of that from a future book and 
public appearances 
niwa has about 1000 hours of ballooning experience but most of 
that is in hotair balloons and none outside japan

their names have disappeared from ships and cities 
but the likenesses of former soviet leaders josef stalin and leonid 
brezhnev can still be found in moscow 
a weekend outing to moscows ismailovo park an open marketplace 
for artists and craftsmen provides ample exposure to the latest in 
stalin and brezhnev bashing 
a cluster of halloweentype masks with ghoulish faces realistic 
enough to make boris karloff shriek in terror includes stalin and 
brezhnev both now disgraced in official and unofficial circles 
the brezhnev mask complete with bushy black eyebrows 
eyeglasses and wrinkles was selling for about 40 a visage of 
stalin selling for the same price had a thick mustache and a large 
nose to mock his georgian origins 
hanging on a piece of plywood next to stalin and brezhnev were 
masks of a gorrilla and various monsters 
other soviets have joined in the artistic parody in the form of 
political buttons tshirts paintings and even wooden dolls of 
stalin complete with legendary pipe in one hand and a bloody dagger 
in the other 
under mikhail s gorbachev stalin has been criticized for 
killing millions of people with his bloody purges and brezhnev has 
been hit for ruining the countrys economy and culture 
homemade political buttons for sale at the park offer such 
commentary as boris you are right referring to former moscow 
party chief boris yeltsin who lost his job for pushing too hard for 
reform and yegor you are not right referring to conservative 
politburo member yegor ligachev 
another identifies the wearer as a veteran of the cold war

the immigration and naturalization 
service will stop processing amnesty applicants in a building which 
city officials cloed last week because of health and safety 
violations an ins official said today 
armed with bolt cutters and a temporary restraining order ins 
officials on monday returned to the former furniture store where the 
agency processes more than 2000 political asylum applicants weekly 
officials in this small south texas town have complained that 
refugees most of them from central america had left the building 
and surrounding area cluttered with litter and human waste 
ins district director omer g sewell said today the agency would 
no longer process asylum applications in harlingen and would handle 
the south texas cases at the ins detention center in brushland about 
25 miles from town 
candidates seeking amnesty under the 1986 immigration reform law 
will continue to be served at the harlingen building he said 
we want to be good citizens in this community as well sewell 
said 
the new asylum office will open wednesday at the agencys port 
isabel service processing center a minimumsecurity facility where 
425 undocumented aliens were detained tuesday pending action such as 
deportation 
ins officials cut through the chains and padlocks on the doors 
monday afternoon after us district judge filemon vela in 
brownsville set aside a 3dayold state court order evicting the 
federal agency fridays eviction was ordered after harlingen 
officials sued to shut down the office for fire and health 
violations 
the ins successfully moved the harlingen lawsuit from state to 
federal court monday and filed its own federal lawsuit against the 
city 
vela said he set aside the state court order because it 
prohibits the functions and operations of an agency of the federal 
government 
the judge also barred harlingen 25 miles north of brownsville 
from interfering with ins business but said the agency still must 
follow state and local health and fire regulations he set a hearing 
in the case for feb 21 
harlingen city manger gavino sotelo said the city would comply 
with the order but added the conditions at the center remain the 
same as they were before there is trash there is human waste if 
this goes on we might have to close it all over again 
harlingen mayor bill card added if it had been operated in a 
responsible way before it would have never been closed 
city officials promised to monitor the office and make regular 
inspections 
sewell said barring the ins from the 9852squarefoot building 
not only shut down the political asylum process but also made it 
impossible to serve legalization candidates under the immigration 
reform and control act of 1986 
vela said the state courts restraining order issued friday 
interfered with the ins compliance with a federal temporary 
restraining order he issued jan 9 that order mandated the ins to 
allow political asylum applicants to pursue their claims to refugee 
status at their intended us destinations after checking in with 
the ins in harlingen 
with the harlingen office closed immigrants could not obtain 
documents allowing them passage through us border patrol 
checkpoints to leave southern texas 
hundreds of immigrants in the centers parking lot appeared 
puzzled by the legal maneuverings 
we didnt know what was going to happen said juan hernandez 
from el salvador we were just told to wait

four years to satisfy the rotc contractual agreement he said 
in august swanson who lives with his wife in west suburban 
naperville asked a military review board to recommend that he 
become commissioned as an army officer 
but after an administrative hearing at fort sheridan the board 
recommended that swanson be kicked out of the service and his rotc 
scholarship terminated 
swanson said he wrote wagner in november saying that while he 
wanted his officers commission he would equally welcome entering 
the army as an enlisted man 
in the letter swanson expressed regret for his actions saying 
he had made a mistake and wished to deal with it in an upright

william j bennett president bushs nominee to 
become drug czar struck it rich on the lecture circuit after 
resigning as education secretary last september picking up 15000 
to 20000 per speech 
i had a good few months in the private sector the best three 
to four months i ever had bennett said i was told it would 
have been a very good year for me 
if the senate confirms bushs nomination of bennett to become 
director of the office of national drug control policy bennett will 
be paid 99500 a year 
bennett turned down 15 million in lectures in 1989 when 
bush nominated him last month according to a lecturecircuit 
industry source who requested anonymity 
bennett reported having a savings account worth less than 1001 
on sept 20 when he resigned as education secretary 
bennett and his wife elayne who are expecting a second child 
live with their 5yearold son john in a rented home in nearby 
montgomery county md he says that we cant buy a house where we 
want to live on these salaries 
during the past few months bennett was earning 15000 to 
20000 per speech for a total of about 150000 to 200000 
which was just getting his feet wet said don walker president of 
the new yorkbased harry walker agency which got 30 percent of the 
fees 
well we had a good christmas bennett said reflecting on 
the likelihood that hell be taking home a lot less this year his 
government salary 
his earnings during the past few months should be reflected in 
the latest financial disclosure form he submitted to the white house 
counsels office but the form has not yet been made public such 
forms give only ranges not exact figures 
according to bennetts most recent publicly released form 
covering 1988 up to sept 20 indicates in addition to the savings 
account that bennett and his wife had checking accounts of less than 
1001 apiece a retirement annuity worth 50001 to 100000 an 
undisclosed salary for his wife from georgetown university funded by 
a foundation based there and a brokerage account worth 1001 to 
5000 
that brokerage account is with the san francisco office of bear 
stearns amp co the same office that handled many lucrative oneday 
trades for nowindicted w franklyn chinn who was managing money 
for former attorney general edwin meese iii when meese and bennett 
were in reagans cabinet 
oh god no bennett said when asked whether he knew of the 
connection between that office and chinn who is awaiting trial on 
racketeering charges in the wedtech defense contracting scandal i 
didnt know that 
bennett said his account was in that office because his broker 
reed freyermuth is a college friend 
bennetts financial disclosure forms for the past few years 
reveal that he had 18 oneday or twoday stock trades handled by 
that office including three involving stocks traded the same day by 
chinn for meese 
bear stearns had an underwriting position in all three of those 
new issues of stock making it likely that many of the firms 
customers would have been guided toward them 
trade in british airways stock on feb 11 1987 earned bennett

cooperation between military and veterans 
hospitals should be expanded to save money and improve care the 
disabled american veterans said tuesday 
the three military hospital systems and the veterans 
administration system are in deep trouble because of years of 
financial starvation in the face of growing patient demands said 
billy e kirby national commander of the group 
lack of money has brought about losses of staff and beds and a 
rationing of care he said at a joint hearing of the house and 
senate veterans affairs committees 
in 1982 congress permitted local installations to agree with 
their neighbors in another hospital system to share facilities for 
example to send over patients needing a cat scan rather than buy a 
second scanner 
there are now 1800 agreements involving 300 installations and 
that cooperation represents just the tip of a mammoth 
costeffective iceberg said kirby 
rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements 
the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance 
we propose the creation of a new nationwide veterans 
administrationdepartment of defense health care alliance he said 
however thomas keller dav spokesman said outside the hearing 
room the group was not propopsing a full merger of the systems and 
each would keep its own administration 
both donna st john spokeswoman for the veterans administration 
and susan hansen spokeswoman for the defense department said they 
could not comment on kirbys proposal because officials had not seen 
it 
each said the local cooperation agreements were working well and 
saving money 
kirby said two huge medical systems which presently go their 
own way in purchasing everything from cat scans to tongue 
depressors from laundry services to public utilities certainly 
could benefit from singlesource contracting and common purchases 
also he suggested that access to a more varied pool of patients 
combining the generally older males using the va systems with the 
serving men and women and their families using the military 
hospitals should help in the recruitment of medical staff 
the veterans administration spends more than 10 billion a year 
on 172 hospitals 229 outpatient clinics 117 nursing homes and 208 
other installations officials testified last fall they expect to 
fall 600 million to 1 billion short during the current fiscal 
year a shortage many members of congress have said will have to be 
met through a supplemental appropriation and one the va has so far 
met by juggling accounts and turning away some patients it is not 
required to treat 
the army navy and air force operate 500 medical installations 
including 130 hospitals in the united states the three services 
spend about 10 billion a year on medical care of which about 2 
billion goes to civilian providers

consumer spending began the year on a sunny 
note as retail sales rose 06 percent in january the government 
said tuesday in a report that added to concerns the economy is 
speeding forward so quickly it may fuel inflation 
the commerce department said sales rose last month to a 
seasonally adjusted 1389 billion that followed a revised 01 
percent decrease in december and a 13 percent increase in november 
consumers were in a pretty good mood when they started 
january said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch amp co in 
new york good weather got them into shopping malls and they were 
spending money despite higher interest rates they did not feel 
pinched 
januarys increase was bolstered by a 17 percent increase in the 
important general merchandise category which includes department 
stores sales in that category had inched up 01 percent in december 
major department store chains reported their january sales had 
been aided by mild winter weather which encouraged shoppers and 
added to sales volume in addition lean inventories resulted in 
higher prices which boosted overall sales figures 
some analysts said the latest retail sales report coupled with 
other evidence of strong economic growth at the start of the year 
could lead the federal reserve board to continue to nudge up 
interest rates in its ongoing effort to slow the economy and keep 
inflation in check 
the economy will continue to exceed the speed limit on 
average in the quarter ahead said robert g dederick chief 
economist for northern trust co in chicago the federal reserve 
will have to move toward further restraint 
the unexpectedly strong january sales performance came despite a 
09 percent drop in car sales which followed a 04 percent dip in 
december sales had weakened in early january as manufacturers ended 
steep yearend discounts 
excluding autos which account for about onefourth of the retail 
total sales in january were up 1 percent following an unchanged 
sales pace in december 
people are making a lot of money and theyre feeling very good 
and theyre still going out there buying said economist sandra 
shaber of the futures group in washington i suspect that is going 
to continue happening until the economy runs out of steam we cant 
count on the consumer to slow the economy down 
steinberg predicted the pace of retail sales would decrease later 
this year as consumer spending is restrained by a slowdown in 
employment gains and by higher interest rates including rising 
monthly payments for homeowners with adjustablerate mortgages 
retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic health 
because it represents about onethird of the gross national product 
sales of durable goods big ticket items intended to last 
three or more years edged up 01 percent in january after an 
identical rise in december nondurable goods surged 08 percent 
after dropping 02 percent during the previous month 
the only merchandise category besides autos to record a decrease 
in january was clothing and accessory stores where sales fell 11 
percent 
drugs stores reported a 29 percent increase in sales after a 27 
percent decrease in december sales at restaurants and bars were up 
12 percent after a 11 percent increase during the previous month 
furniture and home furnishing sales were up 04 percent in 
january after a 11 percent drop in december sales of hardware and 
building supplies rose 14 percent after a 2 percent increase the 
previous month 
grocery and other food store sales were up 1 percent after a 09 
percent drop gasoline station sales also were up 1 percent last 
month after the same increase the previous month

a woman was sentenced today to 12 years in 
prison for forcefeeding her adopted 4yearold daughter a fatal 
dose of salt as punishment for stealing sugar 
beth michelle riggs 36 wept as roanoke county circuit judge 
kenneth trabue imposed the sentence on her seconddegree murder 
conviction in the may salt poisoning death of heather riggs 
commonwealths attorney skip burkart had asked for the maximum 
sentence of 20 years saying mrs riggs had deprived her daughter of 
most of her life expectancy 
maybe we ought to feed her 56 spoons of salt and see how she 
likes it burkart said noting that that amount of salt would be 
an equivalent dose for an adult 
but we cant do that everybody on earth would come forward and 
say thats cruel and unusual burkart said 
defense attorney james swanson asked for a prison senence of 12 
years to be suspended after six years he said the case didnt call 
for the maximum because mrs riggs never intended to kill her 
daughter 
mr burkart preaches an eye for an eye but then says society 
wouldnt put up with it swanson said i think the whole sense 
of an eye for an eye given these facts is not justice 
earlier today mrs riggs testified that she forcefed the child 
an undetermined number of spoonfuls of salt on may 16 as punishment 
for stealing sugar but had no idea the salt would prove fatal 
if i had known it was going to hurt her i would never have 
done it said mrs riggs who had punished the child on a separate 
occassion by forcing her to eat pepper 
mrs riggs indicated that she had been having a lot of trouble 
with heather eating food without permission county probation 
officer donna w clayton said ms clayton testified that mrs riggs 
told her she had fed the girl a mixture of salt and sugar to show 
heather she shouldnt just eat any or everything

the traditional classroom with its lecturing 
teachers and workbooks is turning out students with basic skills 
but little more says a report issued tuesday 
the national assessment of educational progress called for major 
changes in how and what american students are taught based on 20 
years of evaluations that indicate a disturbing lack of highlevel 
achievement across the board 
it is apparent that fundamental changes may be needed to help 
american schoolchildren develop both content knowledge and the 
ability to reason effectively about what they know skills that are 
essential if they are to take an intelligent part in the worlds of 
life and work said the report 
the group credited relatively traditional classrooms relying 
heavily on textbooks workbook exercises and teacher presentations 
with gains at the lower levels of achievement 
but it said teachers will have to become less authoritarian and 
students less passive if more sophisticated learning is to occur 
discussion teams cooperative work groups individual learning 
logs computer networking and other activities will need to be added 
and may even predominate the report said 
the group has studied the math science reading and writing 
performance of 9 13 and 17yearolds for 20 years under the 
auspices of the private educational testing service some 14 
million pupils have participated in the studies which are paid for 
by the education department 
the groups latest observations come in crossroads in american 
education a review of trends in all four subject areas since the 
first assessment in 1970 
not all the news was bad 
our assets clearly include strengthening students basic skills 
and improving minority student performance said executive 
director archie lapointe but echoing the conclusions of numerous 
recent reports he added that we find deficits in higherorder 
thinking skills 
the report said reading proficiency has improved and earlier 
declines in math writing and science appear to have been reversed 
in addition it said gaps between minority and white student 
performance have been reduced considerably in certain subjects 
but the report noted that not all lost ground has been regained 
and even the benchmark the earliest assessments is considered 
below par furthermore it said recent gains have been mostly at 
the lower levels 
for example students have improved in their ability to do 
simple computation comprehend simple text and exhibit knowledge of 
everyday science facts the report said yet despite these signs 
of progress it remains true that only some of the nations students 
can perform moderately difficult tasks and woefully few can perform 
more difficult ones 
the group said more homework higher performance standards and 
more course work in core subjects all elements of the current 
education reform movement can help improve performance 
leading the group to its recommendations were findings such as 
these 
about onethird of 9yearolds could not yet read simple texts 
and about onequarter did not have beginning math skills or 
understand simple scientific principles such as the structure and 
function of plants and animals 
more than onequarter of 13yearolds failed to demonstrate an 
adequate understanding of elementary school math skills forty 
percent could not read passages at an intermediate level of 
difficulty only half displayed an understanding of basic scientific 
information 
sixtyone percent of 17yearolds could not read or understand 
highschool level material while nearly half had no math skills 
beyond adding subtracting and multiplying with whole numbers 
the general trends were slightly more encouraging students at 
all three ages were reading significantly better in 1984 than in 
1971 math proficiency among the two younger groups was better in 
1986 than in 1973 and the oldest teens improved significantly in 
1982 and 1986 after a nineyear decline 
drops in science in all age groups appear to have been stemmed 
although no group was doing better than its 1970 level as of 1986 
and writing proficiency across the ages generally appeared to be 
no better in 1984 than it was 10 years earlier

a warning light prompted the pilot of a british 
airways boeing 757 jetliner with 40 people aboard to turn off an 
engine but the plane landed safely using its other engine the 
airline said tuesday 
a small temperature rise in the righthand engine turned on the 
firewarning light during mondays flight the airline said as a 
result the pilot shut down the engine as the plane approached 
londons heathrow airport 
flight 391 from brussels landed safely powered only by the 
lefthand engine the spokeswoman said 
engineers found no incorrect wiring or other faults in the 
righthand engine the spokeswoman said she said the cause of the 
temperature increase was unknown 
authorities ordered a check of wiring in several types of 
aircraft after a boeing 737 crashed last month in central england 
and killed 47 people the crash whose cause in still under 
investigation led to speculation that a warning light could have 
led the pilot to unnecessarily shut off an engine

president bush weighing an issue that could 
alter the basis of nuclear negotiations has postponed a decision on 
whether to continue building mx missiles or switch to the smaller 
singlewarhead midgetman his spokesman said tuesday 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush will not 
meet a wednesday deadline imposed by congress for a decision 
we are reviewing the entire strategic posture of the country 
and it is logical and necessary that we postpone this major decision 
until the review is complete fitzwater said 
because of the review the administration also has put off 
resuming nuclear arms control talks with the soviet union they were 
to have started anew in geneva on wednesday 
in an era of tight budgets and big deficits it is generally 
agreed the pentagon cannot build both the 10warhead mx missile and 
the singlewarhead midgetman 
trying to force a decision from the white house congress last 
year stipulated that 350 million which was earmarked for the mx 
program could not be spent until the new administration announced 
how it would proceed 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser has 
argued for years that a singlewarhead missile such as the midgetman 
weighing about 15 tons as opposed to 100 tons for the mx could 
ease a soviet threat to us landbased missiles in fixed silos 
a smaller missile with only one warhead would be a far less 
tempting target to soviet war planners it is reasoned and could be 
the basis for arms control agreements based on counting the number 
of warheads not launchers 
currently the number of launchers is the key element in arms 
control agreements that has spurred development of multiple warhead 
weapons such as the triple warhead minuteman and the 10warhead mx 
and similar weapons in the soviet arsenal 
in 1983 scowcroft was head of a presidential commission on 
strategic forces during the reagan administration and advocated 
development of the midgetman he has not publicly endorsed either 
the mx or the midgetman since joining bushs administration 
fitzwater said the white house will send a report to congress on 
wednesday explaining that the administration is conducting a review 
but omitting any decision regarding the mx or midgetman or other 
type of small intercontinental ballistic missiles 
he said he could not estimate when the white house would reach a 
decision but noted that bush has instructed advisers to report 
within 90 days on the overall review of national security policy 
the spokesman said that the stalled confirmation process 
surrounding john towers nomination as secretary of defense had not 
been a factor in delaying the missile decision hes in on much of 
the review fitzwater said

the last red army soldiers climbed 
aboard giant miitary transport planes and flew home tonight a 
soviet officer said leaving afghan armed forces to defend the 
embattled capital alone for the first time in nine years 
just hours before the soviets departed moslem guerrillas fired 
five rockets into kabul killing four children and an adult and 
hitting kabul airport according to official reports 
reporters watched as at least 80 soviet soldiers boarded giant 
il76 planes earlier it had been thought only about 40 soviet 
troops remained in kabul the day before the wednesday deadline set 
under a unsponsored agreement for the withdrawal of the red army 
lt col pytor sardarchuk declined to say exactly how many troops 
were leaving all those who are left were going he said 
then he turned to reporters watching the final departure shook 
their hands and said goodbye 
earlier moslem guerrillas launched their first attack in more 
than a month on kabul airport the capitals key link with the 
outside world 
the rockets came crashing down near a runway but no one was 
injured soviet soldiers said after the attack 
they were stationed at the airport guarding military transports 
delivering food and other supplies to the besieged capital 
radio kabul said one of the rockets exploded in a bazaar where 
dozens of people were lining up to buy bread the blast killed four 
children and an old man it said 
moscow sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to support 
the marxist governments battle against moslem guerrillas at one 
point the kremlin had an estimated 11500 troops in afghanistan 
besides the small contingent of soldiers who flew out tonight 
several thousand red army troops were approaching the soviet border 
soviet diplomats said they spoke on condition of anonymity 
with the soviet departure over kabul was generally quiet there 
were few rockets whizzing back and forth and the markets were 
crowded 
however residents said letters unsigned and delivered the past 
few nights warn people to stay off the streets starting wednesday 
many residents believed the letters came from the guerrilla forces 
bearing down on the city 
the letters have prompted worry that attacks will resume after 
the soviets leave 
written in the local dari language the letters warn residents to 
stay off the streets close their shops and keep away from the 
airport 
some foreign diplomats suggested the letters might be the work of 
khadd the najib governments secret police 
a un airlift of food to kabul where food and fuel are in short 
supply has been suspended because transport crews fear for their 
safety 
guerrilla attacks and heavy show have delayed soviet convoys 
carrying food fuel and other supplies into the capital there have 
been long lines at bakeries and gasoline stations in kabul 
one soviet convoy arrived overnight after traveling down the 
salang highway into the city of more than 2 million 
the soviet union also has been airlifting up to 600 tons of flour 
and other goods to kabul in an effort to help ease shortages but 
the supplies are handed out to government workers and members of the

the spacecraft separation occurred on time and everything looks 
fine said lt col ron rand the air force launch commentator 
on thursday an onboard motor will fire to shift the satellite 
into a circular orbit in which both the high and low points will be 
about 11000 miles high 
the launch was postponed sunday just 13 minutes before the 
planned liftoff after balloon data showed that winds several miles 
above the launch pad were too strong for the rocket to pass through 
safely 
rand reported the winds today had shifted to a more favorable 
direction and had calmed 
aboard the delta 2 for its maiden flight was a 65 million 
navstar global position system payload that will enable us and 
allied military units such as ships planes submarines and tanks to 
locate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel 
the accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet 
the satellite which contains an atomic clock with an error rate 
of one second every 300000 years was designed to provide 
information on longitude latitude and altitude 
the delta 2 is a more powerful model of the delta 1 which has 
logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960 it is the first of 
three new space boosters the air force ordered built to carry 
national security payloads after the challenger exploded in 1986 
the grounding of the shuttle fleet and the air force titan 34d 
rocket also after a 1986 failure has left the pentagon with a 
backlog of about 40 reconnaissance communications navigation and 
other military satellites 
the new titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month 
with the atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch

the soviet media that for years failed to tell the 
soviet people their sons were fighting in afghanistan said tuesday 
the red armys withdrawal could turn the moslem country into a 
second lebanon 
one newspaper on the eve of the soviet withdrawal deadline quoted 
a combathardened army major as asking why so many soviet soldiers 
had to die 
was this war necessary for us were our numerous casualties 
justified said maj pavel pinchanov a 32yearold combat veteran 
quoted by the labor newspaper trud in an article headlined the 
last march it said those questions are shared by soldiers and 
civilians alike 
the article did not give any casualty figures and soviet media 
generally skirt the issue government spokesmen have said 15000 
soviet soldiers died and more than 35000 were wounded in the 
nineyear war 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began may 
15 1988 under a unmediated agreement wednesday is the deadline 
for all to be gone 
when soviet soldiers began fighting in afghanistan their own 
newspapers were silent even parents of the early casualties were 
told their sons had died in accidents while on a peaceful aid 
mission in the neighboring country 
the possibility of afghanistan becoming another lebanon ravaged 
by endless battles was suggested by gennady gerasimov spokesman for 
the soviet foreign ministry in his weekly column in soviet culture 
gerasimov blamed the perilous situation in afghanistan on its 
long history noting that englishmen had suggested in 1979 that the 
soviets had not read enough rudyard kipling stories of the hardships 
of british soldiers in the hindu kush mountains of afghanistan a 
century ago 
he quoted american sociologists ekbal achmad and richard barnett 
as writing beyond the boundaries of village and tribe most 
afghans look on each other fearfully as strangers 
even the presence of a common enemy as the soviet soldiers 
were insidiously portrayed could not unite the warring factions 
gerasimov wrote 
now he said there is only one way out the path of national 
reconciliation it is a difficult path going against a tradition of 
bloody revenge but it is the only one 
otherwise there will be a second lebanon he concluded 
the trud article insisted that soviet troops know their labor 
was not in vain and the afghan people will find the forces to 
defend the integrity and independence of their motherland 
but the conclusion jarred with its description of what was left 
behind by retreating soviets 
some garrisons have been plundered certain posts and 
strongholds transferred to the afghans have been emptied the 
article said their troops who were subjected to threats and 
hostile action simply fled the extremists have already moved in 
the political situation in the republic is becoming tense 
attacks by military formations on peaceful cities are increasing 
daily not to mention the artillery and rocket shellings of kabul 
kandahar jalalabad and other big centers the extremists from 
peshawar dont want a peaceful national settlement it said 
referring to the city in western pakistan where many moslem 
guerrillas are based 
the newspaper lenins banner published a description of the 
various factions in afghanistan under the headline afghanistan 
what happens after the 15th 
a realistic evaluation of the state of affairs alas does not 
give grounds for extreme optimism the newspaper said because 
none of the warring groups is dominant either politically or 
militarily 
lenins banner blamed the sad prospects for the future on the 
irreconcilable opposition a common moscow term for the 
guerrillas which doesnt want to make any contacts with the 
government of kabul it further blamed the united states and 
pakistan accusing them of repeated violations of the geneva accords 
that led to the soviet withdrawal

paul vanden boeynants the former prime 
minister who disappeared from his apartment garage a month ago 
returned home safely tuesday and officials indicated his family paid 
a ransom of about 1 million 
prosecutor andre rutten said the 69yearold politician and 
businessman was freed in reasonably good condition at 1020 pm 
monday near the railway station in tournai 50 miles southwest of 
brussels near the french border 
vanden boeynants took a taxi to his home and called investigators 
about midnight rutten said 
he told reporters the abductors were still at large but its 
not over the investigation continues on all fronts 
the vanden boeynants family paid a ransom of several tens of 
millions of francs rutten said ten million francs is the 
equivalent of 255000 
ruttens deputy andre vandoren said the ransom was paid in 
the classic way after negotiations between the family and the 
abductors he did not elaborate but said some elements occurred 
abroad raising speculation it was paid through a foreign bank 
possibly swiss 
vanden boeynants made no statement but appeared briefly in the 
window of his seventh floor apartment tuesday morning and waved to 
journalists he was wearing sunglasses and had a scruffy beard 
he agreed to receive one photographer who described him as 
looking tired weak and thin 
vandoren said he learned of the ransom negotiations eight to 10 
days ago but had only fragmentary information 
police said vanden boeynants was kidnapped in the early evening 
of jan 14 after parking his car in the garage of his apartment 
building his pipe hearing aid and a shoe were found at the scene 
a special parliamentary commission was to open a hearing three 
days later into charges that he took bribes while defense minister 
in the 1970s but the hearing was postponed and the panel later 
dismissed the charges as groundless 
in 1986 vanden boeynants was convicted of tax fraud and forgery 
as head of a brussels meatpacking company he was fined about 
17000 and the sentencing judge called him an inveterate 
swindler 
soon after the kidnapping a previously unknown group calling 
itself the socialist revolutionary brigade claimed responsibility in 
telephone calls and letters to brussels newspapers 
it demanded ransom equivalent to 790000 twothirds to be 
distributed to the needy through relief organizations 
according to vandoren the kidnappers were common criminals with 
no political motives he was knocked down by two people and tied 
up then a third person helped carry him to a car the deputy 
prosecutor said of the abduction 
vanden boeynants dentention was not the most pleasant but 
the kidnappers were rather correct although that is relative 
term he told the news conference 
vandoren did not say where the victim was held but said he was 
confined to one room two or three people were always present 
and the room was dark much of the time 
officials said vanden boeynants told his abductors he had a heart 
condition and necessary medication was provided from the third day 
of captivity 
investigators discounted the possibility that vanden boeynants 
faked the kidnapping we maintain the theory that this was a real 
abduction vandoren said 
prime minister wilfried martens said the day after the 
disappearance that vanden boeynants had received threats in the 
preceding weeks but he did not characterize them the former 
premier also was to have met with the interior minister the next 
week presumably to discuss his personal safety 
officials stayed largely out of the ransom negotiations he 
said and took no risks because we feared for his life 
the ransom was paid at least 24 hours before the release 
vandoren said he denied a published report that the amount was 
255 million to 51 million 
rutten the prosecutor said his abductors blindfolded vanden 
boeynants on monday night and told him to wait two minutes before 
finding his way home from tournai there were unconfirmed reports he 
was held in france 
vanden boeynants a christian democrat was prime minister from 
1966 to 1968 and again briefly in 19781979 he was defense minister 
for seven years in the 1970s and a brussels city council member for 
more than 30 years starting in 1953 
the allegatons that he took bribes as defense minister which the 
parliamentary commission dismissed arose in media reports 
controversy also touched his service on the brussels council 
during which he oversaw an urban renewal program that was criticized 
by conservationists

secretary of state james a baker iii announced today 
that he is selling his controversial holdings in a new york bank and 
all other publicly traded stocks that have been held in a blind 
trust 
baker announced the decision through a spokeswoman while on a 
tour of western european capitals 
his wife susan is disposing of her stock as well the trust set 
up when baker went to work at the white house in 1981 as former 
president reagans chief of staff also will sell publicly traded 
stock held by their daughter mary bonner baker 
while i believe this decision goes well beyond what is required 
or has been recommended i think it is the correct decision for 
someone committed in meeting the highest ethical standards 
bakers statement said 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said baker made the decision in 
london on saturday after consulting with his lawyers 
the washington post in a frontpage article on friday said 
white house counsel c boyden gray had pressed baker to divest 
himself of substantial stock holdings in chemical new york corp a 
bank holding company that has 45 billion in loans to third world 
nations 
on friday while r said he never sought the 
waiver and decided instead to get rid of all his publicly owned 
stock in the bank and other firms 
bakers latest financial disclosure form filed with the office 
of government ethics puts a value of more than 250000 on the 
assets held in the secretarys qualified blind trust 
the form shows that the secretary received over 100000 in 
income from the trust during the time that was covered january 
through august of 1988 
baker left the treasury department last summer help thenvice 
president bushs campaign for the oval office 
the disclosure form also lists the separate property of mrs 
baker which includes 1087 shares in houston industries with a 
valuation between 15001 and 50000 
the stock listed assets of daughter mary as including 5310 
shares of chemical new york corp 196 shares of exxon corp with a 
value listed between 5001 and 15000 144 share of houston 
industries with a value listed between 1001 and 5000 and 330 
shares in trinity petroleum trust with a value listed between 
5001 and 15000 
the spokeswoman said state department lawyers had offered baker a 
number of other options which were not disclosed but that bakers 
decision went further than any of them she said the sales will be 
completed after details are worked out 
bakers portfolio was not disclosed apart from chemical new york 
corp in which he acquired holdings after chemical bank took over 
texas commerce bancshares of houston a bank his grandfather helped 
found during bakers tenure as treasury secretary 
baker who had held news conferences daily since setting out on 
his trip last friday did not meet with reporters traveling on his 
air force jet today as he made his way from bonn west germany to 
ankara turkey then to athens greece and finally to rome a 
planned meeting here with foreign minister giulio andreotti was 
canceled because the italian official was ill 
a us official said baker received a list of recommended options 
while flying to ankara on tuesday morning but baker basically 
decided to sell his holdings on saturday 
the details of divestiture are complicated and must be worked out 
with bakers trustees said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
asked if baker stood to lose money by selling the official said 
ive never asked and ive never heard him mention it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters in 
washington earlier today that the decision on bakers stocks 
doesnt require a presidential review the matter is being worked 
out there will not be a conflict of interest 
fitzwater commented in response to a story in the washington post 
today that members of two senate committees were unaware that baker 
held large amounts of bank stock during the process of his 
confirmation as treasury secretary four years ago 
state department spokesman charles e redman asked about the 
post report said you know what the state of play is from the 
secretarys own description most recently in ottawa he said he 
had no information on whether baker had decided to sell the stocks 
or seek a waiver 
while in office bakers holdings were in a qualified blind 
trust a trustee was in control of the stocks but baker was 
informed annually of the general nature of the holdings 
as treasury secretary baker developed the socalled baker plan 
which called on third world nations to make good on their debts as 
they restructured their sagging economies it also called for new 
public and private lending and did not seek to force the banks to 
forgive the loans 
the post said it could reach spokesman for only two other members 
of the two committees john heinz rpa and john c danforth 
rmo it quoted both senators as saying through their spokesmen that 
bakers bank holdings would have made no difference on his 
confirmation as treasury secretary has they known about them 
although baker had provided information to the senate finance 
committee in 1985 as an attachment to letter promising to recuse 
himself from any decisions affecting his holdings the information 
was not circulated to the panels members the newspaper quoted 
congressional aides and senators as saying

afghanistans demoralized marxist 
government is given little chance of survival without soviet 
military forces to help it fight moslem guerrillas who already 
control much of the countryside 
western diplomats guerrilla leaders and others generally feel 
the government in kabul has a few months at most after wednesday 
the deadline for soviet withdrawal 
divisions within guerrilla ranks however could prolong a civil 
war that already has ravaged the country for nearly 11 years some 
insurgent commanders also say government forces may put up more 
resistance than expected 
president najib insists his government wont be defeated and can 
survive even though a soviet force estimated at 115000 soldiers 
failed for nine years to overcome the guerrillas 
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 to 
help fight an insurgency that began after a communist coup in april 
1978 the red army withdrew under an agreement mediated by the 
united nations 
the seven main guerrilla groups members of an alliance based in 
pakistan are deeply divided and their leaders are locked in a 
struggle for power guerrillas in the field have little discipline 
possess few heavy weapons and lack the kind of military experience 
needed to assault and capture cities 
guerrilla leaders say they do not want to assault kabul and other 
cities because of the inevitable civilian casualties 
abdul haq a top commander said up to 300000 civilians could be 
killed in an assault on kabul whose normal population has doubled 
to about 2 million because of refugees 
were fighting to free this country haq said were not 
fighting to kill our own people 
some guerrilla leaders say arrangements have been made for the 
cities to be surrendered with no resistance from the government but 
ranking field commanders say they are unaware of such plans 
a system must be devised for soldiers to surrender with safety 
haq said because those who fear for their lives could be provoked 
into fighting 
they cannot resist for a long time but if we make them fight 
for survival they will fight he said 
najibs army has about 30000 men most of them poorly trained 
conscripts who do not support the government according to western 
intelligence estimates army units usually perform poorly against 
the insurgents 
also at the governments disposal however are more reliable 
military units and other groups of loyalists who probably face 
reprisals if the guerrillas win 
some insurgent commanders estimate the regime has up to 50000 
loyalists ready to fight including secret service units the armys 
elite guard paramilitary police and party members government 
militia units composed of former guerrillas also would have little 
choice but to fight they said 
these people would have no place in afghanistan and there are 
many among the people who want justice for what the communists have 
done said masoud khalili a senior guerrilla official 
weapons and ammunition appear to be no problem for government 
forces the soviets are leaving huge stockpiles behind 
tough or desperate government units in the cities could mount 
sustained resistance in fortified positions capable of withstanding 
guerrilla hitandrun tactics 
by contrast some western diplomats say an internal coup or power 
struggle between rival communist party factions could topple najib 
or senior army commanders might make a deal with the insurgents

the agriculture department announced tuesday a 
proposal to lower 1989crop honey supports by nearly 5 percent from 
last year part of a gradual decline specified by the 1985 farm law 
milton hertz executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp asked for public comments on the proposal 
which would reduce the basic honey support to 5636 cents per pound 
from 591 cents in 1988 
adjustments of the basic support can be made according to honeys 
flower source color class grade location and other market 
differentials 
details of the 1989 honey program were officially published 
monday in the governments federal register 
hertz also asked for comments on continuing the programs 
marketing loan provision which allows producers to repay honey 
price support loans at less than the original loan rate 
in effect this lets the producer sell honey to the 
government and then buy it back for less if loans arent repaid 
producers forfeit the honey and the ccc adds it to surplus 
stockpiles 
the buyback rates are set at levels low enough to minimize loan 
forfeitures and to reduce ccc honey stocks and storage costs 
currently for example producers can buy back 1988crop honey at 
rates of 34 to 40 cents per pound depending on quality the ccc 
loans originally were for 48 to 62 cents per pound

rebel leader jonas savimbi said tuesday that 
cuban soldiers are battling his guerrillas in southern angola 
despite a peace accord aimed at removing foreign troops from the 
wartorn country 
an estimated 600 cuban soldiers and 4500 angolan government 
troops are attempting to capture rebelheld positions in 
southcentral angola near the border with namibia said officials of 
savimbis national union for the total independence of angola 
the angolans and the cubans are trying to take the border posts 
by force but they will not do so savimbi said in an interview at 
his bush headquarters in southeastern angola 
cuba last month began a phased withdrawal of its 50000 soldiers 
supporting angolas marxist government in a 13yearold war against 
rightist rebels 
cuba angola and south africa signed a peace agreement in new 
york in december calling for cuba to withdraw all 50000 troops by 
july 1991 a total 3000 troops are to leave by april 1 and all 
remaining soldiers are to be moved at least 180 miles north of the 
namibian border by aug 1 
south africa has agreed to stop providing military assistance to 
the rebels and is to grant independence this year to namibia also 
known as southwest africa 
savimbi and his insurgents were not involved in the peace talks 
and they have vowed to continue fighting to wrest a powersharing 
agreement with the government 
savimbi said he received substantial stockpiles of weapons 
gasoline and other military essentials before south africa stopped 
supplying aid 
south africa is gone we are standing on our own and we are 
going to survive said savimbi 
he refused to disclose the extent of his armory but unconfirmed 
reports say he has supplies to last two years the united states 
supports savimbi and president bush has pledged to continue aid 
estimated at 15 million last year 
the rebel leader denied an angolan government claim that south 
african forces entered southeastern angola last week in defense of 
the rebels pretoria has denied the charge which it says places 
the spirit of the cuban troop withdrawal process in jeopardy 
savimbi said his movements diplomatic position has improved 
since the guerrilla movement formally cut ties with south africa 
he said several african leaders including president felix 
houphouetboigny of the ivory coast are attempting to arrange a 
reconciliation between the angolan government and rebels 
savimbi said he canceled an offensive begun last week so as not 
to jeopardize houphouetboignys efforts 
angolan president jose eduardo dos santos and his government 
refuse to negotiate with the rebels although savimbi says the 
adversaries maintain lowlevel contacts in europe 
the rebel movement traditionally launches offensives in the 
januaryapril rainy season when the bush gives them more cover 
government troops usually make a major push during the dry season 
later in the year 
but wambu chindondo the rebel intelligence chief said the 
combined angolancuban forces began an offensive feb 2 aimed at 
rebel strongholds near the southern towns of caiundo and ongiva

the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to work more closely in an effort to curb illegal salmon 
fishing in international waters of the pacific ocean the state 
department said tuesday 
department officials said in a statement that negotiators from 
the two countries had decided that illegal salmon fishing on the 
high seas by other nations represented an irrational and wasteful 
harvesting method and that all efforts should be taken to prevent 
the unauthorized possession harvest transport and sale of salmon 
in the north pacific 
american fishing groups have contended that illegal catches by 
foreign trawlers sometimes under the guise of fishing for squid 
have already resulted in depleted salmon runs in the pacific 
northwest and alaska 
soviet and us negotiators meeting last week in washington 
signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two countries 
agreed to increase their bilateral cooperation in the field of 
enforcing salmon conservation measures 
under the agreement the two countries will exchange information 
on illegal salmon fishing gathered by patrol vessels and 
surveillance aircraft in the north pacific and any information on 
the sale purchase and transport of such fish 
the two countries also agreed to work together on various 
enforcement issues though the memorandum provided no specifics 
in addition they agreed to hold a symposium on pacific salmon 
biology in the soviet union 
on other topics the negotiators reviewed measures the two 
countries might take to regulate pollock fishing in an area of the 
bering sea known as the doughnut hole 
both countries have previously expressed concern that expanded 
fishing by foreign trawlers in the doughnut hole may be 
depleting stocks within the two nations 200mile fishing zones 
the us coast guard and american fishing groups have also 
contended that foreign trawlers use the doughnut hole for a 
staging area to sneak into the 200mile us economic zone under 
cover of darkness or bad weather to fish illegally

the judge in the oliver north trial today 
rejected an agreement that would have allowed the justice department 
to object at any time to defense disclosures of classified material 
us district judge gerhard a gesell ruled that attorney general 
dick thornburgh may not file a series of affidavits in bits and 
pieces during norths trial 
gesell said he was inclined to wait until the supreme court rules 
on the justice department request for a stay of the trial the full 
court meets privately friday the department has sought to delay the 
trial until appellate judges can review procedures to protect 
national security 
the agreement on how to handle the classified material was struck 
over the weekend between thornburgh and the independent counsel 
gesell said it was not satisfactory 
i find no basis for giving him thornburgh and the justice 
department a seat at counsel table or the right to intervene by way 
of bits and pieces of affidavits whenever the going gets tough 
said gesell 
he also said he would consider defense objections to an admission 
proposed by the government that the reagan administration gave third 
countries quid quo pro inducements to help arm the nicaraguan 
rebels when us assistance was banned by congress 
the judge said he had a sense that the quid may be 
underplayed in the prosecutions proposed description of the 
arrangements that the defense said were approved by president 
reagan who ordered top officials to keep them secret 
gesell said he would convene a hearing on wednesday to consider 
defense proposals to change the statement about the thirdcountry 
contributions 
in a filing today norths lawyers said the inducement offered to 
central american nations in return for their military support for 
the resistance contras was in part cia covert support 
if the court requires prior notice of this covert support it 
will effectively require prior notice before any exploration of quid 
pro quo arrangements that are central to this case norths 
lawyers said 
gesell already has thrown out the major charges against north 
because of justice department objections to disclosure of certain 
classified information 
north attorney brendan sullivan is attempting to introduce 
evidence about the reagan administrations secret efforts to aid the 
contras in his defense of north who is charged with covering up the 
irancontra affair by shredding evidence and lying to congress 
sullivan said monday that reagan and other top administration 
officials participated personally and directly in quid pro quo and 
other arrangements with central american and other third countries 
as a means of obtaining military assistance for the contras after 
congress banned us aid 
the officials also established a policy that those arrangements 
would not be disclosed outside a limited group of executive branch 
officials sullivan said in a court filing 
reagan lawyer theodore olson declined to comment on sullivans 
assertions 
independent counsel lawrence walsh whose office is prosecuting 
north said in a court filing that he is willing to agree at trial 
to a candid admission with respect to quid pro quo 
arrangements under which the reagan administration steered favors 
to nations aiding the contras 
but sullivan said a proposed stipulation on the issue by walsh 
is utterly inadequate because it doesnt acknowledge that reagan 
and other top officials participated in the arrangements and 
disclosed them to no one outside a limited group of officials 
at the heart of this case said sullivan are the quid pro 
quo and other thirdcountry arrangements with which the reagan 
administration obtained military support for the resistance during 
the socalled boland amendments that was the period from october 
1984 to october 1986 when congress banned military aid to the 
contras 
sullivan disclosed that gesell addressed the possible relevance 
of the information to norths case in a closed hearing last 
wednesday 
according to sullivans filing gesell said it was possible that 
north was between a rock and a hard place hes being told on the 
top side not to tell anybody and hes being asked a lot of questions 
about it on the bottom side 
and some of those instructions came from people who have 
military authority over him as well as presidential authority over 
him and i have ruled that he should be entitled to have the jury to 
see the circumstances under which he acted 
the allegations concerning reagan are part of the dispute over 
the planned use of classified documents at norths trial on which 
gesell is to hold a hearing today 
the justice department wants more stringent limits placed on 
classified material that north can use at trial claiming that 
national security could be hurt by public disclosures norths 
lawyers oppose the additional controls and say classified material 
can prove norths innocence 
sullivan said the government wants to omit any reference to the 
direct participation in thirdcountry arrangements by reagan cia 
director william casey national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
secretary of state george shultz secretary of defense caspar 
weinberger and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff john 
vessey 
reagans involvement in thirdcountry contributions for the 
contras was publicized in some detail in the 1987 irancontra 
hearings but his alleged involvement in providing favors and in 
covering up the arrangements is new 
an instance of quid pro quo efforts involving north surfaced in 
the irancontra congressional hearings in 1987 north wanted 
falsified documents from central american countries to conceal 
shipments going to the contras 
on march 5 1985 he proposed that guatemala be rewarded for its 
assistance in providing false enduser certificates so that more 
than 98000 pounds of east european munitions could be made by 
chartered aircraft from a european arms dealer to a central american 
country for the contras 
enduser certificates are documents certifying that the arms are 
for the exclusive use of the country to which they are being sent 
the contras could not issue such certificates because they were not 
a recognized government 
in a memo to thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane 
north suggested that the secretaries of state and defense and vessey 
be asked to grant guatemala additional security assistance 
the real purpose of the memo said north was to find a way by 
which we can compensate guatemala for the extraordinary 
assistance they are providing to the nicaraguan freedom fighters 
north said he was attaching enduser certificates which 
guatemala provided for the purchase of nearly 8m worth of 
munitions to be delivered to the contras 
sullivan also said he wants to crossexamine mcfarlane about a 
message he wrote on nov 8 1986 saying i hope to daylights that 
someone has been purging files on this episode 
sullivan said that under the governments proposed agreement on 
the use of classified information the use of this computer message 
is now in doubt 
north is charged among other things with shredding documents 
that month to conceal the irancontra affair

after years of printing official complaints about 
rampant lawlessness in the west a soviet newspaper on tuesday 
published what it called shocking statistics showing a dramatic rise 
in crime 
the government daily izvestia publishing the kind of figures 
that have been secret since 1933 said the overall rate of 
registered crimes rose 38 percent last year and that the rate of 
all crimes soared 178 percent 
probably the figures published in the newspaper would shock 
many izvestia said but its better to know the true state of 
affairs so that our safety and the polices concerns and problems 
will become clear 
some of the figures were released last month but tuesdays 
report was the most detailed yet 
the report quoting the interior ministry said 1867223 crimes 
were registered last year 68700 more than in 1987 the countrys 
population is about 285 million 
on the last page of izvestia was a table that listed among the 
most shocking statistics the number of premeditated murders they 
soared 141 percent from 14651 in 1987 to 16710 last year 
the higest increase among different categories of crimes was 
registered in breakins and holdups which rose 444 percent from 
46485 in 1987 to 67114 last year in 1988 17658 rapes were 
reported a rise of 53 percent over the 1987 level of 16765 
some progress was reported in tackling economic crime izvestia 
said there were 96986 cases of misappropriation of government and 
public property through embezzlement theft and abuse of office in 
1987 the number fell 98 percent in 1988 to 87450 
economic crime is so widespread in the soviet union that many 
soviets believe a second economy that is based on a black market 
is thriving 
interior ministry official m yegorov told the tass news agency 
that speculators have been taking advantage of the shortages that 
plague soviet society twenty years ago he said only 17000 cases 
of speculation were reported izvestia said there were 45235 of 
speculation last year 
interior minister vadim bakatin told the communist party 
newspaper pravda last month that president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms have let loose not only more democracy but also thieves and 
attackers 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness officials and 
the staterun media have detailed drug abuse prostitution murders 
and other crimes the kremlins longrunning attempt to blame such 
problems on the west and to claim that they had not crossed soviet 
borders has been largely abandoned the media often has painted a 
picture of the united states as a country where it was unsafe to 
walk on the streets at night

educational exchanges according to joseph john jova the current 
head of meridian house

meridian house last year when he was asked by president reagan to go 
to saudi arabia he went there with the understanding that his stay 
in riyadh would be brief they said 
no reason for horans abrupt departure last year was disclosed at 
the time but sources later said king fahd asked the ambassador to 
leave they said fahd was angry because horan officially complained 
to him about the kingdoms purchase of chinese ballistic missiles 
an issue that the riyadh government regards as an internal affair 
israel had complained that the deployment of such projectiles in 
an arab country could endanger its security 
cutler a career diplomat since 1957 previously had served in

the son of former soviet premier nikita 
khrushchev said tuesday the opportunity for improvement in 
superpower relations is greater today than at any time since his 
fathers ouster in 1964 
in the past unity between peoples was considered science 
fiction but today we see that as a real possibility sergei 
khrushchev said at a harvard university news conference on his first 
trip to the united states in 30 years 
the 54yearold heavyset computer scientist came to the 
university for a sovietamerican news conference on a sixyear 
harvard study of the 1962 cuban missile crisis which took the 
superpowers to the brink of nuclear war 
khrushchev whose father faced president kennedy in the showdown 
praised two new books resulting from the study that call for the 
united states and the soviet union to move away from military 
confrontation and toward sustainable peaceful competition 
but he also stressed continuing misunderstandings including what 
he said was an inaccurate report that fidel castro asked his father 
to launch a nuclear strike against the united states 
it seems to me that the main thing is weve come to understand 
how poorly we actually understand each other and those 
misunderstandings have led to missteps even at the highest levels 
said khrushchev 
in contrast to his father a hottempered leader who once banged 
his shoe in anger on a table at the united nations the younger 
khrushchev appears softspoken and urbane nikita khrushchev 
premier from 1958 to 1964 died in 1971 
in an attempt at levity khrushchev tried to tell a story about 
his youth but as if to prove his point about misunderstandings the 
story fell flat when a translator muffed the punch line 
khrushchev said a similar loss in translation may have led to the 
reports that castro requested a nuclear strike 
those reports originated at a conference in moscow last month 
that brought some of nikita khrushchevs advisers former kennedy 
aides cuban officials and scholars together for the first time to 
discuss the missile crisis 
some news reports said sergei khrushchev who also took part in 
that conference had told other participants that on oct 26 1962 
near the height of the missile crisis castro sought a preemptive 
nuclear strike on the united states to forestall what he believed 
was an imminent invasion of cuba 
both soviets and americans at tuesdays news conference denied 
hearing him say such a thing at the conference they included sergo 
mikoyan son of former soviet deputy premier anastas mikoyan who 
said the reports had resulted either from a misunderstanding by an 
american journalist or an absence of will to understand 
one of the americans david a welch provided a possible 
explanation welch a research fellow at harvard and coauthor of 
one of the new books on the brink soviets and americans 
reexamine the cuban missile crisis said castro almost certainly 
asked on oct 26 that soviet troops fire antiaircraft missiles at 
american military jets flying over cuba 
when someone said castro asked khrushchev to fire the missiles 
someone else may have thought he was talking about the nuclear 
missiles welch said 
khrushchevs last visit to the united states was in 1959 when he 
accompanied his father on a tour through disneyland iowa cornfields 
and hollywood movie studios 
khrushchev who holds a doctorate in computer science lived in 
relative obscurity for more than 20 years after his father lost 
power but he has recently attracted attention with the publication 
of his diaries and is editing the russian edition of his fathers 
memoirs which have never been published in the soviet union 
the memoirs were published in english under the title 
khrushchev remembers

new hud secretary jack kemp beginning a personal 
tour of inner cities visited poor atlanta neighborhoods tuesday and 
said he wants to create dramatic incentives that will bring jobs 
and housing to blighted urban areas 
there is distress and despair in many of the areas of the 
economy that have been left behind and thats where i definitely 
want to focus my attention kemp said 
one day after being formally sworn in as secretary of housing and 
urban development at a ceremony with president bush kemp flew to 
atlanta for a twoday visit to poor neighborhoods 
he said the trip was the first of a series of visits to major 
cities to help find answers to the problems of homelessness 
housing and urban economic development 
kemp met with the citys black democratic leaders mayor andrew 
young and rep john lewis dga toured the museum honoring martin 
luther king jr and scheduled a private dinner with the late civil 
rights leaders widow coretta scott king 
kemp received a warm welcome as he heard more than 20 community 
leaders but was also told the needs are too great for private 
efforts to work without government help 
a lot of people have a lot of hope for you said millard 
fuller a leader of the habitat for humanity group that builds homes 
for lowincome people without federal help theres a lot of good 
feeling for you i hope you live up to the expectations 
kemps meetings were emblematic of the former congressman and 
unsuccessful republican presidential candidates stated intention to 
seek innovative solutions for innercity problems regardless of the 
source and of national republican intentions to seek support among 
blacks 
this is an opportunity after my swearing in yesterday to come 
to a city where lots of things are happening to help people get in 
homes jobs shelter kemp said 
young led kemp through a series of public housing projects and 
other developments where private groups some with and some without 
government assistance built homes and apartments for rental or 
purchase by lowincome people 
his visit had the feel of a campaign day as he went from 
neighborhood to neighborhood in a motorcade with police escort with 
one bus filled with the press and another with local officials and 
supporters 
kemp visited the nations first public housing project techwood 
built in 1936 as well as neighborhoods such as cabbagetown bedford 
pine and vine city where redevelopment projects are underway or 
planned 
much of the housing was in good shape newly constructed or 
renovated kemp was not taken to bankhead courts a public housing 
project that has received widespread attention for its crime and 
other problems but young said that the areas the secretary did 
visit had problems that were identical 
were not trying to hide the fact we have many many housing 
problems young said 
he said that on wednesday kemp would meet with groups arranged by 
mrs king and see other areas with worse problems 
kemp used the visit to repeat his pledge to seek the 
establishment of urban enterprise zones that carry federal tax 
incentives designed to attract businesses and jobs kemp said the 
incentives could include breaks on capital gains for qualified 
investments with the tax breaks contingent on hiring people who 
otherwise would be receiving welfare or other assistance 
some of the projects he visited were built through the local 
equivalent of enterprise zones local abatements or forgiveness of 
property taxes that encouraged development 
weve got to do it at the federal level because only the 
federal government can provide dramatic incentives kemp said 
kemp repeatedly referred to reincentivizing the economy 
through such tax breaks and said enterprise zones would 
greenline urban areas that have been hurt by redlining a 
term for lending practices that deny capital for development to 
certain areas 
areas that were at one time redlined for despair need to be 
greenlined for success kemp said

gunmen abducted and killed the powerful leader 
of the nations miners police said tuesday his communistled labor 
movement blamed the government and called a national strike to 
protest the slaying 
saul cantoral who led two crippling nationwide mining strikes 
last year and a woman companion were slain monday night on a 
deserted street in a lima slum police said 
it was not known if cantoral secretary general of the 
communistled general federation of mine workers was slain by 
shining path leftist rebels or a new paramilitary death squad the 
rodrigo franco command 
the shining path has been fighting for nine years to topple the 
elected government of peru and install marxist rule the government 
says more than 12000 people have died in the insurgency 
the rodrigo franco command named after a government official 
slain by the shining path has vowed to kill leftist guerrillas and 
their supporters 
police refused to provide details of mondays slayings 
the lima newspaper la republica said a note left at the scene 
linked the attack to the shining path but the lima daily expreso 
reported that an anonymous caller claimed the antirebel franco 
group killed the unionist 
the mine federation which represents nearly all of perus 70000 
miners called a news conference to announce a oneday strike on 
thursday and to demand a government investigation 
victor cuadros vice president of the miners federation blamed 
the government and enemies of the working class for the attack 
cantoral last year led miners in a onemonth nationwide strike in 
july and a twomonth strike that ended in december both strikes 
were failed attempts at forcing the mining industry to negotiate 
labor contracts jointly with all mine unions rather than on a 
companybycompany basis 
owners of private mines charged during the strikes that miners 
were being manipulated by the shining path 
officials said the strikes caused losses of 400 million one 
third of the perus yearly mining exports mining is perus most 
important industry accounting for about half its foreign exchange 
the newspapers quoted police as saying cantoral and the woman 
whose identity was not released were seized by gunmen in a car and 
brought to canto grande a lima slum 
the 42yearold labor leader was shot four times in the back and 
once in the head and the woman was run over and killed by a car 
while apparently trying to escape newspapers said 
president alan garcia and prime minister armando villanueva 
condemned the killing and vowed to track down the perpetrators 
government leaders have denied charges linking the new death 
squad to government officials

the afghan government has sent a note to the 
state department protesting president bushs decision to continue 
providing aid to anticommunist rebels so long as the sovietbacked 
government remains in power an afghan diplomat said tuesday 
we think that this decision will just bring more bloodshed and 
more war to our country said the top afghan envoy in washington 
miagol in an interview with associated press radio 
we asked for the administration of bush to change this decision 
for peaceful solution of our conflict said miagol who does not 
use a second name the envoy said that all involved in the afghan 
conflict have to sit down and they have to negotiate this matter 
transport planes carried the last soviet soldiers home from kabul 
on tuesday a day ahead of the deadline the soviets agreed to last 
spring for ending their military involvement in afghanistan 
the departure of the soviets raised doubts about the ability of 
the afghan government to survive the challenge posed by the 
usbacked guerrillas 
bush decided last week to continue aiding the rebels even after 
the soviets completed their withdrawal partly because of the large 
amounts of military hardware the soviets left behind

three of them women went to the gallows tuesday in the largest 
daily execution toll since iran began a fierce antinarcotics 
campaign early in january 
also tuesday intelligence minister mohammad reyshahri announced 
a heavy ruling was handed down against british businessman roger 
cooper who has been jailed on spying charges for more than three 
years 
reyshahri did not elaborate on the ruling saying only that 
judicial authorities will pass final judgment later 
the drug traffickers were hanged publicly in tehran and 25 other 
cities with all 67 men executed publicly at dawn in a blinding 
snowstorm the women were executed inside iranian prisons the 
official islamic republic news agency reported 
few people turned out to witness the executions however as the 
snow cut communications and jammed traffic 
the public spectacle is to underline the governments 
determination to eliminate drug smuggling and cut supplies to 1 
million addicts by official count and double that number according 
to unofficial estimates 
nearly 200 men and women identified by official media as 
convicted drug smugglers have been executed since early january 
fiftysix were executed in one day jan 16 a few days before a

a major program to take fragile cropland from 
production is turning into an important tool for cleaning up the 
nations rural water an agriculture department report said tuesday 
the conservation reserve program was included in 1985 farm law as 
a vehicle for taking 40 million to 45 million acres of highly 
erodible land from crop production and planting it into protective 
grass and trees for 10 years 
more than 28 million acres have been enrolled and agriculture 
department officials say further signups will bring the 1990 target 
within reach 
overall the report said the program may generate an estimated 
35 billion to 4 billion in water quality benefits through 
reduced water treatment costs lower sediment removal costs less 
damage to equipment that uses water and increased recreational 
fishing 
farming activities generate materials than can be carried into 
waterways by runoff and most agriculturally induced pollution is 
nonpoint source in which the specific source cannot be 
identified 
these farmgenerated pollutants include nutrients from chemical 
fertilizers and animal manure primarily nitrogen and phosphorous 
pesticides sediment and dissolved minerals and salts the report 
said 
sediment washing off cropland and into waterways can fill 
reservoirs block navigation channels interfere with conveyance 
systems harm aquatic plant life and degrade recreational 
resources the report said 
also it said pesticides and fertilizers are important to farm 
production but these chemicals can harm plant and animal life and 
if they reach high enough concentrations in drinking water 
pesticides and fertilizer nitrates can be harmful to humans 
potential for the crp to bring about a major reduction in the 
discharge of agricultural pollutants into waterways is large 
because of the large acreage involved and because only highly 
erodible land is eligible to be enrolled the report said 
the study by the departments economic research service said 
the estimate of 35 billion to 4 billion in water benefits was 
based on an assumption that the full 45 million acres would be 
signed into the program

president bushs ethics commission agreed 
tuesday that members of congress should continue to be exempt from 
the basic conflict of interest law that prohibits making government 
decisions for personal gain 
although bush charged the panel last month with finding standards 
that are equitable all across the three branches of the federal 
government panel members concluded members of congress could not 
be put under the same constraints as judges and executive branch 
employees 
the members did however call for somewhat broader public 
disclosure of the assets held by members of congress so the public 
could decide whether votes were cast or bills were introduced for 
private reasons and turn any member who did that out of office at 
the polls 
the eightmember panel has until march 9 to recommend to bush any 
legislative or administrative changes to stiffen and standardize 
federal ethics enforcement 
the basic federal conflict law known as section 208 of the 
criminal code makes it a crime for an executive branch employee to 
take any government action in which he or his immediate family has a 
financial interest the top penalty is two years in prison and a 
10000 fine judges are separately prohibited from hearing any case 
involving any of their assets 
former attorney general griffin bell told fellow panel members 
this is the toughest thing were going to have to deal with 
former white house counsel lloyd n cutler said if you apply 
208 to congress you get into impossible questions what does a 
farmer do on farm issues what does any member do on tax 
legislation everyone pays taxes 
maybe disclosure of the interest is all you can do 
bell the panels vice chairman agreed i dont believe 208 is 
workable for members theyd have to divest all their holdings 
panel chairman malcolm r wilkey a former appellate judge 
thought perhaps the law could apply to members of congress when they 
do casework for their constituents with specific federal agencies or 
when they get into administrative matters as opposed to legislation 
but he found little support 
the panels only excongressman former new mexico republican 
sen harrison schmitt appealed for some tougher action at least 
full disclosure because we all know of abuses 
judith bello general counsel to the us special trade 
representative said perhaps the law might apply when members are 
negotiating for employment after they leave office 
eventually the commission agreed that the law should apply to 
the executive branch the judiciary and the staff of congress 
forcing members of congress to meet executive branch disclosure 
requirements would entail a minimal change 
members of congress are now required to list whether assets fall 
into these categories 5000 or less 5001 to 15000 15001 to 
50000 50001100000 100001250000 over 250000 
the executive branch has all those categories but the first one 
which is divided into less than 1001 and 10015000 
in other action the panel decided to recommend that members of 
congress file financial disclosure reports upon leaving office as 
executive branch employees and congressional staff employees already 
do 
the members also decided to recommend that divestiture of stock 
holdings be made much more attractive as a way of remedying 
potential conflicts 
currently officials required to divest assets have to pay 
capital gains taxes on the sales the panel recommended allowing 
officials to sell the assets and roll the proceeds into a government 
bond or mutual fund and delaying capital gains taxes until the cash 
was taken out of that approved investment for personal expenditures

us gen john galvin natos supreme 
military commander in europe said tuesday the modernization of 
shortrange nuclear missiles would permit a major cut in nuclear 
artillery 
i would like to see our alliance rely primarily on missile 
capability for the nuclear side of it in the future he told 
reporters at his headquarters south of brussels 
galvin said he recently gave officials of the north atlantic 
treaty organization a confidential report on the alliances future 
nuclear needs it calls for a strong cut in artillery which would 
be replaced by a dependence on missiles he said 
in order to do that he said i have to have some missiles 
and that is the lance and the lance today is very old 
he declined to say how many artillery rounds might be reduced 
with the upgrading of the lance nato has more than 4000 nuclear 
weapons based in its european arsenal no breakdown is provided for 
artillery 
the upgrading of the lance surfacetosurface missile has become 
one of the most controversial issues in the 16nation western 
alliance 
military analysts say the missile introduced in 1972 with a 
range of about 75 miles will become obsolete in 1995 most of the 
700 missiles are deployed in west germany and the remainder are in 
italy a proposed replacement for them would have a range of 320 
miles 
us secretary of state james baker discussed the sensitive issue 
this week with west german chancellor helmut kohl who has said he 
wants to delay a final decision on deployment of the new generation 
lance until 1991 or 1992 
the united states wants a firm commitment from the allies on 
whose soil the weapon would be deployed before it presses congress 
for money to produce the missile it has hoped for a strong signal 
this spring 
galvin said congress needs to consider this year whether to 
provide money to develop a model of the new lance for test purposes 
if this has to be complete in the middle of the 1990s then it 
needs to start now 4 years is not very much time he said 
galvin said the failure to upgrade the weapon would force the 
alliance to restudy our ability to carry out the current 
strategy 
the issue of upgrading shortrange nuclear arms has gained 
prominence since former president reagan and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev signed in december 1987 the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty it provides for eliminating all us and 
soviet landbased missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3400 miles 
strong antinuclear movements in germany the netherlands and 
belgium have opposed plans to modernize and extend the range of the 
lance missile 
galvin said he would prefer that eastwest negotiations on 
reducing conventional forces in europe be finished before 
discussions begin on shortrange nuclear arms nato and the seven 
warsaw pact nations are to begin conventional force talks in early 
march in vienna 
the nato allies contend they need their nuclear arsenal as a 
deterrent countering the huge superiority the warsaw pact maintains 
in conventional or nonnuclear arms 
kohl said monday that germany wants a disarmament mandate built 
into nato strategy so that deployment plans would be stopped if 
progress is made on cutting the easts conventional arms

president corazon aquino said tuesday 
she will proceed with scheduled visits to japan and to a military 
academy in the north despite rumors that rightwing groups would 
attempt a coup while she was out of the capital 
she also remained firm in her refusal to let ailing former 
president ferdinand marcos return from exile in hawaii citing 
security reasons 
the chief executive announced her decisions after a nearly 
threehour meeting tuesday with the cabinet crisis committee 
she said they discussed security measures for her trip this 
weekend to the philippine military academy where she is to address 
the graduating class and her visit to japan next week to attend the 
funeral of emperor hirohito 
the committee agreed my presence at these two events would be 
advantageous to our country mrs aquino said in a statement 
military officials said only members of the presidential security 
force would be allowed to carry weapons on the academy campus in 
baguio city about 150 miles north of manila during the festivities 
from friday to sunday 
banners will be banned on graduation day sunday last year 
graduates waved banners reading we belong the slogan of the 
reform the armed forces movement which has figured in unsuccessful 
attempts to unseat mrs aquino 
two years ago a bomb exploded at the academy grandstand a few 
days before mrs aquino was to address graduating cadets killing 
four people she said the bomb was meant for her 
reports of a new coup plot surfaced last week but military chief 
gen renato de villa said his command received no such information 
but he said former lt col gregorio honasan and two other renegade 
officers linked to previous coup attempts had held a secret meeting 
apparently to join forces 
honasan led an august 1987 coup attempt which killed 53 people 
and wounded hundreds 
mrs aquino leaves for japan on feb 23 but she is expected to 
be back in time for the third anniversary of the feb 25 
civilianmilitary uprising that drove marcos into exile and brought 
her to power 
she said with regard to expresident ferdinand marcos my 
position remains the same considerations of the highest national 
good dictate that we preserve the substantial economic and political 
gains of the past three years 
my duty is paramount to preserve democracy and its 
institutions i must therefore decline the wishes of some people 
that mr marcos be allowed to return to the philippines 
marcos only son ferdinand jr and vice president salvador 
laurel were among those who appealed to her to heed marcos request 
to come home 
marcos 71 was reported in guarded condition at the st francis 
medical center in honolulu after suffering a relapse of pneumonia 
marcos is under us indictment with his wife imelda accused of 
stealing more than 100 million from his homeland and stashing much 
of the money in the united states 
on tuesday justice secretary sedfrey ordonez brushed aside 
reports of negotiations for marcos return saying marcos first had 
to resolve criminal charges pending against him in the united states 
a presidential commission has been charged with recovering up to 
10 billion that the aquino government claims marcos his family and 
associates plundered from the country during his 20year rule 
marcos faces 39 civil suits in manila but no criminal charges have 
been filed

families and friends of the american hostages 
in lebanon remembered their loved ones on valentines day at a 
ceremony tuesday to display a huge heartshaped card bearing the 
captives names 
we hope the bush administration will put the hostages in the 
forefront and keep them there until they are released said thomas 
cicippio of norristown pa his brother joseph cicippio is one of 
the nine americans held captive 
the eightfoot card was put on display at the washington 
convention center where people are free to sign it after several 
days it will be taken to the lebanese embassy to be held until the 
hostages are released 
while no one has any firm word about the nine americans in 
lebanon david reed of spring grove pa nephew of hostage frank 
reed said there were signs indicating a great deal of quiet 
diplomacy on the issue 
our hope is that there is some movement he said based on 
his conversations with officials at the state department and the 
united nations reed said our sense is that the captors dont 
want to talk 
the american hostages are thought to be held by proiranian 
shiite moslems specifically groups under the umbrella hezbollah 
organization 
joseph sayah deputy ambassador at the lebanese embassy said 
there were a lot of negotiations talking place between the us 
side and the others but he would not elaborate on any specifics 
i hope something will be done so we can put an end to this 
ordeal he said 
the ceremony with the card was arranged by no greater love a 
humanitanian organization which has spotlighted the plight of the 
hostages and their families 
while we realize this greeting will not directly bring the 
hostages home it does let their families know that many many 
americans still care said carmella laspada the groups head 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson a correspondent for 
the associated press whose fourth anniversary in captivity is next 
month 
andersons sister peggy say did not attend the ceremony because 
she has extended her stay in damascus syria awaiting word of her 
brother 
others at the ceremony were steve hagey a reporter for the 
baltimore sun representing the journalists committee to free terry 
anderson john holger director of the un information office and

the fire department has a significant 
problem with chemical use and abuse and some firefighters have 
reportedly battled blazes while under the influence of drugs the 
fire chief said 
at least 20 of the citys 450 firefighters are using cocaine and 
30 others are alcoholics fire chief tom dickenson said monday his 
remarks were prompted by the weekend arrest of a veteran firefighter 
on cocaine charges 
the chief said his figures are based on experiences with 
disciplinary actions and complaints hes had from firefighters as 
well as the arrested mans statements to police he added that he 
had also heard reports of firefighters fighting fires while under 
the influence 
the president of the firefighters union and a city drug 
dependency coordinator said they dont believe there is a major drug 
problem in the department however neither had any estimate of how 
many cocaine users there were 
minneapolis firefighters union president dick will said monday he 
didnt know the source of dickinsons chemical abuse figures and 
that the union was unaware of firefighters under the influence while 
on the job he blamed the city for failing to develop an acceptable 
drug policy 
dickinson said the city has been unable to negotiate a 
drugtesting policy with the union that would allow testing when 
there are reasonable suspicions 
we are not against a reasonable form of drug testing said 
will and we certainly dont condone anyone showing up for work 
under the influence of any controlled substance 
he said the city is unwilling to define reasonable suspicion 
ken voltin an alcohol and drug dependency coordinator for the 
city said it would be hard to determine if there are 20 cocaine 
users in the department i dont believe there is a major cocaine 
problem he said 
a 45yearold firefighter was arrested friday on a felony charge 
of selling 22 grams of cocaine for 40 to an undercover st paul 
police officer in a bar 
we have information that there are other firefighters that are 
involved in drugs said sgt phil van tassel administrative 
assistant to minneapolis police chief john laux 
dickinson said the arrested firefighter told police lots of 
firefighters used cocaine asked if there were more than 20 the 
firefighter said yes the chief said van tassel confirmed the 
remarks 
twenty cocaine users would represent a conservative figure said 
dickinson 
steven fredrickson an assistant city attorney said minneapolis 
has reached agreement with about 12 unions on the drug testing 
issue but not with firefighters 
we have taken the position that the testing should be based on 
reasonable suspicion of drug usage said fredrickson the union 
has asked that it be based on probable cause which is a higher 
standard

the bush administration saying its 1990 budget 
speaks for itself declined tuesday to provide additional details on 
spending cuts and insisted they be shaped through negotiations with 
congress 
this budget is alive and is an active force subject to change 
in negotiation and discussion presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters 
he said the administration would have no separate proposal for 
filling a spending gap estimated at 96 billion to 11 billion to 
help pay for expanded social programs bush advocated in his 116 
trillion spending plan 
well be providing details as we go along everybody knows 
cuts have to be made fitzwater said 
congressional democrats have complained that bushs budget allows 
him to claim credit for proposing more spending on social programs 
such as those affecting the homeless child care and education 
while making sure congress shares responsibility for coming up with 
unpopular cuts in other programs 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee and sen jim sasser dtenn the budget 
committee chairman told bush in a letter tuesday that if he failed 
to provide more detail congress would have no alternative but 
to assume he endorses the program cuts proposed last month by 
thenpresident reagan 
bush budget director richard g darman white house chief of 
staff john sununu and congressional budget leaders met tuesday 
afternoon sununu was coy with reporters regarding how much new 
information he would provide the congress before leaders agreed to 
fullscale negotiations 
its not a question as to whether the detail is available its 
a question of whether you do it a step at a time sununu said 
darman said after the twohour meeting that the administration 
was making an extraordinary effort and sununus presence 
signified bushs stake in the process 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the white house appeared cooperative and he hoped 
the administration would in meetings scheduled for later this week 
provide congress with more information 
he said he was sympathetic that the administration needed time 
but said the information had to come before any negotiations on how 
the fiscal 1990 budget should be drafted 
you cant negotiate when most of the lines are blank he said 
bush plans to travel around the country to build public support 
for his budget plan 
he travels to columbia sc on wednesday to highlight the 
budget measure in an appearance before the state legislature bush 
spoke monday to business and civic leaders in manchester nh 
fitzwater denied bushs budget road show was an effort to make an 
endrun around congress as reagan had done in building public 
support for some of his initiatives 
instead the spokesman said the trips were just an opportunity 
for the president to discuss his priorities and an attempt to 
stress his intention to work with congress 
bushs budget which he unveiled thursday in his first major 
policy speech before congress called for expanded spending to cover 
a host of campaign promises 
other than calling for freezing military spending at the level of 
inflation the spending outline was vague on where other specific 
areas of spending would be restrained to meet deficit targets 
the president generally called for freezing most domestic 
programs at 1989 levels however that would leave a 96 billion to 
11 billion financing gap in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 if 
the programs are merely allowed to keep pace with inflation and 
population growth 
thus specific cuts must be worked out 
fitzwater said however that the administration has no plans to 
amend or expand upon the budget it proposed last week indicating 
that any changes must be the product of bargaining with congress 
the numbers speak for themselves fitzwater told reporters 
nothing is final and well be negotiating all of these programs 
the budget has already stirred controversy in the 
democraticcontrolled congress both for its lack of specifics on 
spending cuts and for its advocacy of a cut in the capital gains tax 
rate a tax break democratic leaders have suggested would benefit 
mainly the rich 
still fitzwater said that we dont want the budget to be 
confrontational and that the administration would retain an open 
mind on spending cuts

this is a very proud day for us we are ready to deliver it to 
jpl nasas jet propulsion laboratory on its way to jupiter 
hughes vice president steven dorfman said at a news conference 
tuesday 
hughes spokesman richard dore said the 4footdiameter 
teardropshaped probe would be trucked wednesday across the los 
angeles area to pasadena where jpl runs americas unmanned space 
exploration program for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the kennedy 
space center in april followed the next month by the mother ship 
or galileo orbiter after the two are attached the combined 
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed 
aboard the shuttle atlantis 
the launch is expected to take place between oct 12 and about 
nov 21 
after exploring two asteroids the orbiter and probe will reach 
jupiter in december 1995 after separating 150 days earlier the 
probe will enter jupiters atmosphere at 115000 mph then deploy a 
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planets 
atmosphere 
the probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes 
before it is crushed by jupiters tremendous atmospheric pressure 
the orbiter will circle jupiter for at least 20 months studying 
the planet and its surrounding moons magnetic field and 
electrically charged particles 
the data will help scientists better understand the origin of 
jupiter the solar system and the universe said richard young 
galileo probe project scientist at nasas ames research center in 
mountain view 
galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in 
may 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a centaur booster for a 
threeyear trip to jupiter the solar systems largest planet and 
the fifth from the sun 
then challenger blew up on jan 28 1986 killing seven crew 
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last fall after the 
tragedy nasa decided it was too dangerous to carry liquidfueled 
centaurs aboard the shuttle 
galileos route to jupiter was drastically redesigned and 
lengthened because earth and jupiter are no longer aligned as 
ideally as they were in 1986 and because the new booster is less 
powerful 
because of the launch delay and the longer flight time the probe 
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts 
wouldnt fail because of aging and its scientific instruments were 
retested 
on the new flight plan galileo will take six years instead of 
three years to get to the gaseous giant planet traveling 24 
billion miles although jupiter is about 400 million miles from 
earth dore said to gain energy for the trip galileo will use the 
gravity of venus and earth in a slingshot effect 
galileo will swing toward venus in february 1990 swing back 
toward earth that december circle the sun and swing around earth 
again in december 1992 before finally heading for jupiter 
the delay increased the probes cost to 157 million from 133 
million said benny chin galileo probe project manager at 
nasaames total cost of the mission from its official start in 
1977 through completion in late 1997 is about 136 billion said 
richard spehalski galileo project manager at jpl 
spehalski said white house approval for the launch is expected in 
september such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter 
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive 
plutonium a nasa environmental impact statement concluded last 
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off 
with galileo is very small

federal investigators on tuesday blamed work 
arrangements that deprived a train crew of sleep for the headon 
collision of two conrail freight trains in pennsylvania that killed 
both trains engineers and brakemen a year ago 
the national transportation safety board recommended that 
consolidated rail corp and other railroads look for ways to change 
work cycles that put crewmen on trains without adequate sleep 
the board said the jan 14 1988 collision at thompsontown 
occurred because the engineer and brakeman of a 105car coal train 
were asleep it was made worse the board said because the engineer 
of the other train did not slow down quickly enough and a 
computerbased traffic control system was not working properly 
damage in the crash was estimated at 6 million 
the report said none of the men on the coal train which was en 
route from baltimore to altoona pa had had more than two hours 
sleep in the previous 22 to 24 hours and they had not eaten in over 
13 hours the men had reported for work at 1130 pm and the crash 
was at 745 am the next day 
conrail spokeswoman pat linsky said the company could not comment 
in detail until officials had reviewed the board report but the 
railroad issued a statement saying that the engineer and brakeman on 
the coal train had signed off their previous runs 375 hours earlier 
and the conductor 50 hours before boarding the baltimorealtoona 
train 
the probable cause of this accident was the sleepdeprived 
condition of the engineer and other crewmembers of train ubt506 
which resulted in their inability to stay awake and alert the 
board said it said the engineer did not attempt to stop the train 
after warning signals went off and suggested he may have pushed a 
pedal in his sleep that acknowledged the warning but deactivated 
automatic braking of the train 
drug tests on the four dead crewmen and two conductors who 
survived the crash were negative for use of alcohol or illicit 
drugs except for a minuscule indication of marijuana in one 
conductors urine 
the board said the railroad industry has long had unpredictable 
work schedules but the problem has worsened with the elimination of 
many regularly scheduled freight and passenger trains a cutback in 
yard operations agreements protecting employee seniority longer 
freight runs and relocations of work assignments

the government expressed cautious optimism 
tuesday about talks in their second week with solidarity but it 
warned the banned independent union to stop pressing us against 
the wall 
a spokesman for the union responding to the statement by 
government spokesman jerzy urban denied solidarity had such 
intentions 
we want to reform the country and if this requires the 
governments withdrawal from its hitherto policy thats something 
else said janusz onyszkiewicz solidarity spokesman 
the exchange came as solidarity leader lech walesa traveled to 
jastrzebie in the coalmining region of silesia his second campaign 
swing in five days to seek rankandfile backing for the 
negotiations 
talks continued in warsaw as part of the broad series of round 
table negotiations aimed at reinstating solidaritys legal 
status bringing about opposition participation in parliament and 
forming a broad social agreement on economic and political reforms 
two teams meeting tuesday discussed environmental protection and 
an opposition proposal for a nationwide system of indexing wages to 
inflation 
urban at his weekly news conference said solidaritys proposal 
that the military and police budgets be cut by 20 percent is an 
example of pressuring 
urban characterized the proposal as political and irrelevant 
to a discussion on improving the economy 
stop pressing us against the wall he said we are putting 
forward a program of changes which are already so deep and brave 
that a general pressing of us may turn into adventurism 
destroying the chance for agreement even so urban said he could 
express cautious optimism about the talks please do not 
interpret my remarks as negative ones he said 
but onyszkiewicz said the tone of urbans comments was 
unexpected i am a bit surprised that minister urban presented it 
in such a drastic way such a reaction seems completely 
unjustified 
solidaritys national executive commission with about 20 
members also convened tuesday and issued a statement in warsaw 
urging a decrease of social tensions for the next six weeks 
while talks with the goverment continue 
the panel suggested a freeze on prices during the six weeks and 
said that managers discuss any wage decisions in advance with 
solidarity and other trade unions 
in southern poland walesa stressed to miners the importance of 
the talks 
we must agree we have to use all our wisdom and strength 
to make something out of poland he said we have no choice 
walesa addressed 500 miners at a social club in front of the 
manifest lipcowy mine where a nationwide wave of strikes began last 
august prompting the government to propose the talks 
nobody is going to build poland for us as a present walesa 
said but referring to the government he added we were badly 
led this system has led to absurdities 
walesa received an enthusiastic welcome at the club filled with 
solidarity songs and banners it appeared to be the warmest meeting 
so far during his travels to brief followers on the talks 
after attending mass with more than 2000 people at a church 
walesa held an hourlong meeting with silesia solidarity activists 
in the church basement

the crash last november of a new b1b bomber in 
texas was caused by a fire in the left wing that knocked out two of 
the planes four engines and burned out critical control equipment 
the air force said tuesday 
the fire apparently was fed by a ruptured fuel line in the 
portion of the wing that runs above the left engines 
but the inflight fire and crash impact destroyed evidence 
necessary to further isolate the cause of the fire and the exact 
location of the fuel leak the air force said all four crewmen 
ejected safely 
a temporary grounding after the accident failed to locate any 
wing fuel line problems with the remainder of the b1b fleet but 
more frequent inspections will continue to be performed the service 
added 
the investigation also confirmed earlier reports from 
eyewitnesses that the pilot of the stricken plane probably saved 
several lives on the ground 
capt michael e waters ordered his three crewmen to employ a 
manual ejection sequence so that he would be left behind after 
they bailed out and then flew the plane away from a populated area 
seeing that the aircraft was headed toward an inhabited area 
and observing an open field to the left he pointed the aircraft in 
that direction nosed the aircraft over 2 or 3 degrees and 
ejected the report states 
the air forces strategic air command which is responsible for 
the manned bomber force said its investigation of the nov 8 crash 
had ruled out any problem with the planes general electric co jet 
engines 
a review of the maintenance personnel and supervision records 
the remaining aircraft records and the testimony of maintenance 
personnel revealed no factors contributing to the mishap the 
report adds 
the accident report does not explicitly address the question of 
whether an assemblyline problem could be responsible for the 
accident but an air force official who declined to be identified 
said there was no evidence of any problem involving initial 
production 
the 280 million bomber went down last november in a field 
outside abilene texas while practicing touchandgo landings 
at dyess air force base texas the plane was consumed by fire after 
crashing and declared a total loss 
all was normal on the flight until just after a touchandgo 
landing around 320 pm cst at this point the planes crew had 
been practicing such landings and approaches for almost two hours 
without incident 
as the bomber climbed skyward though ground observers clearly 
spotted flames and puffs of smoke on the left side of the plane the 
report adds the crew didnt know there was a problem until the plane 
had flown about onehalf mile from the runway and they suddenly 
heard a loud bang coming from the back and left side of the 
aircraft 
using data from the planes computerized monitoring system the 
investigators concluded the bang represented the start of a massive 
fuel leak but they were unable to determine what caused the bang 
the crash at dyess was followed just nine days later by another 
b1b crash at ellsworth air force base sd the air force two weeks 
ago blamed that accident on pilot error 
the november crashes were the second and third involving a 
productionmodel b1b in 14 months time leaving the air force with 
97 of its original 100 planes 
the fourengine swingwing b1b is the first new addition to 
americas manned bomber force in more than 25 years built by the 
rockwell international corp the b1b has a maximum speed of about 
1000 mph and a range of more than 7000 miles

five central american 
presidents agreed tuesday on a plan to monitor progress toward 
democracy in nicaragua and said they would seek a way to dismantle 
the contra rebel army fighting the sandinistas officials said 
verifying democratization in nicaragua is considered vital if the 
central american peace plan is to be revived discord over the issue 
arose soon after the summit began monday at this seaside resort 40 
miles southeast of san salvador 
the summit brought together host president jose napoleon duarte 
of el salvador and presidents vinicio cerezo of guatemala jose 
azcona of honduras daniel ortega of nicaragua and oscar arias of 
costa rica 
tuesdays compromise appeared to be a concession to nicaragua 
which held out for an international role in determining that 
democracy was being implemented 
other central american governments have accused the leftist 
sandinista government of failing to make required moves toward 
increased democracy but nicaragua recently has talked about holding 
early elections and taking measures to give the opposition a fair 
chance 
paul reichler a us lawyer and adviser to the sandinista 
government told reporters of tuesdays 11thhour accord on 
verifying that commitments to democracy and human rights are 
fullfilled 
reichler said the formula revives the commissions of dialogue 
formed as a result of the esquipulas ii plan signed on aug 7 1987 
the commissions promoted dialogue between governments and their 
political opposition but ceased to function when the peace plan 
bogged down last year 
he said the dialogue commissions would be the first arbiters of 
disputes over electoral procedures respect for civil liberties and 
other matters stemming from government commitments under the 
esquipulas accord to complete democratization 
reichler said that if the dialogue commissions cannot resolve 
disputes the commissions of national reconciliation formed under 
the peace plan would serve as an appeal body 
these commissions also stopped operating in most of the signatory 
countries and would have to be revived they were headed by each 
countrys top roman catholic churchmen 
if the reconciliation commissions fail a panel of experts 
designated by the secretarygeneral of the organization of american 
states would serve as arbiter said reichler 
guatemala honduras el salvador and costa rica wanted to have 
the reconciliation commissions as final arbiter but nicaragua said 
that would stack the deck 
asked if the oas panel would include people from outside the 
region reichler said presumably 
reichler and other officials privy to the presidential 
discussions indicated earlier tuesday that the political 
verification issue was not going to be resolved here 
foreign minister alfonso cabrera of guatemala had told the 
associated press the presidents would give impetus to the spirit 
of verification but the nuts and bolts of monitoring compliance 
would have to be worked out later 
officials close to the talks said the presidents also agreed to 
look for a way to break up the contra apparatus constructed during 
the eight years of ronald reagans presidency 
reichler told reporters the presidents committed themselves to 
drafting a plan within 90 days for dismantling demobilizing and 
relocating the contras he gave no details 
an estimated 11000 contra fighters and about 10000 of their 
family members remain in camps in honduras near the nicaraguan 
border supported by us humanitarian aid many expressed a desire 
to go on fighting despite lack of us military help 
this summit was an attempt to resuscitate esquipulas ii which 
called for ceasefires in civil wars affecting nicaragua el 
salvador and guatemala democratization amnesties and a halt to 
outside aid for insurgents 
it banned use of one signatorys territory as a base for 
agression against that of another 
the foreign ministers last week worked out a preliminary accord 
for monitoring compliance with the territory clause the draft 
worked out at the united nations involves international monitors 
tentatively from canada west germany and spain who would work 
along the honduran borders 
officials said the presidents ratified that agreement monday 
then delved into the thornier issue of monitoring compliance with 
democratization

a government minister met 
tuesday with lawyers and parents of some of the nearly 300 black 
detainees who have vowed to starve themselves to death unless they 
are freed or charged with a crime 
in support of the hunger strikers anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu called on anglicans to fast each monday wednesday and friday 
after a twohour evening meeting with adriaan vlok minister of 
law and order one member of the sixparent delegation wallace 
motsetsi said he felt there was a ray of hope but delegate 
willie bokala said the meeting achieved nothing 
bokala said he was guardian of clive radebe 25 who he said has 
been in detention since november 1987 and entered his 21st day of a 
hunger strike tuesday 
we are faced with the difficult situation that children may die 
in detention bokala said before the meeting 
lt peet bothma spokesman for law and order minister adriaan 
vlok said detainees are reviewed and released every day and 17 
were freed tuesday 
but he warned it was dangerous to free detainees who were on 
hunger strike because they might go out and fill themselves up and 
they could die 
he said two were freed monday two days after they started eating 
again he said they were not released because they broke their fast 
but because of the regular review of detainees 
some strikers have not eaten for 22 days and 21 reportedly have 
been hospitalized vlok says fewer than 1000 people are being held 
under national emergency laws which allow indefinite detention 
without charge some have been held without charge since june 1986 
bothma said vlok spent several hours tuesday going over files of 
detainees with several lawyers 
he said vloks meeting with lawyers was part of a daily process 
of review which usually is made internally without outside 
consultation 
we are reviewing every detainee virtually on a daily basis 
bothma said every day someone is released and detainees 
positions are reviewed 
tutu said he and other antiapartheid church leaders will meet 
vlok on thursday to discuss the strike it has proved the strongest 
challenge yet to the governments policy of detention without trial 
tutu the winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize spoke by 
telephone with vlok on monday and described the minister as very 
concerned 
the very fact that he is ready to meet a delegation of lawyers 
and church leaders is an indication that he is prepared to listen to 
different points of view the bishop said 
he said a prayer service for the detainees would be held in cape 
town on thursday before his meeting with vlok and a larger 
solidarity service is planned friday 
vlok has used emergency regulations to ban any meetings to 
support the strikers and police have warned they are investigating 
newspapers that have described the hunger strikers physical 
conditions which may violate emergency rules 
the rev allan boesak who along with tutu is one of the 
countrys most influential antiapartheid clerics announced monday 
he is fasting in solidarity with the hunger strikers 
none of us wish to die boesak said in a letter to vlok 
but if this is the road we must take to make you and your 
government understand the evil of your ways we will take it 
the strikers include about 170 detainees at diepkloof prison 
outside johannesburg 105 at st albans prison in port elizabeth 
and 11 at a port elizabeth police station

faisal husseini a leading supporter of the plo 
in the occupied territories met with leftwing israeli legislators 
tuesday in the first such contact since the palestinian uprising 
began 14 months ago 
it was a general meeting and we discussed personal subjects 
husseini said after the twohour session at a guest house in arab 
east jerusalem he would say no more and members of the israeli 
delegation declined comment 
among the israelis were labor party legislator chaim ramon chaim 
tzadok a former labor justice minister legislator yair tzaban of 
the socialist party mapam and mapams general secretary elazar 
granot 
government policy prohibits contacts with the palestine 
liberation organization but leftist legislators want that changed 
on grounds the plo is israels inevitable partner in peace 
negotiations the government considers the plo a terrorist 
organization 
husseini who has spent 18 of the past 22 months in israeli 
prisons under administrative detention without trial has 
expressed willingness to meet with israelis of all political 
viewpoints 
i would like to spend more and more time talking with 
different groups of israelis not only groups that support my aims 
but those who are not supporting our aims he said in an interview 
earlier tuesday 
asked about talking with israeli leaders husseini said if 
its the right place the right timing the right person i will not 
say no if its the wrong time the wrong place the wrong person i 
will say no 
while in prison husseini met with shmuel goren coordinator of 
israeli policy in the occupied west bank and gaza strip which 
israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
goren arranged the meeting 
soldiers shot and wounded four palestinians in the occupied lands 
tuesday ranging in age from 9 to 16 arab hospital officials 
reported an army official confirmed a 9yearold was wounded in the 
west bank city of nablus 
at least 380 palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed since 
the uprising began and more than 7000 palestinians have been 
wounded 
merchants closed their shops in bethlehem a christian town in 
the west bank to protest raids by israeli tax authorities an arab 
reporter said tax boycotts have been a regular feature of the 
uprising 
in the golan heights captured from syrian in 1967 druse arabs 
held a general strike to protest israeli annexation of the area 
seven years ago hundreds of extra riot police were deployed to 
prevent violence 
the druse dont accept it the annexation because this is 
syrian territory a villager identified as arab zafadi said on 
israeli army radio 
about 150 syrians some shouting antiisraeli slogans through 
loudspeakers approached the border to support the druse israel 
radio said 
israel extended its law to the golan heights on dec 14 1981 
the druse began a campaign against it two months later but have not 
held regular protests in solidarity with the palestinian uprising 
the druse sect is an offshoot of islam

an advanced navigation satellite 
soared into orbit tuesday aboard the maiden flight of the air 
forces new delta 2 rocket a booster developed to carry vital 
military payloads grounded after the space shuttle challenger 
explosion 
it was the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the pentagon 
is ordering in a 14 billion program to resolve a postchallenger 
crisis that has seen about 40 needed reconnaissance and other 
national security payloads languish in storage for want of a launch 
vehicle 
the navstar global positioning system satellite carried on the 
delta 2s maiden flight tuesday was the first military payload 
shifted off the shuttle manifest to a throwaway booster 
the 30 million 128foot rocket roared off its launch pad at 
130 pm and the air force reported 30 miunutes later it had 
performed flawlessly in lofting the 65 million satellite into an 
initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11000 miles 
above the earth 
it was in every way a pictureperfect launch air force lt 
col bob tayloe the launch director told a news conference the 
satellite came up very strong and were receiving a good signal 
on thursday an onboard rocket motor is to fire to shift the 
satellite into a circular orbit about 11000 miles up 
the 3675pound navstar gps is an advanced version of seven 
earlier model navstars currently in orbit the new satellite will 
tell us and allied military forces where they are to within a few 
feet anywhere on the globe land sea or air 
the new satellite has more power and other improved systems and 
has two information channels instead of one with the second being 
encrypted for use only by the military 
users of the military channel will be able to plot their 
locations to within 50 feet in some cases to within 5 or 6 feet 
officials said 
civilian users will have to be satisfied with an accuracy of 
about 300 feet still pretty good if a person is in the middle of an 
ocean or a jungle said col marty e runkle director of the joint 
global positioning system office of the air force space division 
just about any military system or operation you can conceive of 
can use the gps system for location airplanes trucks submarines 
tanks troops whatever runkle told a news conference midair 
refueling or a linkup at sea in dark nights through the fog can be 
done without any communications or turning on of radar typically 
you have to turn on radar and essentially light up the sky 
the satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded navstars the air 
force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992 giving 
anyone anywhere in the world 24hour access to the positioning 
information 
the air force originally planned to launch all 21 on nasas space 
shuttle fleet but that plan was scrapped after the shuttle 
challenger exploded on jan 28 1986 now only two navstars remain 
scheduled on the shuttle 
pentagon officials decided after challenger they had made a 
mistake in abandoning unmanned rockets to launch all payloads on the 
shuttle and authorized the building of three new models of rockets 
the mediumsize delta 2 and atlas 2 and the much larger titan 4 
the delta 2 a more powerful version of the earlier delta rocket 
that has been flying since 1960 is the first of the new rockets to 
fly the titan 4 is scheduled to debut next month and the atlas 2 
next year 
the grounding of the shuttle and the air force titan 34d rocket 
also after a 1986 failure created a backlog of about 40 
reconnaisance communications navigation and other national 
security satellites 
six more delta four titan and two military shuttle flights 
scheduled this year will help drain down that backlog

the service also announced a separate 35 million award to the 
newport news shipbuilding amp drydock co to inactivate and defuel two 
old nuclearpowered attack submarines 
the two submarines are the skipjack which was commissioned in 
1959 and the sculpin commissioned in 1961 the navy described the 
deactivations as longplanned and routine and based on the age of 
the vessels 
the larger contract was awarded to peterson builders inc of 
sturgeon bay wis peterson is the lead contractor for the socalled 
avenger class of minesweepers 
two weeks ago the navy announced it had settled a dispute with 
another wisconsin shipyard that is building the vessels in that 
case the navy said it was providing additional money to ensure that 
the marinette marine corp which has been struggling financially 
completed work on the three ships it has under contract 
construction of the vessels at both yards was delayed for two 
years because of hundreds of design changes the ships are unusual 
in that they must be made with glassreinforced plastic sheathing on 
a wooden hull and use lowmetal engines in order to maintain the 
low magnetic signature essential to hunting and clearing mines 
peterson has delivered the first ship in the class the avenger 
and has four others under contract besides the three awarded 
tuesday the navy has not said how the settlement with marinette 
will affect that firms participation in the program

secretary of state james a baker iii met 
tuesday with greeces socialist premier after gaining turkeys 
approval for the upgrading of nato battlefield nuclear missiles 
baker later flew to rome where he is to meet with italian 
premier ciriaco de mita on wednesday 
a senior us official told reporters that prime minister turgut 
ozal of turkey during a stopover in ankara offered his support for 
upgrading of lance nuclear missiles a move that has become a 
contentious issue in west germany 
the most difficult problem for baker during his tour has been 
west germanys refusal to support doubling the lance missiles range 
to about 150 miles turkeys support strengthens the secretary of 
states hand as he plans for a nato summit meeting in may 
after an hourlong talk with premier andreas papandreou and 
foreign minister carolos papoulias at a luxurious seaside hotel 
baker said they had discussed the future of us military bases in 
greece 
papandreou has threatened to force american forces to withdraw 
from four large military bases and 20 smaller ones the fiveyear 
bases agreement expired on dec 20 but negotiations are continuing 
under an extension 
we talked about the issue of the bases my government believes 
that continuing our defense relationship is in the interest of both 
our countries baker said 
we still have difficult issues to resolve but i am very hopeful 
for an early and successful conclusion of the negotiations he 
said 
rome was the ninth stop on an eightday tour of 15 capitals of 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
although greekus relations have been improving in recent 
years delays in reaching a new agreement on the american bases here 
and repeated accusations that greece has been soft on terrorism have 
strained ties 
greek and american officials have held 14 rounds of talks on the 
bases since late 1987 
papandreou assured baker it is the desire not only the greek 
government but of all the greek people to promote relations between 
our two countries with continual improvement and to resolve whatever 
bilateral issues exist 
earlier in turkey baker discussed the 14year turkish military 
occupation of northern cyprus in meetings with ozal and foreign 
minister mesut yilmaz but the sessions reaffirmed the shared view 
that the nato alliance continues to have vitality cohesion and 
principles said the senior us official who briefed reporters 
under rules of anonymity 
us security assistance to turkey has risen to 610 million from 
560 million and the turks did not renew last years demand for 1 
billion in aid the official said 
greeces often testy relations with turkey have cramped us 
foreign policy in the alliances southern flank 
talks on the bases have stalled because of the socialist 
governments insistence that a new agreement provide assurances that 
the united states help solve greeces disputes with turkey over 
military control of the aegean sea its seabed mineral rights and 
over cyprus 
baker said he and the greek leaders also talked about 39yearold 
mohammed rashid wanted by the united states for the 1982 bombing of 
a pan am jet over hawaii a passenger died in the blast 
we also discussed the issue of terrorism and the need for very 
close cooperation among democracies to wipe out this scourge 
baker said 
a decision on extraditing rashid who has been jailed since his 
arrest last may is pending in the supreme court 
baker described as frank but friendly his talks with 
papandreou and papoulias which in diplomatic jargon indicates they 
encountered some discord but he said the officials shared the 
need for close cooperation among democracies to decrease this 
scourge of terrorism 
greece outraged thensecretary of state george p shultz last 
december by refusing to extradite osama abdel alzomar to italy for 
prosecution in a 1982 grenade attack on romes main synagogue 
instead zomar an alleged member of the abu nidal terrorist 
organization was sent to libya abu nidals home base

a house task force on thursday recommended 
removing the social security trust fund from calculations of the 
federal deficit because it makes the budget picture too optimistic 
and undermines the retirement program 
the social security trust funds represent an opportunity for 
current workers to save for their retirement the report said 
but they cannot have this effect if they are used simply to 
offset current deficits in other federal accounts 
the task force appointed by house democrats byron dorgan of 
north dakota and mary rose oakar of ohio included a bipartisan 
group of economists the panels view echoes a growing perception on 
capitol hill that using social security taxes to hide shortfalls in 
the governments operating budget is flawed and allows a drain on 
the economy 
the 1983 revisions to the social security law increased 
retirement taxes on workers to build up a surplus that would protect 
the baby boom generation when it retires early in the next century 
according to recent calculations by the congressional budget office 
the social security trust fund surplus reduces the deficit by 56 
billion this year and will soon top 100 billion a year 
but because that money is covering the shortfall in the rest of 
the budget the governmentenforced savings is essentially 
cancelled the task force said 
congress and the white house have included the trust fund in 
deficit calculations as specified in the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law removing the surplus would be politically difficult 
because the overall deficit would suddenly appear tens of billions 
of dollars worse and a balanced budget would be an even more elusive 
target 
but dorgan said the longterm risks to the nation should compel 
lawmakers to face up to the situation or they should replace social 
security taxes with levies less onerous to the working poor 
we ought to stop the practice coldturkey he said i hope 
that both the administration and the congressional budget writers 
will understand that were heading toward a cliff here

the immigration and naturalization 
service said tuesday it will begin processing political asylum 
applicants at a detention center outside the city which evicted the 
agency last week for health and fire violations 
a lawyer for central american immigrants said the sight of a 
prison will intimidate some people from applying for refugee status 
the applicants will not be locked in the minimumsecurity port 
isabel service processing center but ins district director omer g 
sewell said detention is being considered as a way to manage more 
than 100000 central americans expected to pour into southern texas 
this year 
there are a number of alternatives that are being considered 
and as attorney general richard thornburgh said detention was one 
of them sewell said 
he said a dispute with harlingen officials over garbage human 
waste and fire code violations at the asylum office speeded up 
previously made plans to move to the rural ins detention center 
southeast of the city 
but he said the ins could continue to process hundreds of asylum 
applicants in town if it chose to we want to be good citizens in 
this community as well sewell said 
the city evicted the agency from a former furniture store on the 
edge of town friday and chained the doors the city also obtained a 
temporary restraining order in state court to prevent the agency 
from reopening an unsafe and unsanitary facility 
ins officials responded monday by obtaining a federal restraining 
order to regain access to the building where they cut the chains 
sewell said the ins will go on using that building to process the 
applications of people seeking amnesty under the 1986 immigration 
reform law 
beginning wednesday however all political asylum claims must be 
submitted at the rural detention center asylum can be granted to 
immigrants fleeing political or other forms of persecution 
asylum processing will take place at a building outside the 
doublefenced detention area sewell said as of tuesday 425 
undocumented aliens were detained there most of them pending 
deportation proceedings 
city manager gavino sotelo welcomed the move but called it a 
partial solution he said the ins needs to detain asylum 
applicants who otherwise will continue to strain local communities 
with their need for shelter and assistance 
they need to address this problem the way they did with 
refugees from vietnam cuba and haiti sotelo said 
during an influx of cubans and haitians in the early 1980s the 
government used facilities similar to the detention center in 
southern texas sewell said 
the center on approximately 400 acres near the laguna atascosa 
national wildlife refuge also has an immigration court he said 
at the current rate of 2000 or more central americans a week 
crossing the border illegally near brownsville sewell said he 
expects more than 100000 asylumseeking immigrants to pass through 
the area this year 
hopefully well get control of the situation and there wont be 
this largescale need for processing asylum applicants sewell 
said 
the remote location and prison setting will discourage people 
from seeking asylum said mark schneider an attorney with the 
harlingenbased proyecto libertad legal aid office for central 
americans 
its going to be a return to the old days where people went 
underground instead of working through the system said schneider 
one of a group of immigration attorneys who on jan 6 sued the ins 
over a policy that restricted asylumseekers to southern texas while 
their cases for refugee status were under review 
us district judge filemon vela issued a restraining order jan 
9 allowing the immigrants to pursue their claims at their intended 
us destinations but vela has said he probably will allow the ins 
to resume the notravel policy next monday 
the policy which took effect dec 16 was blamed for a sudden 
increase of homeless central americans living in makeshift tents and 
condemned buildings in texas already impoverished lower rio grande 
valley 
health safety and traffic concerns expressed by community 
leaders in harlingen at that time led to immigration officials 
planning the move of the asylum processing sewell said

union carbide corp agreed tuesday to pay 
470 million to the government of india in a courtordered 
settlement resulting from the 1984 gas leak at bhopal that killed 
more than 3300 people in the worlds worst industrial disaster 
activists in bhopal denounced the settlement as a betrayal of the 
20000 victims who still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas that 
escaped from a pesticides plant on dec 3 1984 the government had 
sought 3 billion in damages 
chief justice rs pathak interrupted a government prosecutors 
routine argument when the court reconvened after lunch and ordered 
the usbased multinational company to pay the damages by march 31 
attorneys for the government and union carbide promptly agreed 
it was apparent that there was an outofcourt agreement 
between union carbide and the government said a court official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity for such an order there 
should have been excitement but there was no murmur even 
it wasnt entirely out of the blue said another source who 
also spoke on condition of anonymity 
pathak citing the enormity of human suffering said a 
settlement was needed to provide immediate and substantial 
relief 
more than 2000 people were killed almost immediately when the 
white vapor of methyl isocyanate seeped from a storage tank at the 
plant operated by union carbides indian subsidiary and drifted over 
nearby shantytowns and into bhopal 
the leak occurred shortly after midnight and some victims died 
in their sleep others blinded by tears and gasping for breath 
tried to flee but collapsed in death 
more than 20000 people still suffer from exposure to the gas and 
victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day according 
to a government gas relief board it says the death toll has reached 
3329 
pathak speaking for a fivejudge supreme court panel ordered 
union carbide to pay 470 million to the indian government in full 
and final settlement of all claims rights and liabilities related 
to and arising out of the bhopal gas disaster 
he also ordered all civil proceedings transferred to the supreme 
court and quashed all criminal charges including one of culpable 
homicide filed in 1987 against former union carbide chairman warren 
anderson 
pathak gave no details of how the money should be paid to the 
victims but he directed government prosecutors and attorneys for 
the danbury connbased company to submit a detailed agreement 
wednesday 
this is a fair and just settlement gopal subramanium one of 
the chief government attorneys told a reporter 
in new york union carbide spokesman earl slack said pathaks 
order was based on its review of all pleadings in india and the 
us applicable law and facts and the enormity of human suffering 
that requires substantial and immediate aid 
union carbides stock price soared 212 to 3125 a share in 
early trading on the new york stock exchange on tuesday and 
analysts said they approved of the settlement the closing price was 
3112 up an even 2 
psychologically its terrific financially its reasonable 
said leslie ravitz a research director for salomon brothers in new 
york this relieves the pressure on union carbide and the stigma 
james wilbur a vice president with smith barney harris upham 
and co inc in new york said union carbide had set aside 200 
million and had 250 million in insurance coverage 
the risk is minimal he said 
in bhopal a city of nearly 1 million people many politicians 
and activists were angered by the settlement 
this is a betrayal of the gas victims said babulal gaur a 
state legislator from the opposition bharatiya janata party he 
called the settlement negligible 
the government has once again come under the pressure from the 
lobby of multinationals said abdul jabbar khan who mobilizes 
demonstrations of gas victims 
many of the victims of the disaster live in burlap and cardboard 
shacks and were unaware of the settlement because they are too poor 
to own radios 
pathak ordered the settlement as the supreme court heard union 
carbides appeal of an order to pay 166 million in interim 
compensation to gas victims and a counterappeal by the government 
to raise the amount to 233 million 
the interim order was issued april 4 1988 by the high court in 
central indias madhya pradesh state where bhopal is located 
union carbide had argued the order would prejudice the cases 
outcome 
it maintained the gas leak was the result of sabotage by a 
disgruntled employee and slack said the company stood by the 
contention the indian government said the disaster was the result 
of negligence 
the disaster produced fierce debate around the world about the 
moral and legal responsibilities of multinational companies that set 
up shop in developing countries 
critics charged that rich corporations from industrial nations 
exploit third world countries union carbide officials complained 
privately that they were hamstrung by local restrictions 
in accordance with indian law the bhopal pesticide plant was 
owned by union carbide of india ltd and operated by local employees 
efforts to bring the case to trial in the united states were 
rejected by judges who said they had no jurisdiction 
the case began in the bhopal district court and made its way 
through the labyrinthine indian judiciary where cases can languish 
for years and even decades 
one bhopal judge was dismissed when it was discovered he was 
among the 500000 people who filed damage claims another judge was 
dismissed on grounds he was prejudiced against union carbide 
some of the claimants lived thousands of miles from bhopal but 
said they suffered mental anguish from worrying about the fate of 
loved ones including railroad passengers whose trains might have 
been near bhopal at the time of the leak

usborn john hull a supporter of 
nicaraguan rebels who is under arrest on drug and weapons charges 
has been moved from a hospital to a jail his lawyer elda zuniga 
said tuesday 
hull 69 had been in custody in a costa rican hospital where he 
was taken on jan 24 after suffering a heart attack in his jail cell 
he was taken to a prison near the capital on monday for transfer 
to the prison in san carlos 105 miles northwest of san jose near 
the border with nicaragua ms zuniga said she explained that san 
carlos is where his case will be processed because it is where the 
supposed law violations occurred 
a native of indiana hull moved to costa rica 20 years ago and 
has a ranch in los chiles near san carlos his lawyer says he 
became a costa rican citizen eight years ago 
hull was arrested on jan 13 on charges of drug trafficking and 
violating costa rican security ms zuniga refiled a petition 
tuesday asking that he be released on bail a similar request was 
denied earlier 
we hope this request is resolved favorably because johns 
health is not completely stable ms zuniga said 
she holds that the governments case is unfounded because the 
drug law hull was accused of violating in 1984 was not passed until 
1987 and is not retroactive 
costa rican authorities said hull was arrested for investigation 
of drug trafficking and spying for the antisandinista rebels after 
complaints by residents near his farm 
witnesses testifying before the us congress on illegal arms 
shipments to the contras have said hulls ranch was used by gun 
smugglers and cocaine traffickers 
hull strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking

the judge in oliver l norths case said 
tuesday the justice department must rely on independent prosecutors 
to prevent surprise disclosures of state secrets during the 
irancontra trial 
us district judge gerhard a gesell rejected a proposal he said 
would have allowed the justice department during the trial to file 
objections in bits and pieces to disclosing information needed 
by the defense 
gesell challenged the attorney general dick thornburgh to end the 
case once and for all by filing an affidavit barring disclosure of 
secrets if thornburgh believed procedures the judge has adopted are 
inadequate to protect national security 
he can act now if he wants gesell told thornburgh aide 
stephen a saltzburg 
the decision means the justice department must decide whether it 
can rely on independent counsel lawrence e walsh to protect secrets 
that the department has said could endanger lives if disclosed in 
court 
our lawyers are reviewing the judges order said thornburgh 
aide david runkel adding that justice department officials have 
been meeting with the independent counsel 
there are a number of things being discussed back and forth 
runkel said its a question of reviewing the options we want 
the trial to continue but we want to safeguard against the 
unauthorized release of classified information runkel said 
in the meantime gesell said he will await a supreme court ruling 
on whether the trial will be stayed indefinitely while an appellate 
court reviews the justice departments objection to secrecy 
procedures already put in place by the judge 
the high court which has temporarily stayed the trials start 
will meet friday to discuss the issue 
charges against north include shredding documents and lying to 
congress and thenattorney general edwin meese iii in 1986 to hide 
his role in the sales of arms to iran and diversion of some proceeds 
to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the judges comments came during a hearing on a compromise 
proposal worked out between the justice department and walsh 
covering procedures for deciding which classified information could 
or couldnt be aired during the trial 
the proposal was aimed at preventing surprise disclosures by 
north and it was strongly opposed by the former national security 
council aides lawyers 
gesell ruled that the justice department must rely on walshs 
prosecutors to speak in court for the government on all disclosure 
issues including appeals of any rulings that some secrets are 
relevant to norths defense 
only if the justice department determines it must stop the case 
can it file an affidavit barring further disclosures under the 
classified information procedures act the judge ruled 
saltzburg said well do everything in our power to take this 
case forward if we can do it safely 
it is the responsibility of the attorney general to ensure that 
before classified information is disclosed in the case that the 
national security can withstand such a disclosure he told gesell 
the judge said he wouldnt let thornburgh chop up the case 
with a series of affidavits barring disclosure of information each 
time north tried to introduce evidence the government found 
objectionable 
i find no basis for giving him a seat at counsel table or the 
right to intervene by way of bits and pieces of affidavits whenever 
the going gets tough gesell said 
the judge reminded saltzburg that he had already made a series of 
pretrial rulings governing what north can and cannot disclose 
during the trial 
gesell said he expected that if you feel that was inappropriate 
on my part that you would take appropriate steps but that you 
dont seem to want to do 
the department of justice finds itself in a damned if you do 
damned if we dont position saltzburg said 
so what you are saying is the attorney general is unprepared 
not willing to exercise his authority now to fully protect that 
information the judge said what he wants to see is if you can 
wriggle through it against the courts rulings he has it in his 
power to act 
thats an unfair statement saltzburg said 
on a related issue the judge said he would consider at a later 
hearing defense objections to part of the proposed agreement 
between the justice department and walsh on how certain evidence 
would be presented at trial 
under the agreement the justice department would allow 
introduction of a general admission with no details that the 
reagan administration made quid pro quo arrangements with 
foreign countries to solicit military aid for the nicaraguan contras 
at a time when us assistance was banned by congress 
gesell said he would give norths lawyers an opportunity to 
propose changes in the governments summary which has not been made 
public saying he had a sense that the quid may be underplayed 
in a new filing tuesday norths lawyers said inducements offered 
to central american nations in return for their military support 
for the resistance was in part cia covert support 
if the court requires prior notice of this covert support it 
will effectively require prior notice before any exploration of quid 
pro quo arrangements that are central to this case norths 
lawyers said 
they have objected to the agreement saying their defense of 
north requires introduction of details about the quid pro quo 
which they say include involvement by former president reagan in a 
coverup of such arrangements with the other countries as well as an 
agreement that congress be kept in the dark

a civilian who saved the military 63 
million was finally paid back tuesday with a government check for 
18375 
john ledoux a sergeant with the vermont army national guard 
created a device two years ago that detects whether the infrared 
lights on a helicopter work his 870 creation replaced a 4500 
pair of special goggles 
during a ceremony in the burlington building where he built the 
device ledoux finally received an incentive award from the federal 
office of personnel management after taxes the 25000 reward came 
to 1837550 
ledoux said he was glad to finally get the award which was held 
up for several months because the white house apparently lost the 
letter authorizing the payment 
i feel like its been put off for so long its lost its glow 
but im glad its finally coming to a head said the softspoken 
father of five who accepted the check with his family by his side 
my wife and i have a big family so of course the money is 
nice he said 
the award is the maximum allowed by law and the largest given to 
a federal employee said joseph jamele press secretary for sen 
patrick leahy dvt he said 20 such awards have been granted 
ledoux 33 is a former military technician who worked full time 
at the national guard base in burlington before taking a job with 
the federal aviation administration last year he developed his 
device in 1986 after watching engineers with the lockheed aircraft 
corp test infrared lights on helicopters 
ledoux was concerned the engineers had to perch in precarious 
positions to test the lights particularly while standing on the 
choppers or on ramps outside the helicopter hanger 
it was more for the safety of individuals that was his 
concern said maj george bergeron ledouxs former boss 
vermont ramps are pretty cold and icy 
ledoux built the handheld infrared sensor from 870 worth of 
parts from the local hardware store when he first came up with 
this he stayed up late after work in the shop quite a few nights 
he did that to improve his idea bergeron said 
the army embraced the device after ledoux sent one down 
according to bergerons estimates it has saved the military 987000 
hours of labor a year for a total 685 million bergeron estimated 
net savings of 63 million after subtracting the costs of materials 
and of implementing the device

advocates for the disabled on tuesday hailed 
a federal court ruling requiring wheelchair lifts on new public 
buses but a spokesman for transit agencies said the ruling doesnt 
address vexing problems 
weve been grappling with this for a long time said albert 
engelken deputy executive director of the washingtonbased american 
public transit association 
he said wheelchair lifts receive limited use where they exist and 
are an added expense to transit agencies at a time when federal 
subsidies have been dwindling 
on monday a 3rd us circuit court of appeals panel ruled 21 
that congress has made its wishes on accessibility clear and that 
liftequipped buses are part of that mandate 
the court ordered the us transportation department to rewrite a 
regulation allowing communities to offer alternative paratransit 
service such as van rides to the disabled it said the 24hour 
reservations that riders need to make for such services hinder 
spontaneous use of mass transit 
james d fornari a new york city attorney for a group of 
veterans with spinal cord injuries said the ruling will force 
transit systems to look for the most efficient means of serving 
disabled people 
he said the ruling also could influence transportation department 
regulations being drafted on light rail and commuter rail systems 
we are quite pleased with this decision and i see it as a 
springboard for making other transit systems which have buses 
accessible to the mobility impaired so they can be mainstreamed 
into american life and society fornari said 
transportation department spokesman bob marx declined comment on 
the ruling he said attorneys for the department had not yet seen 
the decision 
engelken said his associations board which comprises the heads 
of transit agencies across the nation believes agencies should be 
able to decide on a local basis how best to serve disabled people 
up until now the courts have ruled that it was local option 
he said this evidently is a new twist 
a transit association task force is studying the issue of 
handicapped access and is scheduled to report by the end of the 
year he said 
many local transportation officials declined comment on the 
ruling because they had not seen it 
but peter dimond a spokesman for massachusetts bay 
transportation authority in boston said we have made a pledge 
that all buses we purchase in the future will be liftequipped 
the boston authority operates 800 buses daily of which about a 
third are liftequipped dimond said a new batch of 200 buses is on 
order all equipped with lifts the agency also provides 
doortodoor van service 
carol boudreaux a spokeswoman for metropolitan transit authority 
in houston said none of the authoritys more than 900 buses are 
equipped with lifts but she said the authority has always complied 
with transportation department regulations in the past and expected 
it would with any new regulations mandated by the ruling 
the houston authority offers a service with vans or cabs in 
which the handicapped pay a portion 
donna alston a spokeswoman for southeastern pennsylvania 
transportation authority said 568 of the authoritys 1510 buses 
are liftequipped she said the authority provides 1200 rides on 
its alternative paratransit service on an average weekday 
a chicago transit authority spokeswoman who asked that her name 
not be used said that the cta has more than 2000 buses and none 
have wheelchair lifts 
the appeals court also upheld a lower court order that the 
transportation department rewrite regulations that relieve transit 
authorities of their obligations to ensure accessibility if they 
spend 3 percent of their budget on services to the handicapped 
given the clear congressional mandate of accessibility the 
dots choice of the cost cap exceeded its discretion wrote judge 
carol los mansmann in the majority ruling 
but judge morton i greenberg dissented saying he felt the 
majority went too far to the extent that money is spent for 
adding lifts to regular transit coaches it will not be available for 
paratransit services unless general services are curtailed fares 
raised or more aid obtained he wrote 
fornari who represented the eastern paralyzed veterans 
association in the case said cost was not a major factor in transit 
agencies failure to install wheelchair lifts 
the cost of paratransit is far in excess of what this will 
cost he said 
rather the ruling will require transit operators to meet 
service criteria instead of just throwing money at it fornari 
said 
it costs 15000 to equip a bus with a wheelchair lift and buses 
cost about 200000 according to joaquin bowman a spokesman for 
the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority which serves 
the philadelphia metropolitan area 
the ruling came in connection with suits filed in 1986 by the 
veterans group and a coalition called americans disabled for 
accessible public transportation which has chapters in 25 cities 
and whose members have been arrested at demonstrations around the 
country

gov joe frank harris was among the 
pallbearers as about 350 people paid their last respects tuesday to 
his slain 74yearold aunt 
the bluerobed choir left a space at the usual seat of allie 
morrow roper as the mourners assembled at faith united methodist 
church for a service in which she was eulogized as a devout 
christian who cared and prayed for her fellow man 
there still were no suspects in her strangulation authorities 
said 
the sanctuary of the small red brick church where miss 
allie was a longtime member could not hold all the mourners 
about 50 listened to a speaker in a church courtyard 
the sanctuary which usually included flowers arranged by mrs 
roper for sunday services was lined with floral arrangements 
the governor did not speak at the service at which his brother 
fred harris eulogized their aunt as mischievous but a source of 
strength for their family 
he said he had been told the oven in her home was on when her 
body was found sunday he said she apparently was preparing to bake 
and i believe that was for joe franks birthday thursday 
authorities have speculated mrs roper was killed by an intruder 
saturday her body was discovered when she did not show up for 
church sunday 
cartersville police have begun circulating a composite drawing of 
a man seen near mrs ropers home but public safety director otis 
chupp said there is still nothing concrete 
a reward fund organized by the cartersvillebartow county chamber 
of commerce had reached more than 6000 tuesday

clemency hearing will be held for a man who says he was framed for 
the fatal poisonings of his seven children in 1967

the road of freedom for james richardson

the clemency hearing and the inmate said his prayers had been 
answered 
i want to be free richardson told rubin it has been 
terrible and when i walk out of this prison i want to look at these 
men who put me here straight in the eye and i will then ask god to 
forgive them this is one of the greatest days of my life 
richardson and his wife were picking fruit on oct 25 1967 when 
their children aged 2 to 8 ate a parathionlaced lunch of beans 
rice and grits the lunch had been prepared ahead of time but was 
served by neighbor betsy reese at the familys arcadia home 
prosecutors said richardson killed all seven children but he was 
convicted of only one firstdegree murder count in 1968 for the 
death of his 8yearold stepdaughter betty jean bryant 
martinez said his office will consult with dade county state 
attorney janet reno whom he asked on feb 1 to investigate the 
case before scheduling a hearing

county supervisors considering joining the 
city in banning semiautomatic assault rifles heard testimony tuesday 
about how the fatal shooting of a mother traumatized her husband and 
children 
supervisor kenneth hahn has proposed a ban on the sale and 
possession of the militarystyle rifles in unincorporated areas of 
los angeles county an anticipated vote was delayed however 
because one supervisor was ill 
meanwhile in olympia wash a republican state senator who 
strongly opposes gun controls bowed tuesday to demands that the law 
and justice committee he heads consider restrictions on ownership of 
semiautomatic weapons sen kent pullen said he will hold a hearing 
next tuesday but would wait for public response before deciding 
whether to hold a committee vote 
several california cities have banned the guns and state 
lawmakers have begun considering action since a man with an assault 
rifle killed five children and wounded 29 others and a teacher at a 
stockton school jan 17 
although the vote was delayed two weeks the county board of 
supervisors listened to testimony about the victims of shootings 
the rev guy wilson pastor of our lady of victory church in 
compton said that last year he lost 13 parishioners to gunfire in 
the gangridden south central los angeles area he brought with him 
the children of one victim rosalinda cisneros 28 who was slain by 
an assault weapon 18 months ago 
the cisneros family the five children here with me they saw 
their mother gunned down wilson said 
the mother had in her arms her 4weekold child when she heard 
the shooting she turned to protect the child and she herself took 
the shot through the heart and died wilson said 
he said the father was so traumatized he turned to drink and is 
now in prison for an alcoholrelated offense the five children now 
live with another family who have eight children of their own 
wilson said 
brian baker a member of the national rifle association argued 
against a ban the issue is being touted as a law and order 
concern but i feel were seeing a cynical attempt to accomplish 
total gun confiscation he said 
under the proposal the assault rifles could still be owned by 
museums licensed dealers law enforcement agencies and the military 
the cities of stockton los angeles carson and compton have 
enacted bans on semiautomatic assault rifles and one was proposed 
monday in san diego 
colt industries inc filed a federal lawsuit in los angeles on 
monday saying the citys new law banning sales of semiautomatic 
rifles will cause the firm financial harm and hurt its image the 
weapons company makes the ar15 semiautomatic rifle which is 
included under the law

an idle reactor on the hanford nuclear 
reservation could produce tritium for weapons after a threeyear 
125 million conversion providing a quick fix for the nations 
nuclear arms program a study says 
the nations only supply of tritium a radioactive isotope of 
hydrogen that is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons has been cut 
off since early last year because of reactor safety problems at 
south carolinas savannah river plant 
the 55 million study authorized by the us department of 
energy considered whether hanfords idle n reactor could be made 
into a shortterm tritium producer until new reactors could be 
built a site manager at westinghouse hanford said tuesday 
it would cost 125 million over three years to set the reactor 
up for tritium wallace ruff manager of defense reactors at the 
southcentral washington site told the associated press 
hanfords n reactor which manufactured another key nuclear 
weapons ingredient plutonium has been on cold standby since 
early 1988 because of a surplus of plutonium 
the plan outlined by the study which was conducted by 
westinghouse hanford co would be a relatively quick and 
inexpensive fix for a us nuclear weapons program that is without a 
working reactor producing tritium and faces steep costs in building 
new tritium reactors 
the production and supply of nuclear weapons materials is 
classified but ruff said the study found the n reactor could meet 
tritium production needs 
such a development could ease the impact of the 2800 layoffs 
expected when the n reactor is completely shut down about 1800 of 
those layoffs already have occurred 
the energy department is planning tritium reactors in south 
carolina and idaho and an experimental method of using a linear 
accelerator to produce tritium also has drawn much recent attention 
the linear accelerator would be at least seven years away from 
production and the new reactors about a decade away 
a third proposal to convert an unfinished civilian reactor at 
hanford to tritium production has run into considerable opposition 
from antinuclear activists who say that would violate international 
nonproliferation agreements 
tom bauman a spokesman for the energy department in richland 
said no decision has been made on restarting the n reactor for 
tritium 
the department is constantly looking at this he said 
the n reactor which began operations in 1963 could operate 
about nine years as a tritium producer at about 150 million per 
year before the plant was adversely affected by aging ruff said 
the reactor shared some design similarities with the chernobyl 
plant whose 1986 destruction killed 31 people both used graphite 
in the reactor core to moderate nuclear fission and lacked a 
containment dome to trap accidental emissions 
federal officials have repeatedly said the n reactor is much 
safer than the soviet plant and 100 million worth of safety 
improvements were performed after the n reactor was closed for 
inspections in early 1987

army troops backed by tanks battled 
christian militiamen in east beirut and hills above the capital 
early wednesday in an apparent showdown for control of lebanons 
christian heartland police reported 
police said at least four combatants were killed and 12 wounded 
in the power struggle between christian army units and the lebanese 
forces the main christian militia in the nearly 14yearold civil 
war against the moslems 
thousands of residents huddled in basements and bomb shelters as 
the fighting flared into the early hours wednesday others dodged 
sniper fire to ring church bells in residential neighborhoods in 
protest against the worsening hostilities a police spokesman said 
also tuesday moderate shiite moslems demonstrated in 13 villages 
in south lebanon demanding a ban on the return of fundamentalist 
supporters of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
christian army units routed lebanese forces militiamen from many 
of their strongholds along beiruts dividing green line and the 
mountain towns of souk elgharb and bekfaya east and northeast of 
beirut police said 
christian militiamen responded by mounting grenadethrowing 
assaults on army barracks and an air base in the coastal town of 
edma 15 miles north of beirut said the police spokesman 
it looks like a showdown unless its quickly curbed it could 
escalate into an allout war said the spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing rergulations 
the confrontation was touched off by a firefight northeast of 
beirut at sundown tuesday prompting announcements by both sides 
that they have put their forces on alert 
the lebanese forces command accused the army of sending five 
tankled battalions of 4000 troops rolling down on beiruts 
christian sector from the mountains and that the 6000strong 
militia was braced for a confrontation the army denied the 
accusation 
the lebanese forces earlier said its fighters were ordered to 
stand by to defend all their positions after a shootout with the 
army in lebanons central mountain range six miles northeast of 
beirut 
the flareup was the third between the two sides in one week 
heightening the struggle for supremacy between the two most powerful 
christian fighting machines 
police in the southern port city of tyre said the antihezbollah 
demonstrations were organized by the prosyrian amal militia whose 
fighters evicted hezbollah from most of the south last april 
schools shops and businesses were closed in the 13 villages in 
sympathy with the protest 
the biggest antihezbollah march on tuesday was in siddiqin six 
miles southeast of tyre where about 2000 demonstrators waved 
banners saying no to the party of satan no to iran in south 
lebanon 
about 1000 villagers in nearby qana paraded in dusty streets 
chanting keep the murderers away we dont want them back 
the return of unarmed hezbollahis was provided for in a peace 
accord signed by the two militias in damascus syria last month 
the agreement ended a 10monthold struggle for dominance of 
lebanons 1 million shiites the nations largest sect

on the corner of neon and lonely streets in the 
bar of the heartbreak hotel dreams dont even have time to die hard 
thats because someone is stealing them drugging the dreamers 
and slipping into their subconscious to pilfer their most private 
fantasies and thoughts 
if that sounds like an audacious and unlikely subject for song 
and dance it is but then in a pigs valise the new musical 
which arrived tuesday at offbroadways second stage may well be 
the most audacious and unlikely new musical of the season 
thats not to say perfect but eric overmyer who wrote the 
book and lyrics and august darnell who wrote the music have an 
affection for the writings of raymond chandler and dashiell hammett 
and the hardboiled detective stories they are spoofing because of 
that its easy to overlook a repetitiveness that eventually 
sidetracks the show once the novelty of the dialogue begins to wear 
off 
the musicals hero is a pudgy shamus named james taxi hired by a 
latin spitfire named dolores con leche meaning sorrows with milk 
explains taxi to find her missing sister the search leads to the 
heartbreak hotel and nefarious doings by a gang of thugs led by the 
notorious bucket brothers shrimp and gut 
the gang kidnaps people and makes off with their dreams to sell 
as computerized holograms their biggest catch is walt disney his 
body frozen wrapped like a mummy and waiting for the big thaw but 
these criminals will take the minds of just about anyone including 
dolores who goes undercover as an ethnic folk dancer in the hotels 
nightclub 
the plot is awash in simile metaphor and enough tough guy double 
talk to baffle bogart much of the deliberately purple prose is 
relayed directly to the audience by taxi and most of it while not 
advancing the plot is very funny 
taxi played by nathan lane is a loser a wellmeaning 
marshmallow masquerading as a hardedged private eye lane fits the 
role perfectly hes a brash performer who moves and sings well 
forty years ago he would have worked steadily on broadway today 
he has to be content with occasional forays into musical comedy 
ada maris sizzles as the tempestuous dolores and michael 
mccormick is a hilarious foil as the evil and fleetoffoot shrimp 
bucket 
as he demonstrated in his plays on the verge and in 
perpetuity throughout the universe overmyer revels in language 
he has an ear for pop vernacular of the past but he laces it with an 
uptodate sensibility that makes it funny in 1989 
overmyers lyrics dont have the intricacy and linguistic dazzle 
of his dialogue but they fit the eclectic score by darnell best 
known as the leader of the band kid creole and the coconuts 
darnells music is not the stuff of typical musical comedy its 
all over the place with bits and pieces of jazz rock pop salsa 
reggae and even rap stuffed into the score 
the show thanks to set designer bob shaw and lighting designer 
peggy eisenhauer has the feel of one of those smoky 1940s warner 
bros detective movies all shadows and neon signs 
graciela danieles fastpaced direction and snappy choreography 
propel the musical rushing the actors through the plot when details 
try to bog down the evening but for much of time in a pigs 
valise is as scintillating and seductive as the saxophone wail 
that begins the show

fumio niwa soared into the night early 
wednesday hoping his huge orange and blue balloon will find the 
easterly jet stream and carry him to san diego on the first solo 
balloon flight across the pacific 
san diego is the sister city of yokohama his hometown but niwa 
may not reach it even if he crosses the ocean successfully late 
weather reports said the winds in the jet stream which begins at 
about 35000 feet had veered to the north and probably would take 
the balloon toward alaska instead 
just before setting off for north america which he hoped to 
reach in about four days niwa said my long dream of crossing the 
pacific is coming true today i still wonder if its really 
possible the jet stream is bending strangely but america is big so 
i think ill make it somewhere 
as people say things that go up must come down so im not 
very worried 
after nearly five hours of slow climbing in the cold evening sky 
fumio niwa reported wednesday morning everything is going 
fine a spokesman said 
in his first radio contact with home made at 621 am 421 est 
tuesday niwa said the balloon was about 80 miles southeast of 
yokohama where he lifted off at 147 am 1247 est tuesday 
according to project spokesman tadakatsu izumi 
izumi said niwas balloon flying at an altitude of 8200 feet 
would head toward the south for some time before reaching 
highaltitude winds later in the day 
his balloon has no maneuvering ability so its direction depends 
entirely on the wind it carries no navigation equipment and niwa 
must rely on amateur radio reports of his location based on 
satellite trackings 
ground equipment used to receive the satellite data malfunctioned 
and a standby unit was installed delaying his takeoff for several 
hours 
niwa 38 says he never outgrew his childhood love of playing and 
is making what he hopes will be a 5000mile flight to test the 
balloon and gondola both of which he designed 
if just flying were my purpose id buy a readymade balloon 
he said but i like to design and make my own equipment and then 
try it out 
the gondola the fifth niwa has designed is a globe six feet in 
diameter too small inside for a passenger to stand and made of a 
plastic stronger than the type used for bulletproof vests it is 
pressurized because of the high altitudes at which he plans to 
travel 
unlike most niwas helium balloon is completely sealed and 
filled with pressurized gas high winds monday and tuesday delayed 
the filling process and tore parts of an outer reflective layer of 
silver fabric 
niwa quit his job at a computer company in november to prepare 
for the flight which he estimates will cost the equivalent of about 
540000 he hopes to earn most of it back from a book and public 
appearances 
because of financial constraints he said the gondola has no 
alarms to warn of a loss of gas or sudden change in altitude it 
also has no heating system and niwa must rely on electric heating 
coils in his flying suit to keep him warm in temperatures expected 
to reach 60 below zero 
he has about 1000 hours of ballooning experience most in 
hotair balloons and none outside japan

antigovernment campaign launched in july 1987 they accuse the 
government of conceding too much to rebels of the minority tamil 
community in a largely unsuccessful attempt to end a 6yearold 
insurrection 
the government says the militants have killed at least 800 people 
since jan 1 and at least 1500 since they started their campaign 
the election also is opposed by tamil guerrillas fighting for an 
independent homeland in the north and east 
a rebel statement issued tuesday said tamils objected to the 
polls because voting was being held under conditions of war and 
violence with continuing military repression 
in one incident tuesday three bus passengers and a driver were 
killed when sinhalese fired on buses operating in defiance of a 
strike call aimed at disrupting the elections officials said 
sinhalese with revolvers ordered passengers to get off then 
poured kerosene on the vehicles and set them on fire said a police 
official 
shops in colombo and towns in the south stayed closed tuesday in 
response to a sinhalese call for a twoday strike residents said 
government officials insisted that the violence would only 
marginally affect voter turnout 
indian soldiers in the tamildominated north and east are trying 
to put down the tamil insurrection 
india initially became involved in the ethnic crisis in sri 
lanka just off indias southern tip because of the 60 million 
tamils in india who sympathize with the rebel cause 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and say 
they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population and control the government and the 
military 
the parliamentary elections are being held for the first time on 
the basis of proportional representation 
voters will cast ballots for parties and the percentage of votes 
received will determine the number of seats each party will gain in 
parliament candidates will be chosen by preferential votes but the 
choices will be restricted to party nominees

gunmen killed a councilman 
belonging to sinn fein the legal political wing of the ira in the 
second slaying of a roman catholic public figure this week police 
said 
no group immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell 
on protestant paramilitaries opposed to the outlawed irish 
republican army a mainly roman catholic group fighting british rule 
of the province 
john joe davey who was in his late 50s was gunned down as he 
approached his home near gulladuff about 30 miles northwest of 
belfast said a spokesman at police headquarters in belfast 
police said several bullets hit him in the chest they said his 
wife ran down the lane from their home when she heard the shots but 
found her husband already dead 
davey was returning from a town council in nearby magherafelt 
police said davey was one of three members of sinn fein who sat in 
the predominantly protestant council 
the attack followed the killing sunday of catholic attorney 
patrick finucane who had acted for clients in the ira 
finucane was slain by three gunmen at his home in north belfast 
a outlawed protestant paramilitary group the ulster freedom 
fighters claimed responsibility for his death 
almost exactly a year ago davey survived a killing attempt in 
exactly the same spot sinn fein said in a statement that he had 
survived three other assassination attempts 
the ira wants to unite predominantly protestant northern ireland 
with the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist 
rule

to northern ireland to discuss how to form a government that would 
replace direct rule from london 
tom king northern ireland secretary said one of his four junior 
ministers dr brian mawhinney will make the factfinding trip to 
belfast 
king apparently referring to secret talks between the main 
northern ireland parties that started in duisburg west germany 
late last year said the question now is whether the 
constitutional political parties and those who support them wish to 
make progress 
if they do then i want to ensure that the government is ready 
to play its part in whatever way is appropriate and helpful king 
said 
mawhinney 48 who is a house of commons legislator for an 
english electoral district was born in northern ireland

presidential candidate carlos 
menem of the opposition peronist party was quoted on tuesday as 
saying the falkland islands belong to argentina and will be 
recovered even if we must suffer the spilling of blood 
argentina will not give in menem said during a campaign 
swing monday night according to argentinas two independent news 
agencies diarios y noticias and noticias argentinas 
the malvinas argentinas name for the territory off its south 
coast that it has claimed since 1810 will return to form part of 
the national territory even if we must suffer the spilling of 
blood he was quoted as saying 
menem was on a visit to ushuaia 2045 miles south of the capital 
city of buenos aires 
argentina and britain went to war over the sparsely populated 
windswept and virtually treeless islands in 1982 argentine troops 
invaded on april 2 a british expeditionary force recovered the 
islands after a counterattack in which 712 argentine and 255 british 
soldiers died 
the war lasted 74 days argentina surrendered but refused to 
formally declare an end to hostilities neither side resumed 
diplomatic relations 
britains claim dates to 1833 it has since fortified the islands 
and enforced a 200mile zone of exclusion around them argentina has 
tried to isolate the islands commercially by prohibiting direct 
flights or ships from the mainland 
it has tried to apply international pressure to force britain to 
negotiate the islands sovereignty british prime minister margaret 
thatcher has refused 
the two agencies also quoted menem as saying i dont know how 
much time will pass or how much blood we will have to spill to see 
that the malvinas return to argentine territory 
president raul alfonsin and foreign minister dante caputo who 
also is president of the un general assembly have said argentina 
inherited the islands upon declaring independence from spain and 
the government will try to recover them peacefully through 
negotiation 
ownership is an article of faith here argentine maps identify 
the islands as the malvinas and schoolchildren are taught they were 
stolen by britain 
recovering the falklands is a main foreign policy theme of 
political groups from both left and right along with the 4 
millionmember general labor confederation which backs menem 
menem in the past said he would seek the islands recovery by 
diplomacy if he wins election on may 14 it was not known whether he 
was speaking rhetorically in ushuaia or shifting and hardening his 
position 
a telephone call seeking comment from the british interests 
section at the swiss embassy rang repeatedly but was not answered

tulsa voters who have refused to change the 
citys government four times in 35 years overwhelmingly approved a 
new city charter tuesday that could end a legal challenge by black 
residents 
a strong mayorcouncil form of government was approved by 33373 
votes or 71 percent to 14213 votes or 29 percent 
this makes a very special valentines day for all of us said 
mayor rodger randle who along with the citys four other elected 
commissioners campaigned in support of the new charter 
tulsa has had a commission form of government elected at large 
since 1908 under the new charter the mayor gains power and 
continues to be elected at large while nine councilmen will be 
elected by districts 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
has sued tulsa contending the atlarge balloting for commissioners 
unconstitutionally dilutes the minority black vote concentrated in 
north tulsa 
similar lawsuits in other cities have resulted in judges ordering 
cities to change to a more representative government a federal 
judge has set a march 9 hearing on the tulsa lawsuit to determine 
whether the new charter makes the claims of the lawsuit moot 
election board officials said rain kept voter turnout under the 
predicted 50000 of the citys 225000 registered voters 
a 1969 proposal that would have changed tulsas form of 
government failed by 63 votes out of more than 23000 cast the most 
recent a 1973 proposal was defeated by a wide margin 
city officials say the commission government is expensive and 
inefficient 
supporters of tuesdays measure said better representation for 
black voters would be one of the benefits of changing the charter 
under the proposal a parttime council would pass laws and 
control the budget while the mayor would have administrative power 
and propose a budget the mayor would be responsible for city 
departments now divided among six fulltime commissioners 
opponents said the charter change would give the mayor too much 
power

manhattan borough president david dinkins 
announced tuesday that he was running for mayor saying 12 years 
under mayor edward i koch had polarized the city and left it 
desperate for new direction 
i am running because i believe this city needs a different 
direction new ideas and a fresh perspective dinkins said 
the announcement at a crowded news conference followed months of 
speculation and recent obvious hints that dinkins would take on koch 
in the september primary for the democratic nomination in an effort 
to become the citys first black mayor several polls have indicated 
dinkins could beat koch 
i am running because our city has become sharply polarized 
he said we need a mayor who can transcend differences so we can 
work together to solve our problems 
dinkins 61 is a lawyer who served as state legislator board of 
elections president and city clerk before being elected in 1985 on 
his third try for borough president each of new yorks five 
boroughs has a president who has a seat on the board of estimate 
which passes on budget and planning matters for the entire city 
i am prepared to lead this city in the new direction we so 
desperately need dinkins said new yorkers are tired of 
politicians who talk tough but act only after problems reach crisis 
proportions 
koch and dinkins are publicly respectful to each other but the 
relationship frosted a bit when koch strongly criticized democratic 
presidential candidate jesse jackson during last years race 
dinkins supported jackson and said he expects jackson to 
participate in the campaign 
the mayor clearly has on occasion contributed to the 
polarization of our city dinkins said 
koch said he considers dinkins to be a very formidable 
candidate i perceive myself as the underdog thats not just 
rhetoric i think the polls show that i hope to turn them around 
i welcome him into the race koch said i think that he is 
a very decent guy i know that both he and i will conduct the 
election battle in a responsible way 
while democrats make up a strong majority of the citys voters 
republicans may also have a primary featuring wellknown candidates 
this year former federal prosecutor rudolph giuliani will likely 
announce his candidacy for mayor sometime in march said us 
rep guy molinari rny molinari said he had had five meetings 
with giuliani to discuss a mayoral run 
republican ronald lauder heir to the estee lauder cosmetics 
fortune and a former ambassador to austria has already announced 
his candidacy 
several polls have shown that dinkins would defeat koch and other 
potential democratic candidates such as city council president 
andrew stein special state prosecutor charles j hynes city 
councilwoman ruth w messinger and former us rep herman badillo 
though he downplayed the importance of polls dinkins said id 
rather be me than them if youll accept that grammar 
in contrast with the combative koch dinkins has a courtly 
manner raising the question of what tone the campaign would have 
ive been described as a nice guy as a gentleman dinkins 
said some of my close friends might dispute that 
but let me tell you im also an exmarine and i dont 
intend for a second to get shoved around in this or any other 
campaign so lets be clear on that

whole milk cheese and other dairy 
products have overtaken meat as the top source of unhealthy 
saturated fat in many teenagers diets new research suggests 
dr curtis ellison of boston university school of medicine said 
tuesday that surveys he conducted at two elite new england prep 
schools found that dairy products contributed about 35 percent of 
students daily consumption of saturated fat 
he said at least two other stillunpublished studies elsewhere 
have reached similar conclusions 
the studies show that the main source of saturated fat is not 
meat anymore he said it is milk and other dairy products 
saturated fat clogs the hearts arteries and is a chief culprit 
in the war on heart disease 
ellison measured the sources of salt and saturated at in the 
diets of students at phillips exeter and phillips andover academies 
in massachusetts and new hampshire as part of a study of dietary 
changes 
he found that after dairy products meat fish poultry and eggs 
provided 28 percent of the youngsters saturated fat baked goods 
and cereals 16 percent ketchup gravy and other food adjuncts 7 
percent fruits and vegetables 7 percent snacks 6 percent and 
everything else 1 percent 
ellison said many people shy away from red meat because of its 
fat content but they sometimes substitute varieties of cheese that 
contain far higher levels of saturated fat 
he recommended that among other things parents and schools 
should encourage youngsters to drink fatfree milk rather than whole 
milk 
kids love milk he said some of them drink two liters a 
day and they grow up thinking that its a good thing to have we 
are not trying to take their milk away just take the fat out of 
it 
ellison presented his data at a program on school lunches held at 
massachusetts institute of technologys clinical research center 
ellison is among health experts who believe that youngsters 
should cut down on saturated fat and salt to establish good eating 
habits and prevent coronary artery disease and high blood pressure 
later in life 
salt aggravates high blood pressure and ellisons prep school 
survey found that breakfast cereal and baked goods provide about 30 
percent of the salt in teenagers diets meats add 21 percent 
dairy products 16 percent food adjuncts 12 percent fruits and 
vegetables 9 percent snack foods 6 percent table salt less than 1 
percent and all else 5 percent 
in dietary experiments at the two schools ellison found that by 
substituting lowsalt recipes in the schools cafeterias cooks 
could make food that the youngsters would eat but still reduce their 
salt consumption by 15 percent to 20 percent this also reduced the 
youngsters average blood pressure by about two points 
in another experiment cooks substituted polyunsaturated fat for 
saturated fat in recipes this reduced saturated fat consumption 
from 13 percent of total calories to 106 percent however because 
of problems measuring the youngsters blood cholesterol levels it 
was unclear what effect this had on their cardiovascular health

a former ruralroute postal carrier was 
sentenced tuesday to a year and a day in prison for failing to 
deliver two of the firstclass pieces found among tons of socalled 
junk mail he was hoarding 
william ryan 59 of milton told us district judge roger 
vinson that he felt he couldnt possibly deliver all the mail on his 
florida panhandle route so about three years ago he started leaving 
a few pieces in his car every day 
things just seemed to snowball once it started ryan said 
im very sorry for what happened its been a bad year last 
year for me 
after receiving a tip last august postal inspectors found what 
assistant us attorney samuel alter termed a mountain of mail 
heaped in ryans home a shed and surrounding woods about 30 miles 
northeast of pensacola 
nearly 500000 pieces were discovered almost all of them 
advertising circulars sweepstakes offers giveaways and other 
thirdclass bulk mail 
alter conceded most of ryans customers probably were satisfied 
with his service but he said the companies that paid to mail the 
material also are postal customers 
the actual victimimpact on the mailers is incalculable the 
prosecutor said 
the judge also placed ryan on probation for three years once his 
prison sentence is completed and ordered him to pay 299194 in 
restitution to the postal service and a 100 special assessment 
the restitution will cover the cost of maintenance personnel use 
of a bulldozer forklift and trucks and other expenses of 
recovering sorting and delivering returning or destroying the tons 
of mail he failed to deliver 
the judge however disallowed 10974 in restitution for the 
salaries of postal supvervisory personnel assigned to the case 
ryan a 15year postal employee for the past three years had 
been working a rural route in escambia county out of the main post 
office in pensacola he was fired after his arrest 
postal inspectors said about 500 pieces of first class mail were 
among the hoard of mainly thirdclass items ryan was charged with 
failing to deliver 10 of the firstclass items five of them were 
tax notices from the escambia property appraiser and the other five 
were voter registration renewal cards from the county elections 
supervisor 
ryan was allowed to plead guilty to two counts and in exchange 
alter dropped the other eight ryan could have received up to 10 
years in prison and fines totaling 500000 for the two charges he

washington a the us environmental protection agency and its 
counterpart at the state level have barred employees from visiting 
the governments uranium processing facility in ohio because of the 
risk of exposure to radioactivity officials said tuesday 
epa regional administrator valdas adamkus in a letter last week 
said tests showed agency personnel were exposed to uranium oxide 
when they went to the feed materials production center at fernald 
and that no federal epa personnel would go to the site until this 
health risk can be satisfactorily addressed 
the ohio epa followed suit tuesday said spokesman allan franks 
after meeting with federal officials state epa director richard 
shank as a precautionary measure ordered our people who do 
routine work to stay away from the site until a regular monitoring 
system is set up franks said 
but the plants operator said tuesday the plant is safe and that 
routine urine tests to detect exposure ensure that the workers are 
protected 
we dont know what lab epa is using but we have the utmost 
confidence in our program said william h kelley spokesman for 
westinghouse materials of ohio the contractor running the plant for 
the energy department 
we have no reason to doubt the reliability of our program 
kelley said we think the plant is safe 
spokeswoman ann rowan said adamkus discussed the issue tuesday 
with joseph la grone oak ridge operations manager for the energy 
department which is in charge of the plant the two agreed to meet 
again on the subject but no date was set 
what we said in the letter still holds rowan said 
la grone has offered to have the energy department finance new 
urine tests to determine whether there is truly a potential 
personnel exposure problem or in fact a laboratory problem 
adamkus letter was obtained tuesday by the investigative staff 
of rep tom luken dohio who said he was upset that the epa didnt 
notify fernald workers about the uranium oxide exposure threat 
the public is totally unprotected when the monitor bars its own 
inspectors from the premises he said 
the plant in southwest ohio about 18 miles from cincinnati is a 
deteriorating foundry that processes uranium for use in the 
governments nuclear weapons or as fuel for reactors 
the plant is the subject of a lawsuit on behalf of 14000 people 
who live or work near the plant and believe their health has been 
threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water 
stanley chesley an attorney in the 300 million classaction 
lawsuit against former plant operator nlo inc said the epa letter 
demonstrates the need to proceed with the suit 
i think its an example of the ongoing trauma that continues to 
plague this plant chesley said from cincinnati

military transport planes carried the 
last soviet soldiers home from kabul on tuesday a red army officer 
said leaving a conscript afghan army to defend the capital alone 
for the first time in nine years 
a few young afghan soldiers outside the airport gates watched 
the soviet soldiers board the planes in gray dress uniforms and fur 
hats 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilev told a news 
briefing in moscow that moslem guerrillas were massing outside major 
cities including about 30000 around kabul but he did not say 
whether they were preparing to attack 
the hardliners in the opposition despite their threat to 
occupy kabul and other major cities would not seem confident in 
their success said perfilev therefore the opposition lays 
the stress on economics and propaganda to provoke discontent of the 
local population 
the guerrillas who began fighting after a communist coup in 
1978 have surrounded and blockaded cold hungry kabul for months 
they fired five rockets into the capital on tuesday the day 
before the deadline for soviet withdrawal one killed four children 
and an old man lined up in the snow for bread the state radio 
reported 
two landed at the airport in the first such attack on the 
facility for more than a month they struck near a runway but soviet 
soldiers still at the airport said no one was injured 
poland closed its kabul embassy tuesday and evacuated the few 
remaining diplomats as hungary had done last week 
western nations including the united states closed their 
legations earlier the soviets are keeping their embassy open but 
the staff has been reduced from more than 300 to about 100 
a council called by guerrilla leaders to choose an interim moslem 
government for afghanistan convened friday in pakistan but 
deteriorated into arguments between moderates and fundamentalists 
including how to divide representation between the sunni moslem 
majority and shiite minority 
insurgents claim the government of president najib will fall soon 
after the soviets are gone the interim government would arrange 
elections and adminster the country until they were held 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began may 
15 1988 under a unmediated agreement wednesday is the deadline 
for all to be gone 
perfilev said the soviet pullout was exactly on schedule and the 
last soviet soldier would be out of afghan territory by the deadline 
as of feb 15 not a single soviet soldiers will be on afghan 
territory perfilev said 
the last red army troops to leave kabul had been stationed at the 
airport protecting an emergency soviet airlift of food and fuel 
that began last month soviet officers have said it would bring in 
12000 tons of food in the first half of february before stopping 
because of the withdrawal 
after manning their posts part of the day tuesday the red army 
troopers changed from filthy green duty uniforms to dress grays and 
filed into four huge ilyushin 76 transports about 80 men were seen 
boarding 
lt col pyotr sardarchuk commander of the airport detail was 
asked the exact number in the group and said only all those who 
are left he shook the hands of the journalists watching and said 
goodbye 
soviet diplomats said several thousand other soldiers were 
approaching the soviet border from elsewhere in afghanistan 
since the second stage of the withdrawal began in january more 
than 45000 soldiers have left the official soviet news agency tass 
said the last contingent of troops led by lt gen boris gromov 
was expected to cross the bridge linking the town of khairaton with 
the city of termez in the soviet union just before noon wednesday 
moscow time 4 am est according to the soviet newspaper trud 
tomorrow you will see departing one of the last columns of our 
military contingent under the command of hero of the soviet union 
lt gen b gromov trud said 
a formal departure ceremony was held monday when 15 paratroopers 
flew home another 450 soldiers left kabul quietly sunday in a 
convoy that set out on the salang highway during a heavy snowstorm 
the other 20000 troops once based in and around the city started 
leaving early in january either by air or by road up the salang 
the only route from kabul to the soviet border 260 miles away the 
highway winds through the rugged hindu kush mountains where the 
guerrillas hide 
kabuls markets were crowded tuesday and except for the rockets 
the city appeared peaceful 
residents said however that unsigned letters delivered the past 
few nights warned people to stay off the streets and away from the 
airport beginning wednesday many said they believed the letters 
were from guerrilla forces outside the city 
some foreign diplomats suggested the letters might be the work of 
khadd the najib governments secret police 
a un airlift of food to kabul has been suspended because 
airlines that provided chartered planes fear for the safety of their 
crews and aircraft 
guerrilla attacks and heavy snow have interrupted the arrival of 
food fuel and other supplies by road long lines form every day at 
bread stores and gasoline stations in a city swollen by refugees to 
a population of 2 million twice its normal size 
on monday a column of afghan trucks loaded with sovietsupplied 
food and fuel reached kabul from the north and delivered wheat 
rice kerosene and gasoline to the capital tass said

the majority opinion by judge carol los mansmann said a

the genesis of the weekly cbs news program 48 
hours was a riveting documentary called 48 hours on crack 
street 
after a season on the air 48 hours has finetuned its 
unique spotdocumentary style and on thursday takes on an equally 
compelling subject homelessness this installment of 48 hours 
produces some of its best reporting camera work and editing yet 
correspondents bernard goldberg betsy aaron harold dow and 
harry smith spent two days covering various aspects of the problem 
their report is often touching often enlightening sometimes 
depressing and ultimately inspiring if this doesnt make you want 
to go out and do something or at least lend a hand to the people 
who do not much will 
the story was covered in new york city where a huge homeless 
population finds it can live under the feet of a hardened populace 
long accustomed to ducking beggars and stepping over derelicts 
goldberg spent his 48 hours with those with whom the rest of us 
come into daily contact panhandlers and street people shorty 
takes goldberg on a sometimes amusing trip through the subway 
system where he hops cars and announces to jaded passengers that he 
is collecting funds to help the homeless you gotta sell and im 
sellin em he tells goldberg on one train shorty is chagrined 
to find hes competing with a guy in a monks robe with a megaphone 
but an hour of working the subway nets more than 22 as the 
camera rolls goldberg asks shorty just between you me and the 
people listening if he is really collecting money for the 
homeless shorty well aware of the camera admits hes collecting 
the money for himself 
cut to needy beggars but also to a public that is suffering what 
goldberg calls compassion fatigue a pathetic young pregnant 
woman begs coins from passersby in grand central terminal with 
little luck one welltodo young woman buying a magazine walks 
hurriedly away 
like you werent even there goldberg whispers to the 
pregnant woman 
it dont feel too good she says softly 
dow followed the final sad journey of a young polish immigrant 
from the street in brooklyn where he succumbed to alcoholism and 
froze to death to his burial in a mass paupers grave 
aaron went into the harrowing welfare hotels and produced some 
heartrending interviews with children who live in tiny rooms with 
desperate parents and face possible death at the hands of strangers 
outside aaron asks one young girl what she most fears most 
killing the girl says 
aaron took a group of the children to a coffee shop and asked 
them to tell her about their dream homes the kids conjure up 
poignant visions of big houses with swimming pools and backyards 
filled with animals 
barry a 13yearold left the hotels he said because his 
mother and aunt did drugs he lives on the streets occasionally 
bunking at the home of a friend he writes poetry but he says 
trudging the streets with a small suitcase theres a time when 
you have to wonder which is better life or death 
before youre so depressed that your face hits the carpet harry 
smith provides a more uplifting report on a successful halfway 
house jointly operated by the government and a millionaire 
businessman leonard stern there 400 lucky families get shelter 
assistance and child care mary scott had been living in a flophouse 
near times square before getting a spot in the halfway house smith 
took mrs scott back to times square at night to talk about what it 
had been like living there walking down the street they encounter 
a young homeless woman mrs scott tries to tell the woman that 
she too had been homeless and things could get better then she 
unexpectedly bursts into tears and hugs the woman its a subtle 
testimonial that the only real solution is caring 
dan rather concludes the broadcast with the results of a cbsnew 
york times poll in which 65 percent of those surveyed said they 
thought government should do more to help the homeless

signs of inflation are showing up in many of the 
smaller businesses of america where economic stresses sometimes 
make their first appearance 
some are reporting small increases in wage pressure which has 
been at minimal levels through most of the sixyearold economic 
expansion plans to raise prices are on a sharp ascent actual price 
increases are rising also 
the evidence is contained in the latest quarterly economic survey 
of small and independent businesses ranging from proprietorships to 
companies that just fail to make listings of the 1000 largest 
companies 
the survey conducted by the national federation of independent 
business shows the worst set of inflation numbers in the 
expansion said economist william c dunkelberg who analyzes and 
interprets the data 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business and 
management said firstquarter plans to raise prices jumped 5 
percentage points from fourthquarter levels to 30 percent of all 
companies in the survey 
the latest percentage contrasts with only 19 percent in july 
1986 levels in some categories were even higher 38 percent among 
wholesalers followed by manufacturing at 37 percent and 
professional service firms at 36 percent 
actual price increases rose to 29 percent indicating that 
companies were following through on plans although that percentage 
was exceeded briefly early in 1988 dunkelberg pointed out that it 
was close to the highest since 1981 
the data gathered from more than 2000 written responses from 
the 500000 business members of the federation led dunkelberg to 
conclude that although not rampant the pace of price increases 
clearly continues to gain momentum 
he said overall price increases in the general economy once again 
may be held down by falling oil prices but that without energy or 
food prices declines 1989s inflation rate will clearly be above 
the 1988 experience 
he estimated the firstquarter inflation level would measure 
about 49 percent on an annual basis compared with a 1988 increase 
in the consumer price index of 44 percent 
in spite of some evidence of rising wages dunkelberg said 
there is no evidence that gains are alarming he added 
however that as inflation rose labor would demand larger wage 
increases which they feel can be funded out of the rather 
impressive earnings being posted by many of our companies 
he said employment of the over16 population is at record high 
levels and that smallfirm job openings are at their highest for 
the more than six years of expansion multiple job holding is 
becoming quite common he said 
overall the small business optimism index made up of such 
factors as expected business conditions current job openings 
expected credit conditions and expected sales volume barely 
changed from the fourth quarter of 1988 
the index adjusted to eliminate seasonal variations reached 
1028 early in the first quarter compared with 1029 in the 
previous quarterly measurement in october 1988 it is based on the 
year 1978 equally 100 
the index begun in the fourth quarter of 1974 reached its 
highest point 1087 in the first quarter of 1984 rising from the 
alltime low of 811 in the second quarter of 1980 since 1984 the 
index has dipped no lower than 995 
an important factor in helping the index retain strength were 
views on the economic outlook twentytwo percent said they 
anticipated an improved economy in the next six months up 3 
percentage points from the earlier quarter 
at the same time negative views shrank only 12 percent said 
they expected business conditions to deteriorate in the first half 
of the year a fourpoint decline from the final quarter of 1988

international chieftains of the armenian church 
once sharply at odds say both the tribulation of the devastating 
earthquake and a joint trip to the united states strengthened the 
brotherly ties between them 
but in the churchs us branch strains of a prolonged split 
still showed tendencies also appeared on one side here to minimize 
the highlevel calls to unity 
these were among the mingled imprints left by an unprecedented 
team visit last week of the two top armenian prelates catholicos 
vasken i of the mother see in soviet armenia and catholicos karekin 
ii of the cilician see in lebanon 
catholicos means universal church head similar to pope in 
roman catholicism however the armenian church like eastern 
orthodoxy uses more democratic procedures such as election of 
local bishops 
the earthquake in armenia had drawn the two church heads together 
there to steady that flock then their mutual trip here thanking 
americans for help raised a sign for peace to a divided us church 
together we have agreed on taking certain steps toward 
cooperation which is more important than disputes of the past 
said vasken the now inclusively acknowledged head of the church 
based at echmiadzin armenia 
the situation is better he added in an interview we hope 
that unity of the divided church here will take place in due 
course 
karekin interviewed later said were on the right track 
closer collaboration will become a source of benefit to our people 
and our church 
people are disheartened with the conflict the polarization in 
the armenian community has caused complications and duplications it 
is my conviction and hope that with the new trend toward brotherly 
relationships these disadvantages will gradually disappear 
both prelates are imposing figures in black cassocks and veiled 
hoods their beards neatly trimmed they carry goldtipped staffs 
the bucharesteducated vasken is 80 while oxfordeducated karekin 
is a more vigorous 56 
asked if the earthquake disaster had firmed up their 
relationship vasken said that this naturally intensified it 
paradoxically good can come from tragedy he said and cited a 
latin saying which goes 
through suffering you rise to the stars 
on that question karekin said the earthquake precipitated our 
coming together we both felt the same as one in that moment of 
tragedy pain was the occasion love was the reason 
the armenian church dates from 301 ad when christianity was 
officially established there the first state church about 2 
million armenians live there and 5 million more are dispersed around 
the world including america 
its approximately 700000 armenian church people are divided 
about half and half by some estimates between two wings of the 
church that have functioned separately for more than half a century 
that split came in 1933 mostly over complex politicalsocial 
antagonisms resulting from the echmiadzin see being under soviet 
controls and being vacant part of the time 
one us church wing now headed by archbishop mesrop ashjian 
chose to be under jurisdiction of the cilician catholicos while the 
other wing now led by archibhsop torkom manoogian clung to 
echmiadzin oversight 
earlier ancient invasions had driven the chief see out of 
echmiadzin and it was for centuries in cilicia which is now part 
of turkey the catholicos there retained that title when in 1441 a 
new catholicos was elected in echmiadzin 
friction between the two sharpened in the mid20th century over 
jurisdictional questions in the divided us church and elsewhere 
adhjian firmly applauds the unity strides manifested by the 
church heads on their visit saying they are working hand in hand 
heart to heart in this beautiful deepening of the unity of the 
church 
however he said that on the local level things were done to 
undermine this spirit alluding to various shifts in arrangements 
that left him or karekin out of some proceedings 
my heart is bleeding for this petty undermining of what they 
are doing together he said 
manoogian said the trip was not to enhance unity or cooperation 
of the two wings but to deal with rebuilding the devastated sector 
of armenia its wrong to connect this to issues of a divided 
church he said 
on another matter the interview with vasken had been scheduled as 
a joint one including karekin in arrangements made through a 
manoogian assistant however karekin was not present explaining 
later he had not been informed about it 
manoogian asked why karekin was not included said it was not 
feasible he then added that the participation was decided by his 
public relations committee 
karekin brushing aside the tangled protocol said that the 
basic principle of working together has been confirmed by catholicos 
vasken and myself 
it is my hope and conviction that such exemplary cooperation 
should have positive and effective impact to bring our people 
together and contribute to strengthening the unity of our church

five days before he starved to death 
14yearold eric cottam ignored a 5pound bag of apples perched an 
arms length from the dayold newspaper he was fetching from a 
neighbors porch 
his emaciated body concealed by bulky winter clothes was 
devouring its own muscle but eric clung to a fanatical conviction 
that kept him from gobbling the neighbors fruit to feed his empty 
belly 
his reclusive family expelled by the seventhday adventist 
church reckoned god would help them his father fired as a 
preacher refused to buy food with 213121 in cash in the house he 
had stashed for god 
he could have had all the apples he wanted all he had to do 
was reach out and take one said mary petyo who stored the 
apples a bag of carrots and a case of soda near the discarded 
papers she saved for eric 
he just stared at me with this funny look on his face he went 
across the yard like someone was chasing him said mrs petyo 
it shocked the daylights out of me when i found out he starved 
eric was found jan 4 42 days after the vegetarian family ate 
its last supper his face covered by a sheet he lay in the only bed 
in the familys twostory frame house near wilkesbarre in 
northeastern pennsylvania 
the 5foot10 boy weighed 69 pounds less than half what he 
should have his parents larry and leona are charged with his 
murder and endangering the life of their daughter laura 12 who 
has been removed from their custody 
the family was hospitalized for malnutrition cottam 39 weighed 
139 pounds his wife 37 99 pounds both are 6 feet tall the 
girls weight was not revealed 
the boy was literally their hostage said margaret singer a 
clinical psychologist who studies cult behavior as a professor at 
the university of california at berkeley 
he probably had been so convinced he must not eat he thought 
god would smote him or his parents would punish him if he 
disobeyed she said 
the cottams lived in isolation on a deadend street in this 
community of 700 residents they spurned offers of food and help 
from church members and family 
they fought a twoyear legal battle to teach their children at 
home rather than enroll them in public or parochial schools cottam 
severed ties with his parents and inlaws 
so no one noticed they were wasting away 
the family refrigerator was unplugged and the phone disconnected 
the cottams turned out the lights at dusk neighborhood kids knew 
not to knock on halloween because no one would answer the door 
they always was loners we tried to help that man over and 
over but we were turned away said frank kowalski the first 
elder at the slocum seventhday adventist church one of four 
churches near wilkesbarre where cottam once preached 
he tested god to the limit theres no way you can sit home and 
starve your kids and expect god to rain food out of the sky 
nothing in the doctrine of the adventists a splinter group of 
baptists with 6 million members worldwide explains the cottams 
actions 
we have no teaching that tells people to fast to death reject 
help or withdraw from family and friends said fred thomas one 
of the top officers of the churchs world headquarters in 
washington dc adventists believe the second coming of jesus 
christ is imminent and they ban the use of alcohol tobacco and 
nonmedical drugs 
cottam was fired as an unordained minister in 1985 for defying 
church officials by yanking his children out of church schools the 
family had not attended church since then and was expelled in 1987 
although there wasnt a scrap of food in the house cottam had a 
strongbox containing 213121 in cash and bank books with 164374 
in savingshe told police the money belonged to god as a tithe 
larry cottam grew up in stockton calif and converted to 
adventism his wifes religion shortly before they were married in 
1972 
i had a funny feeling about larry he was nice and polite but 
there was still something about larry i didnt like he looked like 
a criminal his fatherinlaw john van renselaar told the 
wilkesbarre times leader 
i felt he wanted to start a cult or something every time he 
got on the phone hed start preaching and id say to leona larry 
is a religious fanatic 
cottam graduated from union college an adventist school in 
lincoln neb and got a masters degree in divinity from the 
churchs andrews university in michigan 
the family after living in six states in 16 years settled here 
in 1983 cottam tended four churches while awaiting ordination 
then the trouble started 
the cottams pulled their children out of a oneroom adventist 
school and tried to fire the teacher in 1984 the teacher said the 
children wanted to work on the floor instead of at their desks 
insisted on printing instead of writing and balked at learning 
definitions of words 
to end the squabbling and give cottam seasoning under another 
minister the church transferred him that summer to western 
pennsylvania 
by christmas the children again were removed from the church 
school the cottams claimed the children had been sexually abused by 
their former teacher they said she wore a devils mask and danced a 
satanic jig 
a church investigation found no wrongdoing the teacher who had 
brought a large wooden mask from kenya to class suffered from 
epilepsy and once had a seizure that frightened the children 
larry cottam was fired in october of 1985 and moved back here 
working as a truck driver 
more is known about young eric cottam in death than in life 
he kept a weather vane and rain guage in his garden and dreamed 
of being a meteorologist according to postmaster michael petyo who 
gave the boy a weather band radio 
for the cottam kids there wasnt much chance to play with 
others their mother would call them inside 
they didnt want anybody else around said a neighbor carol 
laurer maybe they was embarassed because the father wasnt a 
minister anymore but how can you sit there and watch your 
children wasting away and not do anything 
an autopsy found no disease or condition that would have 
prevented eric from eating coroner george hudock jr ruled the 
death a homicide caused by starvation 
the boys heart was brown and atrophied instead of reddishpurple 
and vibrant the normal layer of fat around his stomach had been 
exhausted his empty intestine had paper thin walls 
he had no energy to live the flame of life flickered out 
hudock said he looked like a concentration camp victim from 
dachau or auschwitz

eric his sister and his parents hadnt eaten a crumb since nov 
22 when the food in the house ran out 
his father had been fired from his trucking job months earlier 
in march after arguing with his boss he was radical the boss 
roy dieffenbach recalled his attitude was god will provide 
the gnawing pang of hunger goes away within a week after a person 
stops eating experts on starvation say dreams of food are 
accompanied by feelings of cold fatigue and lethargy 
the cottams had no thanksgiving feast or christmas dinner and 
eric apparently died jan 3 a day after his father tried to comfort 
and warm him by lying in bed with him all day 
police werent called until jan 4 larry cottam managed to 
shamble the 106 paces across the yard to use a neighbors phone the 
mother and daughter too weak to stand lay on sofa cushions 
i didnt even recognize him said ruth rineheimer a widow 
who answered cottams knock his face was terrible thin he looked 
like an old man his clothes were real baggy if i had seen a man 
like that in the streets id have said he was a bum 
in a television interview from his hospital room larry cottam 
explained i dont hold god responsible the error was on my part 
not gods my wife and i feel terrible about erics death but my 
faith in god is not shaken 
the churches where cottam once ministered took up a collection to 
pay for erics burial 
the cottams are jailed in lieu of 100000 bond each they are to 
be arraigned tuesday on charges of murder two counts each of 
endangering a person and two counts each of endangering the welfare 
of a child 
our allegations are the parents had a duty to provide food for 
their children said luzerne county district attorney correale 
stevens i dont know of any religion that suggests its all right 
to starve your children to death

the judge who dismissed suffolk countys 
racketeering case against the long island lighting co on monday 
granted its nearly 1 million ratepayers the right to sue the utility 
as a class 
us district judge jack b weinsteins order cleared way for the 
ratepayers attorney judith vladeck to accept a proposed 
settlement but no settlement was reached after 10 hours of 
negotiations involving vladeck lilco attorneys and the 
courtappointed mediator kenneth feinberg ended late monday night 
we have not reached a settlement but we made excellent 
progress said joseph mcdonnell a lilco vice president and 
company spokesman 
he said the negotiators were very close to reaching an agreement 
however and would meet again tuesday afternoon 
the proposed agreement calls for reductions in planned increases 
in electric rates by 400 million during the next decade and could 
lead to the closing of the shoreham nuclear plant 
vladeck who was officially designated by the judge as the class 
representative said during a break in the talks that weinsteins 
class certification was a useful step in the negotiations 
weinstein noted in his order that if his dismissal of suffolk 
countys suit is reversed on appeal lilco will now be liable to pay 
the ratepayers at least 4 billion in damages 
should this courts dismissal of suffolks claims be reversed 
and the jurys verdict against lilco sustained on appeal lilco will 
be forced into bankruptcy since its assets will not suffice to pay 
the judgment weinstein said 
he previously had severed the ratepayers case from the trial of 
suffolk countys suit which ended dec 5 with a jury finding that 
lilco lied to state officials to obtain rate increases and awarding 
suffolk county 228 million in damages 
weinstein on saturday dismissed the countys lawsuit and the jury 
award on the grounds that the racketeering statute did not apply 
lawyers for the long island county did not participate in 
mondays negotiations their portion of the proposed settlement 
includes a provision that lilco would agree to close its shoreham 
nuclear power plant if gov mario cuomo embraced the proposal within 
15 days 
the county legislature is scheduled to discuss the proposed 
settlement on tuesday 
construction of the shoreham plant located 60 miles east of 
manhattan began in 1973 and was completed a decade later at a cost 
of more than 4 billion its total cost now stands at 54 billion 
lilco has not been able to obtain an operating license from the 
federal nuclear regulatory commission largely because of opposition 
by the state and county who claim long island could not be safely 
evacuated during a nuclear emergency

rising interest rates are likely to push more 
savings and loans into insolvency and raise the cost of the 90 
billion federal bailout proposed by the bush administration 
economists and banking analysts say 
when interest rates rise thrifts have to pay higher rates to 
hold and attract deposits the money they earn on their mortgage 
loans also rises but not as much or as quickly 
each percentage point rise in interest rates will add about 6 
billion to the cost of the sampl bailout according to estimates by 
snl securities of hoboken nj that estimate includes the higher 
rates the government will have to pay on the bonds it plans to issue 
to fund the bailouts

barbie turns 30 years old this week gi joe 
marches on at 25 but mr game show the inhumanoids 
flops 
there are a lot of flops toy company analyst walter 
kirchberger said monday the start of the industrys weeklong toy 
fair something like 80 percent of the newtoy introductions turn 
out to be flops 
that makes this flop week in the toy business manufacturers have 
packed their manhattan showrooms with an estimated 5000 new games 
and toys all clamoring for slices of a nearly 13 billion pie 
most wont last youll see a lot of products at the toy fair 
this week that you wont see next year said harold vogel an 
analyst for merrill lynch amp co most toys do not make it into a 
second season 
one reason said vogel theres lots of junk 
qualitys not the sole criterion some entries are undone by 
outrageous circumstance alone the evel knievel doll did very well 
when it came out then it just fell apart said vogel he guessed 
that the real knievels conviction of a baseballbat assault did not 
help the toy 
other casualties are harder to explain barbie dances on the 
grave of a pretender named gem gi joes tough as ever but the 
inhumanoids a toady group from the center of the earth withered 
in the light of day 
no one knows why 
that is the 64 million question in the toy industry and in 
most other industries said kirchberger of paine webber group 
nobody sets out to make a bad movie it just happens its the 
same thing with toys 
toy makers trim losses by making models of most new items 
holding back on production until orders come in the weedingout 
process starts early said jodi levin of the toy manufacturers of 
america sometimes the kids dont even get to pass judgment 
but there have been some epic bombs mr game show a big hit at 
last years toy fair is a goner now kirchberger gave the eulogy 
it was modeled after a tv game show there was a figure of a 
host he spoke hed ask you questions youd push buttons to 
indicate your answer hed tell you if you were right or wrong and 
how much you won very clever wrong price point wrong 
idontknowwhat mr game show didnt make it 
then there was michael jacksons zoo from viewmaster ideal a 
menagerie of stuffed animals inspired by the rock stars 
predilection for offbeat pets 
he even went on tour with his chimp so we tried said 
viewmasters jeremy jacobs we had the chimp appearing in stores 
in southern california we had quite a few good promotions but we 
just couldnt move the product 
or consider golden girl and the guardian of the gemstones the 
concept was action figures for little girls there were 12 beautiful 
female warriors with shields and swords said david galoob of

the trade bought in very very heavily and what we discovered

analysts say consolidated freightways inc 
faces a major challenge in trying to turn around troubled emery air 
freight corp which it is acquiring in a deal worth an estimated 
230 million 
they have their work cut out for them david guthrie an 
analyst with morgan keegan co said monday after the announcement 
its possible they made a good investment its possible they made 
a big mistake 
consolidated announced it had agreed to buy all outstanding emery 
common stock for 775 a share in cash and all outstanding emery 
preferred stock for 2110 a share in cash emery has about 24 
million common shares and 11 million preferred shares outstanding 
the agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of 
both companies said consolidated based in menlo park calif 
the combination will make consolidated one of the nations 
largest airfreight operators 
analysts said emery never regained its competitive edge after a 
series of strategic miscalculations over the past decade 
the company which lost 995 million on revenue of 3188 
million in the third quarter of 1988 took on more than 300 million 
in debt to buy rival purolator courier corp in 1987 
although analysts roundly criticized the 348 million purolator 
purchase emerys problems really began when it waited until 1982 to 
purchase its own planes and adopt the hubandspoke distribution 
system used by industry leader federal express corp guthrie said 
before then emery shipped freight on commercial airlines 
essentially they waited too long and let federal express steal 
a substantial part of the market guthrie said from that point 
on they were never able to catch up 
consolidated and emery specialize in shipping large packages and 
freight that federal express an overnight packagedelivery service 
generally does not handle 
paul schlesinger an analyst with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
said he thought consolidated paid too much for emery because 
theres so little in the way of hard assets that emery still owns 
he noted that emery sold its fleet of planes on a leaseback 
arrangement in order to raise cash 
its going to be complicated to turn that thing around 
schlesinger said 
emery based in wilton conn was founded in 1946 by john emery 
sr when his son john c emery jr who started as a truck driver 
with the company suddenly announced his retirement as chairman and 
chief executive officer in december 1987 analysts saw it as an 
indication that the company was positioning itself to be sold 
emery jr was replaced by william f souders a board member who 
had no previous experience in the air freight industry 
the combined company will operate under the name emery 
worldwide a cf company said lary scott president of 
consolidated 
we have every confidence that this business combination will 
offer customers the best service available souders said in a 
statement 
consolidated does business in longhaul trucking air freight 
regional trucking and rail piggyback and ocean intermodal services 
its 1988 revenues totaled 27 billion 
emery provides air courier and cargo service and has 17000 
employees worldwide 
consolidated said it plans to centralize operations in dayton 
ohio where emery operates its superhub about 1700 people are 
employed at the hub 
emery spokeswoman jennifer davis said consolidated plans business 
as usual at the hub with no changes in job levels at this time

the savings and loan industry hypersensitive to 
high interest rates is being squeezed by a rise in rates that is 
likely to drive more thrifts into insolvency and raise the cost to 
taxpayers of the bush administrations proposed 90 billion federal 
bailout 
increases in interest rates will have a substantial impact on 
the number of savings and loans which will fall into the category of 
either weakened or insolvent thrifts kevin gottlieb staff 
director of the senate banking committee said monday 
when interest rates rise thrifts have to pay higher rates to 
hold and attract deposits the money they earn on their 
variablerate mortgage loans also rises but not as much or as 
quickly 
each percentage point rise in interest rates will add about 6 
billion to the cost of the sampl bailout according to estimates by 
snl securities of hoboken nj 
that estimate includes the higher rates the government will have 
to pay on the bonds it plans to issue to fund the bailouts 
the estimate does not include the likelihood that higher rates 
will push more sampls into insolvency the firm says thrifts with 
more red ink on their books also will cost more to bail out 
taxpayers will foot a much larger proportion of the bill than 
whats being announced it may be double even said jim marks 
publisher of snl quarterly thrift digest 
yields on threemonth treasury bills an alternative to sampl 
certificates of deposit for big investors have shot up to 88 
percent from 56 percent a year ago 
edward j kane a professor at arizona state university said 
monday that according to a stricter accounting standard than the one 
used by the government 750 thrifts were insolvent by last 
september since then rising interest rates have helped push 
another 50 to 100 into their ranks he said 
higher interest rates have caused a hemorrhage of thrift 
deposits net deposit withdrawals rose in december to a record of 
more than 8 billion the federal home loan bank board said friday 
total deposits were about 972 billion 
some thrifts have concluded it is not financially worthwhile to 
raise their rates on deposits high enough to keep all their 
depositors 
with fewer deposits the thrifts have less money available to 
make new mortgage loans but they would rather shrink and remain 
profitable 
because deposits are counted as liabilities on the books thrifts 
can actually improve their net worth by allowing deposits to bleed 
away said edwin gray president of chase federal bank in miami and 
former chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
a silver lining in the sampl crisis is that thrifts are somewhat 
better prepared to cope with high interest rates now than they were 
in the early 1980s the last time interest rates soared most 
mortgages in their portfolios have adjustable rates so mortgage 
payments rise when rates rise 
in september 1981 only about 29 percent of thrifts mortgages 
had adjustable rates as of this past september the proportion was 
74 percent according to james barth chief economist of the federal 
home loan bank board 
stuck with fixedrate mortgages and soaring shortterm interest 
rates 85 percent of thrifts were unprofitable in 1981 barth said 
as of september the proportion of unprofitable thrifts was 30 
percent he said 
some thrifts also have taken steps to protect themselves from 
interestrate fluctuations by raising some of their money through 
issuing bonds instead of taking in deposits 
when interest rates rise the thrifts dont have to raise 
payments on their bonds while they do have to raise payments on 
their deposits as of last september about 11 percent of thrifts 
capital came from borrowings such as bond issues up from 3 percent 
in 1980 barth said 
troubled thrifts have a harder time using such defensive 
strategies it costs more for them to issue bonds and they have to 
have them fully backed with collateral 
also troubled thrifts cannot easily afford to offer the 
incentives that would cause customers to choose adjustablerate 
mortgages instead of fixedrate mortgages gray said 
troubled institutions which have the highest proportion of 
mortgage loans that arent being paid are squeezed the worst by 
rising rates their cost of funds is rising along with everyone 
elses but they have less of an offsetting gain on their loan 
portfolios

president bush is jeopardizing the quality of 
life in rural america by following the failed ideological 
policies of his predecessor says coop leader and former 
agriculture secretary bob bergland 
he follows an incredibly popular president one who cut taxes 
talked frugally but spent freely and who then placed all the blame 
on either jimmy carter or the congress bergland said monday 
todays unconscionable and unnecessary savings and loan crisis 
which one way or the other will cost american consumers 100 
billion could have been averted had the reagan administration 
approached deregulation more thoughtfully he said 
rural areas have problems too including strangulation of our 
air transportation options thousands of miles of roads and bridges 
that are crumbling and huge gaps in television service bergland 
said 
we too live with illiteracy the homeless rising health care 
costs he said we share many of the challenges of city life 
bergland is executive vice president and general manager of the 
national rural electric cooperative association more than 11000 
representatives of local cooperatives are attending an annual 
meeting here through wednesday 
plans of recent years to overhaul the federal power program 
including the possible sale of some large facilities to private 
interests also came in for criticism 
bergland who spoke at the opening days session is a former 
member of congress and was secretary of agriculture during the 
carter administration 
the delegates represent 1000 consumerowned rural electric 
systems which serve an estimated 25 million people in 46 states the 
coop system was started in the 1930s and used federal loans from 
the rural electrification administration or rea to put electricity 
on the nations farms 
critics have contended for years that the job is done and that 
its time to abolish rea and put rural power coops into the private 
domain however advocates contend the task continues and federal 
support is needed to maintain upgrade and expand facilities 
bergland said bush has rubber stamped ronald reagans last 
budget proposals for rea an agency of the agriculture department 
the plan would shift from loan guarantees by the federal financing 
bank to rea guarantees for private loans 
rea is a lending program not a spending program he said 
the truth of the matter is that nowhere in the federal budget for 
rea or the us department of agriculture are you given any credit 
for the money you pay back on your loans each year what does show 
up as spending are the loan levels for the fiscal year 
bergland said that last fiscal year the us treasury realized 
4 billion more than it advanced to the nations rural electric 
systems 
and once again the forces that have sought to dismantle the 
federal power system and drive up rates on power generated from 
federal projects have triumphed he said there is little 
difference if any between the bush administration proposals and 
those of the reagan administration 
bergland said he is not convinced that the united states would be 
better served by turning federal power over to profitdriven 
private interests 
he added there is no basis except for an ideological one for 
dismantling the power marketing agencies and artificially boosting 
federal power rates to socalled market levels and we will oppose 
any such moves with all our strength

barbie was the nations second biggest selling toy last year after 
nintendo video games according to toy amp hobby world magazine 
each year barbie dolls pull in 450 million to 500 million in

rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female 
celebrities including singer melba moore and actresses allison 
smith of the television show kate amp allie and nancy dussault 
who has performed in the broadway play into the woods 
new york mayor edward koch marked the occasion by sending fan 
mail mattels sansone read the mayors letter before introducing 
the entertainment 
she has always reflected the times and today stimulates the 
imagination and delight of another generation koch wrote 
barbies appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a 
great toy for new york a city which draws unique energy from its 
unparalleled ethnic diversity 
an audiovisual retrospective of the dolls 30 years set to tunes 
on the pop charts during the different periods catalogued barbies

bikiniclad at beach parties every so often 
later on barbie donned mod clothing and her normally 
cleancut boyfriend ken grew his hair almost shoulder length 
more recently barbie has become a briefcasetoting career woman 
this year finds barbie characterized as a super star decked out 
in a starencrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion

dollars 
leading edge demanded advance payment an unusual move that 
dealers say they agreed to because of the large demand for the 
computers 
the dealers who signed the bankruptcy petition are seeking to 
freeze leading edges assets pending a thorough examination of the 
companys finances and business dealings leading edge reportedly 
owes dealers more than 10 million 
from my viewpoint at least well know the score very 
shortly said larry stone president of omnitek computers inc of 
portland ore and a cosigner of the petition we think there is 
maybe something there that we dont see and dont fully understand 
stone said leading edge owes him 190000 and that he decided to 
sign the petition when it became pretty apparent the action was 
going to proceed with or without me 
earlier this month stone organized a chicago meeting of 50 
leading edge dealers to consider the companys signed agreement to 
sell its brand name and major business to a computer dealer based in 
riviera beach fla 
michael shane founder and president of leading edge said he was 
disappointed by the petition in bankruptcy court 
we cannot let 2 percent of the dealers divert attention from 
accomplishing whats in the best interest of all the dealers 
shane said 
shane said he was unaware of any fbi plan to investigate his 
company 
leading edge is currently under a temporary restraining order 
issued for unrelated litigation prohibiting the company from selling 
its assets 
leading edge products is the parent company of leading edge 
hardware products

the london stock exchange has introduced new rules 
to encourage trading in large blocks of shares 
the rules some of which went into effect monday are the first 
major changes in the way trading is conducted in london since big 
bang the 1986 deregulation of britains financial markets the 
exchange has made minor variations in the past two years 
under the latest changes investment firms that make markets in 
british shares would no longer be required to trade with each other 
market makers formerly had to trade with clients agency brokers 
and other market makers at the prices and volumes they quoted on the 
exchanges trading system called stock exchange automated 
quotation but they complained that other market makers dumped stock 
on them 
among the other changes details of large trades about 175000 
or more will be publicly reported the following day instead of 
within minutes that rule goes into effect within two weeks 
the exchanges 25member council approved the rule changes on 
jan 9 
its to improve the liquidity of the marketplace said an 
exchange spokesman who wasnt identified in accordance with 
british practice 
some market makers were no longer prepared to offer large 
volume quotations because they felt that other market makers were 
simply taking advantage of them without reciprocating the deal 
since big bang many firms have suffered big losses because of the 
fierce competition and because the volume of trading dropped sharply 
after the october 1987 stock market crash 
under big bang the bulk of which took place oct 27 1986 
brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks an activity 
previously restricted to firms called jobbers

the chicago mercantile exchange says the use of 
hidden recording devices and other surveillance techniques by 
undercover agents may uncover wrongdoing that has escaped internal 
enforcement efforts 
merc officials predicted monday that the effectiveness of their 
own enforcement efforts will be confirmed by a federal inquiry into 
allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the exchange 
and the chicago board of trade systematically cheated customers out 
of millions of dollars in profits 
but the merc also noted in a statement that the undercover probe 
would uncover violations that have escaped its best efforts because 
fbi agents can use electronic surveillance techniques that would 
have constituted felonies if employed by the cme and its staff 
as part of the investigation fbi agents posed as traders to 
learn whether other traders were manipulating the trading of 
contracts for future deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeans 
to treasury bonds 
us attorney anton valukas whose office reportedly is 
conducting the undercover effort has refused to confirm even that 
an investigation is ongoing no indictments have been issued 
in a related matter cme officials on monday also criticized news 
coverage of the investigation and police detectives said they had 
not established a motive for the apparent suicide of a veteran 
trader and former policeman 
the mercs board of governors said in a statement that the 
disclosure of the probe on jan 19 had sparked a media frenzy 
that had inflicted possibly irreversible damage on the futures 
industry 
on monday retired policeman edward cashman 69 was found shot 
to death in the furnace room of his northwest side home an apparent 
suicide said police sgt russell weingart 
weingart said detectives interviewed members of the family and 
the prominent familyowned victor grain co to determine whether 
cashmans death was tied to the ongoing federal investigation 
but we havent established any motive so far said weingart

the administration held fast today against 
demands from congressional democrats that it come up with more 
specifics to cover gaps in president bushs new 116 trillion 
budget 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said spending cuts 
would have to be the product of negotiations with congress this 
budget is alive and is an active force subject to change in 
negotiation and discussion he said 
fitzwater indicated that the administration did not plan to issue 
proposals for more specific cuts beyond those proposed in the 
blueprint for the 1990 fiscal year unveiled last week 
some congressional democrats have contended that bushs budget 
enables him to get credit for proposing more spending on social 
programs like child care education and environmental cleanup 
while making sure congress shares the responsibility for cuts to 
help pay for these programs 
bushs budget apart from proposing a freeze on defense spending 
at the rate of inflation was vague on where other specific areas of 
spending would be restrained to meet deficit targets 
in an interview published in todays editions of the wall street 
journal the president said what we tried to do is simply put 
forward in a broad sense in a short period of time priorities 
and now theres two approaches one is the congress can say heres 
what well do or two they can have negotiations with the white 
house 
the president generally called for freezing most domestic 
programs at 1989 levels however that would leave a 96 billon to 
11 billion gap in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 if the 
programs are merely allowed to keep pace with inflation and 
population growth 
the numbers speak for themselves fitzwater told reporters 
nothing is final and well be negotiating all of these programs 
budget director richard g darman and white house chief of staff 
john sununu were to meet this afternoon with congressional budget 
leaders to work out ground rules for more intensive talks to come in 
the days ahead 
well be providing details as we go along everybody knows 
cuts have to be made fitzwater said 
he said todays meeting following one monday between darman and 
leaders of the house and senate budget committees was part of a 
process of clearing away the underbrush 
although the budget has already stirred controversy in the 
democraticcontrolled congress fitzwater said we dont want the 
budget to be confrontational and that the administration would 
retain an open mind on spending cuts 
bush on monday opened a series of talks around the country to 
promote his budget plan he travels to columbia sc on wednesday 
to highlight his budget goals before a joint session of the state 
legislature 
fitzwater denied that bushs budget travels were an effort to 
make an endrun around congress as former president reagan had done 
in building public support for some of his initiatives 
rather the spokesman said said the trips were just an 
opportunity for the president to discuss his priorities and an 
attempt to stress his intention to work with congress 
bush won initial plaudits from democrats and republicans alike 
for the budget plan he outlined last week in his maiden speech to a 
joint session of congress last thursday 
but some of the warmth of that reception cooled as budget 
analysts combed through the document itself and found details were 
scarce on how the new social programs highlighted by the president 
would be financed

a penny stock firm accused of defrauding 
thousands of customers has shut down its operation citing the 
financial crunch of a flood of investors seeking their money back 
power securities corp announced monday that it was terminating 
all retail sales activities nationwide 
the closure of the las vegas office comes less than a week after 
new york attorney general robert abrams accused power of defrauding 
thousands of investors of millions of dollars 
mark behringer las vegas branch manager for the company said 
power was closing because it could not meet net capital requirements 
there was a rush on the bank he said a lot of stock came 
back at us we couldnt meet net capital and we had to close our 
doors 
the nevada securities division urged power customers to make 
arrangements immediately to have their accounts transferred to other 
brokerage firms or request delivery of their funds and stocks 
our agency will be monitoring the situation closely and will 
take further action if the situation warrants deputy secretary of 
state sherwood cook said 
power attorney gilbert mcswain issued a statement saying the run 
by investors probably was triggered by abrams actions against the 
company and not the publics lack of confidence in the penny stock 
market 
penny stocks are lowpriced highrisk securities sold over the 
counter they are not listed on any major exchanges 
a new york judge last week temporarily barred power from 
soliciting business in the state after abrams said records showed 
power had manipulated stock prices created artificial markets and 
marked up stock prices by 100 percent or more a feb 22 hearing in 
the case is scheduled 
power securities was founded in 1987 by two rochester ny 
natives richard t marchese 29 and eric g monchecourt 27 and 
orville l sandberg 62 of denver 
it employed 106 salespeople in four offices in new york state 
another 400 around the country are registered to solicit business in 
the state abrams said the company said it had 1300 employees

sales of cars made in the united states by the 
nations big three automakers slumped 202 percent in early february 
compared with the same period last year when sales were unusually 
strong the companies said tuesday 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said they 
sold cars at an average daily rate of 16112 during the feb 110 
period compared with a rate of 20182 during the same 1988 period 
trucks made in the united states by the big three sold at a daily 
rate of 10034 down 106 percent from 11223 last year 
combined car and truck sales were off 168 percent during the 
period there were nine selling days in the 1988 and 1989 periods 
during the early part of 1988 sales were abnormally high due in 
part to manufacturers returning to heavy use of incentives partly 
because of fear that the stock market crash of october 1987 may have 
kept car buyers out of showrooms 
but that was an unnecessary concern as the 1988 model year 
proved to be the third best on record 
since the beginning of this year the big three have sold cars 
and trucks at a daily rate of 29243 compared with a rate of 31032 
during the same period last year a 58 percent decline there were 
34 selling days in both periods 
chrysler said its car sales skidded 309 percent during early 
february falling to a daily rate of 2200 this year from a rate of 
3185 last year chryslers truck sales suffered the least among the 
big three dropping 51 percent to a daily rate of 2398 compared 
with a rate of 2528 
so far this year chryslers car sales are 136 percent lower 
than they were in 1988 but truck sales are 77 percent ahead of 
last years pace 
gm car sales fell 23 percent during early february dropping to a 
daily rate of 8355 from a rate of 10856 trucks made by gm in the 
united states sold at a rate of 4040 during the first 10 days of 
the month down 13 percent from 4643 
for the year gm has sold 143 percent fewer cars this year and 
23 percent fewer trucks 
ford said its early february car sales slipped 95 percent to a 
daily rate of 5557 compared with a rate of 6143 truck sales by 
ford were off 113 percent falling to a rate of 3596 compared with 
a rate of 4053 
ford has sold 02 percent more cars and 07 percent more trucks 
so far this year

the fbi confirmed tuesday it is investigating the 
finances of leading edge products inc to determine whether the 
computer company has violated federal laws 
john j cloherty a spokesman for the fbis boston office said 
the probe was launched within the past week but he declined to say 
what information led the bureau to initiate an investigation 
leading edges legal problems mounted monday when six computer 
dealers filed a petition in us bankruptcy court claiming they paid 
a total of 779000 in advance for leading edge computers they never 
received 
dealers said they agreed to the advance payment an unusual 
practice in the industry because of the large demand for the 
computers 
the canton company pioneered the market for lowpriced ibm 
personal computer clones but it stopped delivering computers last 
month 
the dealers who signed the bankruptcy petition are seeking to 
freeze leading edges assets pending an examination of the companys 
finances and business dealings the company reportedly owes dealers 
more than 10 million 
leading edge spokesman david rottenberg said the dealers 
complaints and the companys debts would be addressed by the planned 
sale of leading edge to one of its dealers pc systems of riviera 
beach fla 
the sale however has been blocked temporarily by a court order 
because of an unrelated lawsuit over software royalties filed by a 
former leading edge employee rottenberg said 
pc systems had agreed to supply computers and assume leading 
edges debts in return for the companys valuable trademark 
rottenberg said 
earlier this month 50 leading edge dealers met in chicago to 
consider the pc systems sale 
larry stone president of omnitek computers inc of portland 
ore who organized the meeting said leading edge owes him 
190000 stone said he decided to sign the bankruptcy petition when 
it became pretty apparent the action was going to proceed with or 
without me

threatened with a possible strike march 3 by 
militant machinists eastern airlines has introduced super 
coupons offering passengers sizable discounts if they fly after 
that date 
some analysts and travel agents said tuesday that the coupons 
offered during the peak winter travel period marked a desperate 
move by the strapped airline eastern is staring into the abyss 
they said and a prolonged machinists union strike could throw it 
over the edge 
the discount coupons are just a way to entice people to fly 
eastern despite the strike threat robert decker an airline 
analyst at duff amp phelps inc in chicago any protracted strike 
would really have dire financial consequences for eastern 
competitors including delta air lines and pan am corp said 
tuesday they didnt plan to match easterns coupon initiative 
we do intend to operate in the event of a strike eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak said from airline headquarters in miami 
for those who may be reluctant this the coupon program is a 
little extra incentive to stay with us 
some travel industry experts speculated eastern management could 
reach a settlement with the machinists before the end of the 30day 
coolingoff period on march 3 but others saw a strong possibility 
that the union wont deal with frank lorenzo hardnosed chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp 
a national mediation board negotiator is continuing efforts to 
gain an agreement though no recent progress has been reported and 
both sides have shown signs of preparing for a strike machinist 
union officials have predicted overwhelming approval of a strike 
when the vote is announced later this week 
last week eastern reported a record net loss of 3354 million 
in 1988 nearly double its 1817 million loss the year before 
revenue dropped to 38 billion from 44 billion in 1987 
the airline plans to distribute coupons to passengers on domestic 
flights starting thursday the coupons entitle them to onethird 
discounts off any roundtrip fare of 200 or more for travel between 
march 4 and march 22 between april 5 and april 30 the coupons are 
good for a 20 percent discount 
the discounts apply to eastern flights in the united states and 
the caribbean all travel must be completed by june 15 
newspaper advertisements announcing the coupon drive dont 
mention eastern faces a possible strike the day before the discounts 
apply 
its a desperation move to raise money said david perelman 
president of dms travel in midtown manhattan eastern is trying to 
bring back the passengers that are jumping away because of the 
potential strike situation and the deteriorating service 
perelman reported scant interest in the coupons among his 
customers he said his agency recently started putting a written 
disclaimer on invoices warning fliers of the strike threat and 
financial woes facing eastern and declining responsibility for any 
problems that might arise as a result 
william cooper president of adventure travels in pompano beach 
fla said he hasnt seen great interest in the coupons either he 
has been advising customers to charge eastern tickets on credit

intel corp engineers on wednesday will reveal 
details of a processor chip with blazing speed that is the main 
focus of interest at the world semiconductor industrys biggest 
annual research meeting 
the intel chip codenamed the n10 turned out so well that 
intel might offer it as a central processor for computers instead of 
just an adjunct some industry analysts believe 
the n10 is a major event its had a lot of excitement built 
up around it and it does appear to be the highestperformance 
processor soon to be available michael slater editor of 
microprocessor report newsletter said tuesday 
intel declined to comment on the chip in advance of its 
presentation citing secrecy rules of the international solid state 
circuits conference 
the threeday conference draws scientists and engineers from all 
the major us japanese and european semiconductor makers 
companies often use it to announce their most important research 
advances 
intel and motorola inc are the worlds leading companies in the 
field of microprocessors the brains of personal computers and 
workstations 
industry analysts who have heard about the n10 said it is 
designed to operate at very high speeds on mathematical calculations 
and graphics making it a good supplement to traditional 
microprocessors such as intels 80386 and the 80486 that is due out 
later this year 
the n10 could handle the grunt work of highspeed 
repetitive calculations while the main processor handled more 
complex tasks said dean mccarron a microprocessor expert at 
instat inc in scottsdale ariz 
it probably would take a personal computer equipped with the n10 
and the forthcoming 80486 microprocessor a few seconds to 
recalculate a long electronic spreadsheet instead of the minute it 
would take on todays fastest pcs mccarron said 
beyond serving as a coprocessor though slater said he believes 
intel will announce later this month that the chip will also be 
available for more general uses 
intels problem is that computers would have to be redesigned to 
accept the n10 as a central processor the n10 is built with 
socalled risc technology for reduced instruction set computing 
that makes it incompatible with other intel microprocessors 
every time you have a new different architecture everybody has 
to revise their software to work with that architecture slater 
said 
intels only public statement on the n10 is a brief abstract of 
the paper it is presenting in new york in which it says the chip 
will have peak speed of 150 million operations a second that is 
five times faster than risc chips designed by motorola and japans 
fujitsu ltd

usx corp and kobe steel ltd of japan 
announced a joint venture tuesday the latest in a series of 
partnerships combining the best of two worlds to solve the problems 
of both 
kobe the last of japans big integrated steelmakers to join with 
a comparable us producer will pay an undisclosed sum to buy half 
of usxs lorain ohio plant 
the deal is at least the 11th joint venture completed or under 
consideration it leaves only bethlehem steel corp the 
thirdlargest us producer without a partner from the far east 
the us market is probably more attractive than it ever has 
been said john jacobson of aus consultants of philadelphia 
analysts said the japanese are entering joint ventures because 
steel import quotas and unfavorable currency exchange rates have 
made it difficult for foreigners to penetrate american markets 
its either lose it or buy into it said donald barnett an 
independent analyst 
the japanese also face increased competition at home from 
lowcost steelmakers in korea taiwan and other developing countries 
in the united states companies view the wellfinanced japanese 
as a source of capital the perfect tonic for mills that were 
staved of cash during the industrys 198286 depression the 
japanese also bring expertise in producing highquality steel for 
the autos the biggest single end use of the metal 
id have to say its a winwin situation said jacobson 
both countries see the joint ventures as improving the chances of 
selling steel to japanese automakers that have transplanted 
operations to america 
when the transplants came over here almost everything was 
produced in japan anything sophisticated was even assembled in 
japan now a lot of that is being done in the us said charles 
bradford an industry analyst for merrill lynch amp co 
the partnership with kobe gives usx an opportunity to pump money 
into the lorain works and to possibly hedge its bets in the bar 
market analysts said the lorain plant with 3000 workers 
produces seamless pipe and high quality bar for vehicles and 
machinery 
kobe may have been persuaded to gamble on the deal because 
lorains bar is recognized as high quality and bar prices have 
surged 32 percent from 386 in the third quarter of 1986 to 510 in 
the comparable 1988 period jacobson said 
kobe also owns midrex corp the worlds largest producer of 
plants that produce iron by the shortcut direct reduction process 
in other joint ventures in steel 
nisshin steel owns a 10 percent stake in wheelingpittsburgh and 
has a joint venture with wheelingpitt in a sheet steel coating 
plant 
nkk owns half of the flatrolled producer national steel corp 
and is negotiating with national intergroup to buy the other half 
nippon and inland are building a joint coldrolling mill and say 
they are considering a joint galvanizing line 
sumitomo and ltv are partners in an electrogalvanizing line and 
say they are considering a second line 
kawasaki entered a joint venture with a brazilian steelmaker in 
buying california steel a west coast flat roller the japanese 
company also has agreed to buy 40 percent of armcos eastern steel 
division 
pohang of korea and usx jointly own a west coast sheet steel 
plant

petroleum conference in london 
there was no news on either side of the market that i could see 
all day said bob baker an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
since feb 1 crude prices have fluctuated in the 17 trading 
range reflecting what analysts say are technical factors and 
uncertainty among traders about the future of oil prices 
analysts said prices could remain volatile in the absence of 
fresh news to give the market guidance and as investors await the 
outcome of next weeks meeting of nonopec oil producers the group 
has said it supports production cuts by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries but has not given any definitive 
indication that it plans to reduce its own production to help 
stabilize world oil prices 
the group met last month without producing an agreement to cut 
output

rate policy 
gold prices were mixed the republic national bank of new york 
quoted a gold bid of 38440 a troy ounce at 4 pm est down from 
38520 an ounce late monday 
dealers dumped dollars in favor of west german marks reasoning 
that evidence of rising inflation in that country might induce the 
government to drive interest rates higher higher west german rates 
would enhance returns on markdenominated holdings 
as trading wound down in new york the dollar was reported at 
184325 marks compared with 18677 late monday

combat inflation 
fred barth a first vice president at prudential bache securities 
inc said bushs position seemed to differ with that of the central 
bank even though the president said in the interview that he and fed 
chairman alan greenspan are not far apart at all 
some people were disturbed by president bushs comments 
barth said there may be a little friction between the white house 
and the federal reserve 
the dollar selling snowballed the currencys downward movement 
triggered additional declines as it fell to levels at which dealers 
had previously determined they would sell to avoid losses 
news of a better than expected 06 percent rise in us retail 
sales in january did not affect the markets because the previously 
reported figures for december showing a 02 percent rise were 
revised to an 01 percent decline

akzo nv a dutch chemical company tuesday became 
the first company from any nation to receive a us patent in the 
field of hightemperature superconductivity 
akzo upset a wide range of us japanese and european companies 
that have been working in the field 
superconductors carry electricity without any loss of energy and 
could some day permit tiny computers that run at unprecedented 
speeds batteries that last forever and other technological marvels 
although akzo is based in arnhem netherlands it said its 
research was done at its laboratory in dobbs ferry ny by fawzy 
a sherif 
the patent is for a process of making a superconducting powder of 
uniform characteristics that contains three metallic elements 
yttrium barium and copper akzo said 
the new superconductors retain their special conducting 
properties at much higher temperatures than earlier versions 
although they still must be kept very cold 
in spite of akzos coup other researchers may still receive 
patents that are more fundamental and farreaching than akzos for 
example international business machines corp has applied for 
patents for work done by scientists at its zurich research lab in 
switzerland that led to a major breakthrough in early 1986 
akzo received a patent last august that also related to a process 
useful for the formation of superconducting powders but the company 
said it considered the patent issued tuesday as the first us 
superconductor patent to a company 
akzos news release containing its claim was approved by the 
patent office according to marge waterstreet a spokesman at the 
chicago headquarters of akzo chemicals inc a us subsidiary 
william o craig a spokesman for the patent office said the 
federal energy department which is not a company received a patent 
last august he said it is being reexamined because of a challenge 
to its validity 
electronic business magazine reported last month that japanese 
researchers are leaders in the filing of patent applications in 
superconductivity 
of 75 patent applications made public in britain and west 
germany where the information is disclosed earlier than in the 
united states japan originated 59 and the united states 10 the 
magazine said 
the university of houston expects to receive a patent for a 
promising new superconducting material and in fact is getting 15 
million from du pont co immediately and 3 million later for rights 
to use the as yet unissued patent 
the massachusetts institute of technology said it has been told 
by the us patent and trademark office that a patent would be 
granted on a technique for manufacturing wires and other useful 
shapes from the new materials 
mit has licensed rights on that forthcoming patent to american 
superconductor corp of cambridge mass which was founded by some 
of the mit professors who invented the process

fertilizer use by us farmers is expected to 
rise 9 percent this year because of larger crop plantings and higher 
crop prices the agriculture department said tuesday 
the greater demand also will drive up fertilizer prices the 
departments economic research service said in a report by spring 
planting prices are expected to average about 7 percent more than a 
year ago 
world use of commercial fertilizers also is climbing a trend 
expected to continue at least for several more years 
by the early 1990s world growth in nitrogen demand could 
exceed supply leading to higher prices the report said the 
developed countries will likely have excess phosphate supplies 
while the soviet union asia and eastern europe will be deficit 
areas 
the greatest surplus of potash is expected to be in north 
america while western europe asia afria and latin america are 
projected to be in short supply the report said 
some other farm production items are likely to be more costly 
this spring including pesticides up 2 percent to 5 percent crop 
seeds 10 percent to 15 percent and farm energy costs 
despite the drought 1988 farm machinery expenditures rose an 
estimated 5 percent to 10 percent over 1987 the report said a 
similar increase is likely in 1989 when expenditures could reach 
64 billion to 71 billion 
last years sales of most types of machinery remained stable or 
increased except for a 16 percent drop in combine sales the report 
said barring poor weather sales of all major kinds of machinery 
are expected to increase in 1989

itt corp reported lower fourthquarter and 
fullyear earnings for 1988 on tuesday blaming the results on 
onetime charges and reduced tax benefits 
profit for the quarter totaled 180 million or 126 per share 
compared with a restated profit of 421 million or 284 a share 
for the fourth quarter of 1987 
revenue for 1988s fourth quarter totaled 52 billion a 75 
percent increase over the restated 48 billion in the same period a

increase over the restated 182 billion for 1987 
both the 1988 and 1987 fullyear and fourthquarter periods 
include nonrecurring items that distort the performance picture of 
the company during 1988 said rand v araskog itts chairman and 
chief executive officer 
the 1988 results were reduced by a 41 million aftertax 
provision for discontinued operations in the fourth quarter 
primarily for several environmental cleanup operations at the 
companys southern wood piedmont subsidiary itt said 
profit for 1988 included tax benefits at the hartford itts 
insurance company of 52 million compared with 1005 million from 
the same fresh start tax benefit in 1987 the company said 
the 1987 figures were restated due to a change in accouting rules 
that lowered revenues from itts insurance and finance operations 
the company said all of our business segments with the exception 
of our electronic components operation posted higher operating 
income in 1988 araskog said 
itt is involved in the manufacture and sale of automotive 
components fluid technology defense technology and wood products

a federal judges decision allowing pacific 
telesis group to invest in japans growing longdistance market is 
an important step for the company and the us telecommunications 
industry company officials said tuesday 
this is going to position us and is positioning the company 
as a telecommunications player in japan said jan neels president 
and chief executive of pacific telesis international pactels 
international subsidiary 
on monday us district judge harold h greene in washington 
dc allowed pactel to buy about 85 percent of a japanese 
consortium that will own and operate the western end of a 
fiberoptic cable between the united states and japan 
greenes decision makes pactel the first american regional phone 
company to enter the 1 billion japanese longdistance market and 
the first to provide longdistance service between the us and a 
foreign country said pactel spokeswoman susan rosenberg 
its a very important decision specifically for us and 
i think it will encourage other companies to focus on the japanese 
market and follow our example neels said 
the consortium international digital co inc plans to start 
providing longdistance service using satellite connections and 
other cables in may the new cable which will run from honshu in 
japan to pacific city ore should be ready in late 1990 neels 
said 
our target is to finally get around 15 percent of the market 
share in the initial five or sixyear period neels said it was 
too soon to tell how large a share the consortium might have 
afterward said neels who declined to say how the project could 
affect pactels earnings 
one analyst however believed the companys entry into the 
japanese market growing at about 20 percent a year would have 
little effect on profits 
its a nonevent as far as their earnings will go given the 
size of the company said edward m greenberg an analyst with 
morgan stanley amp co inc in new york 
american companies supported by us trade policy 
representatives have aggressively sought entrance into japans 
telecommunications industry for the past decade 
major shareholders in the consortium which received the japanese 
governments permission in late 1987 include cable amp wireless co 
of britain toyota motor corp and c itoh and co of japan 
pacific telecom cable which has no association with pactel will 
own the eastern end of the cable estimated to cost between 300 
million and 350 million 
pactel needed judicial approval before it could join the 
consortium because the splitup of atampt in 1984 barred regional 
phone companies from entering the longdistance telephone business 
pactels pacific bell the leading provider of phone service in 
california is one of the seven socalled baby bells 
atampt and mci communications corp both objected to pactels 
entering the japanese market arguing the venture would constitute 
an antitrust abuse of its monopoly status as a local telephone 
utility 
but greene who said he based his ruling on commercial and trade 
policy implications dismissed their objections 
the investment serves positive american purposes greene 
wrote without pactels participation the united states could 
also lose a longterm opportunity to influence policies that could 
open more japanese markets the judge said 
greene however refused a separate request by nynex corp 
another of the regional phone companies to take a 50 percent stake 
in a transatlantic fiberoptic cable with britains cable amp 
wireless co

million and 10 million directly with him rather than with the 
firm using the promise of huge returns as an incentive 
we have initiated an investigation and its ongoing said fbi 
spokesman jack cloherty i really can add no more than that at 
this time 
marty meehan of the state securities division said dean witter 
which monday notified officials the broker was missing may have 
violated a state regulation requiring that brokerage houses 
immediately disclose information about possible theft 
but dean witter spokesman james m flynn said the brokerage house 
had complied to the letter of the law with state regulations and 
would continue to cooperate with authorities 
meehan said state officials were reviewing dean witters internal 
reports and interviewing officials but that neither formal charges 
nor an arrest warrant had been issued against curran 
in the weeks leading up to his disappearance curran reportedly 
stopped making payments on 475000 in personal loans from the bank 
of boston and apparently made a series of suspicious deposits and 
withdrawls to his account

days its 26 billion cash offer for rival natural gas company texas 
eastern corp after the original offer passed its deadline 
the 42pershare offer for the estimated 53 million shares of 
outstanding stock will be extended through feb 23 coastal 
spokesman robert wells said coastal officials decided on the 
extension late monday as the first offers midnight deadline neared 
calling it inadequate texas easterns board of directors 
rejected coastals offer last month 
coastals offer when announced jan 16 was 40 percent more than 
the 3025 texas eastern stock was bringing at the time since then 
texas eastern stock has soared past 42 
but wells said nothing has happened to lead us to increase 
our offer and there is not another offer on the table 
wells said about 25 million shares have been tendered since jan 
17 although they are not in coastals possession coastal already 
owned about 25 million shares 
coastal also has been trying through litigation to prevent texas 
eastern directors from implementing antitakeover measures

general motors corp said tuesday its fourth 
quarter profit soared by 675 percent from a year earlier and the 
nations biggest automaker posted record earnings for all of 1988 
gms earnings mean the company will issue 114 million in 
profitsharing checks to some 470000 hourly employees the first 
such payments since fiscal 1985 
in the three months ended dec 31 gm had net income of 14 
billion or 425 a share up from 8358 million or 236 a share 
in the same period of in 1987 revenue during the quarter rose to 
324 billion from 297 billion a year earlier 
for the full year gms earnings rose 369 percent to 486 
billion or 1434 a share from 355 billion or 1006 a share 
in 1987 annual revenue rose to 1236 billion from 1149 billion a 
year earlier 
the pershare earnings do not reflect a 2for1 stock split gm 
announced last week payable march 31 for shareholders of record feb 
17 
the 1988 results include revenue and profits for the companys 
electronic data systems gm hughes electronics and general motors 
acceptance corp subsidiaries which reported their results 
separately on monday 
the 1988 figures for gm included a one time gain of 2242 
million from a firstquarter accounting change 
gms previous record annual profit was 45 billion in 1984 
the annual profits announced so far by gm and chrysler corp 
combined with the ninemonth results from ford motor co which was 
expected to announce its annual earnings on thursday totaled about 
1005 billion for 1988 the previous annual record for the big 
three was 979 billion in 1984 
in the big picture its quite a bit better than it was in 
87 said auto analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc 
of new york however he said the figures showed stiff competition 
in the marketplace and the costs of sales incentives may affect 
future profits 
gm chairman roger smith and president robert stempel said the 
corporations overall earnings were higher because of solid vehicle 
sales overseas and a resurgence of north american operations 
the company said it was issuing profitsharing checks to about 
470000 employees with the typical check amounting to about 254 
per eligible employee 
gm did not issue profitsharing checks for the past two years 
because of slumping north american performance profit sharing for 
workers represented by the united auto workers union is tied to the 
companys us revenue 
healy and another analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co 
said gm earned about 500 million in north america during 1988 
following a year in which those operations pretty much broke even 
while brady was upbeat about the north american performance 
healy said if they earned 5 billion and only 500 million was on 
the north american side its still disproportionate with overseas 
and gmac 
gms operations overseas last year earned 27 billion compared 
with the 19 billion they earned outside north america during 1987 
although still below desired levels of profitability gms 
north american operations achieved substantial profit improvement 
and made significant progress in terms of both product 
competitiveness and improved operating efficiency they said 
part of the increase in earnings analysts said was due to gms 
costcutting program especially in north america 
gm said it cut 48 billion in costs last year bringing its 
total cost savings to 85 billion since its expensereduction 
program began two years ago

government prosecutors questioned dozens of 
stock brokerage officers and employees tuesday in a probe into a 
multimillion dollar illegal trading scandal an attorney generals 
office source said 
four top officers from mexicos two biggest brokerage firms were 
arrested monday on fraud charges the source speaking on condition 
of anonymity said up to 150 more arrests may follow 
the investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200 
investors against all but one of mexicos 24 registered brokerage 
firms after stockholders lost about 7 million in the october 1987 
crash 
the alleged violations ranged from insider trading in both stocks 
and foreign currencies to the sale of nonexistent treasury 
certificates and trading in securities without the consent of their 
clients 
alfredo harp helu president of the mexican stock exchange said 
the national securities commission had determined that the brokers 
and employees only could be given administrative sanctions because 
not one case of the activities under investigation can be 
considered criminal 
harp helu said he did not know the identities of the brokers 
under investigation or what charges they could face 
roberto hoyo daddona the treasurys general prosecutor told 
reporters monday the department began receiving complaints of fraud 
after the stock market index plunged 74 percent in 28 trading days 
he said treasury agents also are investigating possible tax 
evasion 
spokesmen for both the attorney generals office and the treasury 
department which is responsible for enforcing securities trading 
and tax laws declined to comment on tuesdays interviews 
among those arrested were eduardo legorreta board chairman and 
one of the founders of operadora de bolsa one of the mexicos two 
leading trading firms and jaime ceballos cervantes the companys 
director of investment promotions 
legorreta 44 is a member of one of mexicos wealthiest 
families his arrest at a mexico city restaurant monday night shook 
the countrys business community 
also arrested were juan carlos fernandez cuevo and jose francisco 
rodriguez dupont of mexicana de valores e inversiones the other 
major brokerage firm 
gustavo diaz president of an association formed by the wronged 
investors has estimated the brokerage firms netted 435 million in 
profits from the alleged illegal dealing 
market prices started dropping at the close of business on the 
stock exchange monday before the arrests amid rumors of impending 
action by the government the 52stock price index dropped by a 
little less than 1 percent as sales increased 
tuesday opened with another spurt of sales but at the close of 
business the market recovered and the 52stock price index was 
slightly up by 40 points to 211841 
the mexican securities and exchange commission announced it was 
implanting a series of regulations effective immediately to 
prevent future fraud

mattel inc said tuesday that two years 
of belttightening and refocusing on such triedandtrue toys as 
barbie dolls and hot wheels toy cars paid off in a modest 1988 
profit of 359 million 
that is far less than the 80 million mattel earned in 1985 but 
a vast improvement from losses of 83 million in 1986 and 1132 
million in 1987 
the 359 million profit reported tuesday amounts to 75 cents a 
share sales in 1988 were 990 million compared with 1 billion in 
1987 
in 1988s fourth quarter mattel earned 105 million or 22 
cents a share compared with a 1007 million loss in the fourth 
quarter of 1987 sales in the quarter were 2876 million up from 
2338 million a year earlier 
our plan to return the company to solid profitability is on 
course john amerman chairman and chief executive said in a 
statement 
in addition to barbie and hot wheels the company said it enjoyed 
retail success with the little miss makeup doll and a line of 
disneythemed toys for toddlers and preschoolers 
the 1987 loss was blamed on a restructuring program that included 
laying off 500 employees at mattels headquarters closing several 
plants overseas and doing away with marginal toy lines 
the 1986 loss was blamed in large part on slumping sales of the 
oncepopular masters of the universe toys

the long island lighting co and representatives 
of its nearly 1 million ratepayers signed an agreement tuesday to 
settle a racketeering lawsuit against the utility 
the agreement calls for a reduction of 390 million in planned 
rate increases over 10 years beginning in june 1990 it also 
establishes a 10 million fund for claims by former lilco ratepayers 
and requires the utility to pick up the ratepayers legal costs 
the agreement does not address the closing of lilcos shoreham 
nuclear power plant however judith vladeck who represents the 
ratepayers said she agreed to the settlement based on my 
understanding that shoreham will shortly be closed and thereafter 
dismantled 
joseph mcdonnell a vice president for communications at lilco 
hailed the agreement saying it will return the company to 
financial health 
however mcdonnell criticized a resolution unanimously adopted 
tuesday by suffolk county legislators as a condition for a county 
agreement with lilco the resolution said lilco must irrevocably 
withdraw its request for an operating license for shoreham and 
close and dismantle the plant 
construction of the shoreham plant located 60 miles east of 
manhattan began in 1973 and has cost 54 billion but has not 
resulted in generation of any power because of state and county 
concerns about how long island could be safely evacuated during a 
nuclear emergency 
mcdonnell said the utility was interested in negotiating with 
suffolk but the legislators resolution was unreasonable 
the agreement came one day after us district judge jack b 
weinstein who last week dismissed the racketeering suit filed by 
suffolk county granted the ratepayers the right to sue the utility 
as a class 
weinstein said his rulings meant that should his dismissal be 
overturned on appeal lilco would be liable to pay the ratepayers at 
least 4 billion in damages and will be forced into bankruptcy 
since its assets will not suffice to pay the judgment 
the county in negotiating with lilco over whether to appeal 
weinsteins ruling hoped to use the threat of a bankrupting damage 
award to force lilco to agree to close the shoreham plant 
gov mario cuomo speaking in albany prior to the settlement 
predicted a ratepayers agreement would put pressure on suffolk 
officials to cut a similar deal 
they could appeal but for what asked cuomo a shoreham 
opponent who labeled the nuclear power plant the most confusing 
situation ive had to deal with as governor 
the agreement with the ratepayers also includes a promise by 
lilco to establish a citizens advisory panel which would include 
representatives of consumers and businesses to improve service and 
lower electric rates 
the agreement will be subject to two fairness hearings next month 
so consumers can comment on the plan which still needs approval 
from the lilco board of directors and shareholders
